https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848715,"Taiwan denies its sending 1,000 suicide drones to help Ukraine retake Crimea","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday (March 28) denied claims that Taiwan is sending 1,000 suicide drones to help Ukraine with a future counteroffensive to recapture Crimea.On Monday (March 27), international relations researcher and Twitter user ""PStyleOne1,"" alleged that ""Taiwan has provided Ukraine with almost 1,000 drones that have the function of a swarm and are able to interact with each other in automatic mode."" He added that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine purportedly plans to use these drones for a counterattack on Crimea.In a comment under the tweet, he pointed out that he prefaced the original post with the acronym RUMINT, which he described as ""Rumor intelligence"" and emphasized that this is not verified. He said the information had been spreading on Russian and Ukrainian channels and justified uploading the post because ""I have reasons to believe Taiwan has provided something,"" but that he did not know what it was.The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST, 中科院) on March 14 unveiled a new domestically-developed kamikaze drone similar to the U.S. Switchblade. The new drone can be carried in a backpack, is launched from a tube, and can reach a target about 10 kilometers away.Newtalk on Monday reported that some Taiwanese netizens have speculated that gifting these suicide drones to Ukraine would enable Taiwan's military to conduct a ""live demonstration"" of its new military drones. This would allegedly deter China by demonstrating the performance of the drones in Eastern Europe without directly provoking Beijing in the Taiwan Strait.However, MOFA on Tuesday issued a press release in which it stressed that the information provided in the tweet was not true. The ministry said it will promptly collect the relevant screenshots and false news reports and present them to the police.The ministry urged the public not to trust information from unknown sources on the internet and to not spread false information or rumors to avoid violating the law. In addition, MOFA pointed out that the Twitter account claimed in the comments section that the ""so-called information that Taiwan is providing thousands of drones is RUMINT,"" which is unverified information and is ""purely based on the judgment of a personal tweet.""It called on media outlets to fulfill their responsibilities of verification before making such reports in order to avoid misleading the public and causing ""unnecessary trouble.""New Taiwan-made suicide drone.

Investors With Losses to Secure Counsel Before Important Deadline in Securities Class Action - KRNT","New York, US - Newsfile Corp. - March 27, 2023 -  WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of Kornit Digital Ltd., (NASDAQ: KRNT) between February 17, 2021 and July 5, 2022, both dates inclusive (the ""Class Period""), of the important  April 17, 2023 lead plaintiff deadline.    SO WHAT: If you purchased Kornit securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.   WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Kornit class action, go to  https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=12250 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email  pkim@rosenlegal.com or  cases@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court  no later than April 17, 2023. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.   WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition.  Many of these firms do not actually handle securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.   DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Kornit and its senior executives knew or, at a minimum, recklessly disregarded, that the Company's digital printing business was beset by significant quality control problems and deficient customer service; (2) as a result, Kornit was more vulnerable to pressure from competitors than it had represented and lacked the competitive advantages it touted to investors; (3) as a result, problems and deficiencies caused Kornit to lose market share to competitors, which led to a decline in the Company's revenues, as Kornit's dissatisfied customers sought out alternative options for their digital printing needs; and (4) to the extent that the Company purported to warn of risks regarding quality and customer service issues as well as increased competition, Kornit failed to disclose that such risks had already materialized. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848725,Indonesia's stance on Israel overshadows world soccer event,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia could lose its chance to host a global youth soccer tournament, and its chance to qualify for the 2026 World Cup, after refusing to welcome a team from Israel.FIFA canceled an important preparatory step after regional governors and protesters demanded Israel's team be excluded, and the tournament, planned for May 20-June 11, appears to be on hold.The official draw for group assignments in the Under-20 World Cup, was supposed to take place in Bali Friday, but FIFA canceled the event after the island's governor, Wayan Koster, called for a ban on the Israeli team playing there.The Israeli team, which will participate in the Under-20 world tournament for the first time, had been expected to be based in Bali, home to one of the six stadiums scheduled to be used for the tournament.The Israel-Palestinian conflict is an emotional issue in the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, whose 277 million people broadly support the Palestinian cause both for religious reasons and an anti-colonial tradition that dates back to the country's independence. With a presidential election coming up next year, the governing Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, widely known as PDIP, is wary of controversy.In March 2022, an Israeli delegation attended the Interparliamentary Union in Bali, a majority Hindu province.FIFA, soccer's world governing body, has not commented on the situation or a reported offer from Argentina to stage the event. If local authorities fail to resolve the hosting issues over Israel, Indonesia risks being suspended by FIFA and could miss the Asian qualifying rounds for the 2026 World Cup, which will begin this October. Indonesia has not made it to the World Cup since 1934, when it competed as a Dutch colony.President Joko Widodo said Tuesday evening that his administration is trying to save the tournament. He said Indonesia had objected to Israel's participation and told citizens that the country had agreed to host before knowing Israel would qualify, but added that people should not mix “political affairs and sports affairs"" and that he had sent the head of Indonesia’s national soccer association PSSI to Doha, Qatar, to meet with FIFA. He was originally reported as going to Zurich.PSSI chair Erick Thohir has been Indonesia’s minister of state-owned enterprises since 2019. He took over as leader of the PSSI after a government investigation concluded that the national soccer association had ignored safety and security regulations ahead of a stadium crush that killed 135 people last October. He’s also a former owner of major international teams, including Italian soccer giant Inter Milan and the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers.“Continue to be passionate about finding solutions to every challenge, for the sake of an increasingly global Indonesia,"" Thohir wrote in a Twitter post.Indonesia’s Coordinating Minister for Human Development and Culture, Muhadjir Effendy, said Monday that Indonesia had proposed conditions about the presence of Israel during the tournament to FIFA, but said there was no common ground. He did not elaborate on the conditions.“This is not merely a rejection or protest, but this is related to our country’s Constitution,” he said in response to questions about the leaders of two provinces selected as tournament venues pushing back against hosting the Israeli team.The preamble of Indonesia’s 1945 Constitution states: “Whereas Independence is the inalienable right of all nations; therefore, colonialism must be abolished in the world as it is not in conformity with humanity and justice.”Central Java Gov. Ganjar Pranowo, a PDIP member who is also the frontrunner for the 2024 presidential election, joined calls for the Israeli team to be denied a place in the tournament on March 23. The secular party said its position was based on that of Indonesia’s first president, Sukarno, whose daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri is chair of the party.“We know Bung Karno’s commitment to Palestine, whether in the Asia-Africa Conference, the Non-Aligned Movement or the Conference of the New Emerging Forces,” he said last week, referring to Sukarno’s popular nickname. “So, we follow his mandate.”Indonesia's opposition to Israel has disrupted international sports for both countries in the past. Indonesia one was of three Muslim-majority countries that dropped out of qualifiers for the 1958 World Cup rather than play against Israel, allowing Israel to win the Africa and Asia group qualifying rounds without setting foot on the field. In 1962, Israel was forced to withdraw from the Asian Games after Indonesia, as host, refused to issue visas to Israeli participants.The participation of an Israel team has some support in Indonesia.“The rejection of the Israeli national team by some people in Indonesia, including a number of regional heads and politicians is regrettable,” said Hikmahanto Juwana, a professor of international law at the University of Indonesia, “As long as Indonesia has declared itself willing to be the host, Indonesia must take the risk not to reject any members from international event organizers.”The Palestinian Ambassador to Indonesia has said he has no objections to the Israeli national team playing in the tournament.Noted local soccer commentator Tommy Welly said local organizers should comply with FIFA regulations.“There is a principle of neutrality and non-discrimination stated very clearly in both statutes of FIFA and PSSI as its member federations,"" Welly said. ""So, Indonesia’s position must be able to adhere to those principles. Don’t mix or make friction between sport and politics.”Israel qualified last June by reaching the semifinals of the Under-19 European Championship. The team went on to lose the final to England.The Israeli football federation has competed in European soccer leagues since 1974, when it left the Asian Football Confederation because of boycotts from some national teams.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848726,House GOP to subpoena Blinken over Afghanistan dissent cable,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans plan to deliver a subpoena to Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday for classified cables related to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, marking an unprecedented effort to force the release of sensitive documents to Congress.Rep. Mike McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The Associated Press on Monday that he had spoken with Blinken earlier in the day when he was notified the agency would not be turning over a so-called dissent cable written by diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul shortly before the August 2021 withdrawal.“We have made multiple good faith attempts to find common ground so we could see this critical piece of information,” McCaul, R-Texas, said in a statement. “Unfortunately, Secretary Blinken has refused to provide the Dissent Cable and his response to the cable, forcing me to issue my first subpoena as chairman of this committee.”The July 2021 communication warned Blinken about the potential fall of Kabul via a special “dissent channel,"" which allows State Department officials to issue warnings or express contrarian views directly to senior agency officials, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.The State Department made a direct offer last week — before McCaul made his subpoena threat about the dissent cable in particular — to share the substance of the cable via a briefing, according to a March 22 letter obtained by the AP.""The Department is prepared to discuss a path that would communicate to you the circumstances and substance of the requested cable exchange, as an extraordinary accommodation,"" the letter read. ""The Department trusts that this accommodation will address the Committee’s request for information while preserving the confidential nature of the Dissent Channel.”The effort to force the release of the cable is the latest in a series by McCaul and other House Republicans to hold the Biden administration accountable for what they have called a “stunning failure of leadership"" after Taliban forces seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, far more rapidly than U.S. intelligence had foreseen as American forces pulled out.Kabul’s fall turned the West’s withdrawal into a rout, with Kabul’s airport the center of a desperate air evacuation guarded by U.S. forces temporarily deployed for the task. A single explosive device that day killed at least 170 Afghan civilians and 13 American service members.McCaul made the Afghanistan-related document requests in January, upon becoming chairman of the committee, but has said he faced pushback from the department as he pursued his investigation into the withdrawal.State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel told reporters Monday that while he recognizes “the importance and the keen interest in this cable,” it would be a rare move for any secretary to turn over those documents to Congress.“It is a unique way for anyone in the department to speak truth to power as they see it without fear or favor. And they do it by the regulations we have established for these cables in a privileged and confidential way,” Patel said. “It’s vital to us that we preserve the integrity of that process and of that channel.”Since the Dissent Channel was created in 1971, in part to address U.S. diplomats’ concerns over the Vietnam War, the State Department has held communications closely. Nearly all such cables are classified to protect the integrity of the process and the identities of dissenting Foreign Service officers. They are not generally intended for public consumption, however, some have been leaked to the press, often by their authors.According to the National Security Archives at George Washington University, at least 123 Dissent Channel cables have been sent since 1971. The vast majority of those have remained classified and the State Department has long objected to efforts to force their release.The basic contents of some Dissent Channel cables have become public, including in the Afghanistan withdrawal case. One of its authors was given an award for “Constructive Dissent” in 2022 by the union that represents U.S. diplomats.___AP Diplomatic Writer Matt Lee contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848727,Va Tech women headed to 1st Final Four after topping Ohio St,"SEATTLE (AP) — Virginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks stood at the stop of the ladder about to trim the final strands from the net when the familiar thumping beat started blaring through the speakers of the arena.The Hokies’ first Final Four berth deserved a little Metallica and a little “Enter Sandman.”Elizabeth Kitley scored 25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, Georgia Amoore added 24 points and top-seeded Virginia Tech advanced to the Final Four with an 84-74 win over No. 3 seed Ohio State in the Seattle 3 Regional final on Monday night.For the seventh time in the past 10 Final Fours there will be a first-time participant and it’s the champions of the ACC, adding another accomplishment to the best season in school history.Playing in its first regional final, Virginia Tech (31-4) won its 15th straight game and will head to the Final Four having not lost in more than two months. The Hokies will face LSU in the national semifinals on Friday in Dallas.“We're not just going to the Final Four. We're in the Final Four. That's something that means the world to me,” Brooks said.Kitley, the Hokies 6-foot-6 center and leading scorer this season, took over on the interior in the second half. She scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter and her three-point play gave Virginia Tech a 70-60 lead.Amoore hit her fourth 3-pointer of the game to push the lead to 13. Ohio State pulled within six in the final minute, but the Hokies were nearly perfect at the foul line down the stretch.After the final buzzer sounded, “Enter Sandman” blasted throughout Climate Pledge Arena for the first time, setting off an even louder party for the Hokies fans in attendance.And it played again as Brooks stood on the ladder above the celebration.“I don't know if you envision it more than you dream it. Obviously this is not easy and one day I will sit back and realize how hard it was for us to get here and realize we are one of four teams standing,” Brooks said.Amoore shook off the scare of a potential injury in the first half to scored 16 points in the second half. She had a career-high 29 in the regional semifinal win over Tennessee. Cayla King added 12 points, all in the first half for the Hokies.“This group, we all come from different places, but this year we came together because we all wanted the same thing,” Kitley said. “It's so nice to be at this spot but we know that we don't want to be done either yet because we have so much fun playing together.”Taylor Mikesell led Ohio State (28-8) with 25 points, but 19 of those came in the first half. Mikesell didn’t score the first 16 minutes of the second half before hitting a 3-pointer with 3:35 remaining.Jacy Sheldon scored 19 and Big Ten freshman of the year Cotie McMahon added 18. But the pressure defense that Ohio State used to befuddle UConn into 25 turnovers in the regional semifinal was easily handled by Amoore and the Hokies in the opening minutes and mostly abandoned by the Buckeyes.“I felt we were a little tired coming into it. We put so much energy into Saturday’s game and we didn’t quite have the same energy in the press,” Ohio State coach Kevin McGuff said. “And when you don’t have it, it’s tough because you can really get but up on the back end and give up easy baskets.”Ohio State was looking to join its Big Ten Conference partner Iowa in reaching the Final Four for the first time in 30 years. The Buckeyes stayed with Virginia Tech shot-for-shot through a highly entertaining and high scoring first half.But the shots that dropped in the first 20 minutes stopped falling in the second half. Ohio State shot 64% in the first half, including five 3-pointer from Mikesell, but that dropped to just 28% in the second half.“We got the stops we wanted. We didn’t make the most of them on offense,” Sheldon said. “We didn’t execute the way we wanted to. So props to them. They played a great game.”RARE COMPANYBrooks is the third Black male coach to take a team to the women's Final Four and second since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1994. Winthrop McGriff with Cheyney in 1984 and Quentin Hillsman with Syracuse in 2016 were the others. Brooks is in his seventh season in Blacksburg.“I do know that when I was trying to make a name for myself, there wasn’t very many people that were doing it or advocating for people that looked like me. In this profession, I think that we belong. I think that there’s a place for Black males to come in and be a positive influence,” Brooks said before the Sweet 16.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848728,"Booker, bench lead Suns past skidding Jazz as Ayton returns","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Devin Booker scored 24 points and Phoenix reserves sparked the decisive run for the Suns in a 117-103 win over the fading Utah Jazz on Monday night.“Our bench came in and changed the dynamic of the game from a physicality standpoint, getting stops. That allowed us to get out in transition,” Phoenix coach Monty Williams said.Deandre Ayton had 14 points after missing four games with a bruised hip. But a trio off the bench was pivotal for Phoenix: Terrence Ross had 13 points, Cameron Payne added 12 and Bismack Biyombo scored 11. They helped the Suns to a 57-25 advantage in bench points.“The bench is starting to come together. We are getting a better rhythm and groove, and when we come into the game we’re bringing a different level of energy,” Ross said.The Suns (40-35) had lost four in a row on the road. But with this victory they sit more securely in the fourth spot in the Western Conference playoff race — which would give them home-court advantage in the first round.Lauri Markkanen scored 25 points for Utah but shot 6 of 22.“Rough shooting night. I thought I was getting good looks. Didn’t fall tonight,” Markkanen said.Walker Kessler had 18 points and eight rebounds for the Jazz (35-40), who have lost four straight. Kessler also matched a career high with seven blocks.“We could not throw the ball in the ocean for long stretches of time,” Utah coach Will Hardy said. “That can wear on you as a team.”To get injured star Kevin Durant in a midseason trade, the Suns sacrificed some of their depth and have struggled at times — especially on defense — when their starters sit. But this game was different against the undermanned Jazz.“If we’re going to get to where we want, it’s going to be different people every night,” star guard Chris Paul said. “We need that confidence going into the playoffs.”Phoenix went on a 17-2 run bridging the third and fourth quarters, primarily with its backups on the court. The Jazz led 81-78 before Payne and Ross combined for 11 points, and Payne capped the surge with a driving layup with 8:59 remaining to make it 95-83.“When we are getting stops and pushing the pace, it is really hard to guard us. We just didn’t want to let them get their defense set,” Payne said.By the time Booker, Ayton and Paul returned with 4:58 to play, Phoenix still had a double-digit lead and coasted home.“It’s big for our confidence when we leave a game and it’s near even and then (the reserves) go up 10-15 points while we’re out,” Booker said. “It’s nice.”ON THE MENDWilliams said Durant, who has missed 10 games with a sprained ankle, might be ready to return on Wednesday — but it’s up to the training staff.“He has been working his tail off. He’s done everything possible to get himself back as close as he can to game shape,” said Williams, who added it all depends on Durant’s evaluation when the team gets back to Phoenix.TIP-INSSuns: Made 20 of 22 free throws. … Booker scored 18 points in the first quarter and then went 0 for 5 with no points in the second. ... Phoenix had a 57-52 lead at halftime after outscoring the Jazz 13-0 in points off turnovers.Jazz: Talen Horton-Tucker had 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists along a with a bevy of forced shots and turnovers. … Simone Fontecchio, who has started the last three games, was out with a sore toe. … Jordan Clarkson (thumb) and Collin Sexton (hamstring), two of Utah’s top three scorers, have missed the past 10 games.UP NEXTSuns: Host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday.Jazz: At the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848730,"Embiid sits out, Jokic leads Nuggets past 76ers 116-111","DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic posted his 29th triple-double of the season Monday night and the Denver Nuggets beat the shorthanded Philadelphia 76ers 116-111 in a game Joel Embiid sat out with a sore right calf.That scuttled the highly anticipated showdown between MVP frontrunners that many felt could have decided whether Embiid, the runner-up the last two years, denies Jokic a third consecutive award.With Embiid in the locker room, Jokic scored 25 points, pulled down 17 rebounds and dished out 12 assists.While insisting Embiid's absence had no effect on his own approach to the game, Jokic praised his counterpart as a dominant force on both ends of the court.“The guy's a beast,"" Jokic said. “He can affect the game in so many ways on the floor.”The MVP clash wasn't the race that was on Doc Rivers' mind.“It was not a hard decision for us,"" the 76ers coach said of holding out Embiid, who complained of discomfort at the team's morning shootaround after playing both ends of a back-to-back on the road over the weekend.Rivers said he didn't know if Embiid's injury would linger, but noted that calf injuries are notoriously slow to heal and can lead to more serious leg injuries.""Everybody wants to see these two guys play against each other,” Rivers said, but “we’re just going to take it slow and be smart. We want to get him and the whole team healthy for the playoffs.”Embiid, the NBA scoring leader, first experienced tightness in his right calf against Chicago last week and Rivers held him out of the second half of that game. Embiid returned to the lineup and scored 46 points at Golden State and 28 in Phoenix, seemingly putting the issue behind him.The Sixers, who also were without James Harden (Achilles) for a fourth consecutive game, matched their season high with their third consecutive loss.Tyrese Maxey scored 23 of his 29 points in the first half, helping keep the 76ers close. They trailed 61-57 at halftime and fell behind by 22 before a late push brought them to 114-111 on Montrezl Harrell's dunk with 29 seconds remaining.Jeff Green sank two free throws with 13.3 seconds left and Harrell misfired on an open 3-pointer in the closing seconds.“We can't have that"" kind of letdown “especially against a team with their two superstars out,” Nuggets sixth man Bruce Brown said. ”This should have been a 20-point win. We just took our foot off the gas.”“As long as we win,” Jokic said, “that's the most important thing.”Maxey said the 76ers are looking at the bright side: they're burnishing their bench for the playoffs.“The first half we were in the game big time and in the end, but one thing I think we can take from this is how deep we are,” Maxey said. “Guys like (Danuel) House, who hasn’t played in a couple of games because he was hurt, comes in and contributes. The list goes on and on.”Embiid bolstered his MVP credentials in January when he scored 47 points and pulled down 18 rebounds in leading Philadelphia past the Nuggets 126-119.ESPN analyist Kendrick Perkins, a former NBA center who sparked an MVP debate earlier this month by calling Jokic a stat padder, said Embiid owed it to Jokic and basketball fans alike to play in the rematch Monday night.“Joel Embiid is ducking that smoke today and you all know how I feel about Joel Embiid,” Perkins said. ""We know how much it means to him to win this award. And here it is. You gave Jokic a spanking when they were down there in Philly. You have to give him an opportunity to get his lick back.“You cannot sit out this game,” Perkins added. ""I have a vote (for the MVP award) and I'm going to remember this moment.”TIP-INS76ers: Philadelphia has lost four of five for the first time all season. ... Embiid has missed 14 games this season. He hasn't played in Denver since November 2019.Nuggets: Jokic has five triple-doubles this month and 111 for his career, including the playoffs.UP NEXT76ers: Host the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.Nuggets: Host the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday night.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848744,Young Malaysian small business owners drive up tech focus,"Malaysian small businesses are more confident in their business and the economy         Young small business owners are driving a greater focus on technology and innovation         The increasing attention on innovation and technology will support long term growth     KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 - Malaysian small businesses are upbeat about their business and the economy. Meanwhile, young business owners are driving an increasing focus on technology and innovation by local small businesses. These are some of the findings from a new regional survey by one of the world's largest professional accounting associations.            CPA Australia's latest  Asia-Pacific Small Business Survey shows 72.2 per cent of Malaysian small businesses expect to grow in 2023, compared to 54.6 per cent that grew last year.   This trend is being driven by an improving economy and more small businesses grasping the benefits of digital technology including e-commerce, supported by new digital payment opportunities.   ""An increasing focus on e-commerce will position many Malaysian small businesses for future growth,"" Malaysia Division President Surin Segar FCPA (Aust.) said.   The survey found 63.9 per cent earned more than 10 per cent of their revenue from online sales in 2022. Consistent with this, almost three-quarters (72.9 per cent) received more than 10 per cent of their sales through digital payment technologies such as GrabPay.   Small businesses are achieving strong returns from technology spending, with 53 per cent reporting this investment in 2022 improved their profitability. The financial gains available are helping drive the adoption of new technology.   ""Nearly all Malaysian small businesses use social media. Businesses were more likely to invest in mobile phone applications than any other technology.""   Over a third (34.1 per cent) said they will introduce a new product, process or service to Malaysia or the world in 2023, up from 25.3 per cent last year.   ""Small businesses are ready to innovate in 2023. This innovative culture should support long-term growth and improve the competitiveness of Malaysia's small business sector.   ""The appetite to innovate is hugely encouraging. The high percentage of Malaysians under 40 running small businesses is a contributing factor.""   Younger business owners surveyed were more likely to run businesses that are growing, creating jobs, innovating, using emerging technologies and exporting.   ""To harness the entrepreneurial spirit of Malaysia's many young small business owners, we want to see policymakers incentivise them to access professional advice.   ""The increased use of technology raises cyber risks all businesses need to be aware of. Almost half (48 per cent) of small businesses reviewed their cybersecurity in the last six months. While this result was up from 2021, we want to see that figure climb higher.""   CPA Australia's  Malaysia market summary     Hashtag: #CPAAustralia

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848766,Russia says it test-fired anti-ship missiles in Sea of Japan,"MOSCOW (AP) — Moscow test-fired anti-ship missiles in the Sea of Japan, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, with two boats launching a simulated missile attack on a mock enemy warship about 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.The ministry said the target was successfully hit by two Moskit cruise missiles.The Moskit, whose NATO reporting name is the SS-N-22 Sunburn, is a supersonic anti-ship cruise missile that has conventional and nuclear warhead capacity. The Soviet-built cruise missile is capable of flying at a speed three times the speed of sound and has a range of up to 250 kilometers (155 miles).The ministry said the exercise, which included other warships and naval aircraft, took place in the Peter the Great Gulf in the Sea of Japan but did not give more precise coordinates. The gulf borders the Russian Pacific Fleet headquarters at Fokino and is about 700 kilometers (430 miles) from Japan's northern Hokkaido island.The Russian military has conducted regular drills across the country and Russian warships have continued maneuvers as the fighting in Ukraine has entered a second year — exercises that were intended to train the troops and showcase the country's military capability.The U.S. Navy’s 7th Fleet did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Japan reacted calmly to the missile exercise, which was conducted near Vladivostok, rather than directly into the waters between the two countries.Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told a news conference later Tuesday that Tokyo will continue to monitor Russia’s military operations, as it has been stepping up activity in the region.Tokyo does not plan to lodge a protest to Russia over the missile exercise, said Tasuku Matsuki, Japanese Foreign Ministry official in charge of Russia, noting that its location — Peter the Great Bay — is considered Russian coast, though it is facing the water between the two countries.“On the whole, Japan is concerned about Russia’s increasing military activities around the Japanese coasts and watching them with great interest,” Matsuki said.He added that Russia has conducted missile drills in that area in the past and issued maritime advisories ahead of time.Russian nuclear-capable Tu-95 bombers flew over the Sea of Japan for several hours last week.In September, Japan protested multinational military exercises on the Russian-held Kuril Islands — some of which are claimed by Japan — and expressed concern about Russian and Chinese warships conducting shooting drills in the Sea of Japan.Russia also tested submarine-launched missiles in the Sea of Japan last year.___AP writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed from Tokyo.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848767,Ingram scores 29 as Pelicans rout Trail Blazers 124-90,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Brandon Ingram scored 29 points and the New Orleans Pelicans routed the depleted Portland Trail Blazers 124-90 on Monday night for their fifth straight victory.CJ McCollum, who played nine seasons with the Blazers before he was traded to the Pelicans last season, added 17 points. Jonas Valanciunas finished with 10 points and 21 rebounds, and New Orleans led by as many as 36.The Pelicans are eighth in the Western Conference, a half-game behind Minnesota and Golden State. The top six teams avoid the play-in tournament and are guaranteed playoff spots.“We're playing with energy. We play together. We enjoy basketball,” Valanciunas said. “That gives us extra motivation, playing for something. So I think everybody is motivated. Everybody has a goal.”Keon Johnson had 20 points off the bench for the Blazers, who have lost nine of 10 and will likely miss the playoffs for the second straight season. Most of their regular starters were out with injuries, including top scorer Damian Lillard (right calf), Jerami Grant (bruised left quad), Jusuf Nurkic (right knee) and Anfernee Simons (right foot).“I wasn't concerned about the effort. I thought we played hard,"" coach Chauncey Billups said. “That's a team that's on a mission. They're playing very well, and they just kicked our butt, man.”Ingram was selected the NBA Player of the Week on Monday after averaging 31.3 points, 10 assists and 6.3 rebounds in wins over San Antonio, Charlotte and the Los Angeles Clippers last week.He had 18 points in the first half and the Pelicans led 58-35 at halftime.With the game well in hand, Ingram and McCollum both went to the bench for the final quarter.“We came in and just took care of business,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “We know the Trail Blazers are down guys, but it was important for us to respect our opponent.”Given the injuries and the Western Conference standings, Billups has turned his attention to developing young players.“Most of these guys that are out there right now, they weren’t planning on being out there this time of year,” Billups said. “So they’re grateful and thankful for the opportunity. And I feel like they’re doing a pretty good job with it.”SCOREBOARD WATCHINGValanciunas said the Pelicans are keeping an eye on the scoreboard and the standings as the postseason approaches.“It's go time now,” he said. “We're watching all the games, we're watching all the scores. And we're trying to climb up.""TIP-INSPelicans: Green praised Ingram before the game: “He understands the moment. He understands what's in front of us right now.

(AP) — Jaden McDaniels scored 20 points and the Minnesota Timberwolves spoiled Sacramento's hopes for a clinching party by beating the Kings 119-115 on Monday night.The Kings were hoping to end the longest playoff drought in NBA history in front of their fans, but sent them home unhappy.“Guys wanted to clinch a playoff spot at home and wanted to share it with our fans,” guard De'Aaron Fox said. “But at the end of the day, regardless of where we do it, I think people are going to be appreciative and people are going to love it.”The Timberwolves won their fourth straight game and swept a back-to-back set at Golden State and Sacramento to tie the Warriors for sixth place in the Western Conference playoff race. The top six teams avoid the play-in tournament.“These guys really like each other and love playing with each other,"" coach Chris Finch said. “They have lifted their game with the games being so big.”Minnesota wasn't fazed by the frenzied sellout crowd and pulled away in the fourth quarter.Naz Reid hit a 3-pointer to give the Timberwolves a six-point lead early in the fourth, and McDaniels' emphatic dunk made it 114-104 with about four minutes left.The Kings had a chance to make it close late, but Keegan Murray missed a 3 from the corner that could have cut the deficit to three with 42 seconds left.Reid added 18 points, Anthony Edwards scored 17 and Rudy Gobert had 16 points and 16 rebounds.“We know we have the talent and the personnel to be able to beat anybody on any given night,"" Gobert said. ""Really out of urgency and consistency ... we play every game like it’s our last and we play every game like there’s no tomorrow. That’s the mindset that we need.”Fox scored 29 points and Domantas Sabonis added 24 points and 10 rebounds for Sacramento. The Kings struggled from the outside, shooting just 5 of 26 on 3-pointers.Sacramento now will look to clinch its first playoff berth since 2006 later this week, when the Kings travel to Portland for two games.Sacramento's 16-year stretch without a playoff appearance is the longest in NBA history and the longest active postseason drought among any team in the NBA, NFL, NHL or Major League Baseball.The excitement in Sacramento was palpable leading up to the game, with success-starved fans eager to have something consequential to celebrate.The stakes might have contributed to a shaky start for the Kings, who fell behind by 13 in the first quarter. But led by an emphatic dunk for a three-point play by Sabonis and three baskets in the final minute of the half, the Kings took a 58-57 lead into the break.The game stayed close from there until the Timberwolves pulled away in the fourth quarter.“Obviously a missed opportunity tonight to get this game, but the season continues on,” Kings forward Harrison Barnes said.TIP-INSTimberwolves: Star big man Karl-Anthony Towns sat out the back end of a back-to-back as he deals with a lingering right calf strain. ...

(AP) — Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and an assist in his 700th NHL game and the Colorado Avalanche won their third straight game, beating the Anaheim Ducks 5-1 Monday night.The two-point night continued what has been a great month for the All-Star center.MacKinnon — who became the eighth player in Avalanche/Nordiques franchise history to appear in 700 games — is tied for second in the league with 24 points in March. He also has 10 goals, which are tied for third.“The more important the game, the more he’s going to show up for his team. It’s just another level of determination,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said of MacKinnon. “It’s probably hard to maintain or stay up like through the course of 82 games, but when the games get big, he's the guy that is going to show up for you.”Bowen Byram also had a goal and an assist for the Avalanche, who are one point behind Dallas for the Central Division lead. Jack Johnson, Valeri Nichushkin and Samuel Girard also scored for Colorado, and Cale Makar had two assists. Jonas Johansson stopped 29 shots.Anaheim, which went 1-6-1 on its eight-game homestand, got its lone goal from Derek Grant. John Gibson made 39 saves. Trevor Zegras suffered a lower-body injury during the second period and did not return.“I think everyone gets frustrated when you’re losing. It doesn’t matter if you’re playing a good team or not,” said Jakob Silfverberg, who had the assist on Grant's goal. “We knew we were going to have a tough game tonight, so we were just going to try to outwork them out there, but it was a tough game tonight and they are a good team.”MacKinnon scored the go-ahead goal with 7.9 seconds remaining in the first period with a great individual effort. The center kept possession of the puck deep in the offensive zone, skated to the top of the left faceoff circle and put a wrist shot over Gibson's shoulder on his blocker side for his 32nd of the season to give Colorado a 2-1 lead.“I was looking to pass there. There’s some time they kind of play passive a little bit in their defensive zone. We can’t force things,"" MacKinnon said. ""Mikko (Rantanen) and Valeri were doing a great job screening and I managed to find the short side.”The Ducks opened the scoring 12 minutes into the game when Grant took Silfverberg's pass and put it between Johansson's legs for his fifth of the season.Three minutes later, Bryam found the net for the fourth time in the last nine games with a shot from the point just beyond the left faceoff circle that found its way through traffic.Colorado put it out of reach with a pair of goals 96 seconds apart early in the second period. Johnson ended a 146-game goal drought with a snap shot from the point. Nichushkin followed at 3:46 with his 16th off a pass by MacKinnon to make it 4-1.POWERING UPGirard gave the Avalanche a power-play goal for the 12th straight game four minutes into the third on a rebound in front of the net.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848770,Sergio Romo retires as Giant after pitching one final time,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Sergio Romo retired as a San Francisco Giant just the way he wanted, pitching one final time for the team he helped to win three World Series championships and then calling it a career Monday night.In a moment more special than he could have possibly imagined, the entertaining right-hander faced three Oakland batters in the seventh inning at Oracle Park in the exhibition finale for both clubs.“Very fitting to find some closure in what literally is for me was a storybook career,” he told reporters, pausing to catch his breath after the Athletics' 12-6 win.The Giants reached out a few weeks back seeing whether Romo might consider tossing an inning — he looked at his arm and asked if it could give it one last hurrah. He had already taken up golf.“I understand how special this opportunity was,” he said.So, Bay Area baseball fans were treated to a last listen of Romo's long-time signature “El Mechon” walk-up tune, too, and he basked in the cheers.But ahead of unleashing his nasty slider, Romo got a dose of what he'll be missing in the new, modern baseball world — he was immediately called for two clock violations by the plate umpire, resulting in a pair of automatic balls.The first was for taking too long to finish his warmup tosses. The second was for taking too long to throw his first pitch.Going against one of his former teams, and starting with a 2-0 count, Romo quickly walked his first batter. He threw a wild pitch and surrendered two singles that scored a run before former teammate Hunter Pence walked out to make a pitching change.The 40-year-old Romo soaked it all in as he made his way to the dugout, tipped his cap and hugged Giants manager Gabe Kapler and others in a sensational sendoff.Romo got a curtain call and fought tears as he went back into the dugout.Saluted with a rousing ovation when he strolled to the bullpen to begin his warmup tosses, Romo received more cheers when he came into the spring training game. The A's players watched and clapped from their dugout rail and the Giants grinned witnessing the emotional goodbye to baseball.Ever popular with the home fans, Romo wore a special hat. All during spring training, every time a kid asked for an autograph, he'd have them sign his cap.“If this is was the last hat I was going to wear in the big leagues ... I figured it would be nice to not go in there alone,"" he said.Romo played 15 seasons for eight different organizations, including the Athletics, spending his initial nine years with the Giants. The reliever shared a goodbye note Monday to San Francisco on The Players' Tribune.“Dear San Francisco, Tonight I get to do something one last time — something that’s been one of the biggest honors of my whole life: I get to put on a Giants jersey. And before I go do that, I just wanted to write this letter, and share some thoughts with you all. Thanks for reading,” he said.On Sunday in Oakland, Romo greeted fans and fist-bumped youngsters as he made his farewell rounds. On his Instagram account, the ever-creative Romo posted a photo of himself holding a sign similar to those of students on the first day of school but signifying his last day in the majors.Romo grew up in Brawley, California, about 125 miles east of San Diego and some 30 miles north of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. He was a 2013 All-Star for the Giants and posted a career record of 42-36 with a 3.21 ERA and 137 saves over 821 appearances spanning 722 2/3 innings. Last year, he pitched a combined 23 games for Seattle and Toronto.He also played for the Dodgers, Tampa Bay, Miami and Minnesota. A 28th-round draft pick by San Francisco in 2005 out of Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Colorado, Romo was a key member of manager Bruce Bochy's stellar bullpen soon after making his big league debut in 2008.Romo helped the Giants win every-other-year titles in 2010, ‘12 and ’14 — the 2010 team capturing the franchise's first championship since 1954 and first in San Francisco since moving West in 1958.Romo excelled in those games, posting a 0.00 ERA and three saves in six World Series appearances.And long after those October highlights, Romo wound up on the very same mound for the last time, finishing up on March night.“What an experience,” he said.___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World

The Frenchman replaced ailing Marcus Morris in the starting lineup and produced a spectacular game from the perimeter, hitting eight of his first nine 3-point attempts while Los Angeles ran away in the first three quarters.“It was nothing crazy, just really open shots,” said Batum, who finished one shy of his career high in 3s, set 11 years ago. “I didn't have to take a dribble on any of those shots. I just had open shots, and my teammates made some good passes. It was just good basketball.”Gordon had his biggest scoring performance since returning to the Clippers in a trade last month, and Russell Westbrook added 12 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. The Clippers finished with a season-high 41 assists, topping 40 in a game for the first time since January 2015.“When we're attacking the paint, attacking the rim and playing the right way, we're a really good team,” coach Tyronn Lue said. “Tonight was a blueprint of how we should play.”Los Angeles (40-36) kept hold of fifth place in the Western Conference standings and moved a half-game behind fourth-place Phoenix.Zach LaVine scored 23 points and Nikola Vucevic had 20 points and eight rebounds for the Bulls, who followed up their impressive win over the Lakers on Sunday with a dud.DeMar DeRozan had 21 points and seven assists in his hometown, but Chicago lost for only the third time in 10 games and missed a chance to pull even with Toronto and Atlanta for eighth place in the East.“When a team gets into a rhythm, that's what generally happens,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Tonight we just didn't do a good enough job all around. ... I felt we gave up too many uncontested 3s, especially early when they started to find their rhythm. And then the ones we did contest, they made, because I think we gave them too many open looks early.”The Clippers improved to 2-1 without leading scorer Paul George, who is all but certain to miss the rest of the regular season after spraining his right knee in a loss to Oklahoma City last Tuesday.Batum immediately clicked with the Clippers' starters, hitting five 3-pointers in the first half. Morris has hit only five 3s in his last seven games combined, and Batum's contributions along with Gordon's 16 first-half points mostly against LaVine's defense boosted Los Angeles to an early 11-point lead.The Clippers rolled to a 22-point lead in the third quarter, and Batum didn't miss his second 3-point attempt until right before the quarter buzzer. Batum didn't take a 2-point shot.TIP-INSBulls: Alex Caruso sat out to rest his foot injury. ... Vucevic was well rested after getting ejected early in Sunday's win. ...

Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Skiers have likely noticed signs at mountain resorts across the country saying, “Know the code.” They refer to universal rules of conduct that apply to people who partake in inherently risky snow sports that involve navigating down crowded slopes, often at high speeds.But whether they actually understand the code is another question. For those unfamiliar with skiing and snowboarding, it’s likely something they’ve never heard of.That’s all changing as actor Gwyneth Paltrow’s highly publicized ski collision trial is live-streamed from the courtroom. The actor-turned-lifestyle-influencer was accused of crashing into a fellow skier during a 2016 family trip to the upscale, skiers-only Deer Valley Resort in Utah. The celebrity trial is on day six and expected to conclude Thursday.For a week, the trial has shone a spotlight on the unspoken rules that govern behavior on the slopes. Testimony has repeatedly touched on skier’s etiquette — especially sharing contact information after a collision, and ski turn radiuses — in the most high-profile ski collision trial in recent history.There are about a hundred code-related lawsuits playing out now outside the spotlight. Most cases are settled before going to trial.Throughout Paltrow's trial, the word “uphill” has emerged as synonymous with “guilty,” as attorneys have focused on one of the code’s main tenets: The skier who is downhill or ahead on a slope has the right of way.Rather than focus solely on the question of who hit who, attorneys have questioned nearly every witness — from Paltrow’s private ski instructors to doctors for the man suing Paltrow — about which skier was downhill at the time of the collision.After initially suing Paltrow for $3.1 million, retired optometrist Terry Sanderson is now suing for at least $300,000 in damages. Paltrow has countersued for $1 and attorney fees, claiming Sanderson ran into her.In court, attorneys on both sides have repeated the term “downhill” to try to persuade the jury that their client had the right of way.The question has become a focal point of the trial, as both sides call legions of family members, friends and doctors to testify in Park City — the posh Rocky Mountain resort town that draws a throng of celebrities each year for the Sundance Film Festival.Paltrow's position on the slope was central to the questioning of her teenage children — 16-year-old Moses and 18-year-old Apple Martin.In depositions read by attorneys in court on Tuesday, the children both testified that they didn’t see the moment of the crash. Before it happened Moses Martin said he saw a man uphill from his mother.”“I was following my instructor but didn’t know what was going on,” Moses Martin, who was nine at the time, said.His instructor testified that he didn’t witness the moment of the crash either but approached Paltrow and Sanderson afterward.Apple Martin, then 11, remembered that her mother was in a “state of shock” after the collision and that she used an expletive to say that a man hit her on the run.To support Paltrow's version of events, specifically that she was downhill when the crash happened, her defense team commissioned artists to render advanced animations.Because no video footage was included as evidence, the recollections of a ski buddy of Sanderson's who claims to be the sole eyewitness has become a sticking point for Paltrow’s team. In addition to sharing animations, Paltrow's team undercut the man’s testimony by calling on experts arguing that Paltrow was downhill.Over objections from Sanderson's attorneys, the court has allowed Paltrow's team to play three of the seven high-resolution animations on a projector positioned between witnesses and the jury box — showing the pruning on Deer Valley’s aspen trees, childrens' ski coats and groomed snow on the beginner run where Sanderson and Paltrow crashed.Irving Scher, a biomechanical engineer hired by Paltrow’s defense team, drew stick figures and line graphs on a white board, as well as jotted down equations calculating force and torque to argue that science supported Paltrow's account.“Ms. Paltrow’s version of events is consistent with the laws of physics,” Scher testified Tuesday.In an equally theatrical display last week, Sanderson’s lawyers tried but failed to rope Paltrow into a reenactment of events, when the judge put the kibosh on it.While there are minor differences in state laws when it comes down to finding fault, “in court it becomes a question of who was the uphill skier,” said Denver attorney Jim Chalat, who has litigated cases in Utah and Colorado.“It’s the uphill skier who is almost always in a position to cause the crash,” Chalat said. “If you’re skiing too fast for your own ability and you can’t carve out a turn, and you hit someone, you’re going to be in trouble.”Still, crashes between skiers are rare. Most incidents resulting in injuries or death occur when skiers or snowboarders slam into stationary objects, usually trees. Collisions involving people represent only about 5% of skier injuries, Chalat said.Experts at the Paltrow trial have argued that the National Ski Areas Association's more than 60-year-old code is ubiquitous, with similar etiquette in Canada, Australia and parts of Europe.The responsibility code was recently updated to urge skiers involved in a collision to share contact information with each other and a ski area employee. Last week, Paltrow was grilled by Sanderson’s attorneys for leaving the collision without first exchanging information with Sanderson. She said she knew one of the family's ski instructors handled that for her.Very few cases target the ski resorts where crashes occurred because of the inherent dangers that come with skiing and snowboarding, Los Angeles attorney John Morgan of the firm Morgan & Morgan said.The mountain where the Paltrow-Sanderson collision happened, Deer Valley, was removed from the lawsuit in part because skiers absolve resorts of responsibility by agreeing to a set of rules on the back of every lift ticket.“It’s like going to a baseball game and you get hit in the head by a foul ball. You know by sitting there that there’s some risk of that happening,” he said.___Weber reported from Los Angeles. AP writer Anna Furman in Los Angeles contributed.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848773,Police: Nashville shooter fired indiscriminately at victims,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The shooter who killed three students and three staff members at a Christian school in Nashville legally bought seven weapons in recent years and hid the guns from their parents before carrying out the attack by firing indiscriminately at victims and spraying gunfire through doors and windows, police said Tuesday.The violence Monday at The Covenant School was the latest school shooting to roil the nation and was planned carefully. The shooter had drawn a detailed map of the school, including potential entry points, and conducted surveillance of the building before carrying out the massacre, authorities said.The suspect, Audrey Hale, 28, was a former student at the school. Hale did not target specific victims — among them three 9-year-olds and the head of the school — but did target “this school, this church building,” police spokesperson Don Aaron said at a news conference Tuesday.Hale was under a doctor's care for an undisclosed emotional disorder and was not known to police before the attack, Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said at the news conference.If police had been told that Hale was suicidal or homicidal, “then we would have tried to get those weapons,"" Drake said. “But as it stands, we had absolutely no idea who this person was or if (Hale) even existed.""Tennessee does not currently have a “red flag” law, which lets police step in and take firearms away from people who threaten to kill.On Tuesday night, Tennessee's governor said one of the victims, 61-year-old substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, was a close friend of his wife, Maria, and that the two had been scheduled to have dinner after Peak taught that day.“Maria woke up this morning without one of her best friends,” Gov. Bill Lee said, adding that his wife once taught with Peak and another victim, Katherine Koonce, and the women and “have been family friends for decades.”Hale legally bought seven firearms from five local gun stores, Drake said. Three of them were used in Monday’s shooting. Police spokesperson Brooke Reese said Hale bought the guns between October 2020 and June 2022.Hale's parents believed their child had sold one gun and did not own any others, Drake said, adding that Hale “had been hiding several weapons within the house.”Hale's motive is unknown, Drake said. In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Drake said investigators don't know what drove Hale but believe the shooter had “some resentment for having to go to that school.”Drake, at Tuesday's news conference, described “several different writings by Hale” that mention other locations and The Covenant School.Asked at a Senate hearing whether the Justice Department would open an investigation into whether the shooting was a hate crime targeting Christians, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said federal officials were working with local police to identify a motive.Police have released videos of the shooting, including edited surveillance footage that shows the shooter's car driving up to the school, glass doors being shot out and the shooter ducking through one of them.Additional video, from Officer Rex Engelbert's bodycam, shows a woman meeting police outside as they arrive and telling them that all the children were locked down, “but we have two kids that we don't know where they are.”The woman then directs officers to Fellowship Hall and says people inside had just heard gunshots. Three officers, including Engelbert, search rooms one by one, holding rifles and announcing themselves as police.The video shows officers climbing stairs to the second floor and entering a lobby area, followed by a barrage of gunfire and an officer yelling twice: “Get your hands away from the gun."" Then the shooter is shown motionless on the floor.Police identified Engelbert, a four-year member of the force, and Michael Collazo, a nine-year member, as the officers who fatally shot Hale. The White House said President Joe Biden spoke Tuesday with Drake, Engelbert and Callazo to thank them for their bravery.Police response times to school shootings have come under greater scrutiny after the attack in Uvalde, Texas, in which 70 minutes passed before law enforcement stormed the classroom. In Nashville, police said about eight minutes passed from the initial call to when officers arrived at the scene.Surveillance video shows a time stamp of just before 10:11 a.m., when the attacker shot out the doors. Police said they got the call about a shooter at 10:13. Aaron said in an email Tuesday that dispatch records show officers arrived on campus shortly before 10:22.At about 10:24, officers engaged the suspect, the chief said during the news conference. Within two minutes of that, the suspect was down, according to the dispatch records.“There were police cars that had been hit by gunfire. As officers were approaching the building, there was gunfire going off,” Drake said.“We feel, our response right now, from what I’ve seen, I don’t have a particular problem with it. But we always want to get better. We always want to get there in two or three minutes,” he said, adding that traffic was “locked down” at the time.Traffic was indeed stopped along a nearby two-lane road with a turning lane as police tried to weave their way to the school.Police have given unclear information on Hale's gender. For hours Monday, police identified the shooter as a woman. Later in the day, the police chief said Hale was transgender. After the news conference, Aaron declined to elaborate on how Hale identified.In an email Tuesday, police spokesperson Kristin Mumford said Hale “was assigned female at birth. Hale did use male pronouns on a social media profile.” Later Tuesday, at the news conference, Drake referred to Hale with female pronouns.Authorities identified the dead children as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. The adults were Cynthia Peak, 61, Katherine Koonce, 60, and Mike Hill, 61.The website of The Covenant School, a Presbyterian school founded in 2001, lists a Katherine Koonce as the head of the school. Her LinkedIn profile says she has led the school since July 2016. Peak was a substitute teacher, and Hill was a custodian, according to investigators.Koonce was remembered as someone who would run toward danger, not away from it.“I guarantee you if there were kids missing (during the shooting), Katherine was looking for them,” friend Jackie Bailey said. “And that’s probably how she got in the way — just trying to do something for somebody else. She would give up her own life in order to save somebody else’s.”Founded as a ministry of Covenant Presbyterian Church, the school is in the affluent Green Hills neighborhood just south of downtown Nashville. It has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade and roughly 50 staff members.Before Monday’s violence in Nashville, there had been seven mass killings at K-12 schools since 2006 in which four or more people were killed within a 24-hour period, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. In all of them, the shooters were males.The database does not include school shootings in which fewer than four people were killed, which have become far more common in recent years. Last week alone, for example, school shootings happened in Denver and the Dallas area within two days of each other.___Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia, John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia, and Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848774,"Taiwan nearing deal on missile trucks, self-propelled artillery from Czech Republic","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan is reportedly nearing a major deal to acquire hundreds of missile trucks and self-propelled howitzers from the Czech Republic, while also looking to cooperate on developing military drones.President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) met with a delegation led by Speaker of the Czech Chamber of Deputies Marketa Pekarova Adamova on Monday (March 27). CM Media cited a source familiar with the matter that Taiwan is preparing to purchase large missile trucks and 155 mm eight-wheel self-propelled howitzers, and will engage in cooperation on the development of military drones, with the deal expected to close soon and included in the next year's budget.Adamova is heading a delegation of 160 members that arrived in Taiwan on Saturday (March 25). The delegation includes Michal Koudelka, head of the counter-intelligence Security Information Service (BIS); Lukas Kintr, director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NUKIB); and other high-level security officials appointed by the new president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel.The source said the two countries are planning on conducting in-depth exchanges and cooperation in the military, combating disinformation, cybersecurity, semiconductors, and the military aerospace industry. In terms of military procurements, the source revealed that Taiwan is planning to purchase about 200 to 400 12-wheel large semi-trailer trucks, which would be used to transport Taiwanese missiles such as the Yun Feng surface-to-surface, supersonic cruise missile.Under the guidance of the National Security Council, Taiwan and the Czech Republic have already reportedly discussed the procurement of vehicles in July 2022. The current delegation has been sent to further the talks, and the agreement has almost been finalized, according to the news site.As for the purchase of the 155 mm eight-wheel self-propelled howitzers, Taiwan's previous application for the purchase of 40 M109A6 Paladin self-propelled howitzers from the U.S. was to cost about NT$17.3 billion (US$569 million), which was approved by former President Donald Trump.However, President Joe Biden scuttled the deal citing reasons such as the war in Ukraine and production line bottlenecks. Instead, the Biden administration offered the M142 HIMARS system as an alternative.According to the news agency, Taiwan had already established communications over possible arms deals with the Czech Republic in 2020. It cited military experts as saying the Czech Republic's 155 mm self-propelled howitzer is more advanced than the M109A2 and A5 currently used by the Taiwanese military, but slightly inferior to the M109A6.The name of the system was not provided, but the DITA 155mm Self-Propelled Howitzer is in development, and the Morana 155 mm Self-Propelled Howitzer was unveiled in 2022.The Czech delegation also includes personnel from the military aerospace industry. Taiwan's unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) experts and members of the Asia UAV AI Innovation Application R&D Center in mid-February reportedly went to Europe to seek opportunities for strategic UAV cooperation in France, Turkey, the Czech Republic, and other countries.Experts said Czech UAV technology is mature and Luxembourg has donated the Czech-made Primoco One 150 UAV, which has effectively provided battlefield intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR), and target acquisition (TA) capabilities.When meeting with Adamova, Tsai pointed out that this is an important milestone in the progress of Taiwan-Czech relations. She mentioned that she had a phone call with Pavel in January about strengthening exchanges and cooperation in various fields.",2023/03/28,9678,Politics

It is included in the vaccination to boost the immune response and provide long-lasting protection against the antigen. Adjuvants are added to vaccines to improve the body’s response to vaccination while also reducing the number of vaccine doses given to patients. Aluminum hydroxide and paraffin oil are the most often utilized adjuvants. Vaccine adjuvant also decreases the quantity of administered foreign material. It has also been used in research and for commercial purposes. The market growth is driven by high prevalence of infectious and zoonotic diseases and increasing focus on immunization programs from various government bodies.For instance, various governmental organizations across the globe are promoting and creating awareness about vaccination against diseases such as anthrax, BCG, hepatitis, HPV, influenza, varicella, smallpox, and other illnesses. The US government provided USD 290 million in foreign aid to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI, now known as GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance) in 2019 and USD 226 million to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support child vaccine campaigns in other countries. However, stringent regulatory environment and time-consuming approvals may impede market growth over the forecast period of 2021-2027.A rise in investments for R&D of novel medicines, as well as an increase in deadly epidemic illnesses, are driving the vaccine adjuvants market in the North American area. As a result, vaccination against acute and chronic illnesses is required. In addition, the existence of significant market participants in the United States increases product penetration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848887,Georgia bill is latest GOP effort targeting prosecutors,"ATLANTA (AP) — A new Georgia commission to discipline and remove wayward prosecutors would be the latest move nationwide to ratchet up oversight on what Republicans see as “woke prosecutors” who aren't doing enough to fight crime.The Georgia House voted 97-77 on Monday for Senate Bill 92 to create the commission. The Senate later sent the measure to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature or veto. Kemp has previously voiced support for the concept.The Georgia bill parallels efforts to remove prosecutors in Florida, Missouri, Indiana and Pennsylvania, as well as broader disputes nationwide over how certain criminal offenses should be charged. All continue anti-crime campaigns that Republicans ran nationwide last year, accusing Democrats of coddling criminals and acting improperly by refusing to prosecute whole categories of crimes including marijuana possession. All the efforts raise the question of prosecutorial discretion — a prosecutor's decision of what cases to try or reject and what charges to bring.Carissa Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the Republican push tries to reverse a sea change in prosecution. Hessick, who directs the Prosecutors and Politics Project, said that for the first time voters are confronted with meaningful debate about prosecutors' policies.“I think it's happened because several years ago, there was a push to try to use the office of prosecutor to address mass incarceration and injustices within the criminal justice system,” she said. “That movement was successful in a lot of places.”Georgia Democrats intensely oppose the measure, saying majority Republicans are seeking another way to impose their will on local Democratic voters.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has decried the measure, claiming it's a racist attack after voters elected 14 nonwhite district attorneys in Georgia in 2020. Willis pushed herself to the center of the controversy even as she's mulling charges against former President Donald Trump for interfering in Georgia's 2020 election. Some have viewed it as Republican retribution against the Atlanta prosecutor.But the energy behind the bill has not been against Willis, whom in addition to targeting Trump is pursuing a tough-on-crime offensive against alleged gang members. Instead, many Georgia Republicans are most angered by Deborah Gonzalez, a district attorney who covers two counties including Athens, Kemp's hometown. She's under fire for refusal to prosecute marijuana crimes, an outflow of prosecutors working under her, and failure to meet court deadlines.“That’s the whole point of this bill, is to restore public safety in places where you have rogue district attorneys who simply are not doing their job,” said Georgia Republican Rep. Houston Gaines of Athens.The effort was born from frustrations involving a white Republican prosecutor in suburban Atlanta who was indicted for bribery related to sexual harassment claims. He lingered until he pleaded guilty to unprofessional conduct and resigned in 2022.Some Democrats were interested in similar measures for a time because of Jackie Johnson, the coastal Georgia district attorney later charged with hindering the police investigation into the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery.Democratic interest cooled after voters ousted Johnson. Now they say Republicans should respect the will of local voters.Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat and former prosecutor, on Monday described the bill as a “a power grab by the majority party to usurp the will of the voters by putting this body in the business of overseeing duly elected prosecutors throughout this state.”Crucially, the Georgia bill mandates that a prosecutor must consider every case for which probable cause exists and can't exclude categories of cases from prosecution. A similar bill pending in Indiana would let an oversight board appoint a special prosecutor to handle cases when a “noncompliant” prosecutor refuses to charge certain crimes.Hessick said considering every case individually is an unrealistic standard because prosecutors turn away many more cases than they accept. She said the Georgia law is less likely to change prosecutors' decisions about which cases they pursue than to muzzle their ability to talk about their decisions.“It's designed to stop them from running on these platforms of reform,” Hessick said.The rules could also target prosecutors who declared before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022 that they would not prosecute abortion-related offenses. Seven current Georgia district attorneys made such pledges, among dozens nationwide.In some states, such laws could face hurdles. A New York court struck down a 2018 commission to investigate prosecutorial conduct after district attorneys sued saying it gave state lawmakers too much oversight over independent offices.Then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2021 signed another version into law. The commission isn't yet operating because some members haven't been appointed, a court spokesperson said.Georgia lawmakers can already impeach district attorneys and solicitors general — elected prosecutors in some Georgia counties who handle lower-level cases. But they say impeachment would take up too much of lawmakers' time. Instead, the new commission would investigate and make decisions. A prosecutor could appeal a decision to a state-level court, and eventually to the state Supreme Court.Impeachment is proceeding in Pennsylvania, where state House Republicans voted in November to impeach Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner for reasons including his failure to prosecute some minor crimes, his bail policies and management.Krasner sued to challenge the impeachment's legality, and a divided state court ruled for him, finding impeachment articles didn't reach the needed legal threshold.Plans for an impeachment trial in the Republican-majority Pennsylvania Senate have been on hold while that decision is appealed. In the meantime, the Republican majority that voted to impeach in the House is now a Democratic majority. It's unclear what that will mean for any trial.Other governors and legislatures have moved more directly to remove prosecutors. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended State Attorney Andrew Warren in Tampa’s Hillsborough County in August. A federal judge found DeSantis illegally targeted Warren because he’s a Democrat who has publicly supported abortion and transgender rights and because it would politically benefit DeSantis. But the judge wrote he had no power to reinstate Warren, leading the Democrat to appeal to the state Supreme Court.In the meantime, the prosecutor that DeSantis tapped to replace Warren has resumed prosecuting some misdemeanors — including suspended licenses, disorderly conduct and panhandling — that Warren had stopped bringing to trial.The GOP-led Missouri legislature is also maneuvering to override a Democratic prosecutor — St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner. It would let Republican Gov. Mike Parson appoint an additional special prosecutor for five years in any jurisdiction where the homicide rate exceeds 35 killings per 100,000 residents. The bill was drafted with St. Louis in mind.Also, Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey is seeking to remove Gardner from office, alleging negligence in her job. If a judge agrees, Parson would appoint her replacement. A hearing date hasn't been set.___Associated Press writers Jim Salter in O'Fallon, Missouri, Alana Durkin Richer in Boston and Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, contributed to this report.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848888,Oilers hold off Coyotes 5-4; McDavid reaches 140 points,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored the tiebreaking goal with 7:55 remaining and the Edmonton Oilers beat the Arizona Coyotes 5-4 on Monday night.Zack Hyman, Evan Bouchard, Darnell Nurse and Leon Draisaitl also scored for the Oilers, who extended their points streak to seven (6-0-1). Jack Campbell stopped 29 shots.“We’re walking out of this building with those two points, but there were moments where we can be better,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “But we found a way to win and that’s a good sign. They’re a good young skilled team.”Connor McDavid picked up an assist for his 140th point of the season, becoming the first player to reach the mark since Pittsburgh’s Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr both achieved it in 1995-96. The last Oilers player to do it was Wayne Gretzky in 1987-88.Matias Maccelli and Barrett Hayton scored two goals each for the Coyotes, who lost their fifth straight overall and snapped their eight-game home points streak. Lawson Crouse had three assists and Karel Vejmelka finished with 24 saves.Arizona coach Andre Tourigny, having seen his team complete a difficult stretch that saw two games in three days against Stanley Cup champion Colorado, said he will give them the day off Tuesday. The Coyotes don’t play again until Friday.“It was a tough one, five games in seven days and (against) those kind of opponents,” Tourigny said. “They worked really hard and I’m really proud of them.”Nugent-Hopkins' goal was his 34th of the season and came with Arizona's Clayton Keller in the penalty box for hooking. It was the Oilers' second power-play goal of the game.The Oilers hadn't played yet in Mullett Arena, which seats only 5,000 and has been a tough place for opponents, especially recently.“The rink's probably the same size, I would imagine,” Hyman said. “Just with the limited seating it's a college game obviously with the fans on top of you. It was a different experience. ... It's a weird throwback environment.”Edmonton entered Monday as the highest scoring team in the league with 286 goals. They showed why in the first period with three goals — one on a power play, one short-handed and one at even strength.Arizona scored first, though, as Maccelli scored his ninth goal from the slot off Campbell's glove 3:50 into the game.That didn’t last long as the Coyotes’ Nathan Smith was penalized for holding at 4:34. Just 6 seconds later, Hyman tied it up on a rebound for his 32nd. McDavid had his 80th assist of the season on the play.Hayton put the Coyotes in front again with a power-play goal with 7:01 left in the period, exactly one minute after Edmonton’s Vincent Desharnais went to the penalty box for holding. But that advantage also went away quickly when Bouchard scored his fifth of the season, on a second-chance goal with 6:26 remaining after Nick Bjugstad drove to the net.Despite McDavid being in the penalty box for hooking, the Oilers took their first lead on Nurse’s ninth goal at 18:11 when he and Kailer Yamamoto broke in on Vejmelka 2-on-1.After five goals and six penalties in the first period, the second period just had one goal, when Draisaitl scored his 46th, beating Vejmelka from the faceoff circle to the goalie’s left with 5:28 remaining to push the Oilers' lead to 4-2.The Coyotes, who have made a habit of rallying in the third period, did it again on Monday. Maccelli's 10th goal of the season 3:52 into the third period — assisted by Crouse and McBain as on the first goal — cut it to 4-3, and Hayton tied it up less than a minute later with his 17th goal with assists by Keller and Nick Schmaltz. But this time Arizona was unable to get the game into overtime.“Proud of the fight we put up, but at the same time it’s frustrating,"" Hayton said.ICE CHIPSOilers: LW Ryan McLeod (undisclosed) was a scratch.Coyotes: D Josh Brown (upper body) returned after missing six games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848889,Daughter: Mississippi tornado victim was ‘beautiful soul’,"ROLLING FORK, Miss. (AP) — With her sister behind the wheel, Queen'terica Jones rushed across the flat Mississippi Delta as a powerful tornado bore down on their mother's home. The howling winds lifted the rear of their car off the ground and slammed them into a churchyard.They arrived too late. The tornado had already killed their mother, ruined her home and devasted the town of Rolling Fork. With no electricity, survivors used cellphone flashlights to pick through the wreckage. Jones said she found her mother’s lifeless body face-down in the yard, bloodied by nails that struck her head.“I wouldn't wish this pain upon nobody, not even an enemy,” Jones said Tuesday.Her mother, Erica “Nikki” Moore, worked as a personal care assistant and is survived by six children. She was “a beautiful soul” who loved to pray and help people, Jones said.“She was amazing. A sweetheart,"" Jones said. “I mean, ain’t nobody perfect. Everybody goes through something, but our mom — everybody that’s known our mom knows she had a heart of gold.”At least 21 people in Mississippi and a man in Alabama perished as menacing storms tore across the Deep South over the weekend. The toll was especially steep in Sharkey County, in western Mississippi, where Moore was among 13 people who died in a county of 3,700 residents.County Coroner Angelia Eason said the losses hit the close-knit community hard.“I had to identify family, that’s what it felt like,” Eason said. “When something like this happens, we tend to come together even closer. We didn’t just lose 13 people. We lost 13 family members.”The storm wiped out multiple generations: A woman and her elderly mother were killed, Eason said. Others were in the wrong place at the wrong time: A man from Yazoo City had traveled more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) for an auction in Rolling Fork.TJ Herman said his sister, Linda Herman, and their mother, Luvella Herman, died when the tornado wiped out the mobile home park where they lived. Linda had retired after working in restaurants, and she took good care of their mother, said TJ, who lives in Rockford, Illinois. He said his mother and sister enjoyed their uncomplicated life in Rolling Fork.“Matter of fact, we brought our mom up here once, and we had to turn around and take her back the next day when she found out that we had to lock our doors up here,” TJ said Tuesday, referring to his hometown of Rockford. ""In her community, nobody locked their doors. She didn’t like it very much up here.”Lonnie and Melissa Pierce lived a quiet, peaceful life in the town before the tornado swept up a neighbor's semi-truck and dropped it onto their brick home like a bomb, killing the married couple.Lonnie's friends and neighbors say the retired welder was fond of hunting and bass fishing. Melissa volunteered for a local Christian charity that operates a small thrift store.“They were good. About the best, I can tell you that,” said neighbor Harvey Cockrell, 76, a fellow welder who worked with Lonnie for decades.A mound of broken rubble was all that remained of the couple's home after the twister packing winds of up to 200 mph (320 kph) hit Rolling Fork late Friday. The 18-wheeler remained perched atop the debris Monday, and deer antlers that had been among Lonnie’s hunting trophies covered the couple's yard.Once the storm passed, Jermain Wells, a neighbor of the Pierces, went door-to-door searching for survivors in need. When he got to the wreckage of the couple’s home, there was nothing he could do.“We couldn’t get them out,” Wells said.April Johnson, a mother of five, was killed while working the cash register at a discount store in town. The storm destroyed the business.“She was a hardworking, loving kind who would go out of her way to help people,” said Dianne Berry, a cousin to April's mother. “She always had a smile.”Berry said April's son played football and she was always willing to drive other kids to games and practices. “She would fix them little snack bags,” Berry said.Shaquana Stubbs' brother, Daryl Purvis, also died in Rolling Fork.“He was a very kindhearted person,"" Stubbs said of Daryl, who worked in landscaping. “He was the life of the party. He’ll do anything to make you laugh, and everybody that knew him loved him. You couldn’t do nothing but love him.”In addition to the heavy death toll, the same storm system injured dozens of people and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and buildings during four days in which it pummeled the South from Texas to the Carolinas.In the Mississippi neighborhood where the Pierces were killed, it was difficult to believe anyone had survived. Cockrell and his wife, Mary Cockrell, took cover in the central hallway of their home when the tornado struck. Their home was destroyed, and they lost nearly everything but their lives.“It’s like a war zone,” Mary Cockrell said. “Everything's torn to pieces.”___AP reporter Emily Wagster Pettus contributed to this story from Jackson, Mississippi.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848890,"Handmade blankets welcome refugees, immigrants to US","BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — ""Welcome to the USA,"" says a note attached to a hand-crocheted blanket of purple, white and gray stripes.Hollie Shaner-McRae, of Burlington, who made the blanket as a gift for a refugee, wrote of her great-grandparents coming to the United States from Ukraine, Russia and Poland.One great-grandfather was a tailor and the other was a barrel maker, she wrote. “Both were so brave and came to America as teenagers,"" she wrote in the note. “I hope you make friends and feel safe here,” Shaner-McRae wrote to whomever would receive the blanket. “Vermont is blessed to have new families arrive and enrich our world.”The quilt was one of at least 86 artistic blankets that crafters sewed, crocheted and knitted as gifts for refugees and immigrants to make them feel welcomed in their new community in Vermont. The handmade creations were on display at the Heritage Mill Museum in Winooski, Vermont, before they were given away to refugees last week.The effort is part of the national Welcome Blanket project, which describes itself as a crowd-sourced artistic action supporting refugees settling in the U.S. Los Angeles activist Jayna Zweiman started Welcome Blanket in 2017 in opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy speeches about building a wall between the United State and Mexico.As a grandchild of refugees, she grew up with family stories of her grandfather seeing the Statue of Liberty. That monument decades later still made him feel welcomed, she said.Just as the Statue of Liberty was seen as an inviting symbol for immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Zweiman thought at the time: “What can we do in the 21st century as people are coming through these different ports to welcome them?""To date, thousands of blankets and notes have been created around the country for exhibits including in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Winooski, Vermont. The blankets, accompanied with the personal notes from their creators, were then gifted to refugees at events, in welcome boxes, at their new housing or through charity groups.The project is geared toward refugees — people forced to leave their home or country to escape war, persecution or natural disaster — including Ukrainians who escaped the Russian invasion of their home country. But the blankets have also gone to immigrants.In Vermont, Aisha Bitini, who is originally from Congo, said that she loves the blanket she chose — a soft, crocheted piece made up of large squares of gold, maroon, off-white and gray.“I’m so blessed to have one of them,” she said, draping it over her shoulder. She picked it out at the blanket giveaway held last week at the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, or AALV.The note that came with the blanket “feels so special,” Bitini said, adding that she thanks the person who made “this beautiful blanket” and that she will ""cherish it forever.""Kalyan Adhikari, who's originally from Nepal, said the Vermont project was “such a kind and warm initiative.” He said it makes refugees feel welcome and little bit more like they're home.“This makes my heart warm. I can't thank them enough,” he said of the blanket-makers.The immigrant-refugee story resonated with Sonia Savoulian, of Los Angeles, when in 2017 then-President Donald Trump imposed a ban on travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries. Her ancestry is Armenian, and her family includes refugees and immigrants. She herself is an immigrant — and she also happens to make things with yarn.The Welcome Blanket project combines a creative outlet with a product that would help newcomers to the U.S. “feel an embrace, a welcome and an aspiration,” she said. Since making her first Welcome Blankets for an exhibit in Atlanta in 2018, she has made a total of about 50 such blankets.Zweiman said she hopes the blanket-making for refugees will become an American tradition.“I want this happening 50 years from now,” she said. “And I want a kid who took part in this, ... when the next wave of xenophobia comes, to remember that he had actually physically made something for someone who was coming.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848891,Tornado-spawning storms may get worse due to warming,"America will probably get more killer tornado- and hail-spawning supercells as the world warms, according to a new study that also warns the lethal storms will edge eastward to strike more frequently in the more populous Southern states, like Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee.The supercell storm that devastated Rolling Fork, Mississippi is a single event that can’t be connected to climate change. But it fits that projected and more dangerous pattern, including more nighttime strikes in a southern region with more people, poverty and vulnerable housing than where storms hit last century. And the season will start a month earlier than it used to.The study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society predicts a nationwide 6.6% increase in supercells and a 25.8% jump in the area and time the strongest supercells twist and tear over land under a scenario of moderate levels of future warming by the end of the century. But in certain areas in the South the increase is much higher. That includes Rolling Fork, where study authors project an increase of one supercell a year by the year 2100.Supercells are nature’s ultimate storms, so-called “Finger of God” whoppers that are “the dominant producers of significant tornadoes and hail,” said lead author Walker Ashley, a professor of meteorology and disaster geography at Northern Illinois University. Tall, anvil-shaped and sky-filling, supercells have a rotating powerful updraft of wind and can last for hours.Supercells spawned the 2013 Moore, Oklahoma, tornado that killed 51 people, the 2011 Joplin, Missouri, tornado outbreak that killed 161 people and the 2011 super outbreak that killed more than 320 people in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, the Mid-South.The study used computer simulations to predict what will happen by the end of the century with different levels of global carbon pollution levels. But Ashley said that stormier future seems like it's already here.“The data that I’ve seen has persuaded me that we are in this experiment and living it right now,” Ashley said in an interview three days before the EF-4 tornado killed more than 20 people in Mississippi on Friday. “What we’re seeing in the longer term is actually occurring right now.”Ashley and others said although the Mississippi tornado fits the projected pattern, it was a single weather event, which is different than climate projections over many years and a large area.Ashley and study co-author Victor Gensini, another meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University and a longtime tornado expert, said they are watching the potential for another supercell blow-up in the Mid-South on Friday.Past studies have been unable to forecast supercells and tornadoes in future climate simulations because they are small-scale events, especially tornadoes, that global computer models can’t see. Ashley and Gensini used smaller regional computer models and compensated for their reduced computing power by spending two years running simulations and crunching data.Three scientists not connected to the study said it makes sense. One of them, Pennsylvania State University tornado scientist Paul Markowski, called it a promising advance because it explicitly simulated storms, compared to past research that only looked at general environments favorable to supercells.While the study finds a general increase in supercell counts, what it mostly finds are large shifts in where and when they hit — generally, more east of Interstate 35, which runs through east central Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, and fewer to the west.In moderate warming – less warming than the world is headed for based on current emissions – parts of eastern Mississippi and eastern Oklahoma are projected to get three more supercells every two years, with eastern Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, western Tennessee and eastern Georgia getting one more supercell every other year.With worst-case warming — more than the world is presently on track for — the study projects similar changes but with worsening supercells over eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.Cities that should see more supercells as warming worsens include Dallas-Fort Worth, Little Rock, Memphis, Jackson, Tupelo, Birmingham and Nashville, Ashley said.The moderate warming simulation projects 61% more supercells in March and 46% more in April, while the more severe warming scenario has 119% more in March and 82% more in April. They see double-digit percentage point drops in June and July.In the mid-South, including Rolling Fork, the study projects supercell activity peaking two hours later, from 6 to 9 p.m. instead of 4 to 7 p.m. That means more nighttime supercells.“If you want a disaster, create a supercell at night where you can’t go outside and visually confirm the threat’’ so people don’t take it as seriously, Gensini said.The eastward shift also puts more people at risk because those areas are more densely populated than the traditional tornado alley of Kansas and Oklahoma, Ashley and Gensini said. The population coming under more risk is also poorer and more frequently lives in mobile or manufactured homes, which are more dangerous places in a tornado.What’s likely happening as the climate warms is the Southwest United States is getting hotter and drier, Ashley and Gensini said. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Mexico, which provides the crucial moisture for the storms, is getting hotter and the air coming from there is getting juicier and unstable.The hot dry air from places like New Mexico puts a stronger “cap” on where storms would normally brew when air masses collide in spring time. That cap means storms can't quite boil over as much in the Great Plains. The pressure builds as the weather front moves east, leading to supercells forming later and farther eastward, Gensini and Ashley said.Because February and March are getting warmer than they used to be this will happen earlier in the year, but by July and August the cap of hot dry air is so strong that supercells have a hard time forming, Ashley and Gensini said.It’s like playing with a pair of dice loaded against you, Ashley said. One of those dice is making the odds worse because of more people in the way and the other one is loaded with more supercells “increasing the odds of the perils too, tornadoes and hail.”___Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848892,"Harris, in Africa, confronts painful past, envisions future","CAPE COAST, Ghana (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday stepped through the black doors of a colonial-era seaside fort and down into the dungeons, touring a site where millions of enslaved Africans were held captive before they were loaded onto ships bound for the Americas.With her visit to Cape Coast Castle, Harris was insisting on remembering the painful past even as she stood earlier Tuesday before a monument commemorating Ghana’s independence, envisioning a grand future between the U.S. and Africa propelled by innovation on the continent.""The horror of what happened here must always be remembered,"" she said from the fort as the sun set over the water. “It cannot be denied. It must be taught. History must be learned.""The nation's first Black and South Asian vice president is the most high-profile member of President Joe Biden’s administration to visit Africa as the U.S. escalates its outreach to the continent. The events on her second day in Ghana are part of a weeklong trip that will include visits to Tanzania and Zambia.Cape Coast Castle is one of dozens of fortresses in West Africa that held slaves, many of them in Ghana. The government here has viewed preserving them as part of its historical responsibility.Harris skipped her prepared remarks to talk bluntly about the anguish “that reeks from this place,” and the horrors endured by the people who passed through those walls; mass kidnapping, sickness, rape and death. Those who lived were sold into bondage in the Americas.“And yet, they survived,"" she said, her voice cracking with emotion. She said the endurance and determination of the African diaspora in the world should be admired.“All of us, regardless of our background, have benefitted from their fight for freedom and justice,"" she said.During their tour, Harris and husband Doug Emhoff walked past a plaque commemorating a visit by Barack and Michelle Obama, the nation’s first Black president and first lady. The couple walked along the stone ramparts flanked by cannons, pausing to gaze out over the sea as waves crashed on the rocky shore below.She passed through white archways and down a darkened path leading through the infamous “door of no return,” through which slaves left the coast and never came back. Harris choked back tears, her hand on her mouth, as she approached. She placed a white bouquet of flowers, given to her during the arrival ceremony, at the entrance to a women's dungeon nearby.Tour guide Kwesi Blankson said he told the vice president about how captives would sometimes gaze up through the holes in the dungeon ceiling and pray to the gods and sing songs. He sang one to her, about wishing for death, “because death means freedom.”He described the tour as a solemn moment, “like a graveyard.”Harris has proved to be a potent messenger in Ghana, and thousands waited hours earlier Tuesday at Independence Square for a chance to see her speak at the Black Stone Gate monument.“Because of this history, this continent of course has a special significance for me personally, as the first Black vice president of the United States,” she said to huge cheers from the crowd. “And this is a history, like many of us, that I learned as a young child.”Tracy Sika Brobbey said “it’s a special moment” to see the first woman vice president. Margaret Mintah, who waited alongside her, said Harris “gives us some kind of hope, that we can believe that anything is possible.”“It’s like a blessing,” she added.During her remarks at the monument, Harris pledged a new era of partnership with Africa, envisioning “a future that is propelled by African innovation.”Much of her remarks there focused on innovation and entrepreneurship, part of her effort to spotlight Africa as a place for American private-sector investment. It’s something that Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said he hopes to see after years of being overlooked.“We must invest in the African ingenuity and creativity, which will unlock incredible economic growth and opportunities,” Harris said, highlighting the continent’s innovations to deliver emergency healthcare supplies and provide vaccines, and in farming and mineral processing.The U.S. must be guided “not by what we can do for our African partners, but we can do with our African partners.”Harris also homed in on areas for work, including promoting democracies across the world, progress in the digital economy in Africa, and the empowerment of women.“Women around the world must be able to fully participate in economic, political and social life, and they must be able to participate equally including in leadership roles,” she said. “The empowerment of women is rooted in the concept of freedom, not just freedom from violence or want, but freedom to create one’s own future.”U.S. outreach is part of the global competition over Africa’s future, with China and Russia each defending their own interests in the continent as well. But Harris has been careful to play down the role of geopolitical rivalries during her travels here.“Together we can unleash growth and opportunity that far exceeds what either the public or private sector can achieve on its own,” she said.Harris spoke of the vast capabilities of the continent’s youth, calling them “dreamers and innovators;” Africa’s population has a median age of 19. “It is your spark, your creativity and your determination that will drive the future.”“Imagine a future where every person is connected to the digital economy, where every young person trusts that their voices are heard, a future that is propelled by African innovation,” she said.___Long reported from Washington.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848893,Fiji allows Taiwan representative office to restore previous name,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After a five-year hiatus, Fiji has allowed Taiwan to use its official country name in the title of its representative office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday (March 28).In addition, the ministry said diplomatic privileges under Fiji's Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1971 would also be restored to the mission.In 2018, facing Chinese pressure, the government of the Pacific island nation forced the office to change its name from “Trade Mission of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the Republic of Fiji” to “Taipei Trade Office in Fiji,” the Liberty Times reported.After a change of government following elections late last year, the new cabinet expressed respect for Taiwan’s contributions to the development of fisheries, agriculture, education, healthcare, and personnel training, and decided to allow the return of the previous name for the representative office.The People's Alliance Party, the National Federation Party, and the Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) formed a coalition government with Sitiveni Rabuka from the People's Alliance serving as prime minister.After a discussion over the matter was held by a cabinet meeting, the Rabuka government decided to revoke the decision made by the previous administration under former Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and restore the name of the representative office and its diplomatic privileges.MOFA expressed approval and gratitude for Fiji’s decision, adding it would continue to deepen cooperation and protect the development of democracy in the Indo-Pacific region.Over the weekend, Honduras broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan after more than 80 years to recognize China, leaving Taipei with only 13 diplomatic allies, most of them small nations in the Caribbean and the Pacific.",2023/03/28,1638,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848964,"Taiwan not too close to US, but too far from China","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of Taiwanese anti-war scholars released a statement on March 20 that called on Taiwan to maintain “equidistant relationships” between China and the U.S., though one of Taiwan’s leading experts on diplomacy says the problem is not being too close to the U.S. but being too distant from China.
Director of National Chengchi University’s Department of Diplomacy Professor Yeh-chung Lu (盧業中) told Taiwan News that building closer relations with China does not mean asking for unification, but it would contribute to Taiwan's security.
Lu said, “We need to restore certain kinds of channels of communication, as the U.S. is doing right now. They are still maintaining the channels of communication with China, so the problem is not that we are too close to the states. The problem is we are too distant from China.""
Relations between China and Taiwan have worsened significantly in recent years and communications have reached a standstill. China has ramped up pressure on Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, causing nine to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing since 2016, with the loss of Honduras being the most recent in late March.










In a press conference announcing the anti-war statement, retired National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Professor Daiwei Fu (傅大為) said that China’s constant threats to Taiwan mostly originate from U.S. provocations. However, Lu believes Taiwan’s present relationship with the U.S. is “totally fine.” He said that Taiwan’s relationship with the U.S. enables Taiwan to secure itself from military threats that are directly related to Taiwan’s survival.
The anti-war scholars’ statement called for the Taiwan government to redirect military spending toward climate mitigation and social welfare policies, but Lu said “they are proposing an idea that is desirable but not feasible.”
“If we take the money from military equipment and put everything into climate change, maybe we are doing something very good for the following generations,” Lu said, ""but if we can not secure ourselves, our following generations may face more severe military challenges from China, that are directly related to our survival.""TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of Taiwanese anti-war scholars released a statement on March 20 that called on Taiwan to maintain “equidistant relationships” between China and the U.S., though one of Taiwan’s leading experts on diplomacy says the problem is not being too close to the U.S. but being too distant from China.Director of National Chengchi University’s Department of Diplomacy Professor Yeh-chung Lu (盧業中) told Taiwan News that building closer relations with China does not mean asking for unification, but it would contribute to Taiwan's security.Lu said, “We need to restore certain kinds of channels of communication, as the U.S. is doing right now.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848965,"Boan Biotech Announces 2022 Financial Results, Showing Accelerated Innovation and Strong 225% Revenue Growth","YANTAI, CHINA -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 - Boan Biotech (6955.HK) announced its 2022 financial results and recent business developments on March 27, 2023.   2022 business highlights         Record high in revenue: In 2022, Boan Biotech's revenue was approximately RMB 516 million, representing a strong growth of 225% from 2021, mainly attributable to the fast sales growth of Boyounuo® and the successful launch of Boyoubei® at the end of last year; its gross profit was approximately RMB 354 million, representing an even stronger growth of 233% from 2021, with a gross margin higher than that in 2021.           Fast progress in R&D: Boyoubei, the first denosumab biosimilar in the world developed by the company, was launched; 1 drug candidate entered the Biological License Application (BLA) stage, 2 saw significant progress with their Phase 3 clinical trials (including BA5101, the world's first dulaglutide biosimilar to enter Phase 3 clinical trials), and 5 innovative antibodies as drug candidates entered Phase 1 clinical trials.           A new journey in the capital market: Boan Biotech was listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) on December 30, 2022, and was included in the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect on March 13, 2023.      Eye-catching performance of two marketed products   Boan Biotech's first drug Boyounuo (bevacizumab injection, a biosimilar to Avastin®) is used for the treatment of multiple cancers. Sales grew rapidly immediately after it was launched in China in May 2021. Its first full-year sales were approximately RMB 515 million in 2022, which was a remarkable performance. Two new indications (ovarian cancer and cervical cancer) were also added for the drug last year, to further expand its patient base. Today, all the five indications of Boyounuo are on the 2022 National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL).   Boyoubei (denosumab injection, a biosimilar to Prolia®), the company's second product, was launched in China for the treatment of osteoporosis in November 2022. This is the world's first marketed denosumab biosimilar. In addition to China, the company is also developing the product in Europe and the U.S., with a plan to market it globally.   Thanks to the strong sales performance of Boyounuo and the company's well-established commercial capabilities, Boyoubei quickly achieved a number of business milestones in a shorter period of time after its approval. In December 2022, the drug was granted a code for reimbursement by the government's health insurance system. In January 2023, the company granted CP Qingdao, a subsidiary of Sino Biopharm, the exclusive right to commercialize Boyoubei in the Chinese mainland, to put the product on the fast track for commercial success.   A fast growing pipeline with multiple first movers   Boan Biotech is able to innovate efficiently, and all of its products are in-house developed. The company has three platforms for innovation: the Human Antibody Transgenic Mouse and Phage Display Platform, the Bispecific T-cell Engager Platform, and the Antibody-drug Conjugate (ADC) Platform. On these platforms, Boan Biotech has built a strong portfolio, which includes 2 commercial products, 7 investigational antibodies, and 4 biosimilar candidates. Since 2022, the company has made remarkable progress in the development of multiple investigational drugs.   3 biosimilar candidates to be commercialized: BA1102 (denosumab injection, a biosimilar to Xgeva®), the BLA of which has been accepted in China, and which is also being developed in Europe and the U.S.; and BA5101 (dulaglutide injection, a biosimilar to Trulicity®) and BA9101 (aflibercept intravitreous injection, a biosimilar to Eylea®), both of which are in Phase 3 clinical trials in China, with BA5101 being the world's first dulaglutide biosimilar to enter Phase 3 clinical trials.   5 innovative antibodies under Phase 1 clinical trials: BA1106, a non-IL-2 blocking anti-CD25 antibody, which is the first innovative anti-CD25 antibody for the treatment of solid tumors to enter the clinical trial stage in China; BA2101, an anti-IL-4Rα monoclonal antibody, which is the first long-acting anti-IL-4Rα antibody in the autoimmunity therapeutic area to enter the clinical trial stage in China; BA1105, an ADCC-enhanced anti-Claudin 18.2 antibody, which is expected to become the best-in-class targeted therapy for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, advanced gastric cancer, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction; BA1201, an anti-PD-L1/TGF-β bispecific antibody fusion protein; and BA1301, an injectable ADC targeting Claudin18.2.   Boan Biotech keeps a balance between ""the value of innovation"" and ""commercial visibility"". While striving to build a differentiated portfolio, it is also speeding up R&D to gain a first-mover advantage. Many of the above-mentioned drug candidates are ahead of competition in terms of development progress. They set a clear path for the company's commercialization efforts in the short term, and also lay a solid foundation for its long-term sustainable growth.   Strong commercial capabilities ensure successful new product launch   Boan Biotech is one of a few Chinese biopharmaceutical companies operating across the value chain of the industry from research and development to manufacturing and commercialization. The company's highly integrated and coordinated internal operation system enabled it to be able to ""produce blood"" on its own in a shorter period of time. Besides, the company also has strong commercial capabilities, which ensure the successful launch of its investigational drugs later on.   Boan Biotech has been reinforcing its commercial capabilities by leveraging its own professional marketing team and its strategic partners. On the one hand, the company has established an extensive distribution network covering more than 1,300 hospitals and other institutions nationwide. On the other hand, it is joining hands with strong industry partners such as AstraZeneca, CP Qingdao, and OcuMension and leveraging their resources to unleash the clinical value and market potential of its products. In addition, the company has subsidiaries in the U.S. and Singapore, and also has a growing international R&D team and business development team to support the rapid growth of its business.   Moreover, to further support commercialization, in 2022, Boan Biotech ramped up the effort to increase production capacity, and also embraced digital management and upgraded production processes in an effort to reduce cost and increase efficiency. Currently, the company has a total capacity of 8,000 liters for commercial production and 1,700 liters for pilot production. It is also building two 3*2,000-liter lines for commercial production and two 2*500-liter lines for pilot production.   Jiang Hua, Chairlady and Chief Executive Officer of Boan Biotech, said: ""It's very exciting and encouraging to see remarkable breakthroughs and accomplishments of our company in 2022 despite various challenges posed by COVID-19 and a changing industry landscape. Looking forward, we expect 2023 to be a banner year for the revenue growth of our commercial products and a transformative year for accelerating our pipeline of innovative antibodies. Next, we will further accelerate the clinical development of our key products around the world, expand our portfolio of innovative antibodies, beef up our manufacturing and commercial capabilities, and build partnerships, as we want to meet patient needs, reward our shareholders, and give back to communities with more high-quality innovations.""

J. Liu (劉永健) said at a press conference on Tuesday (March 28).
MOFA will provide them with a one-way flight back to Honduras to minimize the fallout from severed diplomatic relations, Liberty Times reported Liu as saying. As a free, democratic, and open society, Taiwan is more conducive to learning, while China is an authoritarian, closed society that does not allow freedom of speech, he said.
According to the Ministry of Education, there were 359 Honduran students studying at National Taiwan University during the 2022 academic year, including 220 degree students, 138 Mandarin language students, and one exchange student.
Among them, 104 had MOFA scholarships, the foreign ministry said. There are currently no Taiwanese students in Honduras.










Liu said Taiwan does not compete with China in dollar diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign aid model is project-oriented, with the purpose of benefiting local governments and people, he said.
Taiwan will continue to uphold its principles, fulfill its international responsibilities, and give back to the global community, the spokesperson said. He added that the 82-year-long friendship between Taiwan and Honduras was ruined due to China’s dollar diplomacy.
Liu said that freedom, democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights are the trend of the times. Any action that goes against this trend is doomed to end in failure, he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848975,Feel the Force: Hamill carries 'Star Wars' voice to Ukraine,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — “Attention. Air raid alert,” the voice says with a Jedi knight’s gravitas. “Proceed to the nearest shelter.”It's a surreal moment in an already surreal war: the grave but calming baritone of actor Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker of “Star Wars,” urging people to take cover whenever Russia unleashes another aerial bombardment on Ukraine.The intrusion of Hollywood science-fiction fantasy into the grim daily realities of war in Ukraine is a consequence of Hamill's decision to lend his famous voice to “Air Alert” — a downloadable app linked to Ukraine's air defense system. When air raid sirens start howling, the app also warns Ukrainians that Russian missiles, bombs and deadly exploding drones may be incoming.“Don’t be careless,"" Hamill’s voice advises. “Your overconfidence is your weakness.”The actor says he's admired — from afar, in California — how Ukraine has ""shown such resilience ... under such terrible circumstances."" Its fight against the Russian invasion, now in its second year, reminds him of the “Star Wars” saga, he says — of plucky rebels battling and ultimately defeating a vast, murderous empire. Voicing over the English-language version of the air-raid app and giving it his “Star Wars” touch was his way of helping out.“A fairy tale about good versus evil is resonant with what’s going on in Ukraine,” Hamill said in an interview with The Associated Press. “The Ukrainian people rallying to the cause and responding so heroically ... It’s impossible not to be inspired by how they’ve weathered this storm.""When the dangers from the skies pass, Hamill announces via the app that “the air alert is over."" He then signs off with an uplifting: ""May the Force be with you.”Hamill is also raising funds to buy reconnaissance drones for Ukrainian forces on the front lines. He autographed “Star Wars”-themed posters that are being raffled off.“Here I sit in the comfort of my own home when in Ukraine there are power outages and food shortages and people are really suffering,"" he said. “It motivates me to do as much as I can.”Although the app also has a Ukrainian-language setting, voiced by a woman, some Ukrainians prefer to have Hamill breaking the bad news that yet another Russian bombardment might be imminent.On the worst days, sirens and the app sound every few hours, day and night. Some turn out to be false alarms. But many others are real — and often deadly.Bohdan Zvonyk, a 24-year-old app user who lives in the repeatedly struck western city of Lviv, says he chose Hamill's voiceover rather than the Ukrainian setting because he is trying to improve his English. He's a “Star Wars” fan, too.“Besides,"" he said, “we could use a little bit of the power that Hamill wishes us.”After one alert, Zvonyk was riding a trolley bus when Hamill's voice rang out from his phone. He said the man in front “turned to me and said, smiling: ‘Oh, those damn Sith,'"" to describe Russian forces. The Sith are the malevolent enemies of the do-gooding Jedi.Olena Yeremina, a 38-year-old business manager in the capital, Kyiv, said Hamill's “May the Force be with you"" signoff at first made her laugh. Now its enduring humor gives her strength.“It’s a very cool phrase for this situation,” she said. “I wouldn’t say that I feel like a Ukrainian Jedi, but sometimes this phrase reminds me to straighten my shoulders and keep working.”Sometimes it can be wise to shut Hamill off. Yeremina forgot to do that on a trip outside Ukraine — to Berlin — and paid for the error when the alarm started shrieking at 6 a.m. and, again, when she rode the subway in the German capital. She wasn't alone. Another person in the subway car also had the app and it erupted, too. The two of them first cursed, but then “it made both me and that person smile,” Yeremina recalled.Ajax Systems, a Ukrainian security systems manufacturer that co-developed the app, hopes Hamill's star power will encourage people outside Ukraine to download it — so they get a taste of the angst heaped on Ukrainians by nerve-shredding alarms and airborne death and destruction.“With Mark's approach, it won’t be so terrifying,"" said Valentine Hrytsenko, the chief marketing officer at Ajax. “But they will understand somehow the context.”In the invasion's first year, air-raid alarms sounded more than 19,000 times across the country, so “of course people are getting tired,” he said. The app has been downloaded more than 14 million times. Hrytsenko is among those who use its English-language setting to hear Hamill’s voice.“For Star Wars fans, it sounds really fantastic,"" he said. “It’s kind of a Ukrainian mentality to find some humor even in the bad situation or to try to be positive.”Hamill is pleased that the sci-fi saga is again transporting people, even if just temporarily, to its galaxy far, far away.“It does inspire people,” he said. “Everyone flashes back to being 6 years old again. And if the movie can help people get through hard times, so much the better.”___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine and https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine-a-year-of-war",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4848993,The Role of Web3 in DeFi: Decentralizing Finance for a More Equitable Future,"The financial system has been centralized for centuries, with banks and other financial institutions holding the power and control over people’s money. However, with the advent of blockchain technology, we are witnessing a shift towards a decentralized financial system that is more transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone. This shift is being led by decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which are built on Web3 technology.In this blog, we will explore the role of Web3 in DeFi and how it is leading the charge toward a more equitable financial future.Web3 is the next evolution of the internet, which is being built on blockchain technology. The current version of the internet (Web2) is centralized and controlled by a few large corporations, who collect and control the data of users. Web3, on the other hand, is decentralized and gives users more control over their data.Web3 is a term that is used to describe the decentralized web, which is built on blockchain technology. It is designed to be more secure, private, and transparent than the current version of the internet. If you also want to adopt web3 technology for your business then a web3 development firm is here for you.The Role of Web3 in DeFiDecentralized finance (DeFi) is a subset of blockchain technology that is focused on creating a decentralized financial system. It uses smart contracts to create financial instruments that are transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone.Web3 plays a critical role in the development of DeFi applications. It provides a decentralized infrastructure for these applications to operate on. Web3 also provides the necessary tools and protocols for developers to build and deploy DeFi applications.One of the primary benefits of Web3 in DeFi is the increased transparency and security that it provides. Traditional financial systems are opaque, and people have little visibility into how their money is being used. With Web3, all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, which is an immutable ledger. This makes it much more difficult for bad actors to manipulate the system.Web3 also provides a level of accessibility that traditional financial systems cannot match. Anyone with an internet connection can participate in DeFi applications, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. This is a significant step towards creating a more equitable financial system.Web3 provides a variety of tools and protocols that are necessary for building and deploying DeFi applications. Some of the most important ones include:Smart contracts are self-executing contracts that are programmed to execute when certain conditions are met. They are used in DeFi applications to create financial instruments such as loans, derivatives, and insurance contracts.Decentralized exchanges are platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized intermediary. They are built on Web3 technology and are a key component of the DeFi ecosystem.Wallets are digital wallets that are used to store and manage cryptocurrencies. They are essential for participating in DeFi applications and are designed to be secure and easy to use.Oracles are services that provide external data to smart contracts. They are used in DeFi applications to provide data such as market prices and other relevant information.Web3 is the future of DeFi, and it will play an increasingly important role in the development of the DeFi ecosystem. As more people adopt blockchain technology and DeFi applications become more accessible, we will see a shift toward a more equitable financial system.The use cases for Web3 and DeFi are endless. From creating new financial instruments to providing access to financial services for the unbanked, WebIn conclusion, Web3 is leading the charge toward a more equitable financial future through its critical role in the development of DeFi applications. Web3 provides a decentralized infrastructure that is transparent, secure, and accessible to everyone. With its various tools and protocols, such as smart contracts, DEXs, wallets, and oracles, Web3 is enabling the creation of innovative financial instruments that were previously impossible in traditional financial systems.As more people adopt blockchain technology and DeFi applications become more accessible, we will see a shift towards a more equitable financial system, where everyone has access to the same financial services regardless of their location or socioeconomic status.

However, the groups called for the government to provide ample resources to help parents find appropriate parenting and communication methods.Liberty Times reported that Youth Rights and CRAT Chair Lin Yue-chin (林月琴) said during a press conference that over 60 countries in the world, including Japan and South Korea, have removed “punishment” from their laws. She praised the government for showing its concern for the issue and actively amending the Civic Code, adding that she hoped the move will help reduce child abuse in the name of parenting.Parent Participating Education Chair Min Po-ling (閔柏陵) was cited as saying that parents face stress in parenting when the social environment is not friendly towards children or demands that parents inflict punishment, as they are made to worry that they are being irresponsible. By amending the law and having the government raise awareness, the inappropriate culture can be corrected.Meanwhile, CWLF Spokesperson Lee Hung-wen (李宏文) was cited by UDN as saying parents should not worry about being stripped of their right to punish their children, because the government should provide guidance as well as social and educational support. He added that in addition to amending the law, the government should also set up supporting measures such as working with civil groups and local familial education centers to reinforce parental and positive education and providing diverse child care services.",2023/03/28,1367,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849006,Woodfibre LNG accelerates Canada’s pathway to net zero,"West coast project will be the first LNG export facility in the world to achieve net zero emissions
SQUAMISH, CANADA -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 - Woodfibre LNG is proud to announce its  Roadmap to Net Zero, a tangible plan to achieve net zero emissions by the time operations start in 2027, 23 years ahead of government regulation. This roadmap will see Woodfibre LNG be the first LNG export facility in the world to achieve net zero, and includes commitments to be net zero both through the construction stage of the Project and during operations. Woodfibre LNG is member of the Pacific Energy group of companies.   This fast-tracked timeline exceeds the federal requirement to be net zero by 2050, while providing benefits to local First Nations, British Columbians, and Canadians. The Project's net zero roadmap follows the B.C. Government's announcement of a new  Energy Action Framework, requiring proposed LNG facilities in or entering the environmental assessment process to develop and submit a credible plan to be net zero by 2030.   ""Woodfibre LNG's roadmap prioritizes emissions avoidance and reduction opportunities, and we are proud to have a credible strategy in place that will make us the world's first net zero facility,"" said Christine Kennedy, President of Woodfibre LNG. ""Alongside the leadership and vision set out by the Province's new  Energy Action Framework, achieving net zero allows Woodfibre LNG to advance the global energy transition, furthering economic reconciliation and contributing to British Columbia's standard of living.""   Woodfibre LNG is able to achieve net zero in part because of early stage decisions aligned with the Indigenous led environmental assessment process conducted by the Squamish Nation, which resulted in the Nation's own environmental assessment agreement related to the Project in 2015. Among these was the commitment for electric compressors using renewable hydroelectricity from BC Hydro, resulting in 14 times fewer emissions than a conventional LNG facility.   Woodfibre LNG was already designed to be the lowest carbon intensive LNG export facility in the world, with an annual emissions profile of 83,374 tonnes of CO2e annually, and a carbon intensity of 0.04 (tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent [CO2e] per tonne of LNG), below the Provincial benchmark of 0.16.   The company's net zero roadmap commits to implementing certain GHG reducing technologies, and outlines incremental opportunities to reduce emissions further as technologies develop and become more affordable.   As part of its net zero roadmap, Woodfibre LNG will also offset emissions during the construction phase of the Project. Woodfibre LNG has secured carbon credits from Cheakamus Community Forest, which is a nature-based carbon offset project in Whistler, where the Squamish Nation, Lil'Wat Nation and Resort Municipality of Whistler are partners. In addition, Woodfibre LNG has procured carbon credits from BigCoast Forest Climate Initiative for hard-to-abate emissions during operations. BigCoast Forest Climate Initiative is a nature-based, forest preservation project located in coastal British Columbia that has partnerships with over 25 First Nations.   Woodfibre LNG's robust strategy has been independently validated by a Canadian climate engineering firm, Brightspot Climate Inc.   Woodfibre LNG's net zero roadmap is consistent with  Canada's Methane Strategy and draft guidance for best-in-class GHG emissions performance by oil and gas projects. The roadmap is a living document that will be updated on an annual basis to integrate efficiency improvements, new technologies, and evolving industry practices to reflect the evolving net zero industrial and regulatory landscape.   ""Woodfibre LNG's announcement comes at a time when global trading partners, such as Japan, are calling on the Government of Canada to provide a reliable, sustainable source of LNG to support global energy demands. The Woodfibre LNG Project has a critical role to play in demonstrating that British Columbia and its diversified portfolio of energy offerings can contribute to a low carbon future, both at home and abroad"", said Ratnesh Bedi, President of Pacific Energy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849026,North Korea unveils new nuclear warheads as US air carrier arrives in South,"North Korea unveiled new, smaller nuclear warheads and vowed to produce more weapons-grade nuclear material to expand the country's arsenal, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, as a U.S. aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea for military drills.KCNA released photos of the warheads, dubbed Hwasan-31s, as leader Kim Jong Un visited the Nuclear Weapons Institute, where he inspected new tactical nuclear weapons and technology for mounting warheads on ballistic missiles, as well as nuclear counterattack operation plans.Experts say the images could indicate progress in miniaturising warheads that are powerful yet small enough to mount on intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S.""It has something more powerful in a smaller space. That's worrisome,"" said Kune Y. Suh, professor emeritus of nuclear engineering at Seoul National University, comparing the new warheads to the 2016 version.Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korean naval officer who teaches at Kyungnam University, said the warheads were most likely designed for use with at least eight different delivery platforms listed in posters on the wall, including missiles and submarines.""Those are not limited to tactical missiles but appear to be a miniaturised, lightweight and standardised warhead that can mount on various vehicles,"" he said.""Now that the delivery vehicles are nearly ready, they would churn out warheads to secure second strike capabilities - perhaps hundreds, not dozens - while running centrifuges even harder to get weapons-grade nuclear material,"" he addedKim Jong Un ordered the production of weapons-grade materials in a ""far-sighted way"" to boost its nuclear arsenal ""exponentially"" and produce powerful weapons, KCNA said.He said the enemy of the country's nuclear forces is not a specific state or group but ""war and nuclear disaster themselves,"" and the policy of expanding the arsenal is solely aimed at defending the country, and regional peace and stability.Kim was also briefed on an IT-based integrated nuclear weapon management system called Haekbangashoe, which means ""nuclear trigger"", whose accuracy, reliability and security were verified during recent drills simulating a nuclear counterattack, KCNA said.North Korea has been ramping up tensions, firing short-range ballistic missiles on Monday and conducting a nuclear counterattack simulation last week against the U.S. and South Korea, which it accused of rehearsing an invasion with their military exercises.North Korea's military simulated a nuclear airburst with two tactical ballistic missiles equipped with mock warheads during Monday's training, while testing a nuclear-capable underwater attack drone again on March 25-27, KCNA said in separate dispatches.The underwater drone, called Haeil-1, reached a target in the waters off the northeast coast after cruising along a ""jagged and oval"" 600km (373-mile) course for more than 41 hours, it said.South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said North Korea does not deserve ""a single penny"" of economic aid while pushing for nuclear development, his spokesman said.A South Korean military spokesman said that additional tests and analysis would be needed to verify whether the North's new warheads are deployable, but that its report on the underwater drone was most likely ""exaggerated and fabricated.""U.S. AIR CARRIERAlso on Tuesday, a U.S. carrier strike group led by the USS Nimitz docked at the Busan naval base in South Korea after conducting joint maritime drills. It was the carrier's first visit in nearly six years and coincides with the 70th anniversary of the two countries' alliance.Rear Admiral Kim Ji-hoon of the South Korean navy said joint exercises were intended to improve U.S. extended deterrence - the military capability, especially nuclear forces, to deter attacks on its allies - given the North's evolving threats.The strike group commander, Rear Admiral Christopher Sweeney, said his ships were prepared for any contingency.""We don't seek conflicts with the DPRK. We seek peace and security. We're not going to be coerced, we're not going to be bullied and we're not going anywhere,"" he told reporters.DPRK is an abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.Pyongyang has accused the allies of stoking tensions and using exercises to rehearse an invasion.A commentary in the Rodong Sinmun, the North's ruling party media outlet, said the drills, especially those involving the aircraft carrier, amount to ""an open declaration of war"" and preparations for a ""preemptive attack"" against North Korea.""The frantic war drills in the puppet region are not just military drills but nuclear war drills for a preemptive strike ... pursuant to the U.S. political and military option to escalate confrontation with the DPRK and finally lead to a war,"" it said.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in Seoul and Dae-woung Kim in Busan; Editing by Tom Hogue, Stephen Coates and Gerry Doyle)",2023/03/28,295,World

It is a type of cyanobacteria, which is a family of single-celled microbes that are often referred to as blue-green algae. Spirulina has a high protein and vitamin content, which makes it an excellent dietary supplement. Currently, Spirulina can be found in health food stores and is sold mainly as a dietary supplement in the form of health drinks or tablets. It is also an edible microalga and a highly nutritious potential feed resource for many agriculturally important animal species.The Russia-Ukraine War that began in February 2022 has had significant global impacts on various industries. One of the most visible impacts has been the imposition of strict travel restrictions over Ukrainian airspace. These restrictions have affected not only airlines but also other industries that rely on air transportation, such as tourism, international trade, and logistics.

There are two options for the material of wheels, steel or aluminum, commonly called alloy in the automotive industry. Steel wheels are usually pressed from sheet metal and then welded together. They are still found on many cars since they are inexpensive, durable and flexible.The Russia-Ukraine War that began in February 2022 has had significant global impacts on various industries. One of the most visible impacts has been the imposition of strict travel restrictions over Ukrainian airspace. These restrictions have affected not only airlines but also other industries that rely on air transportation, such as tourism, international trade, and logistics. The market in 2022 has also been damaged by the war. The conflict has led to a decrease in consumer and investor confidence, as well as disruptions in supply chains and logistics. The effects have been felt across many industries, including energy, manufacturing, and agriculture.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=aa2330The war has also had significant geopolitical implications. It has raised defense spending in many countries and strengthened the armed forces of NATO nations. European nations, in particular, have increased their defense budgets in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For example, Germany earmarked USD 109 billion, which is more than the whole cost of its military in 2021, in order to increase its defense spending above 2% of GDP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849062,Afghanistan: Prominent girls' education advocate arrested,"Matiullah Wesa, a prominent advocate for the education of women in Afghanistan, was detained by Taliban authorities in Kabul this week, the United Nations Mission to Afghanistan (UNAMA) said on Tuesday.""Matiullah had finished his prayers and came out of the mosque when he was stopped by some men in two vehicles,"" said Wesa's brother to AFP.He added that when Wesa asked for the identity cards of the two men, ""they beat him and forcefully took him away.""The UNAMA released a statement demanding information on his whereabouts.""The UNAMA calls for the de facto authorities to clarify his whereabouts, the reasons for his arrest and to ensure his access to legal representation and contact with family,"" the statement said.The Taliban administration's information ministry and intelligence wing did not immediately respond or confirm his detention.Last year, the Taliban barred girls from attending secondary school, making Afghanistan one of the world's strictest countries when it comes to girls' education.The head of an organization called Pen Path has been a strong advocate for girls' education, especially in conservative rural areas.As the new school year began in Afghanistan last week, Wesa had tweeted that ""the damage that closure of schools causes is irreversible and undeniable""Wesa, who comes from the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, had said that many living in the countryside did not have any access to education.Pen Path held multiple meetings with tribal elders, helped authorities open schools and distributed books and constructed mobile libraries across the country.Wesa committed to his project even as the tenure of the previous Western-backed foreign government was in place.The Taliban have barred most girls from attending high school and banned women from universities.They cited ""problems"" for the move, including those around the female Islamic dress.Since then, officials have said that they would work to reopen schools but have not stated a time frame.While students and activists have protested the bans, their campaign to attend classes at schools has been unsuccessful so far.International pressure on the Taliban to allow girls to attend schools has also proved unsuccessful.Earlier this month, Ismail Mashal, an outspoken critic of the Taliban's ban on education for female students, was arrested by the Taliban authorities.ns/fb (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849063,North Korea: Kim Jong Un seeks expanding nuclear arsenal,"North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un called on his officials to focus ""on increasing nuclear arsenals exponentially,"" the state's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Tuesday.The leader ordered ramping up the production of ""weapon-grade nuclear material"" to build powerful bombs.In the last month, North Korea's weapon's testing and the US-South Korea military drills have intensified in a tit-for-tat cycle, further underscoring the rising tensions in the region.North Korean state media published on Tuesday images showing Kim talking to officials and inspecting a row of purported tactical nuclear warheads identified as the ""Hwasan-31,"" which means ""volcano"" in Korean.A poster on the wall had graphics that implied that the new, smaller  warhead could fit on some of North Korea's short-range ballistic systems and missiles.Kim Jong Un said that the country has ""flawlessly"" prepared its nukes and that ""the enemy would fear us and dare not provoke our state sovereignty system and people,"" according to KCNA.North Korea's main nuclear complex in Yongbyon has facilities to produce both plutonium and enriched uranium, the two main bomb fuels used to build nuclear weapons.The country is believed to be operating at least one more covert uranium enrichment facility.A South Korean biennial defense document released in February said that North Korea is estimated to have 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium. Observers say that this is enough for 9-18 bombs.The South Korean document said North Korea has ""a considerable amount of highly enriched uranium as well.""Earlier this week, North Korea reportedly detonated mock warheads again,  fired two-short range ballistic missiles and tested a purported underwater drone.Despite experts expressing skepticism regarding the readiness of the underwater drone, its testing signals the country's commitment to spur the expansion of its nuclear arsenal.In 2022, North Korea launched a record of 70 missiles.ns/fb (AP, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849064,Amnesty International report: A year of war and protest,"""In 2022, more people worldwide were on the run than ever before. At the same time, millions took to the streets for their rights. People flee and protest because their lives are threatened, because they are oppressed, persecuted, and disenfranchised, and because their human rights are violated,"" said Markus N. Beeko, the secretary general of Amnesty International's branch in Germany.Beeko's figures are alarming: Amnesty International documented war crimes and crimes against humanity in 20 of the 156 countries surveyed, including some committed by Russian forces in Ukraine. In 62 countries, governments restricted freedom of assembly, association, and expression. And in 79 countries, activists were arbitrarily detained, many of them tortured and abused.But there are plenty of developments that give cause for hope, according to Beeko. ""The courage and perseverance of the people who are taking to the streets for freedom and justice, in Iran, Peru, Georgia and elsewhere, is impressive,"" he said.""It's also a positive development that states have taken in millions of refugees from Ukraine unbureaucratically,"" he added. ""Moreover, with investigations into human rights abuses in Syria, Myanmar, Ukraine, and Iran, the international community is showing that it wants to hold those responsible accountable.""Whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will ever have to answer to the International Criminal Court is open to question, but it appears that Russia's war against Ukraine would provide enough material for its own Amnesty International report.""Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, an act of aggression and a crime under international law,"" said Janine Uhlmannsiek, Europe and Central Asia desk officer at Amnesty International in Germany. ""Amnesty International investigators have documented numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces.""Uhlmannsiek lists among these the indiscriminate attacks on residential areas, hospitals, and schools by the Russian military and the use of indiscriminate weapons such as banned cluster munitions, which have caused thousands of civilian casualties. Amnesty said there have also been crimes such as torture, sexual violence, and unlawful killings, and the deportation of large numbers of civilians to Russian-occupied territories or to Russia.""In one case documented by Amnesty, an eleven-year-old boy was separated from his mother. We have also documented cases of unaccompanied children being taken from Mariupol to Donetsk,"" says Uhlmannsiek, referring to parallel policies in Russia: ""In the case of children who are either considered orphans or without parental care, the procedure to obtain Russian citizenship has been accelerated. This is to facilitate the adoption of children by Russian families.""All of this, she said, is a deliberate systematic policy, and part of a comprehensive attack on Ukrainian civilians. The same goes for the use of violence against women, and systematic rape, which is always a feature of armed conflicts.""We were able to talk to a woman who was raped several times by Russian soldiers. The war of aggression has a serious impact on women, girls and marginalized populations in Ukraine and puts their psychological, physical, sexual and reproductive health at risk quite enormously,"" said Uhlmannsiek.  ""At the same time, the war also increases the risk of gender-based violence and exacerbates the risk of exploitation.""The human rights situation in Russia itself, already dramatic before February 24, has worsened over the past year, Amnesty said. The government has been relentless in its crackdown on those who oppose the war or report on it independently. Amnesty International counted more than 100 criminal cases on charges of discrediting and at least 180 for knowingly disseminating allegedly false information.""They face heavy fines and up to 15 years in prison. Last year, in March 2022, new laws were rushed through that criminalized the discrediting of the Russian armed forces and the dissemination of alleged false information about the armed forces,"" says Uhlmannsiek. ""In its efforts to conceal the true extent of the destruction caused by the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian leadership is really cracking down on critical voices and on independent media.""As well as Russia's war on Ukraine, Amnesty International's annual report is focused on the human rights situation in Iran, particularly following the violent death of 22-year-old Kurdish woman Jina Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Amini was arrested for allegedly not wearing her headscarf correctly, and her subsequent death in custody sparked a wave of protests throughout the country that still continues.The mullahs' regime responded with brutal violence over the past few months. ""We saw another significant deterioration in 2022 in terms of the number of executions, torture and arbitrary arrests,"" Amnesty Middle East specialist in Germany Katja Müller-Fahlbusch told DW. ""At the same time, we have seen a unique awakening. The courage with which Iranians are fighting for their freedom and their human rights, against all odds and against all state violence, even after six months, is impressive.""Amnesty's report found that the Iranian regime has not shrunk from arresting, torturing and raping children and young people. According to Müller-Fahlbusch, this too is a systematic plan aimed at intimidating their families and preventing them from protesting in the streets. The death penalty and even public executions have also formed part of this strategy.""Between the arrests, the show trials, the death sentences, and the executions in four cases so far, it took only a few weeks at a breathtaking pace,"" said the Amnesty expert. ""There are no rule-of-law standards and no regulated procedure, it is solely a means to stir up fear.""Müller-Fahlbusch fears that this violent suppression will continue this year, arguing that state authorities in Iran have for decades only employed one means: That of violence and the systematic violation of human rights. But she predicts that the protests of a society that no longer allows itself to be divided will also continue, which is why the international community must show solidarity, she said.""In the case of Iran, publicity and public pressure provide protection,"" she said. ""Quiet diplomacy, for example in the case of imprisoned dual nationals, does not help. What helps is public pressure, because the publicity created makes the crimes of those in political power visible. And this in turn raises the price for the Islamic Republic of Iran in this very, very cynical game.""The human rights organization is also concerned about the situation in Myanmar, where the military seized power on February 1, 2021. Since then, Amnesty International has documented extensive human rights violations, including war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. The rulers used indiscriminate and targeted ground and air attacks against civilians, looting villages and burning them to the ground.Thousands are believed dead, 1.5 million displaced and 13,000 people still imprisoned in inhumane conditions. In addition, Amnesty has documented four executions, plus at least 100 death sentences. Unfair trials were as much a part of everyday life as the routine use of torture during detention, the report found.In East Africa, meanwhile, Amnesty International has welcomed the peace agreement between the Ethiopian and Tigrayan governments, though it is worried that the processing of war crimes does not play any role in the peace process and that the Ethiopian government may want to prevent it.Amnesty's research found that all parties to the conflict in northern Ethiopia have committed human rights violations, including war crimes, massacres, looting, and sexual violence. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in Tigray by air strikes by Ethiopian security forces and the Ethiopian government has blocked food aid to Tigray, possibly using hunger as a means of warfare.In response to all these abuses, Amnesty International has called on Berlin to condemn these offenses, to strengthen civil society and to advocate for the release of journalists and human rights defenders, as well as to demand that human rights violations be dealt with.This article was originally written in German.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849082,Shattered: Catholic community confronts its founder's lies,"ROCCA DI PAPA, Italy (AP) — The findings of an initial expert report were astonishing: One of the 20th century’s revered Catholic leaders, who built an international movement of community care for people with intellectual disabilities, perverted Catholic doctrine about Jesus and Mary to justify his own sexual compulsions and abuse women.The findings of a second report were even worse: The movement he created had at its core a secret, mystical-sexual “sect,” and was founded for the precise purpose of hiding the sect’s deviant activities from church authorities.The two rounds of revelations about Jean Vanier and the L’Arche federation he founded have rocked the group to its core, all the more because L'Arche itself commissioned independent scholars to investigate after receiving a first complaint from a victim a few years before Vanier died in 2019. It’s the latest case of a Catholic giant, considered a living saint by his admirers and eulogized as a “great” Christian by Pope Francis, falling to revelations that he abused his power to sexually exploit women under his spiritual sway.L’Arche’s national and regional leaders have been meeting for the past week in the hills outside Rome for the first time since the latest revelations to chart a path forward, now that their official history has been shown to be a lie and their hero-founder Vanier a narcissistic and delusional abuser. Emotions were still raw, as L’Arche’s most devoted staff processed the gravity of Vanier’s deceptions and what it means for the organization’s future, according to interviews at the retreat with The Associated Press.“I believed in something, in a vision that then is revealed to you and you’re told it’s not like that,” said Azucena Bustamante, who oversees five L’Arche communities in Honduras, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. “It does frustrate me — the damage it has caused to a lot of people who believed in this, and then found out everything we were made to believe, it’s a lie.”___Vanier, a former Canadian and Royal Navy officer, founded L’Arche in 1964 in northern France. He initially invited two intellectually disabled men to live with him, then built the utopian-style, Catholic-inspired community into an international movement bringing people with and without disabilities to live together in a spirit of mutual respect.Born to socially prominent, religiously devout parents — his father was governor general of Canada — Vanier arrived at his calling after having joined a spiritual community, L’Eau Vive, in 1950 that was founded by a French Dominican priest, the Rev. Thomas Philippe.According to the investigative reports, it was at L’Eau Vive that Vanier fell under Philippe’s spell and was initiated into the priest’s mystical-sexual practices.Philippe developed his twisted theology after experiencing what he called a mystical “grace” one night in 1938 in Rome, while looking at a fresco of the Madonna in the church atop the Spanish Steps. Over time, the “graces” came to involve sexual gratification with women that both Philippe and Vanier justified by claiming that Jesus and Mary were involved in similarly incestuous sexual relationships.The Vatican was informed of Philippe’s deviant practices by two victims in 1952; four years later it sanctioned Philippe for “false mysticism.” The Vatican forbade him from public or private ministry, ordered L’Eau Vive dissolved and its members forbidden from reconstituting the community.But Philippe, Vanier and the women they had manipulated disobeyed, and regularly met in secret, according to private correspondence and church archives only recently made available to the L’Arche-commissioned researchers.Over time, Philippe resumed his priestly ministry as his Dominican superiors ignored the Vatican sanctions, at which point Vanier, a layman, founded L’Arche. The study commission concluded in its January report that Vanier did so as a “screen” to hide the reuniting of the original L’Eau Vive group, even though there was also a sincere commitment to help people who otherwise would have been institutionalized.The study commission identified at least 25 women whom Vanier abused, none of them intellectually disabled. It determined that Vanier and Philippe’s deviant practices didn’t extend beyond the core “sect” at the original community in northern France. But it called for vigilance, especially in the way authority and power are exercised in L'Arche's more than 150 communities in 37 countries.L’Arche’s leaders have apologized to the victims, thanked them for their courage in coming forward, and assumed responsibility for not having spotted the abuses earlier. They say they questioned Vanier repeatedly as soon as the first victims came forward, as well as what he knew about Philippe’s 1956 Holy Office condemnation, but that he lied to them.The nearly 900-page forensic history of the scandal is remarkable, providing perhaps the best documented case of a phenomenon that has existed in the Catholic Church for centuries but is increasingly coming to the public fore: spiritual charlatans using false mysticism to manipulate their victims and abuse them sexually.Significantly, L’Arche was able to obtain a summary report of Phillipe’s 1956 canonical trial, which shows the Vatican was well-versed in the dynamics of abuse of power over women, decades before the #MeToo movement put it in the spotlight.But the researchers, who hailed from a variety of academic disciplines, blamed the Vatican’s secrecy in handling the Philippe case for laying the groundwork for L’Arche's scandal. They found that no one except a few Vatican and Dominican superiors knew of Philippe's deviance or his sanctions, “precisely what allowed him to maintain his reputation for holiness and to rewrite history as he pleased.”One of the Vatican's top experts in abuse prevention, the Rev. Hans Zollner, praised L'Arche for its “fearless” courage in exposing the painful truth about its past and said the phenomenon of spiritual gurus misusing their authority can't be ignored any longer by the church.“Some time back we did not speak about the abuse of power as the root cause of basically every type of abuse, be it sexual, be psychological, be it spiritual,"" he said. “But it has become clear that this is something that we need to engage further,” said Zollner, who runs an institute at the Pontifical Gregorian University that trains church personnel on preventing abuse.___The L’Arche community on Rome’s outskirts was buzzing with activity on a recent weekday: After nearly three years of pandemic lockdown, the ceramics studio had recently reopened, volunteers were helping some of the 19 live-in residents decorate Easter baskets and the gardening team was busy recycling wood chips.Here, where Pope Francis visited in 2016, the revelations of Vanier and L’Arche’s origins have hit longtime staffers hard, though there is no questioning of the fundamentals of the mission, said Loredana Moretti, a 35-year veteran of L'Arche's Il Chicco community and now on its leadership team.“For sure the investigation shocked all of us at the start,” said Moretti, adding that she now realizes Vanier epitomized a type of charismatic leader: ""extreme in the good and in the bad.”“What’s important is to not make a myth or idealize anyone, including our founder. If we made a myth out of him, we were wrong,” she said.Such soul-searching was the order of business at the L’Arche leadership retreat a short distance away. It was held in a converted monastery in the hills overlooking Lake Albano, within view of the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo across the lake.L’Arche leaders were tackling big issues. How to tell its foundational story, now that it wasn’t just about helping disabled people as Vanier claimed. How are power and authority exercised, given the risk that Vanier’s methods trickled down to the next generation. How does L’Arche move forward with its unique spirituality, given Vanier’s writings were found to be problematic once details of his secret life were uncovered.“As a whole body, the question we have is: Do we tell our story now? What does it look like? It's a broken story,"" said Stacy Cates-Carney, L’Arche’s vice international leader. She said the revelations had “shattered” L'Arche's understanding of its origins.Regular audits are now planned to ensure L’Arche’s safeguarding practices are being implemented. Reviews are under way to ensure staffers’ professional, personal and spiritual needs are being met appropriately. And for now, L’Arche staff are being given time to talk and process the revelations.“We’re in a stage of grief,” Cates-Carney said. “And in grief, people move through that really differently.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849107,Netanyahu suspends judicial overhaul after day of Israeli turmoil,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paused his signature plan to overhaul Israel's judiciary after a day of nationwide turmoil when workers joined a general strike against the proposal and hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets.The plans by his nationalist religious coalition to hand control over judicial appointments to the executive while giving parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings has ignited one of the biggest internal crises in Israeli history.Announcing his decision late on Monday to suspend the plans until parliament returns after the break for the Passover holiday and Independence Day next month, Netanyahu said the crisis required all sides to act responsibly.""Israeli society is on a dangerous collision course. We are in the midst of a crisis that is endangering the basic unity between us,"" he said in a prime time television address.As he made the address, huge crowds had gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, including a large counter-demonstration by right-wing supporters of the overhaul. Their presence prompted fears of possible violence between the two sides but the evening passed with no reports of major violence.While Netanyahu and his supporters say the plans would ensure a proper balance between the elected government and the judiciary and would not endanger individual and minority rights, they have drawn sustained and furious opposition.For months, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities to protest a project its critics say would destroy the checks and balances protecting Israeli democracy.Netanyahu, currently on trial on corruption charges which he denies, had previously promised the overhaul would not pose a threat to individual rights but had given no sign of giving way on any of its essentials.The decision to suspend the overhaul followed an extraordinary weekend in which Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was sacked after warning the divisions caused by the plans had affected the military and were threatening national security.His dismissal by Netanyahu led thousands to take to the streets and Israel's President Isaac Herzog to urge a halt.The Histadrut trade union organisation called a general strike that prompted flights from Ben Gurion airport to be suspended and businesses from banks to McDonald's fast-food restaurants to close.An early rally in Israel's shekel currency ILS= fizzled out after Netanyahu suspended the overhaul with its eventual fate uncertain.Coming at a time when Israel faces a prolonged security crisis in the occupied West Bank as well as rising tensions with Iran, Gallant's dismissal had appeared to many a sign that the government had set aside the national interest.While opposition parties gave a cautious welcome to Netanyahu's decision to suspend the overhaul to allow time to reach an agreement, many protesters remained mistrustful.""I will continue protesting until these reforms are completely dropped, because this isn't a set of reforms, this is a coup by the executive,"" Eitan Kahana, a 27-year-old demonstrator in Jerusalem said.Within his own coalition, there was also some unhappiness, with hardline Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declaring the decision to suspend the overhaul was a mistake but promising to accept the prime minister's decision.Arab broadcasters carried rolling coverage of the Israeli crisis with some Arabs saying they hoped it would lead to Netanyahu's political demise and others expressing hope of more far-reaching consequences for Israel.The United States welcomed Netanyahu's action.(Reporting by James Mackenzie; Editing by Howard Goller)",2023/03/28,144,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849130,Taiwanese diplomacy after Honduras,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — In the 1990s, a blueprint for Taiwanese diplomacy prioritized a “three pillars” approach: formal diplomatic relationships first, followed by Taiwan’s unofficial relationships, and lastly, participation in international organizations. However, according to National Chengchi University Department of Diplomacy Chair Professor Yeh-chung Lu (盧業中), the contemporary global environment is challenging this approach.Speaking to Taiwan News on Honduras’ recent decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China on Tuesday (March 28), Lu said the country’s local conditions conflict with the values of freedom, human rights, and democracy that Taiwan employs when seeking to improve its unofficial relationships with developed democracies like the U.S., Japan, and EU countries. He said this is also an issue for some of Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies, meaning challenges for Taiwan when working to improve relationships with its informal allies.“In other words, if we continue to put resources on the ‘second pillar,’ then our traditional diplomatic allies may feel betrayed,” he said. If Taiwan continues to commit support to formal diplomatic allies that are not democratized or committed to human rights, then how can Taiwan convince its informal diplomatic allies, ""especially advanced stable democracies, that we are going to contribute to the international community?” Lu asked.Is U.S. power in Central America waning?Despite commentators suggesting that U.S. weakness in the region was the reason for the switch, Lu believes the Honduran President Xiomara Castro, who has been in office since January 2022, played a central role. “I believe when president Castro was inaugurated she would have cut off the ties immediately, so I think the U.S. actually helped Taiwan to keep them longer, for at least a few months.”He said U.S. support ultimately failed to protect the Honduras-Taiwan relationship because of reported financial arrangements President Castro made for herself and her family with the Chinese government. “China, to my knowledge, has been in touch with Honduras’ political elites for a very long time, so I think President Castro is the key figure in the decision-making in Honduras on this issue,” he said.Tsai’s upcoming Central American tripDespite the switch outwardly appearing as something of a humiliation to the Taiwanese government, Lu said that Taiwan’s career diplomats deserve to be recognized for the way they handled the situation. He said he believes Taiwan’s diplomats in Honduras had known for some time about the possibility of a diplomatic switch, and that they used this knowledge to help the Presidential Office plan President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) upcoming Central American Trip beginning March 21.“I think this kind of information has been transmitted to the president's office in Taiwan,” Lu said, allowing the Office to avoid a face-to-face meeting between Tsai and Castro. “If both Presidents met and Taiwan made some commitment, but Honduras said they would cut off the ties by the end of the year anyway, that would be a huge setback to Taiwan.”Quality versus quantityPresident Tsai said on Sunday (March 26) that Taiwan refused to ""engage in a meaningless contest of dollar diplomacy with China,"" after Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) revealed that growing Honduran aid requests had resulted in the breaking of ties between the two countries, adding that Taiwan did not provide direct “cash assistance."" Paraguay, whose election in April threatens yet another diplomatic break for Taiwan reportedly also asked for massive aid increases to maintain ties with Taiwan, though Paraguayan officials have since denied this.According to Lu, these revelations are cause for considering what kinds of allies Taiwan wants to have, referencing the outgoing President of the Federated States of Micronesia’s (FSM) open letter to the country’s parliament calling for the switch of diplomatic relations to Taiwan from China. President Tsai and Minster Wu’s comments may mean “people will think that Taiwan is now focusing on real friends instead of the total number of allies, so people will consider if Micronesia really is one of them,” Lu said.Lu had heard talks about a possible diplomatic switch going back about two years, saying, ""some people on the Taiwan side already spoke about this but in terms of the size of the country, it’s very small, only the population of one district in New Taipei."" Despite its small size, if FSM did switch diplomatic recognition to Taiwan, it would still be a victory, Lu reasoned.The FSM President’s letter claimed that NT$1.5 billion (US$50 million), an additional US$15 million annually in healthcare, scholarships, and training programs “can, and will” be received by the FSM “if and when” the country switches diplomatic relations from China to Taiwan. Minister Wu confirmed to the legislature on March 10 that he had ""indeed contacted and exchanged views"" with the FSM President, but did not comment on alleged promises of aid.",2023/03/28,1844,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849143,Lawmakers back Paris Olympic law despite surveillance fears,"PARIS (AP) — A proposed French law for the 2024 Paris Olympics that critics contend will open the door for privacy-busting video surveillance technology in France and elsewhere in Europe passed an important hurdle on Tuesday with lawmakers overwhelmingly voting for it.The bill will legalize the temporary use of so-called intelligent surveillance systems to safeguard the Paris Games, which run next year from July 26-Aug. 11, and the Paralympics that follow. The systems combine cameras with artificial intelligence software to flag potential security concerns, such as abandoned packages or crowd surges. Human operators would decide whether action is needed.French authorities insist the surveillance wouldn't involve facial recognition. Supporters of the bill argue that the technology could help avert disasters like the deadly crowd crush that killed nearly 160 people during Halloween festivities in South Korea in October.“It’s not about recognizing ‘Mr. X’ in a crowd,” Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told National Assembly lawmakers last week when they were debating the measures. “It’s about recognizing situations.”The Senate overwhelmingly approved the draft in January, by 245 votes to 28. The National Assembly followed suit Tuesday with a 400-93 vote that the French government's sports minister, Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, hailed as “an essential step.”The draft is now slated for further fine-tuning by assembly members and senators before its final adoption, expected in April.Digital rights watchdog groups argue that France will violate international human rights law by becoming the first of the European Union’s 27 countries to legalize AI-powered surveillance, even if just temporarily. The bill says the technology can be used on an experimental basis to the end of 2024 to safeguard sporting and cultural events in France that are particularly at risk of being targeted by terror attacks.The technology’s use “risks permanently transforming France into a dystopian surveillance state” and “will lead to an all-out assault on the rights to privacy, protest, and freedom of assembly and expression,” said Mher Hakobyan, an Amnesty International adviser on AI regulation.“It has also been well-documented that hostile surveillance technologies are disproportionately used to target marginalized groups, including migrants and Black and brown people,” Hakobyan added.Even though the draft law says the cameras won't use facial recognition, they are still liable to scrutinize physical traits including people's postures, walks and gestures, critics contend. Opponents also are concerned that the technology risks zeroing-in on people who spend a lot of time in public spaces, such as the homeless. The bill also clears the way for the technology's use with cameras mounted on drones.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849145,Israel's Netanyahu may have tough time saving judicial plan,"JERUSALEM (AP) — As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put his contentious judicial overhaul plan on hold this week, he vowed to pass the package through parliament “one way or another.” But he may have a hard time keeping that promise.This week’s about-face has left him weakened and coming up against a wall of opposition he has never before faced in a three-decade political career.For nearly three months, hundreds of thousands of people have repeatedly taken to the streets week after week to demonstrate against the plan, crippling major highways and city streets as they accused him of pushing the country toward dictatorship.Influential business leaders and security men came out against him. The country’s main trade union declared a general strike. Perhaps most worrying for Israel, key military reservists, first and foremost Israeli fighter pilots, threatened to stop reporting for duty. Key international allies voiced concerns and objections.While Netanyahu has the support in parliament to push through the plan, the prospect of continued unrest along with economic, diplomatic and security damage proved too much for him to handle.“He understood that he’s in a dead end,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.Plesner said that Netanyahu’s pause this week did not mark a “domestic peace accord” between Israelis. “Rather it’s a cease-fire, perhaps for regrouping, reorganizing, reorienting and then potentially charging ahead.”As Netanyahu tries to regroup, those obstacles show no sign of disappearing. If anything, his opponents appear to have been emboldened by the success of their protests.“The protesters who take to the streets are not stupid,” the grassroots protest movement said Tuesday. “The government will not be able to pass the judicial coup because the millions of citizens who have protested until now, will not give up.”While other protest groups said they would suspend their activities, they also said they were ready to spring back into action if necessary.Much of Netanyahu’s predicament is rooted in his own legal woes. Since he was indicted on corruption charges in 2019, a string of former partners and allies have abandoned him, plunging the country into five rounds of elections in under four years.When Netanyahu finally was able to secure a parliamentary majority after the most recent vote last November, he required the support of ultra-Orthodox and ultranationalist parties to form the country’s most right-wing government in history.These partners have antagonized the United States and other Western allies, as well as Israel’s new Arab allies in the Gulf, by aggressively pushing for West Bank settlement construction and making controversial statements about the Palestinians. The nonstop crises have distracted Netanyahu from his traditional focus on security and diplomatic issues.Domestically, these partners have alienated large swaths of the Israeli public, primarily secular, middle-class taxpayers, with demands widely seen as religious coercion or infringing on the rights of LGBTQ people, Palestinian citizens and other minorities.Ultra-Orthodox partners, for instance, want to strengthen a system that grants them exemptions from compulsory military service in order to study religious texts. On Tuesday, Netanyahu's coalition pushed through a law allowing hospitals to bar the entry of bread into their facilities during the Passover holiday, when religious Jews do not eat leavened foods.But the government’s most controversial move so far has been the introduction of its judicial overhaul. Among its key components are proposals that would allow the ruling coalition to control the appointment of judges and give it the authority to strike down Supreme Court rulings it dislikes.Netanyahu’s conservative allies say the bill is needed to rein in a system of judges who are unelected and overly interventionist in political issues.But his opponents say the overhaul is a power grab that would weaken a system of checks and balances and concentrate authority in the hands of the prime minister and his extremist allies. They also say that Netanyahu has a conflict of interest in trying to reshape the nation’s legal system at a time when he is on trial.The protests have brought Israel’s largest cities to a standstill, disrupted Netanyahu’s overseas travel and even forced his wife to flee a Tel Aviv hair salon under heavy police protection.The public anger boiled over on Sunday after Netanyahu abruptly fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who had urged the prime minister to put the overhaul on hold, citing concerns about the damage to the military.Within an hour, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets across the country, blocking a major Tel Aviv highway and scuffling with police outside Netanyahu’s Jerusalem home.The unrest continued Monday when tens of thousands of people protested outside the parliament in Jerusalem, while the Histadrut labor union announced a general strike. It was the first time the union has taken such action over a political issue, causing flights to be canceled and closing offices across the nation.Then, Monday night, Netanyahu officially put his plan on hold until the summer session of parliament, which begins at the end of April. In the meantime, he said he would seek a “broad agreement.”“One way or another, we will enact a reform that will restore the balance between the authorities that has been lost,” he said.The general strike was quickly halted. Gallant remained on the job, and negotiations began Tuesday night between Netanyahu’s government and the political opposition. President Isaac Herzog's office, which is mediating the talks, said there was a “positive spirit” and meetings would continue Wednesday.But a deal remains elusive and Netanyahu remains weak. New opinion polls released late Monday showed a sharp drop in support for the embattled prime minister — even with his Likud party.A poll conducted for Channel 12 TV found that 58% of Likud voters opposed his firing of Gallant, compared to just 22% who favored it. Sixty percent of Likud voters supported the freeze of the overhaul plan, while 55% said Netanyahu’s performance as prime minister is “bad.” The poll surveyed 502 people and had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist with the Haaretz daily, said that Netanyahu will struggle to revive the plan. He said the coalition is now divided over the merits of continuing, while the grassroots opposition remains motivated by its successes.“The struggle for the future of Israeli democracy is far from over. There will be further rounds,"" he wrote. ""But the opposition has not just won this round by forcing Netanyahu to pause the legislation. They emerge stronger and more united than the coalition and fully prepared for that next round, whenever it arrives.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849146,Greek prime minister calls general election for May 21,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s center-right prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, called a May 21 general election Tuesday as his party’s long-standing lead in opinion polls has declined in the aftermath of the country’s worst train disaster.A Feb. 28 collision between a passenger train and a freight train in northern Greece left 57 people dead. The disaster stirred public anger, cutting the conservative New Democracy party's support by a half-point to 4 points over its left-wing main rival, Syriza, according to opinion polls.“The country and its citizens need clear skies … our work continues more boldly and with fewer compromises,” Mitsotakis said during a televised Cabinet meeting.Mitsotakis, 55, the son of the late former prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis, has remained popular throughout his four-year term, which was due to end in July.But more recently, his reputation has been dented by allegations of wiretapping by state security services, as well as the government’s failure to protect rail network safety.The election he called is not considered early because it is within six months of the end of his mandate. Greece is moving to a proportional representation system that is likely to result in six parties with seats in parliament.The recent slide in the polls for the prime minister's party has made a coalition government more likely. But Mitsotakis insisted that New Democracy was seeking outright victory. “Greek men and women, in the elections of May 21, will finally have a choice on whether the country will continue to seek and win the challenge of modernization,” he said. The left-wing Syriza party said it would seek political partnerships but has ruled out forming a coalition with the conservatives.“At Syriza, we will seek a government of cooperation, even if we have an outright victory. The country is facing huge challenges and needs the widest possible social consensus,” Alexis Charitsis, a spokesman for the opposition party, told private Antenna television.___Find more AP coverage of Europe at https://apnews.com/hub/europe",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849147,UN says Afghan girls' education activist arrested in Kabul,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — An Afghan rights activist who has campaigned for girls' education has been arrested in Kabul, the United Nations said on Tuesday.The U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Matiullah Wesa, founder and president of Pen Path — a local nongovernmental group that travels across Afghanistan with a mobile school and library — was arrested in the Afghan capital on Monday.Local reports said Taliban security forces detained Wesa after his return from a trip to Europe.The U.N. urged authorities in Kabul to clarify Wesa's whereabouts, reasons for his arrest and ensure his access to legal representation and contact with family. There was no immediate word from the Taliban on the arrest.Since their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban have imposed restrictions on women’s and minority rights. Girls are barred from school beyond the sixth grade and last year, the Taliban banned women from going to university.Wesa’s brother, Attaullah Wesa, said the Taliban forces surrounded their family’s house on Tuesday. They beat up the Wesas’ other two brothers, insulted their mother and confiscated the arrested activist’s mobile phone.Social media activists later created a hashtag to campaign for Wesa’s release. Many posts condemned his detention and demanded immediate freedom for the activist.Wesa has been outspoken in his demands for girls to have the right to go to school and learn, and has repeatedly called on the Taliban-led government to reverse its bans. His most recent tweets about female education coincided with the start of the new academic year in Afghanistan, with girls remaining shut out of classrooms and campuses.Wesa and others from the Pen Path launched a door-to-door campaign to promote girls’ education.“We have been volunteering for 14 years to reach people and convey the message for girls education, Wesa had said in recent posts. “During the past 18 months we campaigned house to house in order to eliminate illiteracy and to end all our miseries,” he added.The U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, said he was alarmed by Wesa's detention.“His safety is paramount & all his legal rights must be respected,” Bennett tweeted.Also Tuesday, Amnesty International raised the alarm about the deterioration of human rights in South Asian countries. In a new report released Tuesday the London-based watchdog also criticized the Taliban for imposing restrictions on women and minority rights since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.Peaceful protesters have faced arbitrary arrests, torture and enforced disappearance while journalists faced arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as torture and other ill-treatment for reporting that was critical of the Taliban, said Amnesty.“Women have been at the forefront of protests in the region, often challenging patriarchal control over their bodies, lives, choices and sexuality on behalf of the state, society and family,” said Yamini Mishra, the group's regional director.The failure of South Asian countries “to uphold gender justice leaves a terrible legacy of suppression, violence and stunted potential,” she added.Meanwhile, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing near the foreign ministry in Kabul the previous day, when six people were killed and about a dozen wounded. It was the second time this year that IS staged an attack near the ministry. In mid-January, the militant group killed five people there and wounded several others.The regional IS affiliate — known as the Islamic State in Khorasan Province — is a key rival of the Taliban and has frequently targeted Taliban officials and patrols, as well as members of Afghanistan’s Shiite minority.IS has increased its attacks in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849148,MLB free agent watch: Ohtani leads possible 2023-24 class,"CHICAGO (AP) — The number will follow Shohei Ohtani until it is over. No, not Ohtani's home runs or strikeouts or any of his magnificent numbers from the field. Nothing like that.It's all about how much. As in how much will his next contract be worth.Ohtani is among several players going into their final seasons before they are eligible for free agency. There is still time for signatures and press conferences before opening day, but history shows a new contract becomes less likely once the real games begin.There is no real precedent for placing a value on Ohtani's remarkable skills, especially after baseball's epic offseason spending spree. And that doesn't factor in the potential business opportunities that go along with the majors' only truly global star.Ohtani hit .273 with 34 homers and 95 RBIs last season in his fifth year with the Los Angeles Angels. The 2021 AL MVP also went 15-9 with a 2.33 ERA in 28 starts on the mound.He prepared for this season by leading Japan to the World Baseball Classic championship, striking out fellow Angels star Mike Trout for the final out in a 3-2 victory over the United States in the final.Ohtani, who turns 29 in July, could set multiple records with his next contract, likely in the neighborhood of a $45 million average annual value and quite possibly reaching $500 million in total.If the Angels drop out of contention in the rough-and-tumble AL West, Ohtani likely becomes the top name on the trade market this summer. If the Angels are in the mix for the playoffs, the pressure builds on the team to get something done before possibly losing Ohtani in free agency for nothing more than a compensatory draft pick.So yeah, definitely high stakes with Ohtani and the Angels.Here is a closer look at five more players eligible for free agency after this season:RHP AARON NOLA, PHILADELPHIA PHILLIESNola, who turns 30 in June, went 11-13 with a 3.25 ERA in 32 starts for Philadelphia last year. He also had a career-best 235 strikeouts in 205 innings for the NL champions.Nola was selected by the Phillies with the seventh overall pick in the 2014 amateur draft. There were extension talks during spring training, but it didn't work out.“We are very open-minded to trying to sign him at the end of the season,” President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski said. “We're hopeful that he'll remain a Phillie for a long time.”3B MATT CHAPMAN, TORONTO BLUE JAYSChapman hit 36 homers and drove in 91 runs for Oakland in 2019. He hasn't been able to duplicate that production, but the three-time Gold Glover finished with 27 homers and 76 RBIs in 155 games last year in his first season with Toronto.Chapman turns 30 on April 28. Long one of the game's top fielding third basemen, he is represented by Scott Boras, who generally takes his clients to free agency.OF TEOSCAR HERNÁNDEZ, SEATTLE MARINERSHernández was acquired in a November trade with Toronto. He hit .267 with 25 homers and 77 RBIs in his final year with the Blue Jays. He was terrific in 2021, batting .296 with 32 homers, 116 RBIs and a .870 OPS.The change of scenery could help the 30-year-old Hernández set himself up for a big payday. He is a .357 hitter with three homers and seven RBIs in 16 games at Seattle's T-Mobile Park.OF IAN HAPP, CHICAGO CUBSThe switch-hitting Happ is coming off perhaps his best big league season, setting career highs with a .271 batting average, 72 RBIs and 42 doubles in 158 games. He also won his first Gold Glove and made the NL All-Star team for the first time.Chicago had struggled to re-sign its own players in recent years, but it agreed to a $35 million, three-year contract with infielder Nico Hoerner on Monday. The 28-year-old Happ, a first-round pick in the 2015 amateur draft, is on the executive subcommittee for the players' union.LHP JULIO URÍAS, LOS ANGELES DODGERSUrías, who turns 27 in August, likely will have plenty of suitors if he reaches free agency. He went 17-7 with an NL-low 2.16 ERA in 31 starts for the NL West champions in 2022, finishing third in NL Cy Young Award balloting. That's after he went 20-3 with a 2.96 ERA in the previous season.Urías also is a Boras client, but the Dodgers have one of the majors' biggest payrolls. Los Angeles also could make a run at Ohtani, which could factor into its discussions with Urías' camp.___Follow Jay Cohen at https://twitter.com/jcohenap___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849149,French police counter protest violence; garbage strike ends,"PARIS (AP) — Bolstered French police forces clashed with demonstrators in numerous cities Tuesday as hundred of thousands of marchers protested President Emmanuel Macron's unpopular retirement reform.Security was ramped up for the 10th round of protest marches since January after the government warned that some demonstrators intended “to destroy, to injure and to kill.""The Interior Ministry put the number of demonstrators nationwide at 740,000, down from more than 1 million five days ago when protesters voiced their rage at Macron's order to ram the bill raising France’s legal retirement age from 62 to 64 through parliament without a vote. The Paris police counted 93,000 in Paris compared with 119,000 last Thursday, when violence reached a peak.In a bid to keep up pressure on the government to simply withdraw its retirement measure, unions organizing the protests called for new strikes and marches on April 6.In a sign that protests may be losing a little steam, sanitation workers in Paris announced that they are suspending their more than three-week-long strike that has left piles of stinking garbage uncollected on the capital’s streets. Growing piles of rotting garbage in the French capital became a symbol of the larger protests.The CGT union, which organized the strikes, said in a statement that workers will return to their jobs Wednesday. It was unclear whether private companies responsible for keeping some Paris districts clean will return to work.Concerns that violence could mar the demonstrations prompted what Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin described as an unprecedented deployment of 13,000 officers, nearly half of them concentrated in the French capital.A group of security forces in Paris at one point withdrew behind the wooden doors of a residential building during hours-long standoffs against ultra-leftist militants attacking with various projectiles and fireworks. A fire raged outside the door.After months of upheaval, an exit from the firestorm of protest triggered by Macron 's changes to France's retirement system looked as far away as ever. Despite fresh union pleas that the government pause its hotly contested push to raise France's legal retirement age, Macron seemingly remained wedded to it.His order to use a special constitutional power to ram the reform past legislators without allowing them a vote galvanized the protest movement.The Eiffel Tower's website announced that strikers had closed down the world-famous tourist attraction. The Louvre Museum was similarly strike-bound Monday.“I'm protesting because this reform is deeply unfair to workers, women, and young people,"" said Camille Sabatier, 19, a political science student at the Sorbonne.“It’s no longer acceptable that a powerful man could force such a bill without a vote by parliament,” she said.“Everybody is getting madder,” said Clément Saild, a train passenger at Paris' Gare de Lyon railway station, where tracks were temporarily invaded and blocked Tuesday by protesting workers. He said he supports the strikes despite their impact on transportation and other services.“I am 26, and I wonder if I will ever retire,” he said.Macron's argues that France's pension system will dive into deficit without reform, because of the lower birth rates and longer life expectancy in many richer nations. Macron's opponents say additional funding for pensions could come from other sources, without having to make workers retire later.Demonstrations got underway peacefully Tuesday morning, with large crowds in multiple cities. But tensions rose as marches concluded in Paris, Lyon, Nantes, Bordeaux and elsewhere.Police were hit with objects and responded with tear gas to disperse demonstrators in the western city of Nantes. In the center of Lyon, in the southeast, there were numerous confrontations between demonstrators and police as the protest wound down.The interior minister had said more than 1,000 “radical"" troublemakers, some from overseas, could latch on to marches in Paris and other cities.“They come to destroy, to injure and to kill police officers and gendarmes. Their goals have nothing to do with the pension reform. Their goals are to destabilize our republican institutions and bring blood and fire down on France,"" the minister said Monday.Some protesters, human rights campaigners and Macron's political opponents allege that police officers have used excessive force against demonstrators. A police oversight body is investigating multiple claims of wrongdoing by officers.The striking railway workers outside Gare de Lyon marched behind a banner that alleged: ""The police mutilates. We don't forgive!”Lucie Henry, a 36-year-old protester, said that by skirting parliament to impose his reform, Macron “has set everyone on fire.”“What adds fuel to the fire is the behavior of the government, the police violence in particular,” she said.Macron's opponents are urging him to cool tempers by backing down. Union leader Laurent Berger appealed Tuesday for a pause in implementing the retirement reform and for mediation.“If we want to avoid tensions — and I want to avoid them —- what the trade unions are proposing is a gesture to calm things down,” he said. ""It must be seized.”Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne reportedly offered to receive the eight unions organizing the protests. Berger, head of the moderate CFDT, said he agreed, French media reported. It was not clear whether other unions backed that stance.The latest round of protests prompted Macron to indefinitely postpone a planned state visit this week by King Charles III.Government spokesman Olivier Veran insisted, however, that France remains a welcoming place for all non-royal visitors.“Life goes on,” he said.___Elaine Ganley, Jade le Deley, Jeffrey Schaeffer, Helena Alves and Masha Macpherson contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World

Market Overview:
Many government digital cites initiatives have driven the rise in smart city adoption in multiple regions. Also, urban areas are increasingly requiring better management of natural resources. Smart cities are also growing because of increased security and public safety. This market is limited by security concerns and inadequate funding. The market will expand due to the growth of IoT and artificial intelligence in smart cities.










The study’s market numbers indicate the revenue from different types of solutions, such as smart mobility management and smart public safety, smart health, smart healthcare, smart building, intelligent utilities, smart security, and smart education.
• Smart cities are urban areas that make use of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, cloud storage, and big data analytics. They gather utilization data, analyze it, and then use the insights to effectively manage their resources, services, assets, and people. Smart cities are seeing growth due to the increasing government efforts to combat urbanization and overpopulation, as well as the need for better resource management for sustainable development.
• Smart cities and platforms are growing worldwide due to the increased use of the internet and the internet of things. In the next three years, it is anticipated that there will be more than 26 smart cities. The majority of these cities are located in North America and Europe. This will provide a significant boost to the adoption of AI and IoT sensors in smart cities.
• Public safety agencies, including law enforcement, and fire & emergency management, have always been early adopters and users of new technologies, from the first telegraphic fire alarms to radios or dash cams to radios and dash cameras. The development of artificial intelligence and smart device networks is making public safety technology an independent partner capable of taking action to keep the public safe.
• Every government that incorporates the smart city plan must be concerned about data security. This is because sensitive data can make it difficult for governments to protect their data. IoT platforms for smart cities have high adoption rates because of IoT demand. These platforms are increasingly being used in smart cities from many verticals, which has made them more vulnerable to data breaches.

                                                         Sleep Apnea Diagnostic Devices Market
Market Overview:
Sleep apnea can cause serious health problems such as stroke, hypertension, high blood pressure, and cardiomyopathy (enlargements of the muscle tissue in the heart). It can also lead to heart attack, heart failure, heart attack, heart disease, and diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to loud snoring, daytime tiredness and breathing problems that cannot be treated. Although sleep apnea is possible in anyone, it is more common in overweight older men. About 25% of men suffer from sleep apnea, and almost 10% of women. It can affect anyone of any age, even children. Patients with obstructive sleeping apnea have certain clinical characteristics and physical traits. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea have a large neck, excessive weight, and structural abnormalities that reduce the diameter of their upper airway. These include a narrow nasal passage, low-hanging soft palates, enlarged tonsils, and small jaws with an overbite. A blockage in the airway is usually caused by the soft tissue at the back of the throat collapsing during sleep. This diagnosis can be made with a sleep test such as an overnight polysomnogram (PSG), or a home sleep test, HST.










The rise in obesity, diabetes, hypertension, shift work, and stressful working environments are all contributing factors to the growth of the sleep-apnea diagnostics industry. The market’s growth is being held back by the high cost of sleep-apnea diagnostics, and the lack of awareness. During the forecast period, lucrative opportunities are expected to be found in untapped markets in developing countries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849174,"Former congressman says US needs clear, consistent messaging on Taiwan","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Washington needs to have a clear statement and consistent messaging on Taiwan, former U.S. Congressman Robert Pittenger said in Taipei on Monday (March 27).
Talking to Taiwan News, Pittenger said, “My interest in coming to Taiwan is to have a global forum to bring nations here from all over to be better informed, to be briefed by the experts from industry, from governments, (and) from think tanks. It’s called the Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum.”
Pittenger is currently the chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence-Security Forum (PI-SF), which has hosted 24 in-person forums with over 1,700 parliamentarians and government officials from 96 countries. PI-SF’s mission is to provide expertise and collaboration among members of parliament and government officials to increase American allies' understanding of global threats from adversarial nation-states, while providing actionable solutions to counter these threats.
“We want to have one here and bring hundreds of parliamentarians from around the world to Taiwan,” Pittenger said.










When asked in what ways Taiwan and the U.S. could boost security collaboration, the former congressman mentioned supply chains. He noted that if Taiwan were to be taken over by China, it would be considered a major security threat to the U.S., due to Washington’s reliance on Taiwan-made chips.
Pittenger then said America needs to have a clear statement on Taiwan. He noted that since Biden took office, the president has made several public statements in support of Taiwan, only to have them walked back by White House officials. The former congressman said Washington needs to have clear, consistent messaging on Taiwan “so you know who you’re counting on.”
While the Taiwanese have long been aware of the dangers posed by China, Pittenger said Americans are also increasingly cognizant of the threat. “The politicians are following the people. Politicians have an innate desire to get reelected, and they do read polls. And there are polls saying that China is not a friendly competitor, it is a major adversary. The American public gets it, which is why now, U.S. politicians get it,” he said.
Pittenger said the PI-SF Taipei event dates need to be finalized and that he would meet with Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游錫堃) on Monday night to plan. He would like to hold the forum in the fall, adding ""the sooner the better.""TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Washington needs to have a clear statement and consistent messaging on Taiwan, former U.S. Congressman Robert Pittenger said in Taipei on Monday (March 27).Talking to Taiwan News, Pittenger said, “My interest in coming to Taiwan is to have a global forum to bring nations here from all over to be better informed, to be briefed by the experts from industry, from governments, (and) from think tanks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849175,Kerry Logistics Network Maintains Growth in Revenue and Core Net Profit,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 - Kerry Logistics Network Limited ('Kerry Logistics Network' or together with its subsidiaries, the 'Group' or 'KLN Group'; Stock Code 0636.HK) today announced the Group's annual results for 2022.   Group's Financial Highlights          Revenue increased by 10% to HK$86,649 million (2021: HK$78,955 million*)         Core operating profit dropped by 12% to HK$4,790 million (2021: HK$5,441 million*)         Core net profit increased by 11% to HK$3,572 million (2021: HK$3,220 million*)         Profit attributable to the Shareholders was HK$3,579 million, which represents a growth of 8% (2021: HK$3,309 million*). Year-on-year drop is 55% if profit from discontinued operations in 2021 is also included         Integrated Logistics ('IL') business recorded a segment profit of HK$1,375 million (2021: HK$1,073 million*), which represents an increase of 28%         E-commerce and Express ('E&E') business recorded a segment loss of HK$826 million (2021: profit of HK$41 million)         International Freight Forwarding ('IFF') business recorded a segment profit of HK$4,703 million (2021: HK$4,825 million*), which represents a slight drop of 3%         Proposed final dividend of 38 HK cents per Share to be payable on or around Thursday, 8 June 2023     * Excluding discontinued operations   William MA, Group Managing Director of Kerry Logistics Network, said, ""2022 was a turbulent year. For the logistics industry, it was a pendulum swinging from one extreme to the other with severe supply-demand fluctuations. Inflation, rising interest rates, overstocking alongside consumers' shift in spending pattern and overcapacity, all led to a sharp drop in the global product demand and purchase orders in 2022 2H. Despite a tough 2022, KLN Group recorded a revenue of HK$86.6 billion and a core net profit of HK$3.6 billion in its continuing operations riding on its unparalleled network in Asia, diversified global service offerings and cross-selling synergies with S.F. Holding in various arenas.""   Integrated Logistics   The segment profit of the IL division recorded a 28% growth supported by the increase in demand for pandemic-related services in Hong Kong as well as the rebound of production activities in Asia. Following the subsequent reopening of the Mainland of China, the IL segment is expected to maintain its growth momentum in 2023 riding on a rebound in retail sales and household consumption.   E-commerce and Express   The E&E division registered a drastic decline in its segment profit due to the intense competition Kerry Express Thailand faced in 2022. A series of restructuring and lean programmes has been launched to improve profitability. The loss is expected to narrow in 2023.   International Freight Forwarding   The IFF division reported only a 3% drop in segment profit in 2022 despite an extremely volatile market. Asia exports plunged in 2022 2H as global demand for finished products and purchase orders started falling. Coupled with a swift increase in both ocean and air freight capacity, freight rates tumbled from unprecedented highs within a short period of time, putting the global freight forwarding sector under tremendous pressure. Extraordinary events and world affairs continued to reshape the global supply chains. Higher freight capacity and low cargo volume were spread across countries, posing increasing challenges to the freight forwarding industry. Nonetheless, the IFF business was able to maintain its profit margin at a similar level as the previous year and will continue to actively look for new business opportunities.   Integration With S.F. Holding   The business integration and development between KLN Group and S.F. Holding is progressing smoothly and successfully, strengthening KLN Group's IL, IFF and express service capabilities, particularly those within Asia. To enhance KLN Group's air freight capacity and last-mile delivery capabilities, KLN Group is expanding its own-controlled air freight network and seeking new business potentials with S.F. Airlines by developing new products, services and trade routes. KLN Group's cross-border express network in Southeast Asia has also gained ground. The synergies thus created are further increasing KLN Group's competitiveness and diversity of global solutions it offers across the region.   William Ma concluded, ""The global economy is poised to experience a deeper slowdown in 2023 with greater market volatility, uncertainties and risks for the year. While the road back to full recovery will be long and bumpy, Asia exports will rebound gradually in 2023 Q2 at the earliest, in an optimistic scenario. 2023 will be one of the most challenging years for the global logistics market in more than a decade. Considering that KLN Group achieved record results in 2022 1H, the Group expects a considerable disparity for 2023 in comparison. Looking ahead, the Group will continue to take an active part in the global supply chain reshuffling as the logistics landscape evolves, while adapting to shifting market conditions to serve its customers' ever-changing needs.""Hashtag: #KerryLogisticsNetwork

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849192,North Taiwan officials bow to baboon after botched capture,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Top Taoyuan Department of Agriculture officials on Tuesday (March 28) bowed at the body of the deceased baboon and apologized to the public for the firing of live ammunition at the animal and the posing of staff members for photos rather than tending to its urgent medical needs.Chen Kuan-i (陳冠義), director of the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture, told the media that during the process of tracking down the escaped baboon, some members of the department failed to protect the animal or respect its life by engaging in inappropriate behavior, reported CNA. Chen vowed that the department will conduct an in-depth review, including an investigation of himself, and those responsible will be assessed by the performance appraisal committee for appropriate penalties.He expressed regret, saying this was the last result he wanted to see. As for why the baboon was shot and how the hunter was allowed to carry live ammunition in Taoyuan City, Chen said that police will be asked to step up the investigation and on behalf of the department, he expressed regret and anger.In addition, regarding an incident in which Lu Chi-yeh (盧紀燁), a special committee member of the department, took photos of the baboon at the moment it was captured and said he wanted to show his daughter, Chen said that this behavior is not a standard operating procedure, was inappropriate, and should be reviewed.The olive baboon appeared in Taoyuan's Pingzhen District on March 10. Huang Chih-chieh (黃志杰), the borough chief of Zhenxing, led a team to capture the animal but failed.The Taoyuan Department of Agriculture started to track down the baboon on March 23, but the baboon was shot and killed in the Fugang area of Taoyuan's Yangmei District on Monday. That evening, a licensed hunter surnamed Lin (林) confessed to shooting the primate and the case remains under investigation.The body of the baboon was sent to the Taipei Zoo for examination at 9 a.m. on Tuesday. It was then packed in a plastic box and personnel from Taoyuan's Animal Protection Office disinfected the box and placed a funerary cloth and flowers on top.Officials formally bowed to the remains of the baboon, and it was then taken to a vehicle and transported to another location.The Department of Agriculture then held a press conference and the Director of the Animal Protection Office Wang Te-chi (王得吉) was cited by the news agency as saying that at about 2:50 p.m., he was notified the baboon was spotted going inside a house. Wang said that when animal control officers arrived outside the home, it was dark inside, and they were unable to locate the primate.When the animal control officers were stepping out to get a flashlight, they encountered Lin, who happened to have a flashlight, stepped inside, and shot the monkey.Wang said that in the past, animal control officers used traps and tranquilizer guns to capture animals. He said that officers were not aware that Lin was carrying live ammunition.Wang said that at first, everyone thought that the baboon fell to the ground after being hit with a tranquilizer dart. Generally, after being hit with a tranquilizer dart, officers usually wait for the animal to stabilize and confirm that it was immobilized, before taking photos for evidence collection.Wang said that it was not until the animal was placed in a vehicle that blood was seen. Since the cause of the bleeding was uncertain, it was transported to Leofoo Village Theme Park for examination and treatment, but it succumbed to its wounds.Wu Hsiu-chen (吳秀真), head of the Taoyuan Department of Agriculture's Forestry Department, said that after its death, the baboon was sent to the Taipei Zoo to undergo X-rays and DNA collection, according to the news agency. It was then sent to the Council of Agriculture National Institute for Animal Health to undergo an autopsy to determine the cause of death.Wu said the Taoyuan government had not appointed the hunter to assist in the search and capture efforts, nor was he authorized to open fire. Lin on Monday was questioned by officers at the Taoyuan Police Department's Yangmei Precinct and on Tuesday was transferred to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated for violating the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法).",2023/03/28,3352,Society

(""OncoVent""), a majority-controlled subsidiary of Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (the ""Company""), yesterday entered into a license agreement with Orient EuroPharma Co., Ltd. (""OEP"").
According to the terms of the agreement, OncoVent agreed to grant exclusive rights to OEP, which will be responsible for the commercialization of oregovomab, an immunotherapy drug candidate, in Taiwan, including related regulatory applications and necessary clinical trials. OncoVent is entitled to a number of payments from OEP under the license agreement, including a one-off non-refundable upfront payment upon the effective date of the license agreement, multiple regulatory milestone payments, and multiple commercial milestone payments, in a total transaction amount of up to US$11.2 million. OEP also agreed to purchase oregovomab from OncoVent at a price equal to an agreed percentage to the average sale price of oregovomab in Taiwan.
In addition, OncoVent granted OEP the right of first refusal for the exclusive sales, marketing, and distribution right in Hong Kong and Macau.










Oregovomab, a murine monoclonal antibody and a first-in-class anti-CA125 immunotherapy drug candidate, is currently being evaluated in a global Phase III trial using study drugs produced by Cytovance Biologics Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a leading contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) serving the biopharmaceutical industry.
Prior to this, a Phase II clinical study of oregovomab in combination with standard chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer was already completed. Results from the Phase II clinical trial showed that the safety and efficacy of the combination in patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer were in line with expectations, with the median progression-free-survival (PFS) of the oregovomab plus chemotherapy cohort significantly improved to 41.8 months, compared with 12.2 months with the chemotherapy-only regimen, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.46 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28, 0.77). It also showed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with an HR of 0.35 (95% Cl: 0.16, 0.76).
Ovarian cancer is ranked the eighth most common cancer in women globally and the first-line treatment for this disease has not changed for many years. Oregovomab has obtained Orphan Drug Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
The first patient in a Phase III clinical trial of oregovomab was dosed in the U.S. in 2020. This global pivotal trial is expected to enroll 602 patients from 190 clinical sites in 17 countries and regions. As of the date of the announcement, the Phase III clinical trial of oregovomab has enrolled 534 subjects globally, of which 21 subjects are from Taiwan.
Mr. Calvin Tsai, Chief Executive Officer of OEP, said, ""we have been actively expanding our oncology portfolio through R&D collaborations and in-licensing, in order to address unmet medical needs in a broad range of tumor types and bring renewed hope to cancer patients in the Asia Pacific region. Hepalink is a leading multinational biopharmaceutical company dual-listed in Hong Kong and mainland China. Its subsidiary, OncoVent, possesses a monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology platform and advanced biotechnologies for the development of oncotherapeutic vaccines and immuno-oncologic combination therapies. It is our pleasure to enter into this collaboration with Hepalink. We believe oregovomab can potentially improve the treatment outcomes for patients with advanced primary ovarian cancer. This collaboration with OncoVent not only strengthens our oncology portfolio, but also serves our overarching objective of advancing oncologic therapeutics.""
Ms. Tao Han, Chief Business Officer of Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. and Chief Executive Officer of OncoVent Co., Ltd, commented, ""having established itself in the oncology field for over 20 years, OEP is a multinational pharmaceutical company with integrated capabilities in R&D, manufacturing and commercialization, as well as a highly experienced team in the Asia Pacific region. We are glad to have entered into this strategic agreement with OEP as it will allow us to jointly develop and commercialize oregovomab, a candidate drug with promising therapeutic potential, and explore the drug's additional therapeutic utility for a broader population of cancer patients. Moving forward, Hepalink will continue to seek partnering opportunities to accelerate the expansion of its innovative drug business and develop a diverse range of commercial capabilities.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849203,U.S. backstops Silicon Valley Bank sale to First Citizens,"March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said on Monday they would backstop a deal for regional lender First Citizens BancShares FCNCA.O to acquire failed Silicon Valley Bank, triggering an estimated $20 billion hit to a government-run insurance fund.The deal comes after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 after depositors rushed to pull out their money in a bank run that also brought down Signature Bank SBNY.O and wiped out more than half the market value of several other U.S. regional lenders.The deal was ""momentous"" for First Citizens, CEO Frank Holding told investors on a conference call Monday. ""We believe this transaction is a great outcome for depositors.""The Raleigh, North Carolina-based lender has completed 21 such government-assisted deals, including 14 since 2009 when CEO Holding was made chairman, according to a Piper Sandler note on Monday.The FDIC fund does not take U.S. taxpayer money and is instead replenished by a levy on member banks.""The FDIC’s sale of SVB helps show business can go on as usual for the banking industry,"" a team of Wells Fargo analysts led by Mike Mayo said in a note on Monday.First Citizens will not pay cash upfront for the deal. Instead, it said it granted equity appreciation rights in its stock to the FDIC that could be worth up to $500 million -- a fraction of what Silicon Valley Bank was worth before it failed.The FDIC will be able to exercise these rights between March 27 and April 14. How much cash it receives will depend on the value of First Citizens' stock.First Citizens shares jumped 50%.First Citizens will assume Silicon Valley Bank's assets of $110 billion, deposits of $56 billion and loans of $72 billion as part of the deal.The FDIC said the $72-billion purchase of SVB's assets came at a discount of $16.5 billion.SVB Private, which the FDIC was trying last week to sell separately and that Citizens Financial Corp CFIN.PKhad expressed interest in, was acquired by First Citizens as well.First Citizens said SVB's Private wealth business ""is a natural fit for our high-touch and sophisticated level of high-net-worth customer service and approach.""LINE OF CREDITFirst Citizens will also receive a line of credit from the FDIC for contingent liquidity purposes and will have an agreement with the regulator to share some losses on commercial loans to protect it against potential credit losses.""First Citizens Bank’s acquisition of the SVB loan book and deposits does not add much to solve the number one issue that the U.S. banking system is now facing: deposits leaving smaller banks for larger banks or money market funds,"" said Redmond Wong, greater China market strategist at Saxo Markets.Based in Santa Clara, Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th biggest lender in the U.S. at the end of last year, with about $209 billion in assets.SVB's collapse triggered the worst banking crisis since 2008, pummelling banking stocks globally. Shares in European lenders fell sharply on Friday, led by Germany's Deutsche BankDBKGn.DE,raising concern among authorities about a potentialcredit crunch.Shares of U.S. banks - both large and mid-sized - climbed on Monday.VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESSSVB customers will continue to be able to access their accounts through websites, mobile apps and branches, First Citizens said. Employees in the acquired businesses will be retained, it added.The deal will accelerate First Citizens' expansion in California and give it wealth management capabilities in the northeast U.S., First Citizens said.""We are committed to building on and preserving the strong relationships that legacy SVB's global fund banking business has with private equity and venture capital firms,"" Holding said in a statement.First Citizens has around $109 billion in assets and total deposits of $89.4 billion. The combined company will have total assets of $219 billion and $145 billion of deposits, according to a First Citizens presentation.""The FDIC estimates the cost of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank to its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to be approximately $20 billion. The exact cost will be determined when the FDIC terminates the receivership,"" it said.That is on top of the $2.5 billion loss to the fund the FDIC incurred when it sold Signature Bank to New York Community Bancorp NYCB.N one week ago.The loss will be ""handled solely by the banking industry,"" bringing the fund to around a third below its statutory minimum, Wells Fargo analysts said.Approximately $90 billion in securities and other assets from SVB will remain in receivership for disposal, the regulator added.",2023/03/28,118,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849214,California farmers flood fields to boost groundwater basin,"A field that has long grown tomatoes, peppers and onions now looks like a wind-whipped ocean as farmer Don Cameron seeks to capture the runoff from a freakishly wet year in California to replenish the groundwater basin that is his only source to water his crops.Taking some tomatoes out of production for a year is an easy choice if it means boosting future water supplies for his farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) southwest of Fresno. He’s pumping 300 acre-feet a day — enough to supply hundreds of households for a year — from the gushing North Fork of the Kings River onto former vegetable fields and others dotted with pistachio trees, which can withstand heavy flooding.“We knew long-term if we didn’t have water, we’d be out of business,” Cameron said. “We’re doing our part to protect communities downstream, but we’re also putting the water in the ground.”The 70-year-old has spent more than a decade building and expanding a system to divert floodwaters from nearby rural communities and is a pioneer in the practice of on-farm recharge, or flooding agricultural lands during rainy periods to help restore the groundwater basin.But he isn't alone. Government agencies, water district officials and nonprofits are eyeing the practice as a way to weather swings in climate, especially as California muddles through a winter that has experts forecasting the Sierra Nevada snowpack could last for months.Groundwater supplies are essential to both farms and communities across the fertile Central Valley, a key source of food for the United States.That's even more the case during drought years, when groundwater accounts for up to 60% of the state’s water supply, compared with 40% in non-drought, said Wade Crowfoot, secretary of California’s Natural Resources Agency.But farmers have pumped ever deeper through years of drought, depleting what's left and leaving wells dry.Hoping to reverse that trend, valley water agencies have built basins to try to capture water in rainy years and allow it to seep back into the ground. Now many are hoping to enlist vast tracts of farmland for a similar purpose.Groundwater recharge projects are a “critical, important part of our infrastructure future,” Crowfoot said.The Tulare Irrigation District for example, has doubled the amount of water it can divert this year thanks to farmers who are willing to take it, said Daniel Mountjoy, director of resource stewardship at the nonprofit Sustainable Conservation, which supports expanding on-farm recharge.“Farmlands are the thing you can expand to when you have a freak year like this,” he said. “They are the solution.”The idea of using farmland to recharge groundwater has percolated for years. After California enacted a law in 2014 requiring regional agencies to manage their aquifers sustainably to avoid overpumping, more farmers faced with the prospect of fallowing fields began considering it.With the potential for flooding in small towns and rural communities this season, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order this month making it easier for farmers to divert floodwater to their fields.While some farmers like Cameron are ready to flood their fields now, many others aren't. Still, the rains and looming pumping limits have galvanized interest, said Wendy Rash, state water quality specialist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service.Last year her agency started a pilot program for 20 farmers, and more than two dozen in Fresno County alone recently were on a call about how to join the expanding effort in its second year. If successful, the program could be replicated in other Western states.The McMullin Area Groundwater Sustainability Agency, which operates in a portion of the Central Valley, has developed an on-farm recharge university to train farmers in the practice. One of them, Mark Pitman, said he has always used water sparingly but may eventually flood his orange grove, which is close to a proposed canal.“If you don't flood it, you may not be able to water your crop next year when it's rough,” Pitman said. “It's six of one, half dozen of another.”Some environmental groups support on-farm recharge but urge caution over concerns that pesticides or other contaminants could be flushed into a system that is also a drinking water source.The worry is ""you may cause a groundwater quality problem when you try to solve a groundwater supply problem,” said Michael Claiborne, directing attorney at Leadership Counsel, a nonprofit focused on valley communities.With such concerns in mind, Newsom's recent order makes dairy lands and fields where pesticides were recently applied ineligible. Also, farmers are required to report to the state when they divert water.It isn't immediately clear how farmers will be compensated, but some say they expect to receive a water credit in the future. Not all the water will come back to those who participate, but experts anticipate they will see a benefit and so will their neighbors.Some soil conditions and crops are better suited for recharge than others. Grapes, for example, can withstand large amounts of water, especially in cold temperatures, and so can pecan trees, said Philip Bachand, an environmental engineer who has worked with Cameron on recharge.In 2017, another wet year, Cameron tried flooding almonds, pistachios, walnuts and winegrapes and found they could survive so long as the water remained cold. He said it's hard to track where all the water went, but he measured a 40-foot (12-meter) increase in the water table beneath his flooded vineyard.Back then, Cameron said, he moved the water with a much smaller system that he has since expanded with help from a $5 million state grant to significantly boost his recharge capacity.“We have the location, we have the soils.” Cameron said. “And we have the will to do it.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849215,Biden: GOP policies would surrender tech economy to China,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — President Joe Biden said Tuesday that Republicans' ideas for cutting the budget could undermine U.S. manufacturing and help China dominate the world economy.Speaking at a semiconductor maker in North Carolina to highlight his own policies, Biden is trying to shape public sentiment as he faces off with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., about whether the federal government should raise its legal borrowing capacity.McCarthy sent a letter Tuesday saying that talks should start about possible spending cuts in return for the debt limit increase. Biden has said Republicans need to put forth their own budget plan before negotiations start. Without an agreement, the federal government could default on its financial obligations.The president tried to ratchet up pressure on Tuesday by saying that the GOP demands on the budget would only empower China, the country's key geopolitical rival. Being tough on China has been a core part of the identity of former President Donald Trump, who is seeking to return to the White House in 2024, and his Make America Great Again movement. The Democratic president said their objections to his policies would instead strengthen China.“It would mean ceding the future of innovation and technology to China,” Biden told the crowd. “I’ve got news for you and for MAGA Republicans in Congress: not on my watch. We’re not going to let them undo all the progress we made.”Biden's trip to Wolfspeed follows the Durham-based company announcing plans last September to build a $5 billion manufacturing facility in Chatham County that is expected to create 1,800 new jobs. Biden had won passage last July of a $280 billion legislative package known as the CHIPS Act, which was intended to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry and scientific research.It's nothing new for the Biden administration to highlight the CHIPS Act, the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, the $1 trillion infrastructure legislation and a roughly $375 billion climate bill — major legislation that the Democratic administration steered into law before Democrats lost control of the House.But now, just weeks after Biden unveiled his own budget — it includes $2.6 trillion in new spending — his administration is looking for chances to lean into its battle with Republicans over spending priorities and who has better ideas to steward the U.S. economy in the years to come. Republicans have rejected Biden's budget but have yet to unveil their own counteroffer to the Democrats' blueprint, which is built around tax increases on the wealthy and a vision statement of sorts for Biden’s yet-to-be-declared campaign for reelection in 2024.His trip is part of a larger effort to draw attention to his policies, which have been overshadowed by high inflation.Besides Biden's visit to Wolfspeed, Vice President Kamala Harris, first lady Jill Biden and other senior administration officials will fan out to 20 states over the next three weeks to highlight the impact of Biden's economic agenda, according to the White House.Biden has said he intends to run for a second term but has yet to formally launch his reelection campaign.His effort to highlight legislative victories could also give him an opportunity to present voters with images of an administration focused on governing as Trump braces for a possible indictment.Trump is being investigated over payments during his 2016 campaign to two women who alleged affairs or sexual encounters with him. The ex-president denies being involved with either of the women — porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal.Trump narrowly won North Carolina in 2020. Among the other states that Biden and administration officials will be visiting in the weeks ahead are Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin — crucial battlegrounds that Biden won in 2020 and states expected to be competitive again in 2024.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849216,China ambassador arrives in North Korea in sign of reopening,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Tuesday its new ambassador to North Korea has taken up his post, in a sign the North is reopening amid reports it has been suffering heavily from the COVID-19 pandemic and food shortages.Wang Yajun will help in the development of the traditional friendship between the “close neighbors sharing mountains and rivers,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing.China is North Korea’s main source of economic aid and political support, but interactions have been disrupted by travel restrictions imposed in an attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19.The ambassador’s posting comes as North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un urged his nuclear scientists to increase production of weapons-grade material to make bombs to put on the country's widening range of weapons.The report Tuesday followed a series of missile launches — seven this month alone — and rising threats to use the weapons against North Korea's enemies.North Korea’s weapons tests and U.S.-South Korea military exercises have intensified in recent months, increasing tensions in the region.China's support for both North Korea and Russia is seen as an act of defiance against the U.S.-led liberal world order, along with ensuring security along its borders. While China has agreed to United Nations sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear tests, it has repeatedly assured the Kim regime of support to prevent its collapse and the potential humanitarian, military and political consequences that might ensue.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849217,Former Taiwan leader begins mainland tour at historic tomb,"NANJING, China (AP) — Former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou began a 12-day tour of China with a symbolism-laden visit to the mausoleum where a founding figure revered in both China and Taiwan is entombed.Ma visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, the capital when Ma's Nationalist Party (Kuomingtang) ruled China in the early part of the 20th century. The party claimed to be the legitimate ruler of China for decades and is seen as more sympathetic to integration or unification with the mainland than the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.There, he paid tribute to Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China and the Nationalist Party, giving a short speech and then bowing in front of the memorial.“The people of both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the Chinese nation, are children of Yandi and the Yellow Emperor,” he told a group of Chinese and Taiwanese reporters who had been allowed to follow him on the trip, referring to mythical emperors revered as founders of China’s dominant Han ethnicity.Ma's tour of China comes as tensions between Taiwan and China rise, aggravated by an antagonistic U.S.-China relationship. Taiwan, where the Kuomingtang retreated after losing the civil war in China, is today a self-governed democracy and the U.S. is its largest unofficial ally. China, however claims the island as its own.Ma's tour comes a few days after Taiwan lost yet another diplomatic ally to China, which has spent the past seven years pressuring countries to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China.He has framed the trip as an effort to lower tensions by promoting exchanges, bringing Taiwanese college students with him on the visit, and has said he hopes that his trip could help lower tensions. Observers expect the visit to be more symbolic than substantive.“Both sides must pursue peace, otherwise, neither will have a future,” he said.Ma praised Sun, who advocated for a modern Chinese nation and the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. It was Sun who founded the Republic of China in 1912, and ruled over the mainland, very briefly. After the retreat to Taiwan, the Kuomingtang continued to call their nation the Republic of China. Meanwhile, the Communist Party took over the mainland in 1949, and renamed the country the People’s Republic of China.Outside the mausoleum, a crowd of curious onlookers and tourists gathered in the morning to see if they could catch a glimpse of the former President.Most of the regular tourists expecting to be able to see the mausoleum and the surrounding park found themselves blocked from entering, though a lucky few who had reserved in advance were allowed to enter the site.“Even though there are some difficulties on the official front, as long as there are benefits to the public and you can build a good foundation, then this will be good for the unification of both sides,” said Chen Shao'an, who had come to the mausoleum to see Ma.Ma is also visiting the China Modern History Museum, which is the site of the old Presidential Palace in Nanjing.—-Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan. Olivia Zhang in Nanjing contributed to this report.___This story has been corrected to show the name of Taiwan's ruling party is the Democratic Progressive Party, not the Democratic People’s Party.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849219,"US, Japan reach deal on vital minerals for EV batteries","TOKYO (AP) — Japan and the United States have reached an agreement on trade in critical minerals for electric vehicle batteries, part of an effort to ensure secure supplies of strategically important resources.The deal due to be signed later Tuesday is expected to help electric vehicles using metals processed in Japan qualify for tax incentives under President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The agreement was endorsed by Japan’s Cabinet on Tuesday.The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted in August, includes a tax credit of up to $7,500 that could be used to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle but requires such vehicles to have a portion of the critical minerals used in their batteries to be mined in or processed domestically or from countries with which the U.S. has free trade agreements. Japan and the U.S. have no such FTA.Japan and European countries had protested being excluded from joining the American Clean Vehicle Credit program under the law.The deal to be signed in Washington by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Japan's ambassador to the U.S., Koji Tomita, will grant Japan the same treatment as an FTA partner regarding such minerals, Japanese officials said.The agreement to not impose export duties on trade in lithium, cobalt, manganese, nickel and graphite —all strategically important minerals — is a boon for Japanese automakers and companies like Panasonic, one of the biggest battery makers.“As we expect a significant increase of demand for EV batteries going forward, securing critical minerals indispensable for their production is a pressing task,” Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.“The deal is aimed at establishing resilient supply chains through cooperation between Japan and the United States, as well as like-minded countries, by strengthening cooperation to secure sustainable and fair supply chains for those critical minerals,” he said.The U.S. government wants to ensure a stable, secure supply of lithium and other materials needed for EV batteries, heat pumps and large-capacity batteries for the electric grid. A majority of global lithium production comes from China, Australia, Argentina and Chile, while Russia dominates the global nickel market and the Democratic Republic of Congo is the world’s largest cobalt producer.“This announcement is proof of President Biden’s commitment to building resilient and secure supply chains,” U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement.Tai said the U.S. “would continue to work with our allies and partners to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals, including through the Inflation Reduction Act.”The Treasury Department is expected to release details about tax credits and adjustments to the law soon.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849220,Hundreds of fencers protest against letting Russians compete,"BERLIN (AP) — More than 300 fencers, including nine medalists from the last Olympics in Tokyo, signed an open letter published Tuesday urging the sport's governing body and the International Olympic Committee not to allow Russian fencers to compete while the war in Ukraine continues.The International Fencing Federation, known by its French acronym FIE, voted this month to allow fencers from Russia and its ally Belarus to return to international competitions as qualifying for next year's Olympics in Paris ramps up. They are set to compete as neutral athletes without national symbols like an anthem or flag.“The FIE is not fulfilling its duty of care for athletes, especially for Ukrainians. Your insufficient leadership in completely banning Russia and Belarus is being called out by athletes and civil society across the globe,” said the open letter signed by the fencers, organized by two advocacy groups, Athleten Deutschland and Global Athlete.“You have chosen Russian and Belarusian interests over the rights of athletes, notably Ukrainian athletes, and by doing so, you are failing to support the very people your organizations are meant to support.”The letter was published on the same day that the board of the IOC — whose president Thomas Bach was a gold medalist in fencing at the 1976 Montreal Olympics — was meeting to discuss setting new recommendations for sports bodies 16 months before the opening of the Paris Games.The IOC recommended excluding Russian and Belarusian athletes on security grounds last year following Russia's invasion but has recently sought to create a pathway for them to return to competition.Bach opened a board meeting with a defense of letting Russian and Belarusian athletes compete in international sport, saying that it “works.”“We see this almost every day in a number of sports,” Bach told media allowed to film his opening speech at IOC headquarters in Lausanne.Bach first cited cycling and tennis, though there was tension among fans in the stands at the Australian Open, and women players from Ukraine have regularly refused to shake hands or be photographed with opponents from Russia and Belarus.Fencers are the latest group to show support for Ukrainian athletes, who are almost universally opposed to the IOC's push for letting Russians return, while track and field's World Athletics governing body last week extended its exclusion while the war continues.The group who signed the open letter include Lee Kiefer of the U.S., the Olympic gold medalist in women's foil, French men's team foil gold medalist Erwann Le Péchoux and four-time Olympic medalist from Ukraine, Olga Kharlan.Billionaire Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov has been the FIE president since 2008, though he suspended himself from his duties on March 1, 2022, days after the invasion, after he was placed under European Union sanctions.The FIE's decision has already affected its competitions after the organizers of an upcoming event in Germany on the showpiece Grand Prix circuit refused to stage it.The event in May in the town of Tauberbischofsheim, where Bach grew up, would have been one of the first fencing competitions to include Russian and Belarusian athletes since the invasion.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849221,Prince Harry returns to court in tabloid phone hacking case,"LONDON (AP) — Prince Harry returned to a London court Tuesday for a second day of hearings to see if the phone hacking lawsuit he brought with Elton John and other celebrities can withstand a challenge from the publisher of The Daily Mail.The case is one of several brought by the Duke of Sussex in his battle with the press and alleges the publisher hired private investigators to illegally bug homes and cars and to record phone conversations.Associated Newspapers Ltd. denies the allegations and is seeking to throw out the case, arguing that the claims are too old and rely on information they turned over in confidentiality for a 2012 probe into media law breaking.Actresses Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, and John’s husband, David Furnish, are also parties to the case.The lawsuit alleges Associated Newspapers, which publishes The Daily Mail and The Mail On Sunday, commissioned the “breaking and entry into private property,” and engaged in other unlawful acts that invaded the privacy of the famous plaintiffs.Attorney David Sherborne, who represents the prince and others, said the intrusions were “habitual and widespread” and later “concealed or covered up.”Articles were falsely attributed to “friends,” a family source, palace sources, royal insider, or similar unnamed individuals to throw subjects “off the scent” of the true origin, Sherborne said.Among the allegations in court papers were that Associated Newspapers unlawfully obtained the birth certificate of John and Furnish’s child before they saw the document and illegally gleaned information on Harry’s previous relationship with Chelsy Davy, a jewelry designer from Zimbabwe.The publisher is also alleged to have hired a private investigator to hack Hurley’s phone, stuck a mini-microphone on a window outside her home and bugged ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant’s car to gather financial information, travel plans and medical information during her pregnancy.The case is to some extent a replay of a British phone-hacking scandal that was front page news a decade ago and eventually brought down another tabloid and ended with the conviction of the former spokesperson for then-Prime Minister David Cameron.The allegations date primarily from 1993 to 2011 but also stretch beyond 2018, Sherborne said.Associated Newspapers claims the information about the scandal was so widely known the subjects could have sued years ago.“It would be surprising indeed for any reasonably informed member of the public, let alone a figure in the public eye, to have been unaware of these matters,” attorney Adrian Beltrami said in writing.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849223,"A 'Clutch' tip helps Miller, Miami reach 1st Final Four","CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Jordan Miller took 20 shots in the regional final for Miami and made them all, helping the Hurricanes rally their way into the Final Four. The personification of clutch.Fitting.A guy named Clutch is why he’s at Miami, why Miller has become one of the stars of March Madness — and why the Hurricanes are one of the four men's teams lucky enough to head to Houston this weekend and see their season stretch into April.It was around this time two years ago when Miami then-assistant coach Bill Courtney’s phone rang with news that Miller had entered the transfer portal and was leaving George Mason. Courtney dove into some tape and began looking into Miller’s background. Turns out, one of Courtney’s old pickup-game buddies from Virginia — Clutch, real name Gary Collins — was Miller’s AAU coach.“The recruitment got pretty simple from there,” said Courtney, now the Hurricanes’ associate head coach.Good thing that recruitment went the way it did, because Miami has needed Miller this season — never more than it did on Sunday. Miller was 7 for 7 from the field and 13 for 13 from the foul line in Miami’s 88-81 win over Texas, a victory that sent the Hurricanes (29-7) into Saturday’s national semifinals against UConn (29-8). For the season, Miller is averaging 15.4 points and 6.1 rebounds per game, second-most for Miami in both categories.He helped the Hurricans get to the Elite Eight last season — and at least one step further this season.“That loss sat with me for a really, really long time,"" Miller said of the defeat to eventual national champion Kansas in last year's tournament. “I had to put it in the past because it was a new season, but having the opportunity to kind of right your wrongs almost and get past something that stumped you previously is a great feeling.”The 20-for-20 combined shooting effort from the field and the line against Texas matched Christian Laettner's historic game for Duke against Kentucky in a regional final in 1992. Laettner — who went 10 for 10 from both the field and the line in that game — tweeted congratulations to Miller on Monday; Miller responded with “Appreciate you! Glad to join some elite company.”There is rich irony in that Miller came to Miami from George Mason — as did Hurricanes coach Jim Larrañaga, who took that school to the Final Four in 2006 and got Miami to the Final Four on exactly the 17th anniversary of that win.“I just asked Jordan to ask the people at George Mason who know what kind of coach I am if he’d fit in my program,” Larrañaga said. “And a lot of them told him, ‘Yeah, you should go play for Coach L.’ I was so impressed with him as an individual. You know, the basketball ability is one thing but his personality, his work ethic, his basketball IQ made me feel like ‘OK, this kid will fit in really, really well.’ I had no idea he was this good.”The Hurricanes were even talking to other players — frankly, with better numbers — than Miller had when he entered the portal. Had it not been for Clutch, it's extremely likely that Miami would have gone in a different direction. And then who knows how this season would have turned out for Miller or the Hurricanes.“I don't know if anyone expected this,” Courtney said. “Clutch was the only one who told me he could be this.”Larrañaga doesn't think many people know how good Miller is. He calls the 6-foot-7, 195-pound wing “the most underrated player in the country.”That moniker might not hold up anymore, especially not after the show Miller put on on Sunday. The 27 points might be a breakout of sorts; it was the second-best scoring effort of his 141-game collegiate career, and by far the most points he's managed in a postseason game at either George Mason or Miami.Larrañaga essentially challenged Miller when last season ended to be this guy.“I sat down and talked to Jordan before this season began. I just said to him: ‘Your role is going to completely change. We’re going to expand it,’” Larrañaga said. “He asked me one question: ‘Hey, if I get a defensive rebound, can I push it in transition, dribble it up the court?’ I asked him one question: ‘Are you going to turn the ball over?’ And he said 'No.' I said, ‘Then you can do it.’”They chart everything in every practice at Miami, as is the case at many schools, and Larrañaga quickly became enthralled by the idea of Miller getting his way — grabbing a rebound like a big guy, then heading downcourt like a guard. For every turnover he had in scrimmages, he had seven assists. Such a ratio is absurd for point guards; for wings and combo players like Miller, it's unheard of. During the season, it's still a very respectable 2:1.“He’s underrated because he’s under been under the radar,” Larrañaga said. “People just haven’t seen him to understand how good he is. I think he showed the country how good he is these past two weeks.""Indeed, thanks to Clutch, he's been clutch. And Clutch is heading to Houston this weekend, to see if Miller and Miami can grab a national championship. The underrated kid might end up standing tallest of all.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849224,Analysis: This Hall of Fame class could be an all-time great,"The Springfield Symphony Hall lists a capacity of 2,611. This is going to be a problem when the basketball world heads to western Massachusetts on Aug. 12.Act surprised on Saturday when the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announces its class of enshrinees for 2023. Among the finalists: Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol, Dwyane Wade, Tony Parker and Gregg Popovich. It's widely assumed that they'll enter the Hall this summer, in what will be a most star-studded event.“We might need a stadium for that one,” Brooklyn coach Jacque Vaughn said.He’s not wrong. More than 2,611 people will want to go to this. Probably more than 261,111 people will want to go to this.It was never a question that the biggest names — the Nowitzki, Gasol, Wade, Parker group — would get into the Hall.The question was about Popovich. Not if. But when.The NBA’s all-time winningest coach, a five-time champion and the coach of the team that won Olympic gold at the Tokyo Games quietly rejected overtures from the Hall in the past. He wanted to see his best San Antonio players — Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili among them — go into the Hall first. He also wanted to see some coaches he respected most, like Rudy Tomjanovich, finally get the call first. Besides, it's not like people will look at Popovich with more reverence or respect after he gets his orange jacket from the Hall and officially gets to be introduced as a Hall of Famer.“It will mean more to us as former coaches, former players, than to him I think,” Vaughn said. “And that’s not a slight at all. I think what he will enjoy is seeing his former players there, and people who he has touched in a tremendous way, families he’s impacted for a long time because of his knowledge and his ability to share his knowledge and his ability to care for people.”More than 300 people have either played for or coached under Popovich in his time with the Spurs and USA Basketball. Nowitzki had more than 200 teammates. Gasol is beloved by teammates on two continents. The Miami Heat will probably send their entire staff up to see Wade give his speech. Add up the numbers, and we’re getting toward that magic 2,611 number really quickly. And that doesn’t even include, you know, the enshrinees’ families and friends, along with the other living Hall of Famers.“I know this much,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “I’ll be on a plane from wherever we are, and I’ll be there.""Spoelstra will be coaching with USA Basketball this summer under head coach Steve Kerr at the Basketball World Cup, which takes them to the Philippines in August and September following warm-up games in Las Vegas, Spain and Abu Dhabi. They’ll be in Las Vegas until a few days before the Hall enshrinement, then the American contingent will head to Spain for games against Spain and Slovenia. Can’t imagine they’ll be very well-attended, not with Gasol going into the Hall that same weekend, with Slovenia’s Luka Doncic probably going to pick being with Nowitzki over a pair of exhibitions, with Popovich set to be enshrined.The Hall will give the enshrinees a number of tickets. It won’t be enough for any of them. Popovich’s guest list will be impossible to pare down, especially his innermost circle of confidants, who remain there even after they leave the Spurs.Case in point: Utah coach Will Hardy. He left the Spurs to be an assistant in Boston under another former Spurs player and coach, Ime Udoka. But when Popovich was coaching the Olympic team, he picked some of the best and brightest to be alongside him, Kerr, Spoelstra, Mike Krzyzewski and others for the process of getting ready. Hardy made that list.“I’ve talked about imposter syndrome some this year — maybe never higher than those moments when you’re sitting in a room and it’s Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, Erik Spoelstra, Jerry Colangelo, Jay Wright, Lloyd Pierce, Ime Udoka, Coach K is in the room,” Hardy said. “And you’re going, ‘How am I sitting at this table right now?’ In a lot of ways it makes no sense. I felt like I was in the greatest basketball grad school class of all time. You almost can’t write fast enough in terms of taking notes and listening.""So many of the pairings will be fitting. The Popovich-Parker duo and Wade faced off twice in the NBA Finals. Popovich-Parker and Nowitzki had Texas-sized battles for years. Nowitzki and Wade played in the finals against one another twice, each winning a title on the other’s home floor. Gasol played against them all for years.They’re all beloved. Wade has teammates already planning their trips to Springfield. Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley doesn’t have his entire summer plan picked out yet, but he’s going to Springfield for Nowitzki — who he coached in Dallas.“The most wonderful thing about him is that being around him in public and going to events, I’ve never seen him turn people down or say no,” Mosley said of Nowitzki. “Whether he’s tired or doesn’t want to do it, he’s always going to go the extra mile to make sure those around him feel his appreciation for how much they’ve given to him. He might be one of the most humble Hall of Famers I’ve ever been around in that regard.”Mosley will have a seat for the big night. So will Hardy. So will Vaughn. How close they’ll be to the stage is anyone’s guess, but with this Hall class, there won’t be a bad seat in the house.___Tim Reynolds is a national basketball writer for The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849225,"Analysis: Ravens are Lamar Jackson's best, only option","PHOENIX (AP) — Lamar Jackson’s frustration over contract negotiations reached a boiling point when he announced Monday that he has requested a trade from the Baltimore Ravens.Staying in Baltimore might be his best and only option.""We made a decision to go with Lamar Jackson five years ago,” Ravens coach John Harbaugh said Monday at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix soon after reporters informed him that Jackson revealed he asked for a trade on March 2. “Why? Because we love him. We love the way he plays. We love his mindset. We love his charisma, his style. The way he is in the locker room. Everything about him, we love him. I love him personally. I love being the coach of the team he’s playing for. That’s what you do. You build a team around your players, and that’s what I’m excited to do.”If the two sides can’t agree on a long-term deal by July 17, Jackson could play this season on the $32.4 million franchise tag.The 2019 NFL MVP hasn’t generated any interest in free agency after the Ravens placed the nonexclusive franchise tag on him. Some teams immediately said they wouldn’t pursue Jackson. The Washington Commanders joined that list Monday.“There are a ton of talented players that could help us that we don’t end up talking to for various reasons, and Lamar falls into that category,” Commanders general manager Martin Mayhew said.NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith has suggested owners are colluding against Jackson.“I have never witnessed teams being so quick to publicly announce their lack of interest in an MVP quarterback, who is in his prime and who is also going to get an injury guarantee, regardless of his contract,” Smith wrote on the union’s website. “The fact that right behind Jackson await quarterbacks like Joe Burrow, Jalen Hurts and Justin Herbert, who have performed at extremely high levels under their rookie deals.“A fully guaranteed contact in Jackson’s instance means that all quarterbacks on expiring rookie contracts will (and should anyway) demand them in the next cycle. Make no mistake, what is occurring right now is their effort to block the same cycle that ushered in fully guaranteed contracts in other sports.”But Jackson’s situation is more complex.A team that signs him to an offer sheet would lose two first-round picks if Baltimore declined to match the deal. Jackson missed 10 games over the past two seasons because of injuries, so teams could view him as a risk and would prefer building around a young quarterback playing on a rookie contract.The major sticking point between Jackson and the Ravens is the guaranteed money.Jackson saw Deshaun Watson get a fully guaranteed $230 million, five-year deal from the Cleveland Browns last season and wants one, too.Jackson has a point. He’s accomplished more than Watson and doesn’t have the baggage. The Browns gave Watson that deal despite a looming suspension for sexual misconduct only after he said he wasn’t interested in playing for Cleveland.The Browns couldn’t have persuaded Watson to agree to a trade without promising a fully guaranteed contract, so the hapless franchise made a desperate decision.Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti publicly criticized the Browns for doing it and other owners quietly bemoaned the deal.“I don’t know that he should’ve been the first guy to get a fully guaranteed contract. To me, that’s something that is groundbreaking, and it’ll make negotiations harder with others,” Bisciotti said last year.No team has done it since.Russell Wilson and Kyler Murray signed lucrative contracts last season with partial guarantees. Derek Carr, Daniel Jones and Geno Smith are other QBs who signed big deals this offseason with partial guarantees.Kirk Cousins previously got a fully guaranteed deal from the Minnesota Vikings in 2018 but it was only worth $84 million over three years. The Ravens already offered Jackson far more. He said he turned down a $133 million, three-year contract that was fully guaranteed.Another factor is Jackson is acting as his own agent. That can be tricky in contract negotiations of this magnitude, though Harbaugh made a point to praise Jackson’s negotiating ability.This is one dispute where both parties have strong arguments. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849226,Stolen futures: Baltimore faces uptick in youth violence,"BALTIMORE (AP) — Decades after losing her older brother to gun violence, Michelle Hines tried everything to keep her teenage son safe: checking in regularly with his teachers, coordinating extracurricular activities, and most importantly, trying to prevent him from growing up too fast.Despite those efforts, Izaiah Carter was fatally shot earlier this month in a park adjacent to his Baltimore high school. He had recently turned 16.His death added to an alarming trend: more children and teens getting shot, even as gun violence overall trends downward in Baltimore. After several recent shootings of Baltimore high schoolers, including three teens killed within blocks of their schools, local leaders are ramping up efforts to reduce youth violence and increase student safety.Last week, officials announced an arrest in Izaiah’s case. Police provided few details about how they solved the killing, saying a motive hasn’t been identified.Hines said the arrest brings her some relief, but she wants to know more about how the shooting unfolded.“This has been one of my biggest fears. That’s why I put so many parameters in place to protect him,” she said in a phone interview Wednesday, the day after her son’s funeral. “It’s so messed up because I never thought I would be one of these stories on the news.”Hines said she was in close touch with many of Izaiah’s teachers at Patterson High School in east Baltimore. On March 6, the day he was killed, a teacher texted her saying he missed last period. A short time later, Hines received a call from the principal who told her about the shooting.“We talk about the prevalence of guns in our community and the ease of access. We talk about the willingness to use those guns — and now, yet again, we’re talking about young people using guns against other young people,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said at the scene. “It has to stop.”The suspected shooter, Roger Alexander Alvarado-Mendoza, 23, was arrested in Texas while trying to flee the country, according to police. Officials said he was not a student at Patterson.During Izaiah’s funeral service, several friends and loved ones — including fellow cadets in his Junior ROTC class — spoke about their loss. They described his quirky smile, goofy personality and caring demeanor. At the downtown restaurant where he recently started working, Izaiah was known for drinking Shirley Temples and keeping his coworkers laughing.Hines takes comfort in hearing how her son had a positive influence on other people’s lives.“But as I’m going through these stages of grief and my feelings are fluctuating, I keep getting stuck in the anger,” she said.She’s angry about the lack of gun control in a country where shootings frequently claim the lives of young Black men. She’s angry at local elected officials for allowing massive systemic inequities to persist for generations in Baltimore, a deeply segregated city where violence remains heavily concentrated in majority-Black neighborhoods. And she’s angry that her family is suffering because of forces beyond her control.“There has to be real change,” she said.She also wonders whether Baltimore schools officials could have done more to protect Izaiah and other students. Hines said she’s considering moving to the suburbs, hoping to remove Izaiah’s younger brother and sister from the dangers of growing up in Baltimore.A school district spokesperson didn’t respond to a recent request for comment, but Baltimore schools CEO Sonja Santelises previously said Patterson High has effective security protocols in place.“This shooting did not occur inside of the school building,” she told reporters at the homicide scene. “When young people want to find a way out, we cannot have our eyes everywhere at the same time.”City leaders say change is happening, but not overnight.During a news conference Monday, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said the city is working hard to address youth violence. He often touts Baltimore’s “dual approach” to public safety, which combines law enforcement action with social programs and other resources aimed at steering people toward alternatives to crime.“We did not wait until now to do that deep work,” Scott said, describing ongoing efforts to bolster violence intervention resources within Baltimore public schools. He said officials have also discussed creating “safe passages” for students going to and from school.Other cities have seen similar increases in youth violence since the pandemic began as shootings and homicides soared nationwide.Scott said it’s disturbing to see more young people solving conflicts with gunfire — even as Baltimore shootings and homicides have each decreased about 25% overall compared to this time last year, according to police.Since the start of 2023, five children under 18 have been fatally shot and another 21 injured in gunfire, according to Baltimore police. Three were killed within blocks of their public high schools.The year began with a Jan. 4 shooting that unfolded around lunchtime outside a Popeyes restaurant across the street from Edmondson-Westside High School in west Baltimore. One student died and four others were wounded. A child’s backpack was visible at the scene, surrounded by shell casings and evidence markers, with schoolwork peeking out from its unzipped pocket.Police made an arrest last month in that case — a teen whose name hasn’t been released because he’s underage.Hines said Izaiah was killed during a pivotal time in his life: caught between childhood and adulthood, his future still an open book.After getting pregnant in high school, Hines pushed herself to graduate, finish college and launch a career in mental health — accomplishments she was proud to share with Izaiah and his two younger siblings. She hoped Izaiah would pursue military service after high school.“I kept telling him, ‘You are not going to become a statistic. You are not just another Black boy in Baltimore city,’” she said. “But the gun violence, it’s so pervasive.”",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849227,"Freed 'Hotel Rwanda' hero in Qatar, heading to family in US","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The man who inspired the film “Hotel Rwanda” and was freed by Rwanda last week from a terrorism sentence has arrived in Qatar on his way to reuniting with family in the United States.Paul Rusesabagina is currently in Doha, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told journalists on Monday.“He will soon be making his way back to the United States. And his family is, as I’m sure no one is surprised, they’re eager to welcome him back here, home. The White House has been and remains engaged in every step of this process,” Kirby said.The 68-year-old Rusesabagina, a U.S. legal resident and Belgian citizen who had left Rwanda after saving hundreds of countrymen in the country’s 1994 genocide, was convicted in 2021 of terrorism offenses and sentenced to 25 years in prison in a widely criticized trial.Rusesabagina disappeared in 2020 during a visit to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and appeared days later in Rwanda in handcuffs. His family alleged he was kidnapped. He was convicted on eight charges including membership in a terrorist group, murder and abduction.Rusesabagina has asserted that his arrest was in response to his criticism of longtime President Paul Kagame over alleged human rights abuses. Kagame’s government has repeatedly denied targeting dissenting voices with arrests and extrajudicial killings.In a signed letter to Kagame dated Oct. 14 and posted on the justice ministry’s website, the ailing Rusesabagina expressed regret for any violence and wrote that “if I am granted a pardon and released, I understand fully that I will spend the remainder of my days in the United States in quiet reflection. I can assure you through this letter that I hold no personal or political ambitions otherwise. I will leave questions regarding Rwandan politics behind me.”His arrest was a source of friction with the U.S. and others at a time when Rwanda's government has also been under pressure over tensions with neighboring Congo and Britain's plan to deport asylum-seekers to the small east African nation.Kirby said U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan personally engaged in the case, “really doing the final heavy lifting to get Paul released and to get him on his way home.”___AP journalist Aamer Madhani in Washington contributed.",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849284,WMI and the Private Banking Industry Join Forces to Strengthen Singapore’s Position as a Philanthropy Hub,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 - The Wealth Management Institute (WMI) and the Private Banking Industry Group (PBIG) announced the launch of the Impact Philanthropy Partnership (IPP) today, which aims to bring together family principals and offices to tackle society's most pressing challenges and issues. The IPP, supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), will create a dedicated series of events and research publications to build greater awareness and momentum for philanthropy and newer models of giving such as venture philanthropy and impact investing.            ""The number of family offices in Singapore continues to grow, and many have a strong appetite to give back to society, both in Singapore and regionally. The IPP will convene thought leaders, changemakers and innovative philanthropists from Asia and around the world, to inspire a broader movement for more strategic and impactful giving,"" says Foo Mee Har, CEO of WMI.   ""Philanthropists and family offices can do tremendous good, especially in areas that lack market support. They can quickly deploy unrestricted funds in response to urgent problems such as natural disasters, back high-risk purposeful ventures, convene stakeholders and promote collaboration, develop and share research, and support large-scale implementation of solutions to pressing social problems. The IPP will build momentum to grow support of causes in Singapore as well as regionally,"" she adds.   One of the key initiatives under the IPP will be a Social Impact Discovery Series, a structured programme providing learning opportunities and thought leadership covering approach-related 'how-to' topics, as well as cause-related topics focused on specific areas of need locally and regionally.   Each partner will play a vital role in the partnership by leveraging their unique networks and expertise to raise awareness and convene the ecosystem, further amplifying the impact of the initiative. WMI will lead and execute the events, programmes and research.   Commenting on the partnership, Arnaud Tellier, CEO BNP Paribas Wealth Management Asia and Chairman of the PBIG Philanthropy Workgroup, says, ""The PBIG Philanthropy workgroup has been working in close partnership with the private, public and people sectors to deepen philanthropic capabilities in the private banking industry. We started this journey in 2021 to enhance Singapore's traditional philanthropy eco-system, through continuous development of philanthropic infrastructure, services and capabilities from Singapore and for the region. The workgroup is now looking to foster growth in other innovative models of philanthropy, such as that of blended finance and impact investing. We look forward to play a catalytic role is transforming Singapore into a philanthropy centre for Asia.""   Phua Wee Ling, Executive Director, Financial Centre Development Department, MAS, says, ""The IPP is an important initiative in line with MAS' vision for Singapore to become Asia's centre for Philanthropy. It will facilitate collaborations between like-minded families and individuals who are keen to utilise their wealth to be a force for good to address needs ranging from climate action and poverty alleviation to inclusive education and resilient healthcare. The IPP initiative complements other efforts to build a supportive ecosystem that include deepening the talent pool for philanthropic advisory services in Singapore, developing due diligence and impact monitoring solutions and enhancing policies to encourage giving.""   Beyond supporting the IPP, the PBIG has recently also worked to incorporate Philanthropy Advisory as a new Technical Skill and Competency (TSC) under the Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore Standards. This reflects the growing importance for wealth advisors of advising clients on philanthropy. In line with this, WMI has launched the Certificate in Philanthropy and Social Impact to support deeper learning in this critical area.   The IPP is open to members of the Global-Asia Family Office Circle as well as networks from PBIG, MAS and ecosystem partners.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849285,Watsons and FWD Celebrate Anniversaries with the Pilot Launch of Retailssure - Asia's First-of-its-Kind Makeup Exchange Assurance Programme,"This marks Watsons' 35th anniversary and FWD Group's 10th anniversary   The programme allows Watsons members to shop for makeup worry-free from 8 March 2023    SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 28 March 2023 – Singapore's leading health and beauty retailer, Watsons, is turning 35 this year and is set to kick off the celebration with the momentous launch of Retailssure, a first-of-its-kind makeup exchange assurance programme in Asia in partnership with pan-Asian insurer, FWD, on 8 March 2023.    Sign-up Retailssure today on                https://www.fwd.com.sg/retailssure!     With the support of FWD and in line with Watsons' commitment to set the standards and bring more to its shoppers' lives, Retailssure's trailblazing makeup exchange assurance programme will for the first time allow its shoppers who have bought an unsuitable makeup product in-store or online to exchange it in-store even if it has been opened and tried.              Retailssure's pilot programme will kickstart on 8 March and is applicable for first 5,000 exchanges till 30 June 2023. With its debut on International Women's Day, Watsons also takes the opportunity to call for equity, empowerment and inclusion with its #WatsonsForWomen movement where individuals can leave their thumbprints using different types of makeup shades as the ink of each stamp print is a unique representation for any one regardless of skin colour.   Extended free and exclusively to Watsons' members, Retailssure is set to benefit its members by enabling them to purchase makeup products with assurance and a greater peace of mind by addressing key pain points that makeup shoppers tend to face including wrong colour shades and unsuitable product textures.           Since the pandemic, shoppers are less comfortable trying out product testers and there are more instances of unsuitable or incorrect purchase of makeup products. In addition, not all makeup products have testers for shoppers to sample and online shopping of makeup products without testing can also lead to erroneous purchases.   As Singaporeans step out of the pandemic and head back out for work and leisure, makeup purchases are on the rise again. With the introduction of a makeup exchange assurance programme like Retailssure, shoppers can enjoy a worry-free shopping experience as they stock up on their makeup essentials. It also increases their confidence to experiment with new makeup and take on different looks for different occasions.   Watsons members can exchange makeup products bought from any Watsons store or online via Watsons eStore that are unsuitable after trying them out within seven calendar days from the date of receipt for in-store purchases or from date of delivery for online orders. For every transaction, one makeup product can be exchanged for another within the same makeup functionality at any Watsons store islandwide.           ""Even as Watsons turns 35, we are constantly seeking new and innovative ways to meet the evolving needs of our discerning shoppers. Retailssure will empower the retail experience of over one million Watsons members that we currently have, especially when shopping for makeup. With close to 30 reputable makeup brands from all over the world to choose from, and many exclusive to Watsons, we hope that this first-of-its-kind, consumer-oriented programme will increase our shoppers' top-of-mind-recall and elevate Watsons' position as the go-to, accessible retailer for makeup products in Singapore,"" said Ms Irene Lau, Managing Director of Watsons Singapore.   ""At FWD, we strive to make digital insurance more accessible and deliver innovative propositions to customers. Retailssure is another example of how we work closely with partners to meet customers' needs. As FWD turns 10 as a Group, we are excited to embark on this strategic partnership with Watsons to launch this first-of-its-kind innovative makeup exchange programme to meet the needs of their members in Singapore."" saidTerence Lim, Group Chief Officer, Digital Commerce, FWD Group.   Adrian Vincent, CEO-Designate of FWD Singapore, added, ""Through this programme, we aim to offer a transformative retail experience for customers at Watsons. We are dedicated to empowering customers and encouraging them to enjoy life to the fullest and celebrate living, knowing that we have got their back. We look forward to an exciting partnership with Watsons and more upcoming initiatives to further empower Singaporeans.""   In addition to Retailssure, Watsons' 'Colour Me Virtual Makeup Try-on' further empowers its shoppers to shop for makeup and hair colouring products with ease by creating an integrated experience to better serve its shoppers' needs. Via the Watsons App, shoppers can virtually try on makeup or hair colouring products including lipsticks, mascara, eyeshadow, brow colouring and foundation to find the right match in just a few clicks.

Each thumbprint will be a unique representation of one's individuality and contribution to the movement towards equity and inclusivity, including the fight against colourism.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849293,Video shows guards walking away during fire that killed 38,"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) — After migrants in northern Mexico placed mattresses against the bars of their detention cell and set them on fire, guards quickly walked away and made no apparent attempt to release the men before smoke filled the room and killed 38 men, surveillance video showed Tuesday.Hours after the fire broke out late Monday, rows of bodies were laid out under shimmery silver sheets outside the immigration detention facility in Ciudad Juarez, which is across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas, and a major crossing point for migrants.Authorities originally reported 40 dead, but later said some may have been counted twice in the confusion. Twenty-eight people were injured and were in “delicate-serious” condition, according to the National Immigration Institute.At the time of the blaze, 68 men from Central and South America were being held at the facility, the agency said. The institute said almost all were from Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela and El Salvador.In the video, two people dressed as guards rush into the camera frame, and at least one migrant appears by the metal gate on the other side. But the guards did not appear to make any effort to open the cell doors and instead ran away as billowing clouds of smoke filled the structure within seconds.Adán Augusto López, Mexico’s interior secretary, confirmed the authenticity of the video in an interview with local journalist Joaquín López Doriga.Immigration authorities identified the dead and injured as being from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, according to a statement from the Mexican attorney general’s office.Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the fire was started by migrants in protest after learning they would be deported.“They never imagined that this would cause this terrible misfortune,” López Obrador said.The deaths forced the government to rent refrigerated trailers to hold the migrants’ bodies, Chihuahua state prosecutor Cesar Jáuregui told reporters.The detention facility is across the street from Juarez’s city hall.At a nearby hospital, Viangly Infante Padrón, a 31-year-old Venezuelan migrant seeking asylum in the U.S. with her husband and three children, waited for her husband, who was being treated for smoke inhalation. The previous evening, she was waiting outside the detention center for his release when the fire broke out.“There was smoke everywhere. The ones they let out were the women, and those (employees) with immigration,"" she said. “The men, they never took them out until the firefighters arrived.”She saw several dead bodies before finding her husband in an ambulance. “I was desperate because I saw a dead body, a body, a body, and I didn’t see him anywhere.”Earlier, about 100 migrants gathered Tuesday outside the immigration facility’s doors to demand information about relatives.Katiuska Márquez, a 23-year-old Venezuelan woman with her two children, ages 2 and 4, was seeking her half-brother, Orlando Maldonado, who had been traveling with her.“We want to know if he is alive or if he’s dead,” she said. She wondered how all the guards who were inside made it out alive and only the migrants died. “How could they not get them out?”Authorities did not immediately answer that question.Márquez and Maldonado were detained Monday with the children and about 20 others. They had been in Juarez waiting for an appointment from U.S. authorities to request asylum. They were staying in a rented room where 10 people were living, paying for it with the money they begged in the street.“I was at a stoplight with a piece of cardboard asking for what I needed for my children, and people were helping me with food,” she said. Suddenly agents came and detained everyone.Everyone was taken to the immigration facility but only the men were placed in the cells. Three hours later, the women and children were released.Tensions between authorities and migrants had apparently been running high in recent weeks in Ciudad Juarez, where shelters are full of people waiting for opportunities to cross into the U.S. or for the asylum process to play out.More than 30 migrant shelters and other advocacy organizations published an open letter March 9 that complained of a criminalization of migrants and asylum seekers in the city. It accused authorities of abusing migrants and using excessive force in rounding them up, including complaints that municipal police questioned people in the street about their immigration status without cause.The high level of frustration in Ciudad Juarez was evident earlier this month when hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants tried to force their way across one of the international bridges to El Paso, acting on false rumors that the United States would allow them to enter the country. U.S. authorities blocked their attempts.After that, Juarez Mayor Cruz Pérez Cuellar started campaigning to inform migrants there was room in shelters and no need to beg in the streets. He urged residents not to give money to them and said authorities would remove them from intersections where it was dangerous to beg and allegedly a nuisance to residents.Migrant advocates who recently denounced more aggressive tactics said Tuesday that the immigration facility was over capacity and that the site of the fire was small and lacked ventilation.“You could see it coming,” the advocates' statement said. “Mexico's immigration policy kills.”The national immigration agency said Tuesday that it “energetically rejects the actions that led to this tragedy” without any further explanation.The “extensive use of immigration detention leads to tragedies like this one,” Felipe González Morales, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights of migrants, said via Twitter. In keeping with international law, immigration detention should be an exceptional measure and not generalized, he wrote.Mexico's immigration lockups have seen overcrowding, protests and riots from time to time.In October, a group of mostly Venezuelan migrants rioted inside an immigration center in Tijuana. In November, dozens of migrants rioted in Mexico’s largest detention center in the southern city of Tapachula near the border with Guatemala. No one died in either incident.Mexico has emerged as the world’s third most popular destination for asylum-seekers, after the United States and Germany. But it is still largely a country that migrants pass through on their way to the U.S.Asylum-seekers must stay in the state where they apply in Mexico, resulting in large numbers being holed up near the country’s southern border with Guatemala. Tens of thousands are also in border cities.At a Mass celebrated in memory of the migrants, Bishop Mons. José Guadalupe Torres Campos lamented the sudden grief that had descended upon the migrant community.“The shout, the cry of everyone is enough, enough of so much pain, enough of so much death,"" he said.___This story has been correct to show the age of Viangly Infante Padrón is 31.___Verza reported from Mexico City. Associated Press videojournalist Alicia Fernández and writers Guadalupe Peñuelas in Ciudad Juarez, Mark Stevenson in Mexico City, Sonia Pérez D. in Guatemala City and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849294,Fed official: Bank rules under review in wake of SVB failure,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve’s bank supervisors warned Silicon Valley Bank’s management as early as the fall of 2021 of risks stemming from its unusual business model, a top Fed official said Tuesday, but its managers failed to take the steps necessary to fix the problems.The Fed official, Michael Barr, the nation's top banking regulator, said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing that the Fed is considering whether stronger bank rules are needed to prevent a similar failure in the future.Silicon Valley Bank's management was deficient, Barr said. In particular, he said, the interest rate model the bank used “was not at all aligned with reality.""The timeline that Barr laid out for when the Fed had alerted Silicon Valley’s management to the risks it faced is earlier than the central bank has previously said the bank was on its radar screen.Tuesday's hearing was the first formal congressional inquiry into the March 10 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the subsequent failure of New York-based Signature Bank, the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history.The failures set off financial tremors in the U.S. and Europe and led the Fed and other government agencies to back all deposits at the two banks, even though nearly 90% of both banks' deposits exceeded the $250,000 insurance threshold. The Fed also established a new lending program to enable banks to more easily raise cash if needed.Late Sunday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said that resolving the two banks, including reimbursing depositors, would cost its insurance fund $20 billion, the largest such impact in its history. The FDIC plans to recoup those funds through a levy on all banks, which will likely be passed on to consumers.Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who leads the committee, suggested that the government's rescue of SVB's depositors, which included wealthy venture capitalists and large tech companies, had caused “justified anger” among many Americans.“I understand why many Americans are angry — even disgusted — at how quickly the government mobilized, when a bunch of elites in California were demanding it,” Brown said.Republican members of the committee focused their fire on the Fed and other regulators for failing to prevent SVB's failure. The Fed has been criticized by advocacy groups for not adequately responding to red flags about the bank's management.“I hope to learn how the Federal Reserve could know about such risky practices for more than a year and failed to take definitive, corrective action,” said Sen. Tim Scott, Republican from South Carolina. “By all accounts, our regulators appear to have been asleep at the wheel.”Several senators have introduced bills that would tighten bank regulation or raise the FDIC's $250,000 threshold. But given the partisan divisions in Congress on those issues, few expect such proposals to become law.Silicon Valley's deposits were heavily concentrated in the high-tech sector, which made it particularly vulnerable to a downturn in a single industry. It had bought long-term Treasurys and other bonds with those funds.The value of those bonds fell as interest rates rose. When the bank was forced to sell those bonds to repay depositors as they withdrew funds, Silicon Valley absorbed heavy losses and couldn't pay its customers.Barr said that depositors withdrew $42 billion — equal to about a quarter of the bank's assets — on the Thursday before the bank failed. On Friday morning, it faced an additional $100 billion in withdrawal requests.Barr said the Fed's review of Silicon Valley's collapse will consider whether stricter regulations are needed, including whether supervisors have the tools needed to follow up on their warnings. The Fed will also consider whether tougher rules are needed on liquidity — the ability of the bank to access cash — and capital requirements, which govern the level of funds a bank needs to hold.Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said he will support any regulatory changes that are proposed by Barr.Last September, before the banks' collapse, Barr had said he was conducting a “holistic review” of the government's capital requirements. He suggested that he might support toughening those requirements, which prompted criticism from the banking industry and Republican senators.Barr also said in prepared remarks that the Fed will review whether a 2018 law that weakened stricter bank rules also contributed to the financial turmoil.“SVB's failure is a textbook case of mismanagement,” Barr said.At the hearing, some Senate Republicans questioned whether new rules were needed and noted that the Fed had had the authority to force Silicon Valley to address its shortcomings.“I can’t think of another rule, or law, or regulation, that you needed,” said Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming.Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the FDIC, and Nellie Liang, the Treasury undersecretary for domestic finance, also testified Tuesday. On Wednesday, all three will testify to a House committee.Gruenberg said the FDIC, which insures bank deposits, and the Fed and Treasury took steps to protect the two banks' depositors to prevent a broader bank run, in which customers swiftly withdraw their funds and which can cause even healthy banks to buckle.“I think there would have been a contagion,"" Gruenberg said, “and I think we would have been in a worse situation today.”Gruenberg said that the top 10 depositors at Silicon Valley held $13.3 billion in their accounts. That is an enormous figure that reflects the wealth of many of its customers, which included large companies such as Roku, the streaming video company, which held about $500 million in an SVB account.The banking turmoil has intensified questions about whether the $250,000 deposit cap, which was enacted after the 2008 financial crisis, should be increased or eliminated entirely.Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax advisory firm RSM, argued Tuesday that the current limit disadvantages small and mid-size banks because only the biggest banks are perceived as “too big to fail."" Many financial firms have shifted their money to larger banks to take advantage of that, Brusuelas said.“Policymakers need to address ways to expand deposit insurance as soon as possible to prevent a wider crisis,” he said.Simon Johnson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who co-wrote a book about the 2008-2009 financial crisis, said there could be bipartisan support for proposals to raise the $250,000 insurance limit for the bank deposits of companies that must meet payrolls and pay bills.Such an expansion, Johnson said, is “quite doable and entirely reasonable. It’s a good idea.”Democratic senators charged that the failures can be attributed, to some extent, to the 2018 softening of the stricter bank regulations that were enacted by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law.The 2018 law exempted banks with assets between $100 billion to $250 billion — Silicon Valley’s size — from requirements that it maintain sufficient cash, or liquidity, to cover 30 days of withdrawals. It also meant that banks of that size were subject less often to so-called “stress tests,” which sought to evaluate how they would fare in a sharp recession or a financial meltdown.___AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849295,US opens investigation into Tesla seat belts coming loose,"DETROIT (AP) — U.S. highway safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into problems with Teslas, this time tied to complaints that the seat belts may not hold people in a crash.The investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration covers an estimated 50,000 Model X SUVs from the 2022 and 2023 model years.The agency says it has two complaints from Tesla owners that the front belts weren’t sufficiently connected at the factory.Documents posted by the agency Tuesday say the belt linkage and pretensioners, which tighten the belts before a crash, are anchored to the seat frames.Both complaints allege that the linkage and pretensioner separated from the frames when the vehicles were driving and force was exerted. Neither incident involved a crash.The agency says it’s opening the probe to look into Tesla’s manufacturing processes, how often the problem happens and how widespread it is. Investigations can lead to recalls.A message was left early Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla.NHTSA also is investigating complaints about problems with Teslas that date to 2020. The probes include Teslas with partially automated driving systems that can brake for no reason or can run into emergency vehicles parked on highways.There also are investigations into complaints that some steering wheels can suddenly disconnect and that suspension parts can fail.",2023/03/28,,World

The findings will contribute to First Hydrogen's overall evaluation and mileage accumulation programme, which supports vehicle optimisation and determines Total Cost of Ownership.   The trials enable fleet managers from sectors including grocery, express delivery, utilities, healthcare, and roadside assistance, to experience the benefits of FCEVs within their own operations. Hydrogen powertrains possess a greater range, higher payload capacity and faster refuelling than equivalent battery electric vehicles. First Hydrogen's vehicle has a range of 400-600km on a single fuel tank filled at 700 bar, which takes approximately five minutes to fill. The programme enables operators to compare different vehicle technologies in action. Fifteen (15) major fleet operators have registered an interest in taking part in First Hydrogen's 12-18-month LCV trial programme.   Upon completion of the trial, Rivus will produce its own independent report analysing the performance of the hydrogen-powered LCV, which will be available to fleet managers and Rivus customers. The report will share valuable insight into the benefits and practicality of adopting hydrogen mobility.   Steve Gill, CEO Automotive at First Hydrogen, says: ""It is incredibly valuable to partner with Rivus for the first of our vehicle fleet trials. As highly regarded fleet specialists, we're keen to receive Rivus' feedback. They will put the vehicle through its paces and test it under various duty cycles. Their findings will showcase our vehicle's capabilities to a new audience of fleet customers and create market demand. Rivus' input will help us to optimise performance and will also inform our plans for future vehicle development and deployment. The team's expertise will also help us to support fleet operators to switch to zero-emission vehicles.""   Thomas Maerz, CDO at Rivus, comments: ""We are delighted to be the first trial participants and for our drivers to test this first-of-its-kind, zero-emission commercial vehicle. Having this time to evaluate the vehicle's capabilities will significantly add to our insight into alternative fuels, especially in the LCV class. In light of 2030 targets, this knowledge enables us to help operators with critical fleets that need to transition to zero emission. Providing this support gives our customers confidence in their transition and fuels our ambition to create a cleaner and more sustainable future.""   About First Hydrogen Corp.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849353,Japan holds evacuation drills amid fear of China invading Taiwan,"Citing the threat from China's aggressive military expansion, Japan has dramatically transformed its defense posture since last year, beefing up its defense budget, strengthening defense capabilities and deepening cooperation with key allies like the US and the Philippines.Some of Japan's remote islands in the south are also enhancing their preparation for a potential military conflict across the Taiwan Strait. On March 18, Japan's Okinawa prefecture carried out its first simulated exercise that aims at evacuating around 100,000 residents from remote islands close to Taiwan. Officials are concerned about southern Japan being affected by a potential Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island, which China sees as part of its own territory. Both local and national authorities in Japan took part in the exercise which was staged in several cities on the Sakishima Islands, about 360 kilometers (224 miles) away from Taiwan.According to Japanese media outlets, the drill simulated residents on smaller islands in the Okinawa prefecture first being taken to bigger islands like Ishigaki and Miyako, and then transferred to Okinawa's main island Kyushu. Apart from the 120,000 local residents and tourists being evacuated based on the exercise, around 1.4 million people living on or around the prefecture's main island were asked to hide indoors.The authorities plan extracting people on civilian aircraft and vessels, and the local government in Okinawa would cooperate with airline and ferry companies or other transportation providers to complete the task. Local authorities estimated that the entire evacuation effort could take six days.While officials in Okinawa try to downplay the correlation between the evacuation drills and the potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, some experts say the proximity of Okinawa to both Taiwan and China, as well as the fact that it hosts US military bases, make the prefecture ""an obvious target of a Chinese attack.""""If China invades Taiwan, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) may also attack US military bases in Okinawa, which means Japan would be automatically dragged into a war with China,"" said Kyoko Hatakeyama, a professor at the University of Niigata Prefecture in Japan.""Japan needs to avoid civilian deaths and casualties in Okinawa, and that's why evacuation drills are becoming more important,"" she told DW.Last December, Japan's westernmost Yonaguni Island also held an evacuation drill over potential ballistic missile strikes. Yonaguni is only 110 kilometers away from Taiwan.Eleanor Hughes, a defense analyst at the Asia Group in the United States, told DW that the preparations are partly aimed at ""bolstering synergies on crisis management"" between authorities at different levels across Japan.""One of the byproducts of these visible preparations is that it's more difficult for Japanese citizens to rule out the possibility that Japan can completely shield itself from feeling the reverberating effects of a contingency [of war], should one occur,"" she said.But some experts express doubt about the effectiveness of these evacuation drills. They also note that Japan's warning system, the J-Alert system, malfunctioned when North Korea fired ballistic missiles over Japan last October. Japan's chief cabinet secretary was forced to apologize to the public over the incident.""If the government's alert system seems to be dysfunctional, Japanese people may think: why should they be too troubled by the potential contingency?"" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University Japan (TUJ).""Local governments in Japan have a long way to go to ensure people living on the remote islands have adequate support if any emergencies were to happen,"" he told DW.According to Kingston, it is still unclear how much support local authorities would provide. Also, communication and transport links remain limited in Okinawa, which would in turn limit the effectiveness of any evacuation plans.Other analysts add that it is very difficult to actually evacuate tens of thousands of people from remote islands once a military conflict breaks out. They argue that the only way to ensure the safe evacuation of civilians under these circumstances is if the warring parties reach some tacit agreement.""From Ukraine's experience, we know evacuating civilians is very hard to do [during a war] and mass evacuation is even harder to execute,"" said Koichi Nakano, a political scientist at Sophia University in Japan.Both Kingston and Nakano point to Okinawa's brutal history during World War II. The island was the site of a battle between the US army and the Japanese forces in 1945, which killed more than 200,000 people. With that in mind, many local residents view the ongoing efforts and evacuation drills with skepticism and concern.""Many people feel like there is once again preparation to use Okinawa as a buffer in a possible military confrontation,"" Nakano told DW.""The government has no choice but to acknowledge that to a certain degree, Okinawa is less safe than it used to be, and that's why they have to conduct evacuation drills. But I don't think that can really reassure the local people,"" he added.Tensions in the region were running especially high last summer, when senior US lawmaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. China saw the visit as implicit support to Taiwan's independence and responded by staging massive military drills, with several Chinese missiles reportedly landing in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone.Residents of the Yonaguni Island, where evacuation drills were held in December, told Japan's daily Yomiuri Shimbun that this incident made them realize the rising military threat from across the Taiwan Strait.Also in December, Japan revealed its biggest defense budget increase since WWII, aiming to raise the defense spending to 2% of GDP and strengthen its counterstrike capabilities. In its newly-released national security strategy, Tokyo characterized China as ""the greatest strategic challenge ever to securing the peace and stability of Japan."" It also highlighted the fact that Beijing hasn't ruled out the possibility of using force against Taiwan.Kingston from Temple University Japan adds that issues related to Taiwan's security have been baked into Japan's foreign policy and there is longstanding sympathy and support for Taiwan in general. According to the expert, Tokyo's commitment to Taiwan will continue, regardless of who is in power.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849354,China increasing bailouts to Belt and Road partners: report,"China has increasingly bailed out developing countries that have struggled to repay loans from the Belt and Road Initiative, according to a new report published on Tuesday.Between 2008 and 2021, China issued $240 billion (€221.7 billion) in bailout loans to 22 countries, the report found. Around 80% of these rescue loans were issued after 2016.The report was produced by researchers from the World Bank, the Harvard Kennedy School, US-based AidData and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany.""Beijing is ultimately trying to rescue its own banks. That's why it has gotten into the risky business of international bailout lending,"" said Carmen Reinhart, a former World Bank chief economist and one of the study's authors.According to the report, Argentina received the most rescue loans from China, totaling $111.8 billion.It was followed by Pakistan with $48.5 billion and Egypt with $15.6 billion.Other countries that received significant sums include Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Suriname.The report said China mainly bailed out middle-income countries due to the risks they pose to Chinese banks' balance sheets..Meanwhile, low-income countries are typically offered grace periods and maturity extensions, the report said.""Beijing has targeted a limited set of potential recipients, as almost all Chinese rescue loans have gone to low- and middle-income BRI countries with significant debts outstanding to Chinese banks,"" the researchers wrote.The report said China's bailout loans are small in comparison to the loans offered by the International Monetary Fund or the liquidity extended by the US Federal Reserve, but they are growing quickly.On Tuesday, China's Foreign Ministry responded to the report of increased bailouts stemming from the Belt and Road Initiative.Spokesperson Mao Ning said Beijing had never compelled other countries to take its loans.He also said China never attached political strings to these loans.zc/fb (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849355,Berlin pools clarify gender equality rules to allow topless bathing,"When Lotte Mies went topless at an indoor swimming pool in the Berlin district of Kaulsdorf last December, she was asked to either cover her chest or leave the pool. The 33-year-old activist had already called ahead to check with staff that she could go topless and was told it would not be a problem. But when she refused to cover up, the police were called and Mies was forced to leave.""It was more than humiliating for me that day and it really wasn't nice to be treated like a second-class citizen on the basis of my gender and not to be able to decide for myself how to [present] my own body,"" Mies told DW.""I thought about it and I came to the conclusion that: 'No, I don't want to ashamed of my breasts anymore, it's actually not in order,'"" Mies told DW. ""This permanent sexualization that we are exposed to, and it's not just about breasts, I just don't want to accept it anymore.""Mies filed a complaint with the ombudsman's office responsible for compliance with Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act (LADG), a law that was introduced in the state of Berlin in June 2020, and is the first of its kind in Germany. The General Equal Treatment Act (AGG), which covers the whole of Germany, forbids discrimination in labor and civil law contexts. Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act extends this existing law to guard against discrimination in the public sector.The Berliner Bäderbetriebe (BBB), the capital's municipal swimming pool operator, never had a gender-specific dress code, only a general rule mandating ""customary bathing attire"" for both men and women which left it down to staff at each pool to interpret what this actually meant. Now, in response to the public outcry over Mies' case, the pool operator has issued a clarification to ensure that women can now go topless at public pools just the same as men.The clarification simply states that: ""Swimming 'topless' is equally permissible for all persons"" and only the ""primary sexual organs"" need to covered. The German government's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency classifies breasts, beards and body hair as ""secondary sex characteristics."" Primary sex characteristics are defined as those necessary for sexual reproduction, such as the penis, testicles, and vagina.Doris Liebscher, the head of the ombudsman's office responsible for compliance with the Anti-Discrimination Act in Berlin, welcomed the clarification to the rules in the capital, saying the decision ""establishes equal rights for all Berliners, whether male, female or non-binary.""This all comes after a similar case hit the headlines in the summer of 2021, when Gabrielle Lebreton went topless at a water park with her five-year-old son in the Berlin district of Treptow-Köpenick. When Lebreton refused to cover her chest, the police were called and she was forced to leave the park.Lebreton decided to sue, in one of the first cases to be launched off the back of Berlin's Anti-Discrimination Act. She lost her case, with the district court (Landesgericht) ruling that women's breasts are different to men's and can therefore by subject to different regulations. Lebreton is currently in the process of appealing the decision at the Berlin Appellate Court (Kammergericht).""Unfortunately, this idea is exactly where the discrimination of the female chest starts,"" Leonie Thum, the lawyer representing Lebreton, told DW. ""The assumption that the sexualization of the female chest is somehow rooted in biology and therefore somehow mandatory, which isn't true. It's simply to overcome a social assumption that the law doesn't define as an adequate justification for discrimination of genders.""Thum argued that the ruling essentially subverted what the anti-discrimination law is for, as if ""part of the public has an issue with something, that is always enough reason to justify discrimination.""After Lebreton was ordered to leave the water park in the summer of 2021, activists in Berlin founded the intersectional feminist alliance ""Equal Breasts for All"" (""Gleiche Brust für alle"") which campaigns for the desexualization of the upper body in a similar vein to the ""Free the Nipple"" campaign in the US. Under the motto ""No nipple is free until all nipples are free,"" campaigners cycled topless through Berlin to protest the hypocrisy of denying women the right to go topless in a city covered with adverts depicting ""half-naked, sexualized and unrealistic images of bodies.""The ""Free the Nipple"" campaign went mainstream in 2013 after the release of the film of the same name. Using the hashtag #freethenipple, campaigners have argued that women should be allowed to appear topless in public in the same way as men, including on social media platforms, where images of women's breasts are regularly censored — from Renaissance paintings to photos of breastfeeding.""Men don't have to hide their beards just because in puberty that signifies that they are ready to have sex, but for some reason with women's breasts that's the case,"" Thum says, adding that men have biological markers that signal puberty in the same way women do, the only difference being that they are not expected to hide them.Another often overlooked aspect of the rules around topless bathing is the rights of transgender and non-binary people, Thum says: ""If you have a gender regulation based on two genders, that is binary, then you will always discriminate against trans and non-binary people. There's no way around it and that's what happens all the time.""In August 2021, a non-binary topless swimmer was ordered to leave a public swimming pool in the German city of Göttingen in Lower Saxony. Following a campaign by the feminist alliance ""Equal Breasts for All,"" the municipal authority last year introduced a pilot project to allow topless bathing for all genders on Saturdays and Sundays at four of its pools.Germany is not known for having a prudish attitude towards nudity, where fully naked bathers can be seen on beaches and in parks soaking up the sun even in the most conservative parts of the country. In fact, the country has a long tradition of nude public bathing as part of the ""free body culture"" (""Freikörperkultur"", commonly referred to as ""FKK""), a naturist movement that emerged in the late 19th century.In an interview with Playboy in 2017, prominent Left Party politician Gregor Gysi, from the former East Germany, complained about the decline of ""free body culture,"" which he blamed on the ""pornographic gaze"" of men from the West.Since Berlin's municipal pool operator announced it would clarify its rules concerning topless bathing as a result of Lotte Mies' compliant, Mies has been subjected to a wave of misogynistic online abuse, ranging from derogatory comments about her appearance to rape threats. ""Most of them are the classic victim-perpetrator role reversal, that I am somehow to blame if more [women] are raped now,"" Mies told DW.Germany still lags behind other European countries when it comes to implementing anti-discrimination legislation long since enshrined in EU law, according to Thum: ""I always thought it would be a straightforward process, that it would always develop to a more equal, free society and I think we are, but because of a lot of pushback it's much slower than you would think.""",2023/03/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849361,Russia says oil sales to India surged amid war in Ukraine,"Alexander Novak, Russia's deputy prime minister, said Russian oil sales to India jumped 22-fold in 2022 amid sanctions against Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.Last year, as European countries sought to end their dependence on Russian energy supplies and imposed sanctions on Moscow, Russia has shifted its oil exports to India and China.Novak said that Russia's energy exports were ""redirected"" to the ""markets of friendly countries,"" adding that energy revenues accounted for 42% of Russia's federal budget in 2022.He said Russia's energy industry was sustainable despite the challenges faced by Western sanctions.India had previously exported large quantities of its oil from Africa and rarely bought Russian oil due to high transport costs.But last year refiners in India became Moscow's key oil clients as Russia reportedly offered discounted rates. According to the Indian newspaper The Economic Times, India received 1.72 million bpd of Russian oil just last month.Over the last year, observers have defined India's position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a muted one. New Delhi has refused to condemn the war or support the Western sanctions.At the G20 meet hosted by India, the US repeatedly called for Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine. But  India refused to condemn the Russian invasion and has called for talks to de-escalate the conflict.""We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can,"" said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while addressing the gathering.Modi has previously said on India's ties with Russia that ""the world also knows that it is an unbreakable friendship.""On the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's war, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) sought to pass a resolution demanding the end of the war.India was among the 32 countries that abstained from voting.ns/fb (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/28,,

""National elections... will be held on Sunday 21 May,"" he said.In line with Greek law, the government had to call an election by July this year at the latest.Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy (ND) party will face off against its main opposition, the leftist Syriza party which led the government from 2015 to 2019, under former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.The May election will be the first to be held using the recently introduced system of proportional representation. A second round of voting, if needed, will be held in early July at the latest, Mitsotakis said.Opinion polls show ND slightly above Syriza, but it is unlikely that the election will produce a clear winner.""Greece is in a much better place in 2023 than in 2019,"" Mitsotakis said, according to Greek newspaper I Kathimerini. ""Our work continues, of course, we weren't without mistakes.""He called on voters to look to other countries that have been caught in a cycle of elections that have produced no clear winner and left them without governments.""There will be elections in neighboring Bulgaria on Sunday,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849364,Is Kazakhstan misleading world on firms fleeing Russia?,"Right after its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia faced a mass exodus of foreign companies. Some were leaving in fear of possible reputational loss, others due to sanctions imposed on the Kremlin by the West and some to mark their protest against Moscow's aggression.The exits were viewed as an opportunity by Russia's neighbor Kazakhstan. In March 2022, barely a month after the invasion, Astana started negotiations with 362 foreign multinationals which had publicly announced their plans to cease or suspend work in Russia, said Deputy Foreign Minister Almas Aidarov at the time. In late December, the Foreign Ministry announced that over 20 foreign companies had relocated their regional offices or manufacturing from Russia to Kazakhstan.The list included big names like US software industrial company Honeywell, Australian iron ore miner Fortescue, Japanese trading house Marubeni, Chinese-owned short-video sharing app TikTok and US ride-hailing service inDrive. DW reached out to some of the companies on the Kazakh list to ascertain Astana's claims. As it turns out, some of the firms named on the list have been present in Kazakhstan for years and are now only executing their long-planned expansion strategy, Others refused to confirm Astana's assertions, or declined to comment.The authorities in Kazakhstan didn't respond to several requests from DW for comment.TikTok was among the first foreign firms to react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, TikTok decided to suspend livestreaming and new postings for users in Russia. The reason was a law passed by the Russian parliament just a week after the invasion that imposed a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading any information about the Russian military that the authorities deemed ""fake"" on any platform, including social media.""Our highest priority is the safety of our employees and our users,"" a TikTok spokesperson told DW, adding that the company continues to ""evaluate the evolving circumstances in Russia to determine when we might fully resume our services.""As a result, TikTok was forced to lay off some of its employees in Russia. The remaining staff was offered other options, among them relocation. While TikTok refused to reveal any information on its employees' whereabouts, it said some of them had been relocated in accordance with the company's global and regional business needs.TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, also decided to focus on the Kazakh market, its spokesperson said. In October, the company and Kazakhstan's IT center, Astana Hub, launched a joint education project for the country's startups. Back then, Theo Bertram, TikTok’s vice president of European public policy, said the company was willing to develop business in Kazakhstan and open a representative office there, The Astana Times reported.The TikTok spokesperson didn't specify how far the company has advanced with its plan, but stressed that it doesn't intend to relocate its Russian business to Kazakhstan.Another multinational company mentioned by the Kazakh authorities was the German manufacturer of building materials Knauf Group. The firm's name on the list is a little surprising, considering it's among a host of German firms that continue to do business in Russia despite intense public pressure. Russia contributes 10% to Knauf's global turnover.""It's not about money for us, it's about 4,000 employees,"" the company's chairman Alexander Knauf told German publication Manager Magazin in October. ""I know some of them for 30 years. Loyalty to these people means to me that I won't send them off into an uncertain future."" He added, however, that his firm has complied with the sanctions imposed on Russia and that it had wrapped up its investment in the country and suspended trade between Russia and the European Union.In a response to DW, Knauf Group didn't confirm the information on its relocation to Kazakhstan. However, the firm did elaborate on its plans to build a new manufacturing facility in the country — a project that was announced by Astana in late December.""We have long been planning to expand in the south of the country. The reasons are growing demand for environment-friendly gypsum boards in Kazakhstan and the need to supply the neighboring markets like Kyrgyzstan,"" the company said, adding that it has been in dialogue with local authorities for a few years now. Knauf already has three production sites in Kazakhstan.Unlike Knauf Group, which plans to begin construction of its new facility as early as 2024, US industrial giant Honeywell already opened a plant for advanced automation and safety equipment in Kazakhstan in July. Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry mentioned Honeywell next to Knauf on the list of foreign multinationals allegedly relocating to the country from Russia.However, just as in the case of Knauf, Honeywell's decision to build a manufacturing unit in Kazakhstan had nothing to do with the current geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West. The plant had been planned way before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the company said in an emailed statement. ""We follow a plan of local growth there [in Kazakhstan] that we embarked on more than two decades ago,"" Honeywell said. ""Work on our Almaty assembly facility opening began several years ago.""The plant's opening was followed by Honeywell's decision to completely shut down its businesses and operations in Russia. In response to DW's request for comment, the company confirmed it was no longer conducting any business in Russia. According to the Foreign Ministry, Honeywell is opening a regional office for Central Asia in Almaty that is set to replace the one it had closed in Moscow. The company didn't comment on this development.Australian green energy and resources company Fortescue is another big name on the Kazakh list. According to Kazakhstan, Fortescue closed its Moscow office and moved it to Kazakhstan. However, the company never really had an actual office in Russia. Its green energy arm, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI), only had a small team of a few people undertaking preliminary work in Russia, the company said.""FFI will not tolerate one country invading another, and a decision was therefore made to withdraw from work in Russia,"" Fortescue told DW. It also pointed out that it never had any assets or investments in Russia.On the other hand, the company has had a presence in Kazakhstan since 2019. In November, FFI and Astana agreed to jointly explore the ""potential delivery of renewable energy projects and green hydrogen production in Kazakhstan.""A similar response came from Japan's biggest trading house Marubeni, which Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry claimed had partly relocated its representative office from Moscow. Marubeni, which has been working in Kazakhstan since 1993 with investments in some big projects, said it always looks for new projects in the country but that it was not accurate to describe its Kazakh plans as a relocation.""It is true that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we have been paying more attention to Kazakhstan and Central Asian markets,"" the company said in an emailed statement. Marubeni also pointed out that it has been strictly complying with sanctions imposed on Russia and that it will not engage in any new Russia-related business and will ""negotiate terminations of existing transactions wherever possible.""For now, Marubeni continues to be a stakeholder in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, by virtue of it being a part of the Tokyo-based consortium SODECO (Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co) which owns a 30% stake. In November, the Japanese stakeholders in Sakhalin-1, which also include Japan's government and the trading house Itochu, decided to retain their stake in the project, formerly led by Exxon Mobil. The US energy company exited the Sakhalin-1 venture in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Meanwhile, at least one foreign company on the list published by Astana has indeed relocated from Russia to Kazakhstan.US ride-hailing service inDrive said in spring 2022 that it would move part of its Russian personnel to Kazakhstan. After the war in Ukraine began, Kazakh authorities approached the California-headquartered startup and offered to facilitate relocating its staff, inDrive founder Arsen Tomsky told Forbes Kazakhstan. The company ultimately moved most of its Russia-based employees to Kazakhstan, which Tomsky described as ""the most suitable and stable place in the region.""The largest of inDrive's 17 offices globally will be located in Almaty, with nearly 1,000 employees working there in 2023, Tomsky told the Russian publication VC.ru.Edited by: Ashutosh Pandey",2023/03/28,,

The Peruvian soccer federation expressed solidarity with its players and said it respected and would collaborate with authorities. It asked for its fans in Madrid to refrain from any violent actions.Madrid government official Mercedes González said Tuesday there will be an investigation to find out whether excessive force was used by the police officers, but she said they acted to guarantee the safety of everyone. She said Gallese was taken to the police station because he assaulted an officer.González said the players had been advised to be careful and not to interact with the fans in order to maintain the safety of hotel guests and others. She said about 300 fans were outside the hotel being used by the Peruvian national team in the Spanish capital.Images on social media showed Peru players outside the hotel watching their fans sing when one of the players was pushed back by an officer. The player moved the officer away and a small brawl ensued with other players and Peru staff getting involved with other police officers.The altercation lasted a few moments while the crowd continued chanting.Earlier Monday, a Spanish hotel employee was detained by local police for allegedly racially insulting the Morocco national team in posts on social media. He was expected to be formally accused of a hate crime, González said.Several players have been subjected to racist insults in Spanish league matches this season, most notably Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior. The league has filed eight formal complaints to authorities because of insults against the Brazilian player, who is Black.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849371,Push in states for $20 minimum wage as inflation persists,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Just years after labor activists persuaded a handful of states to raise their minimum wage to $15 per hour, workers initially thrilled with the pay bump are finding their hard-won gains erased by inflation.New York City resident Anthony Rivera, 20, who sorts packages at a United Parcel Service facility in Brooklyn, said he had to take a second job at a grocery store after his food costs soared.“I was sitting at $15 an hour at UPS, and when it came to paying bills and buying groceries, it was starting to become not enough,” he said. “That led me to no other option than to pick up another job.”New York, California and Massachusetts are among states where pro-labor forces are now pushing proposals that, if approved, would boost minimum wages to $20 or more in the coming years.Inflation has meant that something that cost $15 in 2012 — when labor activists adopted the “Fight for $15” slogan in a push for wage hikes — would probably cost almost $20 today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.But opponents to the wage hikes say they can be detrimental to small businesses, which already took a major hit during the coronavirus pandemic.Cindy Lee, the owner of a bowling alley in Endicott, New York, said she's struggling to pay off loans taken out during the pandemic that kept her business afloat.“All this cost all at once is just going to kill us. I definitely will have to cut corners somewhere with employees if wages are raised,” said Lee, adding that she'd also have to increase prices on bowling, food and liquor.The federal minimum wage in the United States has stayed at $7.25 per hour since 2009, but states and some localities are free to set higher amounts. Thirty states have chosen to do so.Over the past decade, labor groups held out $15 as the target that would let low-paid workers sustain themselves within the 40-hour workweek. A growing number of states across the political spectrum have passed legislation that will take their minimum wage above that amount in the next few years, including Florida, Nebraska and Illinois. Eleven states have phased in wage increases of $5 or more within the past decade.Yet those gains were almost immediately tempered. Inflation in the United States hit a new 40-year high last summer after prices for basic necessities like gas and food soared. Supply chain issues resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, combined with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have disrupted gas and food supplies, sending those prices skyward.Labor activists are pressing for a new round of wage increases even as the old ones are still being phased in.A bill in New York would raise the state’s minimum wage to $21.25 by 2026, and then adjust it each year going forward for inflation. Right now, minimum wage workers in New York City get paid $15, while the rest of the state is at $14.20.In Massachusetts, one bill proposes to raise the wage every year until it hits $20 in 2027, up from $15 now.And in California, where the minimum wage is currently $15.50 for all workers, legislation signed in September would have set the state on a path to raise wages for fast-food workers to $22 per hour. The law was met with heavy opposition from restaurant industry groups who led a successful effort to force it into a referendum vote in 2024.Backers of a proposed wage increase in New York say they hope it will pass as part of the state budget, which is expected to be finalized in early April.“You can't tell us that after the pandemic, that $15 is going to still be enough for us to keep food on our tables,” said state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens, said at a rally in Albany. “That's why we want $21.25, nothing less. The price of everything is going up except for wages.”In her executive budget proposal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also a Democrat, proposed tying minimum wage increases to inflation, but with a cap on how much wages could rise in any one year.Barry Nicholson, the owner of four retail businesses in Corning, a city by the Finger Lakes in New York, said a wage increase to $21.25 would be “a smack in the face to small businesses.”“There is just no way I could handle that,"" said Nicholson, who owns two UPS stores, and women's accessories and modern home furnishings stores. “When you look at retail hospitality, we live and die by a couple of points at the end of the day. We’re not the big corporations everyone talks about.”___Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849373,IAEA head: Deal to protect Ukrainian nuclear plant 'close',"DNIPRO, Ukraine (AP) — A deal to protect Europe's largest nuclear power plant from a catastrophic accident due to fighting in Ukraine could be “close,” the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday, but warned that intensified combat in the area has increased risks to the facility.In an interview with The Associated Press a day before he was to cross the front lines for a second time to visit the plant, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said he felt it was his duty to ramp up talks aimed at safeguarding the facility. He met Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and said he would “most probably” head to Russia in the coming days.“There is an increased level of combat, active combat” in the area of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Grossi said. “My teams there report daily about the attacks, the sound of heavy weaponry. This is practically constant.”Grossi has long called for a protection zone to be set up around the plant, which is very near the front line of the war. But so far, an agreement has been elusive.“It is a zone of extreme volatility. So the negotiations are, of course, affected by the ongoing military operations,” Grossi said. “I would not characterize the process for the last few months as one that has not led to any progress.”The nuclear agency head said he has maintained a professional dialogue with both Russian and Ukrainian officials as he seeks a deal “to ensure ... that there is no radiological accident, major catastrophic accident, in Europe.”“I think it's close,” he said of the possibility of a deal. “Obviously, obviously, I need a political commitment, political decision. And in this case, what I want to stress is that what they would be agreeing is on the protection of the plant. They are not agreeing with each other. They are agreeing with the IAEA. They are agreeing with nuclear safety and security. This is a very important element which I believe should be taken into consideration.”The negotiations are specific to preventing a nuclear disaster at the plant and not aimed at securing a broader cease-fire, Grossi stressed.“What we are doing, the way we are presenting things is as a series of principles or commitments that the IAEA presents and everybody would be able to support,” he said. “So in my opinion this should make an agreement possible, not impossible, not utopian, not something for which we should be waiting for months and months on end.”The head of the nuclear agency said he sees “an increased level of danger” due to the fighting. “I think the principle here is to avoid an accident, and the possibility of having it is increasing. This is a matter of fact.”The U.N.'s atomic energy watchdog, which is based in Vienna, Austria, has a rotating team permanently based at the plant. The power station's six reactors are in shutdown and the plant has received the electricity it needs to prevent a reactor meltdown through one remaining functioning power line.Plant personnel have had to switch to emergency diesel generators six times during the 13-month war to power essential cooling systems. When backup power supplies might be needed again is “absolutely unpredictable,” Grossi said.“It’s because of the shelling, it’s because of the drone, it's because of an attack, it's because of an offensive operation or a defensive operation. So it’s not something that you can really plan for,"" he noted. ""It is occurring, has been occurring. And if we base ourselves on what we have been seeing, it’s going to happen again.”Military analysts expect the fighting between invading Russian troops and Ukrainian forces to further escalate as spring progresses and the now muddy ground hardens, allowing heavy military machinery to advance on the battlefield.“There is talk about offensives, counter-offensives,” Grossi said. “The concentration of troops, concentration of military equipment, heavy weaponry has grown exponentially in the area near to the plant, which of course, makes us believe that the possibility of an accident, of a renewed attack ... could grow.”While the last direct shelling of the plant occurred in November, the surrounding area was still being hit, the nuclear agency chief said, noting that “we have far more military activity, and more is announced.”The IAEA head said he has discussed the situation at the highest levels with both sides and was still discussing “different scenarios that could lead” to the creation of a protection zone around the plant.“This proposal is about preventing a nuclear accident. It Is not to create any situation which may have a military advantage or disadvantage or a legitimization of the situation,” he said.“So I have to walk this fine line talking to both, trying to make it so that both understand very well that a radiological accident ... here and also on the Russian side, would be extremely serious, and it’s something that we really need to avoid.”Grossi's return to Zaporizhzhia to visit the power plant also aims “to consolidate the presence of the IAEA, which is indispensable, to provide technical assistance of nuclear safety and security, to give an objective, impartial impression of what is really happening here,” he said. ___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849374,Ukrainian president extends tour of war’s front-line areas,"OKHTYRKA, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s president visited the Sumy region in northern Ukraine on Tuesday, continuing his tour over recent days of areas of the country that have felt the brunt of Russia’s full-scale invasion and as the stage increasingly looks set for a Ukrainian counteroffensive.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with officials and local people in two cities in the region and with border guards at an undisclosed location near the border with Russia.The Sumy region was partially occupied by Russian forces after the war started more than a year ago. The Russians withdrew from the region by early April.The Associated Press was granted exclusive access as Zelenskyy visited the cities of Okhtyrka, which saw fierce battles last year but was never occupied, and Trostianets, which was held by the Russians for a month after the invasion but retaken by Ukrainian forces on March 26, 2022.The president's office said Zelenskyy also went up to the Russian border to meet with border guards and hear how they are protecting checkpoints. Ukrainian authorities say Russia has increased shelling of border areas in the Sumy region in recent weeks.Zelenskyy’s trip followed his visits over the past seven days to the Kherson and Kharkiv regions, parts of which were retaken last year from the Kremlin’s forces, to the intensely contested area near Bakhmut in the eastern Donetsk region, and to Zaporizhzhia in the south.Also Tuesday, at least three civilians were killed and 43 others were wounded by the latest Russian attacks involving drones, gliding bombs and heavy artillery, Ukraine’s presidential office said.In the eastern Donetsk region, Russian shelling hit 12 towns and villages, killing two people and wounding 34. The Russian shelling also targeted the southern city of Kherson, where five were wounded. In Bilopillia in the Sumy region, a Russian strike damaged a school building and an apartment building.Addressing a crowd on a square in Okhtyrka, Zelenskyy promised that the battle-scarred city would be rebuilt.“We won’t let any wound remain on the body of our state,” he said.In Trostianets, Zelenskyy honored soldiers at the local railway station, where Ukrainian authorities say the Russians tortured prisoners. He also met with Ukraine’s minister for reconstruction, Oleksandr Kubrakov.Many buildings in the city are damaged or destroyed by the war, with crumbling walls and punctured roofs.Trostianets resident Dmytro Zaiats told the AP that the president’s visit meant a lot to him.“It’s a symbol of unity and the iron will that brought the country together,” he said.Expectations of a Ukrainian push against Russian positions are mounting as the weather improves and Western-supplied weapons for Kyiv arrive.Germany said late Monday it has delivered the 18 Leopard II tanks it had promised to Ukraine. Poland, Canada, Norway and Portugal have also delivered promised Leopard tanks. Ukraine’s Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Twitter that the first British Challenger 2 battle tanks had arrived, too.“These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” Reznikov said.Russia is stepping up its own production of war materiel. Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited factories in the Chelyabinsk and Kirov regions producing artillery rounds and rockets, Russia’s Defense Ministry said, adding that the plants will increase the output of certain items by seven or eight times later this year.Russia has kept up its long-range bombardment of Ukraine areas, but its nighttime attacks with Iranian-made Shahed exploding drones are causing little damage.The Ukrainian military downed 14 of the 15 Shahed drones Russia fired late Monday, the General Staff of the Ukrainian armed forces said.The Kyiv regional military administration said that wreckage from a downed drone hit an administrative building in the Sviatoshynskyi District in western part of the capital, causing a fire. There were no casualties.The Dnipropetrovsk regional governor, Serhii Lysak, said the Ukrainian military shot down two drones overnight, but another one hit a privately-owned industrial facility in the city of Dnipro and caused a fire that took hours to extinguish.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849375,Prospects get chance to shine in Basketball Africa League,"They're refining skills of young prospects at the NBA Academy in Africa. The vocabulary, too.“There is a word that really we don't like, which is ‘raw,'"" said Franck Traore, head of basketball operations for NBA Africa. “When you have an African player going to the U.S., they say ‘raw.'”Several academy prospects are playing in the new season of the Basketball Africa League, hoping to gain valuable experience in a professional setting and show that their game is more polished than many think.Now in its third season, the league was created by the NBA in partnership with FIBA to help grow the sport in Africa. It's a three-month, Champions League-style competition for African club teams.They added a twist last season with each of the 12 teams being assigned an academy prospect — called the “BAL Elevate” program that's in place this campaign, too.The young players have to earn minutes on rosters full of veterans. It's another opportunity — along with various tournaments that the NBA Academy shuttles the kids to around the world — for the prospects prove themselves.Academy alum Babacar Sane played in the BAL and other events last year and jumped to the G League Ignite, where the 6-foot-6 Senegalese player is in the first season of a two-year contract. Thierry Darlan, a 6-foot-7 point guard from the Central African Republic, is expected to do the same.Sane and Darlan — both considered future NBA draft picks — are helping change the profile of African recruits.“It's not a hurtful word or anything,” Traore said of the “raw” tag. ""But we're trying to develop programs so when an African player developed here on the continent gets to the U.S. or anywhere else in the world they have the skillset — the same or even better than what we have in the U.S. We’re getting to that point at this moment.”GAME CHANGE?At 6-foot-3, Joy Ighovodja isn't the typical recruit out of Africa. The 18-year-old Nigerian will be playing next season at Oral Roberts, which lost to Duke in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.“I’ve not really seen point guards coming out of Nigeria,” said Ighovodja, whose 6-foot-10 wingspan intrigued scouts last summer at the NBA Academy Games in Atlanta.“The normal thing people think is Nigeria, Africa as a whole, we’re good on defense, run the floor,” he said. “The mentality is they have these big strong guys that get rebounds and play in the paint — not point guards.”Ighovodja, who is playing with the Abidjan team for the BAL season, is a lefty who started playing basketball four years ago, initially as a shooting guard. Coaches like him as a point guard, he said, “to create opportunities for myself and my teammates” with his speed, athleticism and ball-handling.His team, the ABC Fighters, has advanced to the playoffs in May but the teenager has played in only one game so far under coach Liz Mills.“I just have to gain the coach’s trust. I’m getting there,” Ighovodja said recently.Other academy guards include Modou Thiam, who averaged 7.8 points per game for Nigerian team Kwara, and Aginaldo Neto. Although Neto is not playing in BAL, the Angolan is “one of the best upcoming point guards that we have,"" Traore said.“We're just looking at everybody — it’s not even size or position,” he added. “Right now, the game is going position-less. Here, we identify by potential.”BAL GAMESThe academy has bigs in the BAL, too.Rueben Chinyelu (6-foot-10) is making significant contributions with Stade Malien before the 19-year-old Nigerian heads to Washington State. He is averaging 5.4 points and a team-high 8.8 rebounds per game. More than half of his rebounds have been on the offensive end.Ulrich Chomche (6-foot-11) is averaging 1.6 blocks and 20.5 minutes per game for Rwandan team REG, along with five points and seven rebounds per game. The 17-year-old Cameroonian also played in BAL last year and does not lack confidence.Khaman Maluach (7-foot-1) of South Sudan is only 16 and helped Senegalese team A.S. Douanes advance to the playoffs. Maluach is a strong finisher, a rim protector and has flashed 3-point range.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849376,New sports wagering code bans college betting partnerships,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The U.S. gambling industry is adopting a new responsible marketing code that will ban sports books from partnering with colleges to promote sports wagering, bar payments to college and amateur athletes for using their name, image or likeness, and end the use of the terms “free” or “risk-free” to describe promotional bets.The American Gaming Association told The Associated Press on Tuesday the changes are necessary to keep up with developments in the fast-growing legal sports betting industry, which currently operates in 33 states plus Washington, D.C. The group is the national trade association for the commercial gambling industry.But they also follow criticism of the gambling industry from regulators and those who treat gambling addiction; several states are outlawing the kind of betting partnerships covered by the code, and others are taking a renewed look at overall sports betting advertising.One New York congressman has introduced legislation that would ban all online and digital sports betting advertising.“It has always been important that we get sports betting right,” said Bill Miller, the association's president and CEO. “It's always been our No. 1 interest in creating a high bar for responsible advertising and protecting consumers.""He also acknowledged the updated code takes into account things “that the industry has taken some jabs on.” But he said it was always the association's goal to proactively update its marketing code; the association will review it annually from now on.Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, praised the new rules.“The AGA’s code is an important standard for the gambling industry, and we are glad to hear about these updates,” he said. “The code is so important because many sports fans are underage, and we also know that people who gamble on sports have higher rates of gambling problems.”The new rules, to which all the association's members have agreed, also require that anyone depicted in sports betting advertising be at least 21 years old. They also restrict advertising to media where at least 73.6 percent of the audience is reasonably expected to be 21 or older.Although the new rules take effect immediately, companies that have existing advertising campaigns in place that would be affected by them will be allowed to continue them until July 1.There are five partnerships between the gambling industry and colleges that promote or advertising sports betting.They include a deal between Michigan State University and Caesars Entertainment and one between Caesars and Louisiana State University that led to the university sending emails to students — including some who were too young to legally bet — encouraging them to “place your first bet (and earn your first bonus).”The University of Colorado Boulder's 2020 deal with sports book PointsBet included a $30 referral bonus every time someone signed up on PointsBet with the university's promo code and placed a bet. In January, the university ended the referral bonuses but the larger deal remains in place.PointsBet also has a deal with Maryland, and Superbook has one with the University of Denver.Individual states are moving to require what the association is doing on its own.The New York State Gaming Commission adopted rules in February prohibiting advertisements being sent to people under age 21, and banning the use of language such as “free” or “risk-free” in promotions — something most of the major sports books have already done on their own.Ohio recently fined three sports books for such terminology, and Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are among states that also ban its use. Ohio also fined DraftKings for sending direct mail advertisements to people younger than 21.New Jersey has a pending bill to prohibit sports book partnerships with public colleges or universities, and one that “condemns the over-proliferation of pro-gambling ads in New Jersey.""U.S. Rep Paul Tonko, a New York Democrat, has introduced a bill that would prohibit online and digital sports betting advertising.“In the years since the Supreme Court legalized sports betting, these unfettered advertisements have run rampant, with betting companies shelling out billions to ensure they reach every screen across America,"" he said. ""Congress must take the necessary steps to reel in an industry with the power to inflict real, widespread harm on the American people.”And on Monday, U.S. Sen Ric hard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, wrote to 66 colleges and universities asking for information on their efforts to form partnerships with sports books, to prevent underage gambling among students, and treat gambling addiction.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twiter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/03/28,,World

He said that by doing so, Sun changed China’s fate and paved the way for the country’s prosperity.He urged Taiwan and China to pursue peace and avoid war as they fight to “reinvigorate China,” calling it “the undeniable responsibility of Chinese across the strait.”In his speech, Ma also highlighted the fact that “it has been 112 years since (Sun) established the republic,” referring to the ROC calendar. While the calendar is still used by the Taiwan public and government, China claims that it, like the ROC itself, is obsolete.In addition to paying respect to Sun and giving a speech, Ma also inscribed in calligraphy the words, “Peacefully fight to reinvigorate China” and dated his work year 112 in addition to 2023.Chinese media coverage of Ma’s visit has been minimal, focusing on his itinerary as well as his urging for peace and unity and praise for Sun as a hero. However, Japanese media speculated that China’s willingness to interact with Kuomintang (KMT) officials, in contrast with its aggressive attitude towards the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), signals its attempt to divide Taiwanese society ahead of the upcoming presidential election.In Taiwan, though Ma’s trip to China was a highly controversial topic, discussion died down after his arrival in Shanghai on Monday (March 27).",2023/03/28,1960,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849415,Uncrewed Russian spacecraft that leaked coolant lands safely,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian space capsule safely returned to Earth without a crew Tuesday, months after it suffered a coolant leak in orbit.The Soyuz MS-22 leaked coolant in December while attached to the International Space Station. Russian space officials blamed the leak on a tiny meteoroid that punctured the craft's external radiator. They launched an empty replacement capsule last month to serve as a lifeboat for the crew.The damaged capsule safely landed Tuesday under a striped parachute in the steppes of Kazakhstan, touching down as scheduled at 5:45 p.m. (7:45 a.m. EDT) 147 kilometers (91 miles) southeast of Zhezkazgan under clear blue skies.Space officials determined it would be too risky to bring NASA’s Frank Rubio and Russia’s Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin back in the Soyuz in March as originally planned, as cabin temperatures would spike with no coolant, potentially damaging computers and other equipment, and exposing the suited-up crew to excessive heat.The three launched in September for what should have been a six-month mission on the International Space Station. They now are scheduled to return to Earth in September in a new Soyuz that arrived at the space outpost last month with no one on board, meaning the trio will spend a year in orbit.Also on the station are NASA astronauts Stephen Bowen and Woody Hoburg, the United Arab Emirates' Sultan Alneyadi, and Russia's Andrey Fedyaev.A similar coolant leak was spotted in February on the Russian Progress MS-21 cargo ship docked at the space outpost, raising suspicions of a manufacturing flaw. Russian state space corporation Roscosmos ruled out any defects after a check and concluded that both incidents resulted from hits by meteoroids,",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849416,"Myanmar junta dissolves Suu Kyi's party, much of opposition","BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military government took another major step in its ongoing campaign to cripple its political opponents on Wednesday, dissolving dozens of opposition parties including that of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi for failing to meet a registration deadline ahead of elections.Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, or NLD, was one of 40 parties ordered dissolved in an official announcement by the election commission published Wednesday in the state-controlled press. The NLD governed Myanmar with overwhelming majorities in Parliament from 2015 to 2021 before being overthrown by the military.The NLD had already announced that it would not register, denouncing the promised polls as a sham.The party, and other critics, say the still-unscheduled polls will be neither free nor fair in a military-ruled country that has shut free media and arrested most of the leaders of Suu Kyi’s party.The NLD won a landslide victory in the November 2020 election, but in February 2021, the army blocked all elected lawmakers from taking their seats in Parliament and seized power, detaining top members of Suu Kyi’s government and party.The army takeover was met with widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are embroiled in conflict.Suu Kyi, 77, is serving prison sentences totaling 33 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions brought by the military. Her supporters say the charges were contrived to prevent her from participating in politics.Kyaw Htwe, a member of the NLD’s Central Working Committee, told The Associated Press on Tuesday night that the party’s existence does not depend on what the military decides, and it “will exist as long as the people support it.”His statement was a reference to a message Suu Kyi sent to her supporters through her lawyers in May 2021 when she appeared in court in person for the first time after the military seized power, She said “Since the NLD was founded for the people, the NLD will exist as long as the people exist.″“The party will continue to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted by the people.” Kyaw Htwe said in a text message.The army said it staged its 2021 takeover because of massive poll fraud, though independent election observers did not find any major irregularities. Some critics of Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who led the takeover and is now Myanmar’s top leader, believe he acted because the vote thwarted his own political ambitions.The new polls had been expected by the end of July, according to the army’s own plans. But in February, the military announced a six-month extension of its state of emergency, delaying the possible legal date for holding an election. It said security could not be assured. The military does not control large swaths of the country, where it faces widespread armed resistance to its rule.“Amid the state oppression following the 2021 coup, no election can be credible, especially when much of the population sees a vote as a cynical attempt to supplant the landslide victory of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy in 2020,” said a report issued Tuesday by the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank.“The polls will almost certainly intensify the post-coup conflict, as the regime seeks to force them through and resistance groups seek to disrupt them.”The military government enacted a new political party registration law in January that makes it difficult for opposition groups to mount a serious challenge to the army’s favored candidates. It sets conditions such as minimum levels of membership and candidates and offices that any party without the backing of the army and its cronies would find hard to meet, especially in the repressive political atmosphere.The new law required existing political parties to re-apply for registration with the election commission by March 28.Ninety parties ran in the 2020 election, of which just under half have been dissolved. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper on Wednesday published the election commission's list of 50 existing parties that had registered by the Tuesday deadline, and 40 that had not, meaning they would be dissolved as of Wednesday.The surviving parties are unlikely to pose a meaningful electoral challenge to the junta: they won only a handful of seats in the 2020 election, and most will not mount national campaigns.“Among these 63 parties, 12 parties will launch election campaigns across the nation and 51 parties only in one region or state,” the state-run paper reported.The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, which ran a distant second to the NLD in 2015 and 2020, registered again. The Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, and NLD ally that won the third largest number of seats in 2020, did not.Thirteen new parties registered, and the announcement said the opportunity for new parties to register was still open.The National League for Democracy was founded in 1988 in the wake of a failed uprising against military rule. It won a 1990 general election that was invalidated by the country’s military rulers. It was technically banned after it boycotted a 2010 election held under military auspices because it felt it was not free or fair, but was allowed to register when it agreed to run in 2011. It took power after a landslide victory in the 2015 general election.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849417,Portugal: Refugee held as suspect in Muslim center stabbings,"LISBON, Portugal (AP) — A man wielding a large knife killed two women and injured several other people at an Ismaili Muslim center in Lisbon, and Portuguese police said they were investigating Tuesday's stabbing attack as a possible terror act.The women were Portuguese staff members at the center, Ismaili community leader Narzim Ahmad told Portuguese TV channel SIC. Local Afghan community representatives and Portuguese authorities described the man as a refugee from Afghanistan who was receiving help from the Ismaili Community.Officers dispatched to the center late Tuesday morning encountered a man armed with a knife, according to a police statement. The officers ordered him to surrender and he was shot when he advanced toward them, the statement said.A suspect was in police custody at a Lisbon hospital. Investigators were looking into terrorism as a possible motive. Several other people were wounded, according to the statement, which provided no further details.Millions of Afghans have fled violence and poverty in their country, often risking their lives to get to Europe.The suspect is a “young man” who arrived in Portugal through a European Union program that transfers asylum-seekers to member countries to help relieve pressure on Mediterranean nations such as Greece and Italy, Portuguese Interior Minister José Luis Carneiro said.While police told The Associated Press they were investigating the attack as a possible extremist act, Carneiro urged caution, saying any “hasty analysis” should be avoided.The minister said the man's wife died in a refugee camp in Greece, leaving him to care alone for three children, ages 9, 7 and 4. Authorities had no information indicating he had been violent in the past, Carnieiro said.“From what we know, he was a calm person who had received help from the Ismaili community in terms of knowledge of languages, knowledge, food care, care for younger children,” he said.Omer Taeri, president of the Association of the Afghan Community in Portugal, told CNN Portugal the suspect arrived in the country last year. He said the alleged attacker suffered from “psychological trauma” after the death of his wife and was worried about his children.Taeri asked for people to not “judge an entire community by one incident.”Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa said police shot the suspect and told reporters the attack was “a criminal act.”“Everything points to this being an isolated incident,” Costa said, without elaborating.Armed police from a special operations unit could formed a perimeter outside the building following the incident.The Shia Imami Ismaili Muslims, generally known as the Ismailis, belong to the Shia branch of Islam. The Ismaili Muslims are a culturally diverse community living in more than 25 countries around the world.Portugal hasn't recorded any significant terror attacks in recent decades, and religious violence is virtually unheard of.“The Ismaili community is shocked and saddened by this incident and is providing support to the families of the victims,” the Ismaili Community said in a statement. Neither police nor the community identified the women who died.___Joseph Wilson reported from Barcelona.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849418,Small businesses weigh banking options amid bank turmoil,"NEW YORK (AP) — Sarah Walker, owner of Nuance Interior Design Showroom in Bellevue, Washington, thought she had her banking arrangements fairly well protected. She kept deposits at Wells Fargo and a brokerage account at Fidelity under the federal insurance cap of $250,000.But after the recent banking turmoil, she moved about 5% of her total savings into Certificate of Deposits, or CDs, at Barclays. They offer 5% interest rates on deposits, much higher than traditional accounts, if a customers keeps money in the CDs for a year. She also invested more in Treasury bonds.“Those are two very stable things, we didn’t put a ton of money in them, but it’s more than a rainy day fund, it would cover us for a year,” she said. “I do feel better about having diversification. The unfortunate thing is there is only so much you can do.”The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and the bailout of First Republic, was a jolt for small businesses of all stripes, spurring many to scrutinize their banking services and mull whether or not they should make changes to ensure their money is safe. The turmoil in the banking sector just added to the uncertainty already caused by stubborn inflation and higher interest rates.Experts say it’s probably a good idea for small businesses to diversify funds and make sure they’re in close contact with their banker, but emphasized that in the short term their bank accounts are safe because regulators have shown they’re willing to step in when needed. And while big banks may seem like a safer option for their savings, regional and community banks have advantages too.“It’s certainly a good time to reevaluate your relationship with and diversification of assets amongst banks,” said Ori Epstein, technology tax partner at Aprio in Atlanta. Even if small businesses don’t need to shift their money now, it’s worth setting up a schedule for evaluating their banking services on a regular basis, he said.Nidah Barber-Raymond, owner of chemical peel company The Peel Connection in Beverly Hills, California, and New York, doesn’t plan on making any immediate changes to her banking at Bank of America, but said the bank collapses were a wake-up call.“It’s really scary,” she said. “It just opened up my eyes to the possibilities of things going very wrong in this country.After the collapse she initially considered putting her money in bonds because she thought that might be safer. But she consulted with her financial adviser who told her Bank of America was not at risk.Still, she worries that pressure on smaller banks might make it harder to get loans in the future.“It would be a shame not to be able to go to smaller banks should my business need capital in the future,” she said.Sanjyot Dunung, founder of Atma Global, which offers digital services that help companies communicate across countries and cultures, said the collapse gave her more confidence in her regional bank, TD Bank, since it isn’t focused on startups or fintech. She keeps more than $250,000 in the account but is hoping the FDIC raises its insurance cap. Still, she might move some funds to another bank.“The SVB (collapse) has made me think we should have an additional bank, perhaps one of the big banks, for broader diversification,” so that all of her money would be insured and because it’s safer to use more than one bank in case one goes under, she said.About 55% of small businesses use a large bank as a financial services provider and 43% use a small bank, according to The Federal Reserve’s 2022 Small Business Credit Survey. Twenty-four percent use a financial company that isn’t a bank, and 13% use a credit union.Randell Leach, CEO of Oakland, California-based Beneficial State Bank, said people should consider community banks and Community Development Financial Institutions, not just the big players, because those can align better with some small business’ goals.For example, his bank specializes in B Corps., for-profit corporations that are required by their shareholders to also produce a public benefit. And CDFIs focus on impoverished communities and can better service some small businesses that bigger banks would classify as “high-risk.”Community banks are “literally embedded in the community, they’re not out there doing financial engineering,” he said. “They’re literally trying to help keep local depositors’ money safe and invested in their own communities.”Scott Orn, chief operating office at Kruze Consulting, works with venture capital-backed startups and said about 55% of his clients had accounts at Silicon Valley Bank. They also bank at regional banks like First Republic and fintechs such as Brex.His frantic clients were relieved when the government stepped in and they were able to access their funds that had been at SVB and make payroll.“We are encouraging people to diversify and have a portfolio of banks,” he said. He said he understands that is easier to have loans and a dashboard for financial services all at one bank, but “I think everyone is going to diversify, that’s what we’re seeing across our client base is everyone is diversifying.”A review of finances and shoring up relationships with bankers is key now because the banking turmoil could help tip the U.S. economy in to a recession and a tighter credit market, said Curtis Dubay, chief economist, economic policy division at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Dubay expects credit creation to slow as the market determines which banks are in good financial position and which may not be.“So if we have an available line of credit that you tap to fund operations, that might be curtailed,"" he said. ""If you need to get a loan to get by an important new piece of equipment, it might be harder to find, it might be delayed longer than usual.”——This story has been corrected to show the first name of Beneficial State Bank's CEO is Randell, not Randall.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849419,French court refuses to extradite Italian former militants,"PARIS (AP) — France’s highest court ruled Tuesday against extraditing 10 former far-left militants who were convicted of attacks in Italy carried out in the 1970s and 1980s.The two women and eight men fled Italy after their convictions and before they could be sent to prison. Now ranging in age from 62 to 79, they have lived freely in France for decades.The crimes of which they were convicted include the killing of a Carabinieri paramilitary general and the kidnapping of a judge, both in 1980.A Paris court also had ruled against their extraditions, and the decision was appealed last year. But Tuesday’s decision by the Court of Cassation is the final French legal ruling on the decades-long affair.Italy’s justice minister, Carlo Nordio, said Italy “had done everything in its power” to remove the political obstacles that had guided the French policy allowing the militants to live freely in France, and took note of the court’s final decision.In a statement carried by LaPresse news agency, Nordio praised the efforts of his French counterpart, Eric Dupond-Moretti, for having responded to Italy’s requests for justice.Resistance by French authorities to incarcerating the Italians has long been a thorny issue between Paris and Rome.Over the years, Italy has sought the extradition of around 200 convicted former militants believed to be in France.Under a 1980s policy known as the “Mitterrand doctrine,” named after Socialist then-President Francois Mitterrand, France refused to extradite Italian far-left activists unless there was evidence that they committed “crimes of blood.”Italian officials have challenged that criteria as too vague and said the doctrine was based on the false notion that Italy respects democratic freedoms less than France.Most of the 10 people who were the subject of the extradition requests the Court of Cassation rejected were dramatically arrested at their homes in France in April, 2021, a development Italy hailed as historic. They were held in French judicial supervision since then.Some of them were linked with the Red Brigades group, which during the 1970s and 1980s carried out killings kidnappings and “kneecappings,” in which targets were shot in the legs.The court also refused to extradite Ciorgio Petrostefani, a militant from the far-left group Lotta Continua, which in English means The Struggle Continues. He was convicted of the 1972 slaying of Milan Police Chief Luigi Calabresi and sentenced to 22 years in prison.The police chief was shot three times from behind while he walked to his car. His slaying was one of the more notorious crimes during the so-called “Years of Lead,″ the period when acts of terrorism committed by the extreme right and the extreme left bloodied Italy.Before his death, Calabresi had led the interrogation of Giuseppe Pinelli, a suspected anarchist, about the 1969 bombing of a Milan bank that killed 17 people. Pinelli fell to his death from the 4th floor of police headquarters, an event that inspired a play and a movie.Another Italian whom the court cleared to remain in France was a former member of the Armed Cells Against Territorial Power who was convicted of the 1979 killing of a Carabinieri police officer.Adriano Sabbadin, whose father — a butcher — was killed in 1997, said he was “disgusted” by the French court’s decision. “Let the judges tell us: who are the guilty ones? They have dead people on their consciences,” the ANSA news agency quoted him as saying.The Italian justice minister Nordio, a former prosecutor, offered his thoughts to the families of the victims “of that bloody season, who waited for years along with the entire country for a response from the French judiciary.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849420,MI5 hikes Northern Ireland terror threat level to 'severe',"LONDON (AP) — The U.K.’s MI5 intelligence service on Tuesday raised the terrorism threat level in Northern Ireland’ to “severe” amid an increase in activity by dissident Irish republican militants.Severe is the second-highest rung on a five-point scale and means an attack is considered highly likely. The threat had stood one notch lower at “substantial” for the past year.Paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland laid down their arms after the 1998 Good Friday peace accord largely ended three decades of violent conflict between Irish republican and British loyalist groups and U.K. security forces that killed more than 3,600 people. But small Irish Republican Army splinter groups have continued to launch sporadic attacks on security forces.U.K. Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris said that “in recent months, we have seen an increase in levels of activity relating to Northern Ireland-related terrorism, which has targeted police officers serving their communities and also put at risk the lives of children and other members of the public.”He urged people to “remain vigilant but not be alarmed.”Last month, senior police officer John Caldwell was shot by two masked men as he coached a children’s soccer team in the town of Omagh, about 60 miles (nearly 100 kilometers) west of Belfast. Police say he suffered life-changing injuries.An IRA splinter group known as the New IRA claimed responsibility.The change to the threat level comes ahead of events commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday agreement.U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to visit Northern Ireland to mark the anniversary. Major players in the peace process, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair, are also due in Belfast for commemorative events.The threat level for the rest of the U.K. remains at substantial, meaning an attack is considered likely.",2023/03/28,,World

COVID-19 testing also fell more than 90% and sales of at-home tests dropped as well.Analysts expected those declines compared to last year, when the omicron variant of the coronavirus was surging.Walgreens also booked in the recently completed second quarter a $306 million pretax charge for opioid claims and some expenses tied to cost cutting and an acquisition.The chain also saw prescriptions grow more than 3%, excluding immunizations, in its biggest business segment, U.S. drugstores.Rising drug prices and better staffing at the company's drugstores helped pharmacy sales, Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said in a research note.Quarterly net income tumbled 20% overall to $703 million. Adjusted earnings were $1.16 per share, which is 6 cents better than expected, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.Sales climbed 3% to $34.86 billion, which was also better than expected.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. runs a network of around 13,000 drugstores globally, with most of its locations in the United States. Its stores also have become a growing source for care.The company is opening primary care practices next to some locations with the goal of having drugstores and doctor offices work together to help keep patients healthy instead of just treating them when they become sick.That’s an approach that is growing popular with bill payers like employers and insurers.But the drugstore chain and its competitors are struggling to find enough employees to run its U.S. pharmacy counters. Walgreens has had to reduce pharmacy operating hours. The company said Tuesday that it returned about 500 stores to normal hours in the recently completed quarter. But around 1,900 still were affected.Company leaders told analysts on Tuesday that some stores will still be operating with reduced hours by the end of the company's fiscal year in August.Walgreens also said that it was maintaining a full-year forecast it first laid out last fall for adjusted earnings ranging between $4.45 and $4.65 per share. FactSet says analysts expect $4.50 per share.Mizuho Securities analyst Ann Hynes said in a recent note that the company’s forecast is back-end loaded, and she didn't expect the company to change it this early in the fiscal year.The Deerfield, Illinois, company’s shares climbed 3% to $33.97 Tuesday morning while broader indexes slipped.The price of Walgreens shares tumbled about 28% last year, tripling the decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which Walgreens is a component.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849422,Amnesty: West's 'double standards' fuel Mideast repression,"BEIRUT (AP) — A leading international rights group on Tuesday decried what it said were double standards by Western countries that have rallied behind a “robust response” to Russia's invasion of Ukraine but remain “lukewarm"" on issues of human rights violations in the Middle East.According to Amnesty International, such double standards only fuel further repression for millions in the region.The sharp rebuke came as the London-based watchdog launched its annual report at a news conference at its office in Beirut, Lebanon's capital. Every year, the report documents and analyzes patterns of human rights violations and abuses across the world.In the report, Amnesty urged the international community to hold perpetrators of human rights abuses in the Middle East and North Africa to account, and to address the issue of migration without discrimination.“They immediately opened their borders to receive refugees from Ukraine,” Aya Majzoub, Amnesty's deputy chief for Mideast and North Africa, said of Western nations. She said that's in stark contrast to how the same countries generally treat refugees and migrants trying to flee war-torn Syria, the chaos in Libya or Lebanon's economic meltdown.The number of attempts by migrants to enter the European Union without authorization reached around 330,000 in 2022, the highest in five years. In 2015, over 1 million people, mostly Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict, reached Europe.Germany received accolades for welcoming large numbers of Syrian refugees at the time, and the U.S. and European countries frequently point out the billions of dollars they have given in aid to help refugees and internally displaced Syrians.Today, many European governments are calling for reforms to the asylum-seeking system for better efficiency and to distinguish between refugees fleeing war and persecution and migrants searching for job opportunities, who they say are creating a strain on the asylum system and should be returned.Majzoub spoke to The Associated Press in an interview after the news conference. She praised the international community for denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attacks against civilians in Ukraine, including systematic torture and killing in occupied regions — which a U.N.-backed inquiry earlier this month said amount to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.But such a strong response was lacking during Syria's 12-year-old brutal civil war. “That’s perpetuated the culture of impunity and empowered Putin to commit the crimes that he was committing in Ukraine,” she said.Amnesty's report said Middle Eastern governments took advantage of the situation over the past year and doubled down on repressing dissidents while neglecting obligations to respond to economic crises.The group condemned Iranian authorities for detaining over 20,000 people who took part in monthslong anti-government protests that erupted last September, following the death of a young woman in the custody of the country's morality police.Amnesty's report also did not spare oil-rich Saudi Arabia for “changing its image to win over foreign investment” in a public relations campaign while continuing to crack down on activists promoting women's rights.Amnesty also criticized Israel for its ongoing raids on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, with the past months being among the deadliest in years.In tiny Lebanon, Amnesty chastised the authorities for escalating rhetoric against Syrian refugees and the queer community — instead of undertaking badly needed economic reforms for an International Monetary Fund bailout package.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849423,"Care, 'magic' help DC's cherry blossom trees defy age","Peak bloom has arrived for the thousands of Japanese cherry blossom trees at the National Mall in Washington, and the area is awash in magnificent pink and white.Predicting the timing of peak bloom — defined as when 70% of the blossoms have opened — has been getting harder. In the 1920s, the average peak bloom was April 5. That moved up to March 31 in recent years, and the 2023 peak arrived yet a week earlier, according to the National Park Service on Thursday.“I’m feeling like this is going to be the trend” due to climate change, said Matthew Morrison, the park service's urban forester charged with overseeing the trees' care.The annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, which runs through April 16, celebrates Japan’s 1912 gift of 3,020 cherry trees to the city of Washington.Two of those trees were planted by First Lady Helen Herron Taft and Viscountess Chinda, wife of the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, with just a few onlookers present. That small gathering became the origin of the festival, which officially launched 23 years later, in 1934.The average lifespan of a Japanese cherry tree falls roughly between 30 and 40 years, depending on variety, yet the two trees planted by Taft and Chinda and a handful of other trees are still standing 111 years later.“That defies science,” said Morrison, who attributes the anomaly to “a little bit of magic tied to this wonderful gift,” and the attentive, year-round care his team provides.Many of the 3,700 trees blooming at the 146-acre park today are offspring of the originals, cultivated from clippings, Morrison said. Others are regularly donated by the Casey Trees philanthropic group of Washington.Morrison oversees a team of just three arborists charged with caring for the cherry trees, and keeps a “personal health record” for each.The arborists, armed with climbing gear, ladders and chippers, visit each tree to provide pruning and other care. They record their findings in a database.Three years ago, Morrison introduced the practice of mulching the trees with “copious amounts of wood chips” to create the most beneficial growing conditions possible. As the chips decompose, he said, they release beneficial fungi and bacteria that connect the trees' root systems and “allow them to communicate with one another and transport nutrients to each other, so now they function as one super-organism.”The wood chips also serve as a physical barrier between the lawn and the trees, eliminating the mower and string-trimmer injuries that have plagued their lower trunks for years.Morrison recommends the same practice for homeowners growing trees in their own yards. When wood chips are applied over the root zones, he said, “you can pretty much turn your back on the tree,” adding that “it would never need any fertilizer, amendments” or supplemental water.“Even on the hottest days of summer when it hasn’t rained, I dig down in the wood chips and find moisture,” he said.For best results, Morrison advises adding 6 inches of fresh wood chips around trees. “That 6 inches will compress to 3½ or 4 inches, and that’s a good level to maintain,” he said, adding that the chips will smother grass and weeds so can be applied right over them.More tips from Morrison:— Keep wood chips at least 3-4 inches away from tree trunks. Ideally, extend them as far over the soil as the branches reach overhead, but, if necessary, a smaller application can be made on smaller properties to avoid mulching the entire yard.— If grass grows through the wood chips, use a metal rake to fluff them up or cover the breakthrough growth with more chips.— Finally, learn proper pruning techniques, and prune away dead or diseased wood every winter while the tree is dormant.Morrison also recommends the Yoshino cultivar (that of most of the National Mall's cherry blossom trees) to homeowners.“It’s one of the best growers and the best to flower,” he said. “Kwanzan cherry also is a good grower and gets a little bigger than Yoshino.”Before selecting a tree to grow at home, however, Morrison recommends finding your local plant hardiness zone and researching which types will grow best in your region.As for the National Cherry Blossom Festival, it spans five weekends and includes a roster of events throughout Washington and its suburbs, including a Japanese street festival, 5K and 10-mile runs, fireworks, food fairs and more.

(AP) — Six people were killed at a small, private Christian school just south of downtown Nashville on Monday after a shooter opened fire inside the building of about 200 students, police said.Police received a call about an active shooter at The Covenant School — a Presbyterian school — around 10:15 a.m. Authorities said that about 15 minutes after that call to police, the shooter was dead. The remaining students were ferried to a safe location to be reunited with their parents.Here's what we know and don't know about the shooting:HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE KILLED?Nashville police said six people, including three students, were killed. The victims were identified as Cynthia Peak, 61; Katherine Koonce, 60; Mike Hill, 61; and Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all age 9. Police officers also killed the shooter.The website of The Covenant School, founded in 2001, lists a Katherine Koonce as the head of the school. Her LinkedIn profile says she has led the school since July 2016. Peak was a substitute teacher, and Hill was a custodian, according to investigators.On Tuesday night, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Peak was a close friend of his wife, Maria, and that the two had been scheduled to have dinner after Peak taught that day.___WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE NASHVILLE SHOOTER?Police gave unclear information on the shooter's gender. For hours, police identified the shooter as a 28-year-old woman and eventually as Audrey Hale. Then at a late afternoon press conference, the police chief said that Hale was transgender. After the news conference, police spokesperson Don Aaron declined to elaborate on how Hale identified.In an email Tuesday, police spokesperson Kristin Mumford said Hale “was assigned female at birth. Hale did use male pronouns on a social media profile.”Police said Hale was a former student of the school, but it was unclear if Hale had any current affiliation with the school or was related to anyone in the school at the time of the shooting. Police said the shooter had made a detailed map of the school and conducted surveillance of the building before carrying out the massacre.Police said Hale had two “assault-style” weapons and a pistol when Hale shot through the front door to enter the building. Police said Tuesday that Hale had legally purchased seven firearms from five different stores in the Nashville area.Investigators found a sawed-off shotgun, a second shotgun and other unspecified evidence during a search of Hale’s home. Police Chief John Drake said Hale's parents were unaware that Hale had obtained most of the weapons. They told police Hale was under a doctor's care for an undisclosed emotional disorder, Drake said. Hale's parents also said they believed Hale had only purchased one gun and had sold it.___HOW WAS THE NASHVILLE SHOOTER KILLED?A team of five Nashville police officers entered the school after the initial call, said Aaron, the police spokesperson. While clearing the first floor of students and staff, they heard shots being fired on the second floor.Two of the officers opened fire in response and fatally struck Hale at about 10:27 a.m., police said. Police identified Rex Engelbert, a four-year member of the force, and Michael Collazo, a nine-year member, as the officers who fatally shot Hale.___WHAT VIDEOS HAVE BEEN RELEASED AND WHAT DO THEY SHOW?Police released body camera footage Tuesday from two officers that showed a team of Nashville Police SWAT officers briefly speaking to a staff member outside before entering the building and searching several classrooms quickly. They then rush toward the second floor where gunshots could be heard.Officers are heard yelling commands, followed by a barrage of gunfire. Shortly after, an officer yells for Hale to stop moving and “get your hands away from the gun.” Hale, whose face and injuries are blurred in the released footage, is seen laying on the floor motionless.The six-minute video supplements a release late Monday, of about two minutes of edited surveillance footage that shows the shooter’s car driving up to the school, glass doors being shot out and the shooter ducking through one of them.___DO WE KNOW THE MOTIVE?Investigators were sent to the shooter's home shortly after Hale was killed, police said. Hale had a map of the school with a planned route for the shooting, and officers found writings, police said.No motive has been confirmed by police, but officials said Hale targeted the school, not any particular individual killed in the shooting.Chief Drake said officers found writings that detailed the plan to attack the school and potentially other locations. He said in an interview with NBC News that investigators believe the shooter had “some resentment for having to go to that school.”___HOW MANY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS HAVE THERE BEEN SINCE COLUMBINE?There have been 15 mass shootings at schools or universities in the U.S. since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Mass shootings are defined as more than four people dying, not including the perpetrator, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University, in addition to other AP reporting:Of those 15 shootings, 175 people have died, the data shows.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849425,Wyoming abortion clinic fire suspect to go free pending case,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — She posted on social media about competing in a bike race, losing her pet hedgehog and visiting a butterfly garden with her grandmother but gave no sign of the anti-abortion views investigators say drove her to set fire to a Wyoming abortion clinic.On Tuesday, a judge ruled that Lorna Roxanne Green may be released from jail to carry on life as a college student pending further developments in her case, U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick ruled.“I believe the weight of the evidence is strong,” said Hambrick, a substitute judge in the case who's based in Yellowstone National Park and who presided over Green's detention hearing by video link broadcast in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne.Green, who waived her right to a preliminary hearing, won't need to post bond but would owe $10,000 for violating bond conditions.Those conditions include living with her parents in Casper while attending college and working part time as a food delivery driver. Her parents must remove firearms from their home.Appearing by video link from jail, Green made few comments except to say she was a full-time student almost halfway toward her bachelor's degree. She asked if she could have her phone back to work her delivery job; her attorney, Ryan Semerad, said she'd talk to her about that.“Lorna’s family and I are pleased she’s being released and we look forward to addressing the charge against her in future proceedings,"" Semerad told The Associated Press after the hearing.Police in Casper — where the Wellspring Health Access clinic has yet to open since the May 25 fire kept it from opening as planned last summer — arrested Green on March 21. Over the previous nine months, the case had grown cold.Then, after a $10,000 anonymous donation increased the reward in the case from $5,000 to $15,000 earlier this month, several tipsters came forward, according to investigators.Some allegedly identified Green and she told U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agent Matthew Wright the clinic was giving her anxiety and nightmares so she decided to burn it, according to Wright's statement filed in court.Wright said Green told him about driving from Laramie, where she was living at the time, to break into the clinic with gasoline, which she poured on the floor and lit, according to the statement.Public records and Green's Instagram account show no sign of opposition to abortion that may have motivated the crime.Green was a high school and community college honors student interested in science and math. On Instagram, she posted about a March 14, 2022, party celebrating the number pi — 3.14 — where pies and other round treats were served.Four days before the fire, Green posted photos of butterflies she said she'd taken at an Ames, Iowa, garden she'd visited with her grandmother.Then, 10 days after the fire, Green posted about competing in a 60-mile (100-kilometer) gravel-road bike race outside Sheridan, Wyoming. She finished 185th out of 247 participants, according to the race results.In September, she posted about losing her pet hedgehog, Hedgie, in her backyard. And in December, she posted a Casper College commercial in which she was an actor. Green has attended Casper College part time for several years and the ad hasn’t been released, according to Christopher Lorenzen, a spokesperson for the community college.In 2021, Green posted a photo of herself and a sister sitting outside on a car hood, each holding a rifle and a pistol in a pose typical of Wyoming's many families who like to target shoot and hunt.The clinic was scheduled to open as the only facility of its kind in the state, offering women’s health care, family planning and gender-affirming health care in addition to abortion services.The clinic underwent repairs from the fire and was finally set to open next month, but those plans were thrown into doubt after Gov. Mark Gordon allowed a broad new abortion ban to take effect on Sunday without his signature. On Wednesday, Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens halted enforcement of the ban after a hearing in which abortion-rights supporters said it harms pregnant women and their doctors, and violates the state constitution.Owens suspended the ban for at least two weeks. Meanwhile, the state’s first-in-the-nation ban on abortion pills remains set to take effect in July but also faces a court challenge.",2023/03/29,,World

                                              Anti-snoring Devices and Snoring Surgery Market
Market Insights:
The Anti-Snoring Devices and Snoring Surgery market has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by an increase in awareness of the health risks associated with snoring and sleep apnea, as well as a growing demand for effective treatments.










Anti-snoring devices include a range of products such as nasal strips, mouthguards, and chin straps that work by either opening up the airway or repositioning the jaw to reduce snoring. The market for these devices is expected to continue to grow as more people seek non-invasive solutions to snoring.
Snoring surgery, on the other hand, involves a range of procedures designed to permanently address the underlying causes of snoring, such as excess tissue in the throat or a deviated septum. The most common snoring surgery is uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), which involves removing excess tissue from the throat to open up the airway. Other surgical options include laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and somnoplasty.
While snoring surgery is generally more effective than anti-snoring devices, it is also more invasive and carries more risks. As a result, it is typically reserved for cases of severe snoring or sleep apnea that cannot be effectively treated with other methods.
The market for anti-snoring devices and snoring surgery is expected to continue to grow as more people seek effective solutions to snoring and sleep apnea. However, the market may also be affected by factors such as changes in healthcare policies and reimbursement rates, as well as advances in technology and new treatments for snoring and sleep apnea.

Other surgical options include laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and somnoplasty.While snoring surgery is generally more effective than anti-snoring devices, it is also more invasive and carries more risks. As a result, it is typically reserved for cases of severe snoring or sleep apnea that cannot be effectively treated with other methods.The market for anti-snoring devices and snoring surgery is expected to continue to grow as more people seek effective solutions to snoring and sleep apnea. However, the market may also be affected by factors such as changes in healthcare policies and reimbursement rates, as well as advances in technology and new treatments for snoring and sleep apnea.The overall Anti-snoring Devices and Snoring Surgery market report, which includes revenue, market procedures, and market analysis, provides a thorough and detailed assessment of the market as well as projections for the future.

                                                                         Antiemetics Market
Market Insights:
An antiemetic drug prevents nausea and vomiting. These drugs are often used to treat the side effects of opioid painkillers, general anesthetics, or chemotherapy. It is used to treat symptoms such as motion sickness, dizziness, nausea, and food poisoning. It can also be used for gastroenteritis, particularly if the patient has been dehydrated. They are also helpful for pregnant women who experience morning sickness in the first phase of their pregnancy.










The key factor driving the market growth is the increasing number of gastroenteritis sufferers. Also, an increase in surgeries and healthcare expenditure due to rising disposable incomes, rising numbers of lifestyle diseases, rising health consciousness, and rising number of hospitals around the world have made it possible for people to access surgeries. These are all major factors. In the 2023-2033 forecast, the antiemetics market will be boosted by technological advances and modernization in healthcare. Research and development activities are also increasing.
The market growth will be impeded by the lack of an animal model that mimics human reactions to antiemetic therapy. This will also impact the growth of the antiemetic market over the forecast period.
The antiemetics market is expected to grow steadily in the coming years due to the increasing prevalence of cancer and chemotherapy, as well as the growing use of antiemetics in surgeries and for treating other conditions that cause nausea and vomiting. In addition, the introduction of new and improved antiemetic drugs, including those with better efficacy and fewer side effects, is also expected to drive market growth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849505,EU defends its Libya migrant work as UN points the finger,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Tuesday defended its work with migrants in Libya after U.N.-backed investigators accused the 27-nation bloc of abetting human rights abuses and other crimes in the largely lawless north African country.Libya is a major departure point for people from northern Africa and elsewhere desperate enough to make the perilous Mediterranean Sea crossing in poorly maintained boats in search of better lives or sanctuary in Europe.At least 529 migrants were reported dead and 848 others missing off Libya last year, according to the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM). More than 24,680 people were intercepted by the Libyan coastguard as they tried to leave.Presenting a report on Monday by a U.N.-commissioned fact-finding mission to Libya, investigator Chaloka Beyani said that EU assistance to Libya's migration department and the coastguard “has aided and abetted the commission of the crimes,” including crimes against humanity.The report said that migrants, some of whom might have been eligible for asylum, “were apprehended, detained, and disembarked in Libya solely to prevent their entry into Europe as a corollary of both European immigration policy and the economic agenda of migration in Libya via their subsequent detention and exploitation.”The EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, said it takes the allegations “very seriously” but insists that its work in Libya is vital and done in coordination with U.N. agencies like the IOM and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.“Not doing anything is not an answer. And our objective, our joint objective, is to help to improve the situation of the people stranded in Libya,” commission spokesman Peter Stano said.“Of course, there are incidents. There are issues which are a source of concern. We try to address them with the partners in Libya, with the international partners,” Stano told reporters in Brussels. He said the EU’s Libya mission had cooperated with the investigators.The arrival in 2015 of well over one million people, many of them fleeing war in Syria, overwhelmed reception centers in Greece and Italy. It sparked one of the EU's biggest ever political crises.Nations bickered over who should take responsibility for the migrants and whether they all should be obliged to help the EU countries that people entered. That dispute continues today. Several members, Austria, Hungary and Slovenia among them, erected razor-wire fences and other barriers.The new report underlined that investigators believe the EU “directly or indirectly, provided monetary and technical support and equipment, such as boats, to the Libyan Coast Guard and the Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration,” which were then used to catch and detain migrants.But Stano rejected suggestions that the EU would pay to keep migrants in Libya.“We are not financing any Libyan entity. We are not giving physical money to partners in Libya,” he said. “What we are doing is allocating a lot of money, which is then usually used by our international partners. A lot goes through the U.N., for example.”Earlier this month, the commission confirmed that a new boat was recently handed over for coastguard duties in Libya. Two more new boats and an undisclosed number of refurbished ones will also be delivered.At the same time, the EU has refurbished six other boats for Libya’s General Administration of Coastal Security, which is separate to the coastguard. In February, Italy supplied two more fast boats to this GACS fleet. The commission said Tuesday that 142 GACS officers have now received EU training.Italy, where most people leaving Libya arrive, has received at least 15 million euros ($16.3 million) in EU money to fund migration and border control work there.Last year, in answer to a question from the European Parliament, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said that “the EU has devoted around EUR 700 million ($760 million) to Libya during 2014-20, including EUR 59 million ($64 million)” for the coastguard and GACS.Spanish EU lawmaker Sira Rego, from the Left group, said that “for years the EU has allowed slavery in refugee detention camps in Libya, has been aware of the atrocities being committed there against migrants, and yet has continued to implement racist migration policies.""In Greece, meanwhile, a voluntary scheme by EU members to accept unaccompanied migrant children from the country officially ended Tuesday, raising concern over the future of minors traveling alone until long-delayed asylum reforms are hammered out.EU lawmakers have finalized the parliament's negotiating position on the reforms, and hope that nations can agree on the way ahead before the next European elections in May 2024.___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849506,Alibaba to split itself into 6 business groups,"NEW YORK (AP) — Alibaba is splitting itself into into six business groups as the Chinese e-commerce company attempts to become more nimble in reacting to changes in the market and increase the value of those units.U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. jumped 14% to close at $98.40.Alibaba Group said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that the six new groups will be made up of the Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao Tmall Business Group, Local Services Group, Global Digital Business Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media and Entertainment Group.The company said that each group will be able to raise outside capital and potentially seek its own initial public offering, except for Taobao Tmall Business Group, which will stay wholly-owned by Alibaba. Each group will be independently managed by its own CEO and board of directors.The Cloud Intelligence Group includes cloud, AI and DingTalk. The Taobao Tmall Business Group includes Taobao, Tmall, Taobao Deals, Taocaicai and 1688.com. The Local Services Group includes Amap and Ele.me, while the Global Digital Business Group (including Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol, Daraz and Alibaba.com. The Digital Media and Entertainment Group includes Youku and Alibaba Pictures.Alibaba has faced increased competition from short-video platforms such as Douyin and Kuaishou which also offer e-commerce services on their platforms. Its U.S.-listed stock has also been on the decline since a regulatory crackdown on the technology industry in November 2020 that saw regulators halt the IPO of its financial arm Ant Group and crack down on anticompetitive practices across the technology industry.On Monday Alibaba founder Jack Ma resurfaced in China after months of overseas travel. Ma founded Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China’s richest man. He has kept a low profile with few public appearances since Nov. 2020, when he had publicly criticized China’s regulators and financial systems during a speech in Shanghai.The Chinese government has been seeking to raise confidence in the private sector after regulatory crackdowns, on technology, education, online gaming and financial companies, and harsh COVID-19 restrictions slowed the economy.Ma stepped down as Alibaba chairman in 2019, saying he hoped to focus on philanthropy. In January, he ceded control of Ant, the financial technology firm, amid a revamp of its shareholding structure.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849507,US makes corporate transparency commitment with 20 nations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen affirmed America’s commitment to enhancing corporate transparency along with more than 20 other countries participating in this week's Summit for Democracy.While the Biden administration is already working to establish a new database on small business ownership, Yellen pledged Tuesday that her department would maintain the database, known as the beneficial ownership registry, and would ensure that law enforcement will have access and that individuals’ personal data will be protected.“The beneficial ownership database will deter dirty money from entering the U.S.,” Yellen said in a speech before the summit began.The registry will contain personal information on the owners of at least 32 million U.S. businesses as part of an effort to combat corruption.Colombia, Malta and Japan are some of the countries included in the commitment.“Unmasking shell corporations is the single most significant thing we can do to make our financial system inhospitable to corrupt actors,” Yellen said. She added that efforts with allies over the last year to track sanctioned Russian assets have “underscored our vulnerability"" in tracking business ownership.The United States is making the push to combat illicit finance, in part, as a response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as the U.S. tries to more easily identify wealthy Russians who are accused of hiding stolen money and assets in the United States and around the world.The two-day summit opens Wednesday. The U.S. is co-hosting it with the governments of Costa Rica, the Netherlands, South Korea and Zambia.Last September, Treasury began rulemaking to create the small business ownership database. The rule will require most American businesses with fewer than 20 employees to register with the government as of Jan. 1, 2024.“We have seen corrupt foreign officials bury stolen funds in U.S.-based shell companies; kleptocrats launder kickbacks through anonymous purchases of foreign real estate; and elites move corrupt proceeds through complicit or unwitting financial gatekeepers like attorneys or wealth managers,"" Yellen said.The National Small Business Association filed a lawsuit in November to stop the U.S. database from being created, arguing that it is unduly burdensome on small firms and infringes on states’ rights to regulate businesses.Nate Sibley, a research fellow with Hudson Institute’s Kleptocracy Initiative said the “beneficial ownership registry, properly implemented, is an essential and long overdue tool for tackling money laundering and sanctions evasion.””It’s absurd that the U.S. promulgates the most aggressive global sanctions and law enforcement campaigns but can’t see who is burying money in its own backyard,"" Sibley said.Ian Gary, executive director of the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition said the Biden administration should also move to ""put in place new regulations to tackle the scourge of money laundering in the $50 trillion U.S. real estate sector.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849508,Russia convicts father of teen who drew antiwar picture,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — A Russian court on Tuesday convicted a single father over social media posts critical of the war in Ukraine and sentenced him to two years in prison — a case brought against him after his daughter’s drawing at school opposed the invasion, according to his lawyer and activists.But Alexei Moskalyov fled house arrest before his verdict was delivered in his Russian hometown of Yefremov and is at large, court officials said. His 13-year-old daughter Maria, who has been taken from him by the authorities, wrote him a supportive letter for his trial from the orphanage where she is living, according to his lawyer, telling him, “Daddy, you’re my hero.”Moskalyov’s case has drawn international attention and was a grim reminder that the Kremlin is intensifying its crackdown on dissent, targeting more people and handing out harsher punishments for any criticism of the war. The broad government campaign of repression has been unseen since the Soviet era.Moskalyov, 54, was accused of repeatedly discrediting the Russian army, a criminal offense in accordance to a law Russian authorities adopted shortly after sending troops into Ukraine.He was indicted for a series of social media posts about Russian atrocities in Ukraine and referencing the “terrorist” regime in Moscow that he insists he didn't make. But, according to his lawyer and activists who supported him throughout the case and trial, his troubles started last spring after his 13-year-old daughter, Maria, drew an antiwar picture at Yefremov School No. 9 that depicted missiles flying over a Russian flag at a woman and child and said, “Glory to Ukraine.”In April 2022, Moskalyov was fined for critical comments on social media. His apartment was raided in December and a criminal case was opened against him this month. He was placed under house arrest and his daughter was placed into the orphanage.At the trial, which concluded in one day on Monday, three teachers and the director of Maria's school testified that they found Moskalyov's “discrediting” social media posts at random and that Maria's drawing had nothing to do with the case — contradicting the accounts of his lawyer and other supporters. Men in military uniforms and medals showed up at the courthouse Monday, apparently in support of the authorities.Moskalyov rejected the accusations and insisted he had nothing to do with the social media posts in question.In a short closing statement, Moskalyov said he was “against” what the Kremlin insists on calling a “special military operation.”“How can one feel about death, about people who are dying? Adults are dying, children. ... Only negatively — how else can one feel about a war?” he was quoted as saying by Russia's independent news site Mediazona.Court officials said Moskalyov fled house arrest overnight from his apartment in Yefremov, about 300 kilometers (about 186 miles) south of Moscow and a similar distance north of the Ukrainian border. He had been wearing a bracelet that tracked his movements but apparently had taken it off.When an official announced in court Tuesday that Moskalyov had fled, some in attendance shouted, “Bravo!”Moskalyov's lawyer Vladimir Biliyenko said he learned of his client's disappearance at the hearing. Moskalyov was scheduled to appear in court again next week on a petition to restrict his parental rights.Biliyenko told The Associated Press the authorities' petition to restrict Moskalyov's parental rights was based almost solely on his political views and his prosecution for discrediting the army, which they said posed a threat to his daughter.The officials have also accused Moskalyov of being a negligent parent because Maria stopped attending school after her drawing was reported to the police and she was questioned. According to Biliyenko and Moskalyov's supporters, she was scared to go back after that and studied at home.The lawyer described the prosecution of Moskalyov as “bullying of the family.”The lawyer visited Maria in the orphanage Tuesday and told reporters that while he wasn't able to see her, local administrators allowed him to photograph a letter she wrote to her father, which ended with, “Daddy, you're my hero.” Biliyenko also was given two drawings Maria made, depicting a dog and rabbits.Olga Podolskaya, a member of Yefremov's municipal council who has been helping Moskalyov, told AP that father and the daughter clearly love each other, and the decision to take Maria away was politically motivated. Maria's mother left when the girl was 3 and has another family in a different city, Podolskaya told AP by phone.Podolskaya said the news that Moskalyov escaped house arrest shocked her.“We're all really worried, including Alexei's lawyer,” she said, adding that the hope now was for other relatives to seek custody of Maria.Biliyenko said after the hearing that he tried calling Moskalyov after his visit to the orphanage, but he wasn't answering his phone. “I thought that he was being brought here (to the courthouse), because they usually arrive in advance,” he said.Russian human rights activists say the Kremlin has ramped up pressure on those who disagree with the war. The OVD-Info rights group that tracks political cases and provides legal aid this month has registered an increase in prison sentences for people prosecuted for their antiwar stance, said Daria Korolenko, the group's lawyer and analyst.“Repressions are picking up speed,” Korolenko told AP in a phone interview, adding that the numbers are expected to continue growing.Also on Tuesday, a court in St. Petersburg continued a hearing in the case against Irina Tsibaneva, 60, who is charged with desecrating a grave. In October she left a note on the grave of President Vladimir Putin's parents that said, among other things: “You raised a monster and a killer.” She faces up to five years in prison if convicted.Earlier this month, a court in the nearby region of Tver sentenced a married couple to 6 1/2 and 7 years in prison on charges of vandalism and spreading false information about the army. According to OVD-Info, Alexander Martynov and Lyudmila Razumova were charged after critical social media posts and antiwar and antigovernment slogans they allegedly wrote on buildings.In Moscow last week, police raided two bars suspected of raising funds for Ukraine's military. According to media reports, police played patriotic songs and forced the guests to sing along during the raid. At least 40 people were briefly detained.Another recent raid in the capital targeted an event dedicated to the jailed artist Sasha Skochilenko, who is on trial for spreading false information about the army. The event's participants reported being beaten by police or threatened with rape.In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, a court reversed the acquittal of a feminist artist who was tried on charges of disseminating pornography after she shared artwork online of women's bodies. Yulia Tsevtkova’s case drew international outrage and ended in a rare acquittal last year after fears she would be sent to prison. Tsvetkova has since left Russia; a new trial has been ordered for her case.In Yefremov, Yelena Agafonova, an activist who has been helping the Moskalyov family, told AP after the trial that anyone can run afoul of authorities these days with their comments.“Perhaps your children will express their opinion somewhere. Perhaps your children will laugh at something somewhere, and they will be in exactly the same situation in which this family is now,” she said. ""Perhaps a neighbor, who thinks they saw something (untoward), will report on you. So while you are lying on the couch, this will all happen more, and more, and more.”___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849509,Posters near Vatican urge pope to stop Latin Mass crackdown,"ROME (AP) — Posters calling on Pope Francis to stop his crackdown on the old Latin Mass were plastered around the Vatican on Tuesday, in the latest display of conservative opposition to the pontiff.The posters featured images of Pope Benedict XVI and St. John Paul II and quoted from their texts speaking positively about the old rite, which Francis has sought to restrict.“For the love of the pope. For peace and unity of the church. For the free practice of the traditional Latin Mass,” the posters read.They were referring to Francis’ decision in 2021 to overturn one of Benedict’s signature liturgical decisions and reimpose restrictions on celebrating the old Mass. Francis said he had to act because the spread of the old rite was dividing parishes. He said Benedict’s decision to liberalize its use in 2007 had been exploited by people opposed to the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that allowed for Mass in the vernacular, not just Latin.The poster initiative, which is due to last 15 days, was taken by a group of pro-Latin Mass activists and bloggers who said they feared Francis’ ultimate aim was to forbid the ancient rite entirely. After Francis' initial decree restricting the celebration, the Vatican's liturgy office has issued two subsequent clarifications making it tougher to celebrate it widely.In a statement, the traditionalist groups said they were being unjustly marginalized and rejected by the Catholic hierarchy for merely expressing their steadfast faith. They said they were taking action “out of love for the pope, so that he might be paternally opened to understanding those liturgical peripheries that no longer feel welcome in the church.""The initiative was a reflection of the growing opposition to Francis from some traditionalist quarters in the Catholic Church who remain nostalgic for the doctrinaire papacy of Benedict. While only a fraction of Catholics go to old Latin Masses, Francis' crackdown has become a rallying cry for other conservatives opposed to his progressive bent.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849510,Queen and Adam Lambert eager for their post-pandemic tour,"NEW YORK (AP) — Queen and Adam Lambert are hitting the road this fall for a North American expansion of their Rhapsody Tour, with a freshly minted knight onstage and plenty of post-pandemic energy.The band boasts about a new production with a some new songs added to the setlist and a few surprises that members won't reveal, the product of plenty of time to think about the way the tour looks and sounds.“We do constantly try and keep ourselves interested because it’s nice to change the show around, even in small ways,” says drummer Roger Taylor. “Obviously we do some sort of deep cuts whilst at the same time keeping the big hits that everybody knows. People want to see what they know. But it’s nice to spice it up with a few things they might not expect.”The tour will make 14 stops throughout the U.S. and Canada, including shows in Baltimore, New York, Atlanta, Denver, Boston, Toronto, Chicago and Dallas, before closing out in Los Angeles in November. The concerts are being billed as a continuation of Queen’s 2017-2019 Rhapsody Tour.It's the first time the band has toured North America in four years, because of the pandemic, and guitarist Brian May — who was recently knighted by King Charles III — says he, Taylor and singer Lambert have deepened their bond.“For a long time we were sitting there thinking, ‘What the hell do we do?’ But when we came back to it, it was very fresh, which is probably a nice thing,” he says. “I think we learned all over again how to interact with each other. So I think we are on a different level.”The band is riding a wave of respect following the 2018 release of the Oscar-winning “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the biopic of lead singer Freddie Mercury, who died in 1991.“It brought in a younger audience and younger people are what you feed on, in a sense,” says May. “The energy of young people is what we’re about. We’ve always been about that. So it’s been fantastic for us that a whole new generation understand what we’re about and come and want to really rock.”While the band won't reveal the setlist, it isn't too hard to predict “Bohemian Rhapsody” will be played. The complex song that no one thought would be a radio hit has emerged as one of their top tracks, in large part because of 1992's “Wayne's World,” where it played during a key scene.“That one took us really into another league,” says Taylor, who calls it a “game-changer.”Expect also to hear “Don't Stop Me Now,” which Taylor says started as a medium hit and has emerged as a top Queen request and “Who Wants to Live Forever,” which May says Lambert takes “to a different place” live.The time away has also given members a chance to appreciate finding Lambert, who impressed with a Queen song when he auditioned for “American Idol” during the 2009 season. Lambert started performing with Queen in 2011.“Our material, our songs, are very eclectic and the plain fact is that Adam is a truly great singer, and there are not many singers that could cover that range of material as wonderfully as he does,” says Taylor.May agrees, calling Lambert “kind of a gift from God” who combines a powerful voice with a stage presence and emotional interaction with the audience.“He ticks every single box that we could possibly want and he’s quite a nice chap, too,” May says.Lambert, who earlier this year put out “High Drama,” an album of covers from such hitmakers as Duran Duran, Bonnie Tyler and Culture Club, says he always tries to keep Mercury at the forefront.“There’s no replacing Freddie Mercury. That’s impossible. And so I think we’ve made it a real priority to sort of honor him every night, every show we do. It’s a celebration that includes Freddie. And I think the audience feel that,” he says.As for his knighthood, May jokes his bandmates need to adjust to a new reality.“I have the sword now,” he says, laughing. “They have to be much more respectful.”___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849545,Comic Relief launches metaverse fundraiser to fight poverty,"Can playing more Roblox make your kids more philanthropic?That’s what the nonprofit Comic Relief US hopes, announcing Tuesday its new Kids Relief initiative to encourage giving and community building with a new virtual world on the social gaming platform. The “Kids Relief Presents: Solarpunk Simulator” experience on Roblox will also serve as a fundraiser for Comic Relief’s real-life programs battling poverty in America, especially those empowering young people in that fight.Alison Moore, CEO of Comic Relief US, told The Associated Press that the Roblox virtual world and the entire Kids Relief initiative is designed to “support young people’s ability to drive change.”“Children and young people have a deeper understanding that they have the power to make change,” said Moore. “They have the power to gather together and link their arms to do something to change the world tomorrow. They’ve got the mindset that adults don’t have -- that they can do it.”Comic Relief US is behind high-profile fundraisers like Red Nose Day, which uses entertainment and celebrities to help generate donations. “Solarpunk Simulator,” which takes place in a “future world where nature, technology, and people live in harmony” will be no different, with Jack Black appearing as the spaceship captain and Roblox influencers acting as team leaders in the virtual world to get participants to work together toward a common goal.The launch goal will be a special virtual concert by social media sensation BoyWithUke on April 7, but there may be different goals in the future.Zach Letter, co-founder and CEO of Wonder Works Studio, which built the experience for Kids Relief, said the idea for the launch is a metaverse twist on the classic grade school fundraiser “Penny Wars,” where classes compete to see who brings in the most pennies in a week. Instead of pennies, the teams on Roblox are collecting parts of a spaceship together. And instead of a pizza party or extra recess, the winners get to enjoy the concert.“It’s one of those games that has a lot of audio and visual feedback, so it’s really satisfying to play and you always feel this sense of power over collecting the materials,” Letter said. “You don’t want to be shoving charity in someone’s face and make it feel overwhelming and that it’s all about the donations. We really want kids to have a great time here and educate themselves.”Items available in the “Solarpunk Simulator” virtual store will be part of the fundraiser for Kids Relief, Letter said, whether they give the players special powers in the virtual world or allow them to customize how their avatars look.BoyWithUke, the singer-songwriter who just released his latest major-label EP “Antisocial” last month, said he is excited about being part of the initiative.“As someone who grew up in poverty, I think this is a mission I can strongly stand behind,” said BoyWithUke, who hides his identity behind a plastic mask with LED lights. And he said he likes the idea of bringing his fans, including his more than 7 million TikTok followers, into the metaverse on Roblox because “you can be whoever you want.”Comic Relief’s Moore said the Kids Relief campaign is the first initiative supported by the nonprofit’s Innovation and Growth Fund, which hopes to raise $10 million within three years. The group hopes new ideas supported by the fund will generate $1 billion in social impact to alleviate intergenerational poverty.“We want to create more opportunities to have a connection with audiences that are frankly becoming more and more fractured and more and more distracted with everything that’s going on in the world,” Moore said. “We are really thinking about where NextGen audiences are gathering and how we create an experience that’s going to be organic to where they are — to be able to engage and delight and fundraise all at the same time.”_____Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849546,HBO's 'Succession' sets viewer mark for fourth-season start,"NEW YORK (AP) — HBO's “Succession” opened its fourth and final season with a record first-night audience of 2.3 million viewers, the Nielsen company said on Tuesday.That tops the previous high for the drama about a backbiting family of media moguls. It beat the 1.7 million who watched last season's finale the first night it was available, Nielsen said.For HBO, the first-night audience is usually only a fraction of the number of people who will watch one of their shows. For example, each episode last season averaged 7.2 million viewers when delayed viewing is taken into account.The numbers indicate that more people are catching on to the two-time Emmy winner for best drama just as it is approaching the end. There was anticipation for the season premiere, with HBO saying there was four times the viewership of previous “Succession” episodes on HBO Max last week compared to the week before.The first episode showed how much things are strained between family patriarch Logan Roy and three of his four children, critic Brian Lowry wrote for CNN.“There was a lot going on in this season opener, but the premiere's primary function involved setting the stage for the battles and challenges to come,” Lowry wrote.",2023/03/28,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849547,"India's warm weather plans can't take the heat, report says","BENGALURU, India (AP) — With temperatures set to soar next month, Indian authorities need more resources and better preparation to deal with searing heat particularly for the most vulnerable communities around the country, a New Delhi-based think tank said.Analyzing 37 regional and federal heat action plans, the Centre for Policy Research found this week that the plans are not updated regularly, don’t have separate budgets in most cases, have no legal support to implement them and the most vulnerable populations in any given region are not identified in the plans.Heat plans started springing up around the nation after blistering heat waves surpassing 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit) in 2010 killed over 800 people in the northwestern city of Ahmedabad. City authorities and other organizations swiftly pulled together South Asia's first-ever response plan to protect communities through initiatives like awareness programs, specialized training for health care professionals and installing roofs made of cooling materials like coconut husks and paper waste.Several other heat plans have been drawn up since at the state and federal levels.“India has made considerable progress by creating several dozen heat action plans in the last decade. But our assessment reveals several gaps that must be filled in future plans,” said Aditya Pillai, an associate fellow at CPR and co-author of the report.Unlike with other disasters like cyclones, it is still unclear who should fund and implement heat action plans, said Abhiyant Tiwari, lead of the climate resilience and health program in India for the Natural Resources Defense Council.“Funding for heat plans is the elephant in the room,” he said. “While the Indian government is cognizant of the threat of extreme heat, it will definitely help if the issues this report flags are also addressed,” such as how vulnerable communities can be better protected.At least 26,000 people have died due to heat in the last 30 year in India alone, according to a recent report. Residents of urban slums, people with longstanding health issues, older or pregnant people, workers in small, enclosed spaces, farmers and construction workers are among the most vulnerable.Sizzling temperatures and heat waves are becoming more common as the planet warms up as humans pump more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, scientists say. Increasing humidity, another consequence of human-caused climate change, is particularly dangerous in southern India, where relatively lower temperatures can be fatal in moist air.A 2021 report found that India will also likely lose the most work hours in the world, greater than 100 billion hours every year, as a result of scorching heat. Most current heat plans do factor in economic and climate concerns.Pillai called for changes to the heat response, such as labelling heat waves as disasters, regularly monitoring and evaluating heat action plans, establishing laws that implement the plans and ensuring that they have enough funding.He said there is a “solid foundation” but changes need to happen immediately to prevent any more major loss of life.“A lot more needs to be done,” said Pillai.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849548,Poll: Religious service attendance a bit down after pandemic,"A “stable share” of Americans has participated in religious services in some way – virtually or in person – during the coronavirus pandemic, though in-person attendance is slightly lower than before the COVID-19 outbreak.Those are among the key findings in a comprehensive report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center titled: “How the Pandemic Has Affected Attendance at U.S. Religious Services.” The poll surveyed 11,377 U.S. adults in November last year. Its margin of error for the full sample of respondents is plus or minus 1.5 percentage points.The poll found that the share of U.S. adults typically attending religious services at least once a month dropped from 33% in 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak, to 30% in 2022. About 20% of Americans say they now attend in person less often than they did before the pandemic.But the survey also found that the percentage of U.S. adults who take part in religious services in some way each month -- in person, virtually or both -- remained steady since the early days of the pandemic.Researchers based their analysis on five surveys conducted since the start of the pandemic. They show that ""a remarkably steady share of Americans – about 40% – say they have participated in religious services in the prior month one way or the other (either in person or virtually, i.e., by streaming online or watching on TV).”When asked whether they now attend religious services more or less often than they did before COVID-19, more Americans say that their attendance has declined.In San Francisco, the historic Old St. Mary’s Cathedral struggled to stay open during the pandemic. The 160-year-old Catholic church, which is heavily dependent on older worshippers and tourists, lost most of its revenue after parishes closed during the pandemic. The ranks of regular parishioners dropped from 300 before COVID-19, to about 200 now, said the Rev. John Ardis, who had to dismiss most of the lay staff and close the parish preschool.“About 40% of our regular parishioners have chosen not to return,” Ardis said, adding that most parishioners are elderly and those who returned are still wearing masks at services. The pandemic “has been a big and continual hit,” he said.Thomas Groome, professor of theology and religious education at Boston College, said he wasn’t surprised by the survey’s findings.“There are some signs that attendance is coming back, but it’ll probably never come back to where it was before the pandemic,” he said.“I think people learned how to nurture their spiritual lives and faith without necessarily going to their local church every Sunday,"" he added. ""I know some of them went there virtually by Zoom…many read the scriptures themselves or they got together with neighbors or they bonded into family groups.”By November 2022, 20% of respondents said they were attending in person less often, while 7% said they were going in person more often. And 15% said they were participating in services virtually more often, while 5% said they were watching services online or on TV less often.At least 100 parishioners died from COVID-19 at the 17,000-strong Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic church in New York City’s borough of Queens.The number of parishioners who attended its regular services fell, but then rebounded and is now at the same or even higher than before the pandemic, said the Rev. Manuel Rodriguez, the pastor of the mostly Latino congregation.“But that’s not the case, unfortunately, in other churches where attendance is falling,” he said.The biggest decline in in-person attendance was found among Black Protestants, according to Pew. As of November, it found that 46% of them said they attended religious services at least once a month, down from 61% in 2019.The report focused on major Christian and Jewish denominations. Pew researchers said the report could not analyze the attendance patterns of Buddhists, Hindus Muslims, and other smaller non-Christian religious groups due to sample size limitations.___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849549,Klinsmann still awaits first win as Uruguay beats SKorea 2-1,"Jurgen Klinsmann is still waiting for his first win as head coach of South Korea after Uruguay triumphed 2-1 in a friendly played at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on Tuesday.The former Germany and U.S. coach was appointed last month and his first match in charge was a 2-2 home draw with Colombia last week.After South Korea progressed to the second round of last year's World Cup at the expense of Uruguay, the result in Seoul provided some measure of revenge for the visiting team.The meeting between the two teams at the World Cup in Qatar ended 0-0 but it only took Sebastian Coates 10 minutes to open the scoring for Uruguay this time, after he rose above the Korean defense to head home a corner from Federico Valverde.Six minutes into the second half, midfielder Hwang In-beom fired home a shot from inside the penalty area. But Lazio's Matias Vecino grabbed the winner in the 63rd , scoring from close range after goalkeeper Cho Hyun-woo parried a Joaquin Piquerez free-kick.With six minutes remaining, Kim Young-gwon headed home but the goal was ruled out for a foul on the goalkeeper.Lee Kang-in had a productive game in midfield, creating some chances including the opportunity for Kim, allowing Klinsmann to put a positive spin on the game.“Kang-in, I think, is a very, very special talent, and they only could stop him with fouls,” Klinsmann was quoted saying by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. ""Because it’s a friendly game, they didn’t want to give too many yellow cards.”For his part, Lee can already see the benefits of the new coach's approach.“Coach Klinsmann loves an aggressive brand of football, and we’re still in the process of learning his ways,” Lee said. “We will have more important matches coming up, and I think a match like today’s will help us then.”Japan and Australia, which also reached the second round of the 2022 World Cup, fell to home defeats against South American opposition.Despite taking a third-minute lead in Osaka against Colombia thanks to a powerful header from Brighton’s in-form winger Kaoru Mitoma, Japan was beaten 2-1.Colombia equalized just after the half-hour through Aston Villa’s Jhon Duran before Rafael Borre sealed the victory with a spectacular overhead kick on 61 minutesJust four days after beating Ecuador 3-1 in Sydney, Australia lost to the same opposition 2-1 in Melbourne.Brandon Borrello put the Socceroos ahead after 16 minutes but two second-half goals, the first a Pervis Estupinan penalty and the second from William Pacho after 65, gave Ecuador the win.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849550,"Energy company: Minnesota leak fixed, plant to reopen soon","MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP) — A faulty pipe that allowed water containing a radioactive isotope of hydrogen to leak at a Minnesota nuclear power plant has been repaired and the plant will return to service in the next week, a spokesman for the energy company said Tuesday.Meanwhile, a state agency said a fish kill that claimed at least 230 fish in the Mississippi River near Xcel Energy’s Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant was caused by a water temperature change resulting from the shutdown of the plant, not by any chemicals leaking into the river.The nuclear plant, about 38 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis, was fully powered down around 7 a.m. Saturday to fix the leaky pipe discovered last week, Xcel Energy spokesman Theo Keith said.“Crews have already repaired the leak, which did not pose any risks to public health, safety, or the environment,” Keith said in an email. “The pipe was confirmed as the only source of the leak.”The plant will return to service “in the next week,” Keith said, but will temporarily close in mid-April for an annual maintenance project.In November, a leak was discovered that allowed 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water containing tritium into the river. There was a monthslong delay in announcing the initial leak that raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said there was never a public health threat.Tritium occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Last week, the new leak was found coming from a temporary repair to the original leak, the company said. Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said the new leak also posed no risk to the public or the environment.The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the state health department have sampled groundwater wells and found “no evidence that the tritium has reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources,” the MPCA said.The MPCA announced the fish kill on Monday. A statement from the agency said that in normal operations, warm water from the plant enters the river and the fish get used to it.“The fish kill is unfortunate but not unexpected given the significant temperature change that can occur when warm water from the plant stops flowing to the river during a shutdown in operations,” the statement said.Fish found dead included bass, channel catfish, common carp, and one or more species of sucker fish.Tyler Abayare, who regularly fishes near the plant, said he has noticed dead fish near the plant in previous years, when the facility closes for maintenance in April. Then, the dead fish drift downstream to shallow water and decompose. He typically avoids fishing the area until July.“It just starts to stink and makes your eyes water,” Abayare said.___Jim Salter in O'Fallon, Missouri, contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849551,MLB The Show breaks barrier with Negro League players,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — MLB The Show has broken a video game barrier: For the first time, the franchise will insert some of the greatest Negro League players — from Satchel Paige to Jackie Robinson — into the 2023 edition of the game as playable characters.Video gamers are now able to venture into a storyline mode involving eight Negro League legends through MLB The Show 23, which releases Tuesday. The narrative experience will feature short videos about the players along with gameplay focused on the epic moments of their careers.Along with Robinson and Paige, the game also features other players including Buck O’Neil, Rube Foster, Hilton Smith, John Donaldson, Hank Thompson and Martin Dihigo.“This made sense on multiple levels,"" said Bob Kendrick, the narrator of storyline experience and president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, which is located in Kansas City, Missouri. Along with the museum, he partnered with Sony for the historic Black players' insertion into the game.“The way the Negro League players played, it fits perfectly for a video game,” he said. “There were so many gaming fans who have been clamoring for the inclusion of the Negro Leagues. People were popping into my timeline on social media. This has been stirring for several years.""I never really dreamt this would become reality. And I didn't really think it would happen with arguably the biggest baseball video game of them all. This is something we are inherently proud of.”Kendrick said the multi-year partnership is a “gigantic step in keeping the legacy alive” for the Negro Leagues. The last time Negro League players were featured in a video game was on EA Sports MVP Baseball 2005 that included Robinson, Paige and Bob Gibson as legendary figures.“For the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, this is all about creating relevancy,” he said. “How do I establish a relevant connection with an ever-changing generation of young people? I can’t sit back and wait for them to come to me at the doors of the museum. I have to got to them in the mode of which they are getting information. If it’s a video game, then so be it.”Ramone Russell was the first to pitch Sony executives the concept of breathing life into the Negro League players through the franchise's popular video game. He's been mulling over the idea for more than a decade as a mainstay for the development and marketing team for the MLB The Show series.“This is a project I've always wanted to do,” said Russell, the product development communications and brand strategist for Sony Interactive Entertainment. He played a vital role in working across multiple teams who did a “tremendously smart job” in creating the mode.“So many of our fans — even when they hear the word ‘Negro Leagues’ — they have no context of what the Negro League is and what it represents,” Russell continued. “I've been asked ‘Hey, when are you going to have the Negro Leagues?’ My answer would be, ‘As soon as we can find the right way to do it.’ As you know, perfection is the enemy of progress. But about two years ago, I felt like now is the time.""Not a lot of game footage from the Negro Leagues exists, so game creators gathered archive video and photos from the museum and family members of the deceased players to collect as much as they could. That helped nail down the fine animation details for each player, jerseys and the stadiums where games were held.Russell said the process was a tedious one, but it couldn't have fully come together without the expertise of Kendrick — who he says knows the real history of the Negro Leagues and players “more than anyone else.” He said Kendrick was the perfect person to narrate the storyline mode, because of his well-rounded knowledge about player's greatness.Even though Jackie Robinson was the first African American player to play in a Major League Baseball game in 1947, Kendrick said during his narration in the mode that Robinson was not the best player from the Negro Leagues. He said the league had such a rich talent pool where players played with in a “bold, brash way"" and was “fast and daring.”“It's not to disparage Jackie at all, but this is how great the talent was in the Negro Leagues,” Kendrick said. “I tell people all the time that the talent in the Negro Leagues would not take a backseat to any league. We’re talking about some of the greatest athletes to ever put on a baseball uniform. And unfortunately, the majority of the public, they don’t know these names. But they should for both from a baseball perspective as well as a historical perspective.”Sony’s San Diego Studio will donate $1 to the Negro Leagues Museum for every MLB The Show 23 Collector’s Edition is sold.Kendrick said having the Negro League storyline in the game will hopefully inspire young Black kids and others of color to learn more about their heritage. He wants the visibility of the video game to help bring more awareness to the museum.“Through animation and a project like this, you can bring them to life,” he said. “It’s a beautiful way to convey everything the Negro Leagues represents. I was amazed by people who didn’t know night baseball originated from the Negro Leagues. They just didn’t get their just due. It’s not there in the pages of an American history book. ... Now, we have a chance to let people know.""",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849552,FTX founder Bankman-Fried charged with paying $40M bribe,"NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was charged with directing $40 million in bribes to one or more Chinese officials to unfreeze assets relating to his cryptocurrency business in a newly rewritten indictment unsealed Tuesday.The charge of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act raises to 13 the number of charges Bankman-Fried faces after he was arrested in the Bahamas in December and brought to the United States soon afterward. The indictment was returned on Monday.The charge also contains language revealing that a fifth arrest was imminent in what U.S. Attorney Damian Williams has repeatedly described as a continuing investigation. That unidentified individual, according to the indictment, participated in the bribery conspiracy with Bankman-Fried and “will be arrested in the Southern District of New York.""FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, when it ran out of money after the equivalent of a bank run on the global cryptocurrency exchange. He has remained free on a $250 million personal recognizance bond that lets him stay with his parents in Palo Alto, California.He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he cheated investors out of billions of dollars before his business collapsed.A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried's lawyers told The Associated Press Tuesday that they had no comment.An arraignment on the rewritten indictment was set for Thursday by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. He also on Tuesday banned Bankman-Fried from communicating with current or ex-employees of FTX or Alameda Research, its affiliated cryptocurrency hedge fund trading firm. The order also limits Bankman-Fried to one laptop and phone and bans him from encrypted communications or other cellphones, computers, or “smart” devices with internet access.The alleged bribes stemmed from the operation of Alameda Research. The indictment said Chinese law enforcement authorities in early 2021 froze certain Alameda cryptocurrency trading accounts containing about $1 billion in cryptocurrency on two of China's largest cryptocurrency exchanges.Bankman-Fried, 31, understood that the accounts had been frozen by Chinese authorities as part of an ongoing probe of a particular Alameda trading counterparty, the indictment said.After Bankman-Fried failed multiple attempts over several months to unfreeze the accounts through methods including using lawyers to lobby, Bankman-Fried ultimately agreed to direct a multimillion dollar bribe to try to unfreeze the accounts, the indictment said.Among failed attempts, the indictment said Bankman-Fried and others he directed opened new fraudulent accounts on the Chinese exchanges using personal identifying information of several individuals unaffiliated with FTX or Alameda to try to evade freeze orders and move cryptocurrency from frozen accounts to the fraudulent accounts.A portion of the bribe payment of cryptocurrency, then worth about $40 million, was moved from Alameda's main trading account to a private cryptocurrency wallet in November 2021 and the frozen accounts were unfrozen at about the same time, the indictment said.After Bankman-Fried received confirmation that the accounts were unfrozen, he authorized the transfer of additional tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to complete the bribe, according to the indictment.Among those already charged in the case is Carolyn Ellison, Alameda's former chief executive. She has agreed to testify against Bankman-Fried, as have two former FTX executives who have pleaded guilty in cooperation deals with the government.Messages for comment were sent to the Chinese consulate in New York and the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C._____AP Writer Jennifer Peltz contributed to this story.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849553,EU deal to move migrant children from Greece officially ends,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — A voluntary scheme by European Union member states to accept unaccompanied migrant children from Greece officially ended Tuesday, raising concern over delays still facing the bloc in hammering out a comprehensive new migration agreement.Fifteen minors from Somalia, Gambia and Pakistan boarded a plane in Athens bound for Lisbon, Portugal, bringing the total number of migrant children relocated under the program to 1,368 in 16 countries since 2020, Greek officials said.The European Commission has promised to finalize new migration rules, common across all member states, in 2024 following years of delays.The main sticking point is centered around the so-called solidarity mechanism, under which member states would be given relocation quotas to assist countries like Greece, Italy and Spain where most of the asylum seekers arrive.Sofia Voultepsi, the Greek deputy migration minister, said Athens was already in discussions with EU member states for a new voluntary scheme if needed.“Greece alone cannot bear the burden of refugees and immigration. It cannot lift on its shoulders all the unaccompanied children who arrive in our country,” she told reporters at Athens International Airport.Gianluca Rocco, chief of mission for the United Nations' International Organization for Migration in Greece, said he remained hopeful that the EU could reach a deal.“The concern is (centered) around the fact that the discussion on the pact is coming to a very crucial moment, because next year the Commission will end its mandate,” he said. “This issue needs to be addressed together and collectively.”___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/03/28,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849555,Black female athletes: Having Black female coach is crucial,"South Carolina senior guard Brea Beal knew she could trust Dawn Staley before she even suited up for the Gamecocks.It wasn't just Staley's coaching accolades, which include fueling South Carolina’s meteoric rise in women’s basketball, that sold Beal. Beal knew that Staley — a Black woman like her — would best understand how to guide her as she navigated both life and playing basketball on a big stage.“People that were telling me what this community was about, I know it’s somewhere I wanted to be,” Beal said. “As soon as I got here, she definitely led me down a journey so I could find out who I am.”Black female representation in the coaching and sports administrative ranks has existed on a minute scale — even in a sport like basketball, which along with track and field has the highest concentration of Black female college athletes. Black female players who have been coached by a Black woman told The Associated Press that it was crucial to their development.“There are some coaches who will just have all guys with no understanding that there are sometimes things that a young woman may need to talk to another woman about,” said Kiki Barnes, a former basketball player and jumper at New Orleans and current Gulf Coast Athletic Conference commissioner.While the number of women coaching women's sports has increased in the past decade, Black women continue to lag behind most other groups. During the 2021-22 school year, 399 Black women coached women’s NCAA sports teams in Divisions I, II and III, compared with 3,760 white women and 5,236 white men.In women's NCAA basketball, a sport made up of 30% Black athletes, Black women made up 12% of head coaches across all divisions during the 2021-22 season, according to the NCAA's demographics database.Fourteen Black women led women's basketball teams across 65 Power Five programs this past season — up one from 2021. That's less than 22% of the total in a sport that was played by more Black athletes (40.7%) than any other race in Division I, according to a report with data from the 2020-21 season.For the first time in a decade, four Black coaches advanced to the Sweet 16 of the women's basketball tournament, including Staley, who said she believes it's more popular to hire a woman at “this stage of the game.”""And it’s not to say that I’m going to sit here and male bash, because we have a lot of male coaches who have been in our game for decades upon decades,” said Staley, who will lead her team into the Final Four this weekend. “But I will say that giving women an opportunity to coach women and helping women navigate through life like they have navigated through life will allow your student-athletes a different experience than having a male coach.”For years Staley has been an advocate for hiring more female coaches — especially minorities — in college basketball, but WNBA player Angel McCoughtry said Black female coaches as successful as Staley are still too few and far between in the sport.“When I was getting recruited in high school, I don’t remember having a Dawn Staley to look up to,” said McCoughtry, who played at Louisville from 2005-09.McCoughtry also named Carolyn Peck, the first African American woman to coach her team to an NCAA women's basketball title in 1999 with Purdue, as another example of representation in the sport.“So there’s one or two every decade,” McCoughtry said. ""Why can’t we have 10? There’s 10 Caucasian coaches every decade.”McCoughtry, a former No. 1 overall pick by the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream, got used to being around people who didn’t look like or understand her. She is Black. Her AAU and high school coaches were Black men. Her college coaches were white men. Marynell Meadors, a white woman, was her first coach in Atlanta.She has fielded frustrating questions from white peers, coaches and owners — like how often she washes her hair, or whether her passionate play was because she was from Baltimore.“There's just a disconnect in understanding things,” the 36-year-old said, adding: “We need more coaches to protect us.""McCoughtry has never had a Black female head coach but did have the impactful guidance of Michelle Clark-Heard, a Black woman whom Jeff Walz brought on as an assistant when he took over at Louisville in 2008.She also leaned on Tim Eaton, a Black assistant coach who she said advocated for her in her freshman year, when then-coach Tom Collen wanted to send her back to Baltimore because she was late to one of her first practices. Similarly, McCoughtry said, she felt she had less room to make mistakes than white teammates. When she questioned a coach, she was labeled a troublemaker; when she got fired up about a play, she was told she had a bad attitude.“We just never had any inch to be human, like our Caucasian counterparts,” she said, adding: “But who understands that? Our Black coaches. Because they went through everything we went through. They have a story, too.”Part of the reason for the lack of Black female coaches is because of who ultimately holds the power to hire, Barnes said. That's often athletic directors, a level where there is an even greater lack of diversity — 224 of 350 in Division I are white men. Plus, she added, there are changing requirements for what it takes to get leadership opportunities.“And now the system has changed to where now you’ve got to know search firms because now search firms are the ones that are managing and determining who gets these opportunities,"" she said. “Every time we understand how to get in the room and what it takes to be prepared, it’s like the rules change.""Barnes played high school basketball in her hometown of Minden, Louisiana, where she had an assistant coach who was a Black woman; Barnes still refers to her as “Coach Smith.”“For her, it wasn’t just about basketball. It was about who I was as a young lady,” Barnes recalled, adding, “I would say it’s similar with a young woman wanting to talk to a mom about womanly things. It’s not that a man couldn’t do it, but I wouldn’t feel as comfortable talking to either my dad or any other man about woman things.”Priscilla Loomis, a 2016 Olympic high jumper who is Black, said she became a coach to provide kids that look like her the representation the sport has lacked. NCAA track and field numbers mirrored women’s basketball numbers in 2021-22: 5% of head coaches were Black women, while 19% of women’s NCAA track and field athletes are Black.“They want so badly to feel seen and to feel loved and to be given guidance,” Loomis said. “And so that’s why I always say it’s important to get women of color, men of color to the starting line, because a lot of times we’re so many steps behind.”___AP Sports Writer Pete Iacobelli and AP Basketball Writer Doug Feinberg contributed to this report.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849556,"German governing parties agree on energy, climate measures","BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s three ruling parties announced Tuesday that they have an agreement on a series of energy and climate policies following weeks of infighting that threatened to paralyze the government.Senior members of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats and two smaller parties, the environmentalist Greens and pro-business Free Democrats, said three days of closed-doors talks had resulted in a deal to ensure “nobody is left behind” in the drive to replace home heating systems with greener alternatives.The issue had prompted fierce bickering among the parties last week when draft plans were leaked that would have effectively banned the installation of conventional oil and gas heaters starting next year.The Green party argues that fossil fuel furnaces need to be phased out as soon as possible because they contribute to climate change and cement Germany’s dependence on foreign energy imports. The Free Democrats and Scholz’s Social Democrats objected, worrying such a change would anger voters because installing heat pumps requires a much bigger initial investment, though the operating costs are lower.Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who leads the Free Democrats, said parties had agreed to provide subsidies for the heater replacements and continue to permit the installation of fossil fuel furnaces provided they are capable of later switching to cleaner alternatives such as hydrogen or biomass. Low-income groups and elderly homeowners will get additional support, he said.Lindner also touted a major reform of the way Germany requires different sectors of the economy to contribute to the country's binding climate goals. In future the targets will be reviewed over a longer period and lagging sectors, such as transport and housing, will be able to emit more greenhouse gas if the overall pace of cuts is maintained.A similar approach will be taken when it comes to major construction projects, allowing ecological compensation in the form of money rather than land, as is currently the case.In return, the Greens secured a commitment that solar panels will be built along all new highways. The party's co-leader, Ricarda Lang, also announced an increase in highway tolls for heavy goods vehicles, with 80% of the revenue going toward improving Germany's rail network.Earlier Tuesday, lawmaker Alexander Dobrindt of the opposition Christian Social Union had mocked the government’s disunity, telling reporters: “It’s quite possible that this government continues to exist, but it’s not able to govern.”Scholz dismissed such criticism, insisting the talks at his chancellery would produce “very, very, very good results.”The 64-year-old said the overarching goal was to fulfill the government's 2021 pledge to accelerate Germany’s transformation toward a greener, more digital economy.___Follow AP's coverage of climate issues at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849557,Head of Nashville school in shooting would 'run to' danger,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The head of the Christian elementary school in Nashville who was killed in a shooting there on Monday was described by friends as smart, loving and a rare female leader within a male-led religious culture.“If there was any trouble in that school, she would run to it, not from it,” Jackie Bailey said of her friend Katherine Koonce, head of The Covenant School. “She was trying to protect those kids … That’s just what I believe.”Koonce was one of six people killed in the shooting in Tennessee, including three 9-year-old children identified by police as Hallie Scruggs, Evelyn Dieckhaus and William Kinney. Also killed were Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher, and Mike Hill, 61, a custodian.In a video statement released Tuesday evening, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said Peak was supposed to have dinner with his wife, Maria, after filling in as a substitute teacher at Covenant.“Maria woke up this morning without one of her best friends,” Lee said, adding that Peak, Koonce and his wife had once taught together and “have been family friends for decades.”A friend of Hill's posted on Facebook that he also believed Hill would have died protecting the children.Pastor Tim Dunavant, of the Hartsville First United Methodist Church, said that he hired Hill to work at Covenant more than a decade ago.“I don’t know the details yet. But I have a feeling, when it all comes out, Mike’s sacrifice saved lives,” Dunavant wrote. “I have nothing factual to base that upon. I just know what kind of guy he was. And I know he’s the kind of guy that would do that.”Hill's family issued a statement saying, “We pray for the Covenant School and are so grateful that Michael was beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years. He was a father of seven children ... and 14 grandchildren. He liked to cook and spend time with family.”Another pastor, Jim Bachmann, said Hill was “one of those people you cannot not like” and that he made a point of learning the names of all the students and talking to them.Bachmann was the founding pastor of Covenant Presbyterian Church, which runs the school, and is the current pastor of Stephens Valley Church, where Hill was a member and sometimes served as a greeter. On those occasions, Hill would “dress up like he was going to meet the president of the United States,” Bachmann said. He added, “Everybody loved Mike, and he loved them back.""Friends also described Peak as a loving friend and natural teacher.She was “a sweet person from a sweet family,” said Chuck Owen, who told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that they grew up together in Leesville, Louisiana, and that Peak was a lifelong friend.When he heard that Peak was killed in the shooting, “It took my breath away,” Owen said. “You don’t expect something like this. It just took the wind out of me.”Peak was also a devout Christian.“She told me that she got saved in college and that God’s love changed her life,” Owen said, adding it was appropriate that she was teaching at a Christian school.Nashville songwriter Natalie Hemby posted on Instagram that Peak ""taught me how to swim. Keep my head above water… which is what we’re all trying to do right now. ...And next time you jump in a pool on a beautiful summer day, and find yourself floating and looking at the sky, please think of my friend, Cindy Peak.”Her family issued a statement saying their “hearts are broken,” and called Peak “a pillar of the community, and a teacher beloved by all her students.”“She never wavered in her faith and we know she is wrapped in the arms of Jesus,” the statement said.In Dallas, the Park Cities Presbyterian Church held a service to mourn the passing of Hallie Scruggs, daughter of Covenant Presbyterian Church lead pastor Chad Scruggs. He had previously worked as an associate pastor at Park Cities, which issued a statement about the shooting.“We love the Scruggs family and mourn with them over their precious daughter Hallie,"" Park Cities Senior Pastor Mark Davis said in the statement. ""Together, we trust in the power of Christ to draw near and give us the comfort and hope we desperately need.”The church held a noon service on Tuesday to pray for the victims as well as for the shooter.“I spoke with Chad yesterday afternoon,” Davis said. “He was very conversant, admitting he’s in shock, that this is surreal. But also admitting … that the Lord is in control.""The Covenant School in Nashville has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade, as well as roughly 50 staff members, according to its website.Before Koonce took the top role with Covenant, Anna Caudill, a former art teacher, worked with her for almost a decade at Christ Presbyterian Academy, another Christian school in the area connected to a Presbyterian Church in America congregation.“She was an absolute dynamo and one of the smartest women I’ll ever know,” said Caudill, recalling how Koonce excelled at her day job while parenting her children, pursuing her masters and then her PhD, and writing a book.For Caudill, who grew up in several male-led Christian denominations, Koonce had remarkable leadership skills and was the first woman in such a setting to encourage her to keep learning and pursuing her life goals. When Caudill launched her nonprofit advocating for special education resources and other support, she said Koonce was one of the first to donate financially to it.She said Koonce loved her job at Covenant and she was loved by students and their families.“She wasn’t Wonder Woman, but I never saw the two in the same place,” she said.___Adrian Sainz contributed from Memphis, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849558,"IOC details advice to let Russia, Belarus athletes return","GENEVA (AP) — Some Russian athletes can soon return to international sports, although their status for next year's Paris Olympics is still up in the air.The International Olympic Committee recommended Tuesday that individual athletes from Russia and Belarus should be allowed to return to competition under a neutral status as long as they have no military links. But the IOC, facing increased pressure to ban Russia and Belarus from the Paris Olympics because of the war in Ukraine, held off on deciding whether they can compete at next year’s Summer Games.That decision will be taken “at the appropriate time,” IOC President Thomas Bach said. When it comes to other events, including Olympic qualifiers, it will be up to each individual sport's governing body to make the final decision on whether Russian and Belarusian athletes can take part.While the IOC said Russia and Belarus should remain barred from team sports such as soccer and basketball, it still defied repeated calls by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to exclude all Russian athletes while his country is being occupied and attacked. But athletes from Russia and its military ally Belarus who have actively supported the war in Ukraine, or are “contracted to the military or national security agencies”, should not be cleared to compete as neutral individuals, Bach said.The Russian Defense Ministry has said more than 20 of the country’s medalists at the Tokyo Olympics staged in 2021 held military ranks. Of the 71 medals won in Japan, 45 were by athletes affiliated with the Central Sports Club of the Army.In team sports, Russia and Belarus “cannot be considered” for a return, Bach said at a news conference after what he said was a unanimous agreement among the 15-member executive board.Team events in other sports, such as relays or mixed doubles or team all-around in gymnastics, should also be off limits, the IOC said in a document explaining its guidance.“There is definitely discrimination in this,” veteran Russian gymnastics coach Valentina Rodionenko said in comments reported by RIA Novosti, adding that with “conditions like these, they understand very well that Russia itself will not agree to them.”In the guidance document, the IOC said it would like Russians and Belarusians to be known as Individual Neutral Athletes with the French acronym AIN.They should wear uniforms that are either entirely white or a single color, and can’t have a team logo. Athletes should be barred from displaying their national flags on social media or making statements “that may be prejudicial to the interests of the competition, its integrity or the participant’s neutrality,” the 5-page document stated.The IOC’s recommendations “do not concern” the Paris Games that opens in 16 months’ time.“The IOC will take this decision at the appropriate time at its full discretion,” said Bach, adding that “we are not kicking it down the road"" when asked if the IOC was effectively buying time for the war to end.The individual Olympic sports must now decide the entry and eligibility conditions for their events, which include ongoing qualifiers for the Paris Olympics and beyond to the 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Games.Some Olympic sports, such as track and field and gymnastics, have established independent integrity units that earned wide respect. The position of some sports bodies which have strong sporting, commercial and political ties to Russia is less clear.The suggested conditions are stricter than when Russia was under sanctions for doping cases at each Winter and Summer Games since 2018. In those events, uniforms in national colors could be worn and music by Tchaikovsky was played when Russian athletes won gold medals.The IOC also said that event organizers should not fly Russian or Belarusian flags and should try to prevent spectators bringing national flags into venues. Four fans with Russian flags, including one with an image of President Vladimir Putin, were evicted after they flew them at the Australian Open tennis event in January.The IOC advice presented Tuesday marks a profound shift in sport’s position on Russia and Belarus following a near-total exclusion by most governing bodies.Within days of the war starting in February last year, the IOC urged sports bodies to isolate Russia and Belarus. It cited an “extremely grave violation” of the Olympic Truce in place for the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, plus the integrity and security of sports events, including the unfairness that Russians could train in peace while Ukrainians athletes’ lives were disrupted.In January, the IOC formally announced it would seek a “pathway for athletes’ participation in competition under strict conditions”, with a view to letting Russians and Belarusians try to qualify for the Paris Olympics.Bach has repeatedly pointed to advice from independent U.N.-recognized human rights experts that excluding athletes based only on their passports would be discrimination.On Tuesday, Bach said one factor that changed IOC thinking is some sports having already reintegrated neutral Russians and Belarusians, such as tennis and cycling. Soccer’s exclusion of Russian teams by FIFA and UEFA was upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne.Zelenskyy has consistently called for all Russian athletes and teams to be excluded. His call is backed by some governments and Olympic bodies in Europe and elsewhere.“A slap in the face of Ukrainian athletes,” the sports minister of Bach's native Germany, Nancy Faeser, said Tuesday in reaction to to the IOC announcement. “Those who let the warmonger Russia use international competitions for its propaganda are damaging the Olympic idea of peace and international understanding.”Russian Olympic Committee president Stanislav Pazdnyakov told the Tass agency the guidelines would block athletes from competing: “The decision is a farce, the basic principles of the Olympic Charter are being breached.”Ukrainian athletes, including past and current Olympic medalists, have also publicly disagreed with the IOC’s stated “unifying mission” to bring the world together peacefully in sport.The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said there should be no Russian delegation at her city’s Olympics if the war in Ukraine continues.Bach was once close to Putin ahead of the steroid-tainted 2014 Sochi Winter Games in the first year of his IOC leadership, and reminded reporters Tuesday that last year he withdrew an Olympic honor from the Russian president.Asked if he had communicated recently with Putin, Bach replied: “A clear ‘no.'”___ Elllingworth reported from Düsseldorf, Germany.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849581,Northern Ireland terror threat level raised to 'severe',"The threat level from domestic terror in Northern Ireland has been raised from ""substantial"" to ""severe,"" the UK's Northern Ireland Minister Christ Heaton-Harris said on Tuesday.The change in threat level comes after the shooting and injury of an off-duty police officer in the Northern Irish city of Omagh in February.""The public should remain vigilant, but not be alarmed, and continue to report any concerns they have,"" Heaton-Harris wrote in a statement.It comes ahead of a planned visit by US President Joe Biden to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland expected to take place next month on the anniversary of the Good Friday peace agreement.Tensions have risen in Northern Ireland since the UK departed the EU, leaving the territory in a state of limbo.As part of the Good Friday agreement, there can be no hard border on the island of Ireland, but Brexit has meant the introduction of border checks on goods going between the UK and the EU.The current solution has been to carry out border checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the UK mainland, but this has angered pro-UK groups who fear it is weakening the union.The shooting of the officer last month, which was claimed by a republican group known as the New IRA, has sparked fears of escalating violence and a return to the so-called Troubles — an era of widespread sectarian violence that was brought to an end by the Good Friday agreement.But the minister has tried to assure people that the threat of violence will not sway civic life.""The political future of Northern Ireland rests with the democratic will of the people and not the violent actions of the few,"" Heaton-Harris said.""Together we will ensure there is no return to the violence of the past.""He made no reference to Biden's planned visit. Leaders are set to meet in Belfast on April 10 to mark the anniversary of the Good Friday agreement which was in part brokered by the US under then-President Bill Clinton.The Northern Ireland threat level was first introduced in 2010 and was already set at ""severe.""

The ministry added the move did not contravene international non-proliferation agreements.Russian leader Vladimir Putin announced his intention to station weapons in neighboring Belarus last week, drawing condemnation from Ukraine and Western allies.NATO said Western allies act with full respect for their international commitment and rejected Russian claims saying they're only doing what the US has done for many decades.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Belarus would face further sanctions over the plan.The UK and Poland will build two major temporary villages in western and eastern Ukraine to provide housing to Ukrainians forced to flee the war, the UK government said in a statement.The UK announced up to £10 million ($12 million, €11 million) to build temporary shelters and provide energy supplies.The accommodation villages in Lviv in western Ukraine and Poltava in eastern Ukraine will offer accomodation for more than 700 Ukrainians, according to the statement.More than 17.6 million people are thought to be in humanitarian need in Ukraine, with more than eight million having registered as refugees in Europe —  the largest movement in Europe since World War II.Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visited Sumy in northern Ukraine, continuing his tour of Ukraine's front line regions.He met officials and local people in two cities in the region, which borders Russia. Sumy was partially occupied after Russia invaded Ukraine last year, but the Kremlin's foces withdrew from the region early April.""Ukrainians will live here, on their land, in their cities and villages, which we have to rebuild after the war. And I'm sure it will definitely happen,"" Zelenskyy said in a speech.He recalled the shelling of kindergarten in the region, noting that one of the cities he visited, Okhtyrka, experienced heavy losses and ""brutal enemy strikes.""Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov thanked the United Kingdom on Tuesday after the first Challenger 2 tank arrived in Ukraine.The UK pledged to send 14 of the main battle tanks to Ukraine in January.""These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,” Reznikov said in a video posted on social media.On Monday, Ukrainian troops in the UK completed their training to operate the Challenger 2.Russia's oil sales to India increased 22-fold in the past year, Energy Minister Nikolai Shulginov said on Tuesday.Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said energy exports were ""redirected” to ""the markets of friendly countries” after Moscow was hit by sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.He said energy revenues accounted for 42% of Russia's budget in 2022.Russia test-fired anti-ship missiles in the Sea of Japan, Russia's Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.The Moskit supersonic cruise missiles were fired at a mock enemy warship around 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.Japan did not lodge a protest to Russia over the naval exercise because it was conducted in the Peter the Great Gulf near Vladivostok, away from Japan.""On the whole, Japan is concerned about Russia's increasing military activities around the Japanese coasts and watching them with great interest,"" said Tasuku Matsuki, Japanese Foreign Ministry official in charge of Russia.The Foreign Ministry of Belarus said on Tuesday that the country was forced to host Russian nuclear weapons due to ""unprecedented” pressure from the United States and other Western countries.""Belarus is forced to respond to strengthen its own security and defense capability,"" the Foreign Ministry said.Minsk also reiterated the point made by Moscow that the deal ""in no way contradicts” the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.""Military cooperation between Belarus and Russia is carried out in strict accordance with international law,"" the ministry said.The British government announced on Tuesday that it will work with Poland to build two temporary villages in Ukraine to house people displaced by the Russian invasion.The villages, in the Liviv and Poltava regions, will be able to accommodate 700 people. The UK pledged £10 million ($12.3 million) in funding.""For the past year, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has continued to target civilian homes and infrastructure, with the Ukrainian people paying a heavy price,"" British foreign minister James Cleverly said in a statement.The city of Bakhmut has been under siege for months. DW's Max Zander spoke to some of the soldiers holding the line.More than 20 foreign firms that fled Russia after its invasion of Ukraine relocated to Kazakhstan, authorities in Astana claim.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849586,India: What's behind the spike in COVID cases?,"India has seen an increase in the number of daily new COVID-19 cases over the past few days, with virologists and epidemiologists saying that a new variant, XBB.1.16, could be the reason behind the surge.According to Health Ministry data on Tuesday, the South Asian country logged 1,573 fresh infections in 24 hours, while the number of active cases had increased to 10,981.That's up from the less than 100 new cases India reported on some days in January this year — which was the lowest rate since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020.""New variants will keep coming as the virus keeps on mutating over time and the XBB 1.16 is the new strain. These are all from the omicron family, with higher infectivity and lower virulence,"" Srinath Reddy, former president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told DW.Following the surge in cases, Secretary of the Ministry of Health Rajesh Bhushan held a meeting with officials from various states and reviewed the nation's COVID preparedness.State authorities have also been told to undertake mock drills at health facilities on April 10 and 11 to ensure operational readiness of medical infrastructure.""The exercise is aimed at taking stock of the availability of medicines, hospital beds, medical equipment and medical oxygen,"" a senior health official told DW.A similar exercise was held in December last year when there was a surge in COVID-19 cases in countries such as China, Japan, Brazil and South Korea.Despite the rising cases, there is no need to panic, said Gautam Menon, dean of research at Ashoka University.""The rise in infections has not resulted in a rise in serious cases. This is because the new variant is encountering a population that is already substantially protected against severe disease, through a prior infection or vaccination or, in most cases, both,"" Menon told DW.""The symptoms and their relative mildness suggest that COVID-19 will likely stay with us for the foreseeable future, causing mild disease in a seasonal manner, much like the other human coronaviruses that cause about 30% of common colds,"" Menon added.Vineeta Bal from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune pointed out that a discernible pattern is emerging in which a more transmissible virus variant appears, displaces the dominant one, leads to an increase in cases, and then subsides as people gain immunity.""A similar process is happening with XBB.1.16 as well,"" she said, adding: ""The variant appears marginally more infectious, possibly leading to some increase in symptomatic COVID, though not overwhelmingly so.""""Immunity due to vaccination and earlier infections is likely to be waning in the community, and hence a recombinant variant such as XBB.1.16 is gaining some ground. I do not expect another major outbreak of serious illness and this increase in cases may subside in some time.""India, a country of 1.4 billion people, has administered more than 2.2 billion COVID vaccine doses.But government data shows only about 30% of the eligible population has so far received a third or booster dose.Authorities say they are trying to expand this coverage, especially among high-risk and vulnerable sections of society.Giridhara Babu, an epidemiologist, said ""proactive surveillance"" was key to efforts to prevent another mass outbreak of coronavirus infections.""Despite XBB.1.16 being potentially more contagious than other omicron variants, there is no evidence to suggest that it leads to higher disease severity or increased hospitalization and mortality rates,"" he stressed.""With COVID now endemic, it is crucial to continue proactive surveillance efforts to guide the future course of action.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/28,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849588,EU passes law to ban sale of CO2-emitting cars by 2035,"Final approval was given on Tuesday for a law that will bring an end to the sale of vehicles running on CO2-emitting fuels by 2035, Swedish Energy Minister Ebba Busch announced.Energy ministers from the 27 member states gave the go-ahead for the contested law which had been delayed for weeks by Germany's Transport Minister Volker Wissing.A compromise was agreed between Brussels and Berlin on Saturday that will allow the sale of cars and vans that run on so-called climate-neutral e-fuels which use synthetic fuels produced with captured carbon.The move is an attempt to curb the bloc's CO2 emissions which have a major impact on global warming and the subsequent plethora of dangerous effects on the planet.Transport is accountable for around 25% of the EU's emissions.Although Germany was able to water down the law, it was not the only member state to raise opposition. Poland's energy minister voted against the law while representatives from Romania, Italy and Bulgaria abstained.Opposition has stemmed from fears of the rising costs of vehicles. Italy had also pushed for an exemption to be made for biofuels.Not only governments but also car producers had pushed back on the phase-out. German luxury car manufacturer Porsche and Italian producer Ferrari had complained that the necessary batteries for electric cars would be too heavy for their vehicles.Other carmakers, such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Ford are already betting on electric vehicles amid a push to find moderate solutions to reducing carbon emissions.Germany's important car-manufacturing industry, as well as a general love of cars, has been seen as the main reason for its own pushback.Transport Minister Wissing and his pro-market Free Democrats — a member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government — had raised a last-minute objection that had thwarted EU efforts to briskly pass through the legislation.But the German compromise has come under fire for weakening the bloc's environmental ambitions, with critics pointing out that e-fuels are expensive and energy-intensive, requiring about five times more renewable electricity than simply running a battery electric vehicle.ab/fb (dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/28,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849589,Their stories were lost to slavery. Now DNA is writing them,"CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — In the 1700s, a boy was born into slavery in Colonial America. He spent his life working in the coastal city of Charleston, South Carolina. And when he died in middle age, he was buried alongside 35 other slaves.That's the likely history that researchers have uncovered for the man — there's no written record for him or the others buried at the long-forgotten site. Their names have been lost, along with any details of their lives. But their stories are now being told through what was left behind: bones, teeth and, especially, DNA.In recent decades, advances in DNA research have allowed scientists to use ancient remains and peer into the lives of long-dead people. In Charleston, that's meant tracing some of the African roots that were cut off by slavery.“We’re bringing their memory back to life,” said Raquel Fleskes, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut who studied the remains. “This is a way of restoring dignity to individuals that should’ve always had this dignity.”The Charleston project started a decade ago, when construction workers unearthed the remains beneath the grounds of the Gaillard Center, an arts venue in the city that was going through an expansion.Dating back to the second half of the 18th century, the remains are believed to be mostly from enslaved people of African descent who lived nearby. A few of them were likely among the estimated 175,000 Africans brought through Charleston’s port, a hub for the trans-Atlantic slave trade.The city reburied the remains at the site, where a memorial fountain is planned. But with few recorded details available, community members were also interested in using science to learn more about the people, Fleskes said.So, the Anson Street African Burial Ground Project was born, and researchers started looking for clues.____Artifacts from the site showed that the bodies were buried with care, explained Theodore Schurr, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania who worked on the research. Some of them had beads in their hair or coins over their eyes. Minerals in their teeth showed only a few had been born in Africa, while most had likely been born into slavery in Charleston or nearby.Scientists also coaxed DNA from the centuries-old skeletons — drilling small samples of bones and teeth, grinding them up into powder, mixing them into a solution and filtering out everything but the human DNA. They were able to get some genetic material for most of the 36 and full genomes for half of them, which were compared with the genetic makeup of people in Africa today.Results showed that they had ties to many different places along the West African coast, from Gambia to Gabon. They were mostly male, and largely died as adults. Their ages ranged from a child under 3 to a man over 50.Their DNA showed they were unrelated, aside from one possible mother-child pair.Researchers also offered DNA tests to 78 African Americans living in the Charleston area today, said La’Sheia Oubré, who led community education for the project. So far, they haven't found any direct relatives of those buried at Anson Street.Still, Oubré — who took a DNA test — said she and other community members consider them family.“They have such a story to tell,” she said. “And because they’re not related to us by blood, it doesn’t mean that it’s not our moral responsibility to take care of them.”___Since it became possible to sequence DNA from ancient remains, the technology has taken us back to the days of Neanderthals and mammoths.Some researchers have been using ancient DNA to fill gaps in our more recent history. That includes cases like Charleston as well as the New York African Burial Ground Project, which revealed new details about Africans and their descendants in 18th century Manhattan.There aren’t many records for these people from the time, said Michael Blakey, an anthropologist who served as the scientific director on the New York project. The records that are available focuses on things like how much enslaved people cost and what kinds of laws were used to control them, he said.Oubré said it’s been powerful to have DNA reveal some of the “stolen history” of those buried in her city.“To be able to know all of this, it’s still mind-blowing to me,” Oubré said. “It still just warms my heart that we’re able to find out where we come from — where we really come from.”In some cases, ancient DNA research has also challenged the history that’s been written about certain communities.Growing up in Puerto Rico, anthropologist Maria Nieves-Colon was taught that the Indigenous peoples of the islands were quickly wiped out by European colonization, and didn't pass on their genes to people on the island today. But after looking at ancient remains from the island in a 2020 study, Nieves-Colon found genetic links did exist between those Indigenous groups and modern-day Puerto Ricans.Research like this shows “we need to think more critically about what was left in the historical record,” said Nieves-Colon, who is now at the University of Minnesota.___While ancient DNA can be a powerful tool for uncovering history, it needs to be used with caution, researchers note, especially when it comes to vulnerable groups.Unlike research on living subjects, work on recovered human remains doesn’t require scientists to get consent, explained Krystal Tsosie, a geneticist at Arizona State University. And in the past, most researchers haven’t consulted with groups like Native tribes or African descendants before studying the remains of possible ancestors.But this kind of work does impact living communities and they should be part of the conversation, researchers said.“In many ways, it’s about power,” Blakey said. “The right to tell your story.”In Charleston, project leaders asked community members for their permission before every step, Oubré said. The names of the 36 had been lost to history and the team gave them new ones — like Coosaw, Welela, Isi and Kuto — so they wouldn’t be just numbers on a burial plot, said Joanna Gilmore, director of research and interpretation with the Anson Street project.Now, the new memorial is set to honor the lives of these 36 individuals, as well as the thousands of enslaved people who helped build Charleston, project leaders said.The memorial will be at the Gaillard Center, where a small plaque now marks the site where the remains were uncovered. It will include a fountain circled by pairs of bronze hands cast from current residents, and a base made of soil from other African burial grounds across the city, Gilmore explained.Last month at an art studio, residents created a copy of their hands, leaning elbow-deep into buckets of pink goo that hardened into molds. Artist Stephen Hayes poured liquid plastic into the molds to make shiny white replicas.Adrian Swinton got her hands cast to represent a woman given the name Tima. Swinton is descended from slaves herself, and said the memorial was a powerful way to remember their sacrifices.“Her legacy hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Swinton said. “And she wasn’t property. She was a human. She was part of my Black history.”Retiree Ervin McDaniel Jr. was giddy as he held up his freshly made plastic hands, which will be cast in bronze to represent the boy born into slavery who was given the name Fumu.""They lived, they worked, they died — and now they’re being remembered forever,” McDaniel said___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849590,Debt ceiling impasse: McCarthy presses Biden to negotiate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Tuesday he's increasingly concerned about President Joe Biden's unwillingness to negotiate on lifting the nation's borrowing authority, saying in a letter to the president that the White House position could ""hold dire ramifications for the entire nation.”Rather than open direct talks on the debt ceiling, which the Democrats agree must be raised, Biden and his party's lawmakers are challenging Republicans to publicly present their own budget proposals — something McCarthy has so far declined to do.For now, the Treasury Department has resorted to “extraordinary measures” to avoid default on the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority. But those measures will run out — and put the U.S. at risk of being unable to pay all of its bills — possibly as early as June.The White House has emphasized that Biden is not willing to entertain proposed cuts in programs simply in exchange for lifting the debt limit. But McCarthy and Republicans are insisting he must for debt ceiling legislation to move ahead. The two sides are on a slow-motion collision course that could have negative implications for the economy in the months ahead.“Nearly two month ago, you and I sat down to discuss a path forward on the debt limit,” McCarthy wrote. “Since that time, however, you and your team have been completely missing in action on any meaningful follow-up to this rapidly approaching deadline.”He also told Biden, “Simply put: You are on the clock. It's time to drop the partisanship, roll up our sleeves, and find common ground on this urgent challenge. Please have your team reach out to mine by the end of this week to set a date for our next meeting.”In a formal response to McCarthy released later Tuesday, Biden signaled that he would not be willing to meet directly with the speaker until House Republicans released their own budget proposal, and he asked McCarthy to do so before lawmakers leave Washington for the Easter recess later this week.“We can agree that an unprecedented default would inflict needless economic pain on hard-working Americans and that the American people have no interest in brinksmanship,” Biden wrote. He said he would be willing to have a separate conversation with McCarthy on the nation’s fiscal outlook, but “for that conversation to be productive, we should both tell the American people what we are for.”The White House believes that many voters would not look favorably on some of the proposals Republicans are urging.“It's time for Republicans to stop playing games, pass a clean debt ceiling bill, and quit threatening our economic recovery,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.So far, the House Freedom Caucus, which includes many of the House's most conservative members, has put forward a blueprint, which includes returning to fiscal year 2022 spending levels and allowing for 1% annual growth after that for the next 10 years. The plan also includes rolling back an estimated $400 billion in Biden’s student loan relief and clawing back all unspent COVID-19 funds.The White House has seized on those Freedom Caucus proposals, saying they would lead to draconian cuts that would endanger Americans' safety, such as cutting federal support for local law enforcement, scaling back rail safety inspections and jeopardizing safety at U.S. airports while increasing wait times at TSA security check points.Republicans in the House say voters gave them a mandate to reduce future deficits and put the country on firmer financial footing for coming decades. They are portraying the White House as inviting the standoff by refusing to negotiate.“The one thing that is not going to be helpful is Washington playing this silly game of waiting to the last minute to do something,” said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla. “And so I think what the speaker is doing is leading the country. Our hope is that the president joins us in that work.""But Democrats believe the pressure will continue to build on Republicans to allow for a clean debt ceiling increase — with no spending-cut trade-offs — and then lawmakers from the two parties can negotiate overall levels for federal agencies in spending bills for the coming fiscal year. The failures of Silicon Valley Bank in California and Signature Bank in New York have also added to concerns about how the threat of a default could impact the economy.McCarthy listed several prospects for reducing federal spending in his letter to Biden. Among them:— Reducing “excessive non-defense” spending to “pre-inflationary levels” and limiting growth in future years.— Reclaiming unspent COVID funds that he says have sat dormant for more than two years.— Strengthening work requirements for people without dependents who receive federal assistance.— Enacting policies to lower energy costs and secure the U.S.-Mexico border.McCarthy also briefed House Republicans on the letter during a closed-door meeting Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the private session and granted anonymity to discuss it. McCarthy told his colleagues that Biden misled them about the budget negotiations, which have essentially stalled since their first meeting Feb. 1, the person said.Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., disparaged McCarthy's letter as consisting only of bullet points and called on House Republicans to both produce a budget and raise the debt limit, noting Congress lifted the ceiling three times during Donald Trump's presidency.“The full faith and credit of the United States government should not be in question,"" Aguilar said. ""The United States pays its bills.”Senate Republicans have said it will be up to the administration and House Republicans to work out an agreement on the debt ceiling. Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said earlier this year he couldn't imagine any kind of debt ceiling measure passing the Senate could also pass in the House, so the House should take the lead.“We're very supportive of what the speaker is trying to do, and hopefully his letter, which laid out some specific solutions, will get the administration back to the table,” said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Republicans need to provide a plan to advance the issue and justify a meeting.“If they were to sit down, you would have to ask yourself, what are they going to talk about? The weather?” Schumer said. “We have a plan. We want to pass the debt ceiling without hostage taking, without brinksmanship.""___AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and AP writers Stephen Groves and Seung Min Kim contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849591,'The Big Door Prize' asks deep questions about happiness,"NEW YORK (AP) — Not to be rude, but are you living your best life? Are you sure? Might you be destined to be something else? Do you know what that could be?Those are some of the deep questions residents of the fictional town of Deerfield are dealing with as they confront fulfilling their life potential in the new Apple TV+ series “The Big Door Prize” premiering Wednesday.“The show is in many ways about the idea of the road not taken, and that no matter how happy or fulfilled you think you are, there’s always this curiosity about the other path,” says David West Read, showrunner and executive producer.The premise is this: One day a mysterious machine appears in the local store, offering to reveal to every user a specialized card printed with what they should be, like “Meteorologist,” “Healer,” “Storyteller” and “Undertaker.”“This isn’t something you typically see on television. Definitely not wrapped in the form of comedy and magic,” says show star Gabrielle Dennis. “It definitely has you looking within and asking these questions, which can be both a beautiful and scary experience.”Each of the 10 half-hour episodes of “The Big Door Prize” takes turns exploring how members of the community are handling their results. Some quit their jobs, some begin new hobbies, others act differently.The school principal gets “Biker” and soon is riding on a motorcycle until she crashes it and goes to the hospital, where she meets a doctor and falls in love. At her wedding, she credits the machine for connecting her to her new husband, but was that what the machine meant?The series is based on a novel by M.O. Walsh, which appealed to Read's love of stories that mix humor and heart with a magical or sci-fi element. He happened to read it during the pandemic, and the book seemed more timely than ever.“In real life, I saw people hitting the pause button for the first time in a long time and thinking about like, ’What’s that thing I haven’t done — like learning guitar, baking bread, taking up a hobby or breaking up with my partner?'” he says.The spine of the series is a married couple played by Chris O’Dowd and Dennis. O'Dowd's character — a cheerful high school teacher — is unmoored by the destabilizing effect of the machine. When he suddenly learns that his wife enjoys spicy food and men with tattoos, he asks her: “What will I find out next? That you also enjoy meth?”O’Dowd says it was interesting to play a man wondering about his life's destiny because the actor says he himself almost never stops to consider his own happiness, despite outside pressures.“We are given in the modern world just such a high bar for what happiness can be, I think, because of social media and because of this kind of constant portrayal of the wonderful and the beautiful out there,” he says.Read, an Emmy-winning writer from “Schitt’s Creek” who penned the story for the Broadway hit ”& Juliet,” says the couple at the center of the new series get curious answers from the machine.“Part of what’s compelling for me about them is that they don’t know how to get there. They don’t have a clear directive. Their cards are ambiguous and and frustrating,” he says.“If only life were that simple that we all knew exactly what it was that was going to make us happy and we could just go out and do it. But knowing that, on some level, you feel like maybe you could be happier, but you don’t know how to get there, is much more interesting to me.”One of the show's most compelling characters is the town's priest, played by Damon Gupton. It's the priest who must try to understand whether the machine is part of some grander plan and how faith fits in, not to mention grief and addiction.“This show is heartfelt and aspirational, but I wanted it to also contain some darkness to feel like it represented the full spectrum of experiences that people can have with this machine,” Read says.On the lighter side, Dennis' character uses the disruption to speak up for herself, start doing things for herself. “For her, it’s a very big question to explore because sometimes as a mom and a wife, some women feel that they lose themselves,” she says.As for what O’Dowd wishes he'd see if he asked such a machine, the answer is a sense of humor. “I would want it to on both sides be written the words ‘Please Turn Over,’” he says, laughing.___ Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849593,"At trial, Minnesota says e-cigarette maker Juul targets kids","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison personally opened his state's case against Juul Labs on Tuesday, accusing the e-cigarette maker of using “slick products, clever ads and attractive flavors” to hook children on nicotine as the first of thousands of cases against the company reached trial.Minnesota is seeking more than $100 million in damages, accusing Washington, D.C.-based Juul of unlawfully targeting young people to get a new generation addicted to nicotine.“They baited, deceived, and addicted a whole new generation of kids after Minnesotans slashed youth smoking rates down to the lowest level in a generation,” Ellison said. “Now, big tobacco is back with a new name but the same game. Juul wiped out the work of our state with their slick products, clever ads, and attractive flavors.”Juul has faced thousands of lawsuits nationwide but most have settled, including 39 with other states and U.S. territories. Not Minnesota, which won a landmark $7.1 billion settlement with the tobacco industry in 1998. Minnesota added tobacco industry giant Altria, which formerly owned a minority stake in Juul, as a co-defendant in 2020.Altria completed its divestiture this month and says it effectively lost its $12.8 billion investment.David Bernick, an attorney for Juul, promised jurors an “intense and interesting” trial. He said the purpose of Juul was always to convert adult smokers of combustible cigarettes to a less-dangerous product that would still provide a satisfying nicotine experience — not to lure kids. E-cigarettes aren't safe but aren't deadly either, he said; they're somewhere in between. And Juul did nothing to intentionally drive youth demand, he argued, suggesting that the growth in youth vaping was more likely due to increasing adult demand resulting in ”leakage” to kids.William Geraghty, an attorney for Altria, denied Ellison's assertions that Altria invested heavily in Juul because it ultimately wanted to hook kids on its cigarettes, which include Marlboro. He said Altria bought its passive stake because Juul had found the key to successfully switching adult smokers of conventional cigarettes to a less harmful product, while Altria's competing e-cigarettes had failed in the marketplace.The lawsuit against Juul, filed in 2019, alleges consumer fraud, creating a public nuisance, unjust enrichment and conspiracy with Altria. The jury trial before Hennepin County District Judge Laurie Miller is expected to last about three weeksJuul Labs launched in 2015 on the popularity of flavors like mango, mint, fruit medley and creme brulee. Teenagers fueled its rise, and some became hooked on Juul’s high-nicotine pods. Amid a backlash, Juul dropped all U.S. advertising and discontinued most of its flavors in 2019, losing popularity with teens. Juul’s share of the now multibillion-dollar market has fallen to about 33% from a high of 75% in 2018.In his opening statement, Ellison argued that Juul and Altria broke the law by using deceptive actions to sell tobacco products to minors. Juul purposely made its products small and sleek to make detection by adults difficult, formulated them to deliver high doses of nicotine to addict children, added flavors that would appeal to young people and used a marketing campaign they knew would appeal to teens, Ellison said.“Young people are innocent, and they want to explore,” Ellison said. """"Kids are attracted to what is shiny, slick, cool — and that is exactly who Juul and Altria were targeting and preying upon.""Bernick gave the jury an alternative explanation. Adult smokers don’t like to be seen smoking because of the social stigma, he said. So Juul designed its products to look different from conventional cigarettes and other e-cigarettes then on the market so that adults could use them discretely, he said, not so that kids could use them in school.Bernick said Minnesota had experienced an “exponential increase’ in youth vaping even before Juul arrived on the local market in late 2017. And he asserted that the company had already ended some of its most-criticized practices, suggesting that Juul itself wasn’t to blame for the rise.Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group — formerly known as Phillip Morris Cos. — says it had nothing to do with the design of Juul, nor its creation of its fruit and other flavors, nor the running of the company.In fact, Geraghty said, Juul stopped selling several of those flavors at the retail level before Altria invested in it. He denied that the marketing services that Altria provided Juul for about a year — which included the use of its shelf space at convenience stores and Juul coupons tucked into Marlboro packs — did anything to increase youth vaping in Minnesota. State health department statistics show youth vaping actually flattened out in the state between 2017 and 2020, he said.And Geraghty said Altria never made anything off Juul sales — it would have made money only if they company's value had increased, which it didn't.Juul is now appealing the Food and Drug Administration's rejection of its application to keep selling its vaping products as a smoking alternative for adults. Juul is still being sued by New York, California, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Alaska, Illinois, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849594,French authorities search 5 banks in Paris in tax fraud case,"PARIS (AP) — Authorities raided the Paris offices of five banks Tuesday on suspicion of tax fraud, French prosecutors said.The raids come as part of five preliminary investigations opened in December 2021 on allegations of money laundering and tax fraud linked to dividend payments, the French National Financial Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement.Prosecutors didn't specify which banks were raided. French media said the banks searched included HSBC, BNP Paribas, Exane — a subsidiary of BNP — Societe Generale, and Natixis.Societe Generale confirmed the investigation at its office but declined to comment further. Messages seeking comment from the other banks were not immediately returned.The raid comes amid global financial turmoil unleashed this month by the collapse of two U.S. banks and the government-orchestrated takeover of troubled Swiss lender Credit Suisse by its rival UBS.The French investigation involved “cum cum” deals in which a foreign shareholder of a company listed in France transfers its shares to a French bank around the time that dividends are paid out to avoid paying capital gains tax.The French prosecutors' statement says the search involved six German prosecutors from Cologne, in the framework of European judicial cooperation. It suggests that foreign shareholders in question included Germans or German entities.The Cologne prosecutor’s office said it cannot comment on the investigation because “press sovereignty in this case lies with the French investigative authorities.”A similar wide-ranging tax evasion investigation in neighboring Germany in recent years led to searches of banks, other companies and the homes of businesspeople, leading to convictions against some bankers.Hundreds of bankers allegedly were involved in that fraud — involving “cum-ex” transactions in which participants swap shares to collect reimbursement for taxes they had not paid.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849595,"Brazil has a new biggest favela, and not in Rio de Janeiro","SOL NASCENTE, Brazil (AP) — The buzzing main avenue of this poor Brazilian neighborhood is filled with people popping off buses after work or grabbing a bite. Teens attend an open-air rap battle and gymnastics class. Hymns and prayers from tiny church services spill into the night.It’s an ordinary Wednesday in Brazil’s biggest favela, or low-income neighborhood. And for the first time since poverty, lack of opportunity and economic inequality caused favelas to mushroom across many of the nation’s cities, that superlative doesn’t belong to a favela in Rio de Janeiro.Sol Nascente (Rising Sun, in English) is just 21 miles (34 kilometers) from capital Brasilia in the Federal District, whose GDP per capita is by far higher than any Brazilian state, underscoring the inequality between affluent public servants' neighborhoods and the district’s outskirts.The number of households in Sol Nascente has swelled 31% since 2010 to more than 32,000, surpassing Rio's hillside Rocinha favela that had been Brazil’s most populous, according to preliminary data from the ongoing census. Rocinha has almost 31,000 households, the data show.Along Sol Nascente’s unpaved dirt roads of self-built homes and inside the main strip’s busy stores and restaurants, no one The Associated Press spoke welcomed the new ranking,“We still need lots of things, like basic sanitation and infrastructure, but people nowadays have better conditions. Some even have a car,” said street vendor Francisca Célia, 43.Célia added that, despite its challenges, Sol Nascente isn’t nearly as disorganized nor dangerous as the favelas she saw when visiting Rio three years ago. Plus, available plots of land are much bigger.“It’s a paradise here,” she said.The growth of Sol Nascente’s population reflects new arrivals searching for cheap or unoccupied land to build homes, whereas elsewhere in the Federal District poor people often pay relatively high rents. It also mirrors the surge of people living in working-class neighborhoods nationwide, driven by a generalized housing crisis caused by deep recession and higher rent prices, the effects of which were compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Marcelo Neri, an economist and social researcher at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank.The number of people living in areas the national statistics institute classifies as “subnormal agglomerates” jumped 40% to 16 million people since the 2010 census, according to the institute’s preliminary data, reviewed by the AP. Brazil's population as a whole grew less than 9% in that period.Subnormal agglomerates include not just favelas, but also other terms used in Brazil to describe urban areas with irregular occupation and deficient public services. Residents of Sol Nascente acknowledge that it once was a favela, but told the AP that many areas of the community have outgrown that term.The statistics institute ceases to consider communities subnormal agglomerates once most residents gain legal title to their properties or all essential services are available, according to the institute’s geography coordinator, Cayo Franco.Favelas grow as settlers move onto unoccupied public and private land, whether on steep hillsides or flatland, like Sol Nascente.Sol Nascente still has poor public transport and unpaved, impassable roads, which flood frequently during the months of summer rains. Only some residents have obtained legal title, and services aren't universally accessible.“I pay electricity, water, taxes, but there’s no sewage nor asphalt here in front,” said Débora Alencar, 39, who moved to Sol Nascente 15 years ago after finding the opportunity to buy land and build a house.“This is where I gained dignity,” she added.Alencar runs a collective that receives food, clothing and school materials for the needy. It also provides vocational training for manicurists and make-up artists, as well as dance and theater classes.She has also been a community representative since 2019, negotiating with the Federal District’s government for investments. She said she has secured some improvements, but not enough.A common characteristic among favelas is that the stigma lingers even after residents obtain titles and services, according to Theresa Williamson, executive director of non-profit Catalytic Communities, a Rio-based non-profit that studies favelas.That sentiment is familiar to Nayara Miguel, a housewife with two kids in a tidy area of Sol Nascente that now has electricity and water, and where the local government recently paved streets and installed public lighting. The federal government’s cities ministry has earmarked funds for a housing project there.“For me, this isn’t a favela; it’s a city,” said Miguel, 30. “Of course, it’s lacking a lot: I couldn’t get a spot in daycare for my daughter, so I can’t work; we can get to the hospital, but there’s no doctor there to attend to us.”Neighboring areas still feature shacks. Bruno Ferreira and his wife have been carving out a life in a destitute area of Sol Nascente for the last seven years. They found a place where, with their own hands, they could build a one-bedroom home to call their own and escape the rent trap.Ferreira, 39, works odd jobs and his wife has a formal, full-time job at a lunch counter. They are raising five children, with a sixth on the way, and saving to put in tile atop their home’s earthen floor.Neither desires to leave.“It’s very good here,” he said. “It’s just lacking infrastructure to be beautiful and legal.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849596,Residents of historically Black town sue to stop land sale,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — One of the first historically Black towns in the U.S. is suing the local school board to stop the sale of land that is tied up with Florida's legacy of racial segregation decades ago and the state's fast-paced growth nowadays.An association dedicated to the preservation of the town of Eatonville's cultural history last Friday sued the Orange County School Board in an effort to stop the sale of the 100-acre property where the Robert Hungerford Preparatory High School once stood.The proposed $14.6 million sale of the school property to a developer with plans to build 350 new new homes, along with and business spaces, threatens the cultural heritage of the town, the Association to Preserve the Eatonville Community said in its lawsuit. The sale is set to close on Friday.With a population of around 2,350 people residents, of whom almost three-quarters are Black, the town located outside of Orlando is perhaps best known through the writings of Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston. Eatonville was the setting for one of her best known works, “Their Eyes Were Watching God.”The association, along with other Eatonville residents, fear the sale of the property in a centrally-located part of fast-growing metro Orlando will increase traffic and price out longtime residents of the town, many whose families have lived there for generations.""If this sale is allowed to proceed, the rich culture and heritage of the town that Zora Neale Hurston popularized around the world as ‘the first incorporated African American community in the United States’ will be erased,” said said N.Y. Nathiri, executive director of the association, which is being represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center.The school board said in a statement that it couldn't comment on pending litigation.Founded in 1887, Eatonville was among the early all-Black incorporated municipalities established in the decades after the end of slavery in the U.S. Around 1,200 Black towns or settlements were established in the late 19th century and early 20th century, according to the Historic Black Towns and Settlements Alliance.The Hungerford school was established in 1897 for Black children facing an educational system that segregated them from white students. The Orange County School Board purchased the property from a trust in 1951 under a deed restriction that the school would continue to be used to educate Black children. Even after the U.S. Supreme Court desegregated the nation's schools in 1954, Orange County public schools remained segregated for years afterwards.The school board was able to sell a portion of the property in 1974 after a circuit court lifted the deed restriction for that section of land. In the 2010s, the town of Eatonville, in cooperation with the school board, tried to have the deed restriction removed by suing the trust for a release so that the remaining land could be sold for commercial purposes during a period of time when Orlando was one of the fastest-growing metros in the U.S.The parties reached several different settlements over the decade, but the association's lawsuit argues they are void since they either weren't court approved or didn't have the participation of all the required parties, including the Florida attorney general representing the public's interest.Last year, Eatonville residents elected a new town mayor who opposes the proposed development. The trustees have no authority to lift the deed restriction, and any lifting of the restriction should either benefit Eatonville's youth or be used for educational purposes, according to the lawsuit.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849597,"Brueghel work found in dim French TV room sells for $845,000","PARIS (AP) — One of Flemish painter Pieter Brueghel the Younger's largest known works, whose discovery behind the television room door of a house in northern France amazed the art world, fetched 780,000 euros ($845,000) at auction in Paris Tuesday.The 17th century oil painting — which experts call “exceptional” and was long considered a fake by its owners — was discovered by chance in December collecting dust. An expert conducting an estimation request spotted something poking out past a door of the dim family house.“I arrived in a small television room which was not very well lit. I started making my estimates in the living room and turning around behind the door, there were two thirds of the painting visible,” Malo de Lussac of the auctioneers Daguerre Val de Loire, told The Associated Press. “And that’s when in fact I discovered the painting. It was a bit of a surprise.”The family of the owners, who wished to remain anonymous, acquired the work in 1900, and had always called it affectionally ‘The Brueghel,’ thinking it was fake. It was an ironic twist in their family lore that a work of such importance had been hiding in plain view.The painting is believed to have been painted between 1615 and 1617 and depicts one of Brueghel the Younger’s common themes “The Village Lawyer"" — a bustling legal office in a rural community.“The family ancestors bought the painting as an original, but over the years the real story was completely lost orally ... Maybe the family was not necessarily interested in this painting,” de Lussac said. “Yes, they called it the Brueghel, but they had no idea it actually was!”The vibrant painting measures 112cm high and 184cm wide, and is one of Brueghel the Younger’s two biggest pieces.The discovery “was the biggest moment of my career. But of course I was cautious. It is after all rather rare to find a Brueghel hanging in a television room,” de Lussac said.Born in Brussels in 1564, Pieter Brueghel the Younger was the eldest son of the Pieter Bruegel the Elder, among the most important figures of the Flemish Renaissance.Brueghel the Younger was famed for his lively depictions of village life, and sometimes known as “Hell Brueghel” because of his fantastical depictions of infernal and grotesque scenes.“The Village Lawyer” was purchased by an unnamed Swiss buyer.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849598,Liberal outraises conservative in Wisconsin court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Democratic-funded candidate in Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court contest has raised more than five times as much money as her Republican-backed opponent ahead of the April 4 election.Liberal Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz raised nearly $12.4 million in the final campaign finance reporting period between Feb. 7 and March 20, reports filed late Monday show. Her conservative opponent, former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly, raised $2.2 million during the same period.The winner of the country's most expensive state Supreme Court race to date will determine majority control of Wisconsin's high court with issues such as abortion access, legislative redistricting, union rights and election laws at stake. The race has garnered national attention, given Wisconsin's importance as a presidential swing state.The state Supreme Court came within a vote of overturning President Joe Biden's victory in 2020. Conservatives have controlled the court for 15 years, but the winner will determine majority control for at least the next two years, including before and immediately after the 2024 presidential race.Since launching their campaigns, Protasiewicz has raised $14.5 million, more than $8.8 million of it coming from the state Democratic Party. Kelly has raised more than $2.7 million. He received nearly half-a-million dollars' worth of in-kind contributions from the state Republican Party and nearly $50,000 in donations from county Republican parties and the Republican Assembly Campaign Committee.Protasiewicz's fundraising advantage allowed her to get TV ads on the air weeks before Kelly and his conservative backers could counter. As of March 22, her campaign had bought or reserved more than $10.1 million in ads, while Kelly had spent about $460,000, according to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.Over the most recent six-week reporting period, Protasiewicz spent more than $8.3 million on ads compared with roughly $364,000 by Kelly. Third-party groups have helped Kelly narrow the gap, but Protasiewicz's side still had spent more on TV and radio ads, based on tallies by the Brennan Center and others.All of the spending, estimated at more than $30 million and climbing, has made the race the most expensive for a court seat in U.S. history. The prior record high was $15.4 million spent on an Illinois Supreme Court race in 2004.Protasiewicz has made her support for abortion rights a central focus of her ads and campaign. She has also attacked Kelly for his past work for Republicans and Wisconsin Right to Life, an anti-abortion group.Kelly has tried to paint Protasiewicz as weak on crime, citing numerous cases where he alleges she handed soft sentences to criminals — some of whom went on to reoffend.Protasiewicz reported 28 donors over the most recent reporting period who gave the maximum of $20,000 allowed, including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker. Billionaire financier George Soros donated $1 million to the state Democratic Party. Both donations came the day after the Feb. 21 primary. Only three of her maximum donors came from Wisconsin, including former Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig.The number of out-of-state donations points to the national spotlight on this race, which has become a frontline battle over abortion access. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to decide a pending lawsuit challenging the state's 1849 near-total ban on abortion.Kelly reported 19 donations at the maximum of $20,000 this period, including from Beloit billionaire and GOP mega-donor Diane Hendricks. Unlike his opponent, all of his top donors came from Wisconsin except for three.Protasiewicz ended the reporting period with just over $2 million cash on hand, compared with about $395,000 for Kelly.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849599,Millennial Money: Manage the costs of a chronic condition,"For millennials with chronic medical conditions — or those raising kids with chronic conditions — health care can be an enormous monthly expense. About 44% of older millennials born between 1981 and 1988 have at least one chronic health condition, including migraines, major depression and asthma, according to a 2021 survey of over 4,000 adults conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of CNBC Make It. And many millennials are also caring for children with complicated medical needs.Expenses can include doctor’s visits, tests and prescription drugs, plus indirect costs that may result from missing work.But there are ways to keep health care costs lower, including taking advantage of a flexible spending account or health savings account, comparing pharmacy prices on medications and using a care manager through your insurance. Here are some strategies to try.ASK QUESTIONSIf you have a chronic condition, be an active participant in your care. “Too many people go to the doctor and the doctor says, ‘We’re ordering this test; we’re doing this medicine,’ and they don’t inquire as to why,” says Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and physician in Jacksonville, Florida. “When you need bloodwork, ask the doctor, ‘How is this bloodwork going to change what we do for me?’”If the answer is essentially, “We’re just checking,” McClanahan says, ask your doctor whether you can safely skip that test because you’re trying to control costs.COMPARE MEDICATION COSTSYour prescription medication may cost significantly less at another pharmacy. For example, a recent search for sumatriptan, a common migraine medication, showed prices ranging from about $7 to $36 at various pharmacies in Austin, Texas.“People should always shop their prescription costs,” McClanahan says.She suggests checking sites like goodrx.com, which offers coupons on prescriptions and shows nearby prices, or costplusdrugs.com, which sells drugs at a low cost. And ask your insurer whether there are preferred pharmacies on your plan.If a medication is expensive, check with the manufacturer for discount programs or coupons. The manufacturer of diabetes medication Jardiance, for instance, offers a savings card that reduces prescription costs to $10 per month for a limited time for eligible people. A month’s supply of the drug lists for more than $500 on GoodRx.And if your insurer declines to cover a medication you need, appeal the decision. “Appeals are a pain and time-consuming, but they do work,” says Leslie Beck, a certified financial planner in Rutherford, New Jersey.USE TAX-ADVANTAGED BENEFITS WHEN YOU CANIf your employer offers an FSA, you can set aside pre-tax money toward medical expenses. In 2023, employees can contribute as much as $3,050, and employers can allow a carryover from year to year of as much as $610.If you’re using a high-deductible health plan for your health benefits, you can save to an HSA. Savings to an HSA are pre-tax, the money can be invested and grow over time, and anything spent on eligible medical expenses is tax-free.“HSAs are very flexible, and for people dealing with chronic conditions, it may be quite attractive to have this type of account set aside just for their health care costs,” says Jacqueline Koski, a certified financial planner in Dayton, Ohio.(You generally can’t save to an HSA and a health care FSA at the same time — or if your employer allows it, the FSA is limited to dental and vision expenses only, per the IRS.)USE A CASE MANAGERMany insurance companies offer a patient advocate program that can help you manage a condition of yours or a dependent’s. Molly David, whose daughter has a disability, found her insurer’s medical case management program to be a game-changer.“I now had a go-to person for questions and concerns I had,” says David, who also created sempergrata.com, a website for parents of children with disabilities. “This alone was a huge relief. But they could also help with prior authorizations, explaining my options and getting me in touch with other programs that could help.”David’s case manager also pointed out a variety of benefits that were available to her. “We had probably about $80,000 worth of home modifications done by insurance that we never would have thought they would have covered,” David says.FIND YOUR COMMUNITYThere’s strength in numbers, and thanks to social media, it’s easier to find a group of people in the same situation you’re in. Facebook groups and blogs are helpful places to start.“I found a community of Type 1 diabetics, and the guidance that I got from them was life-changing,” says Beck, who also has the condition. “Once you find your community, they’re so helpful in terms of managing (the condition), what works, what doesn’t work, where you can go to get resources — you’d be shocked.”—————————————————————This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849600,Gumbel to receive Sports Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award,"Bryant Gumbel will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award during the 44th Annual Sports Emmy Awards on May 22 in New York, The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences announced Tuesday.Gumbel's career has spanned more than 50 years on NBC, CBS and HBO. He has hosted “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” on HBO since 1995. It has received 36 Sports Emmys.“It’s very humbling. I’ve been a fortunate, lucky guy,” said Gumbel, who is the first Black journalist to receive the award. “It makes you stop and take stock. You take a look at the guys who I admire a great deal who received this award, people like Vin Scully, Jim McKay and Howard Cosell. You never want to put yourself in their company, but it's heady stuff.”Gumbel started as the sports anchor at KNBC in Los Angeles before joining NBC Sports in the fall of 1975. He served as host of the network's NFL, baseball and NCAA Tournament coverage, including the famed 1979 title game between Magic Johnson's Michigan State and Larry Bird's Indiana State. He moved to NBC News in January 1982 to host the “Today” show, a role he had for 15 years.Gumbel was the prime-time host of NBC's coverage of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He was originally slated to be the prime-time host for the 1980 Moscow Games until the United States boycotted them.In 1997, Gumbel went to CBS News to host his own prime-time program. He also had a stint as host of “The Early Show” before departing in 2002.“Bryant has a storied career, from his start as a sportscaster in Los Angeles to five decades of celebrated work — every bit cementing him as an icon and trailblazer in sports and entertainment,” Adam Sharp, president and CEO of NATAS, said in a statement. “Bryant‘s incredible resume and many other projects has brought dramatic and human news and sports stories to life for audiences throughout his career, making him a clear front-runner for this distinct honor.”The one story from “Real Sports” that still resonates for Gumbel is the 2003 feature and interview with Marcus Dixon, who received a 10-year prison sentence for having sex with an underage girl. Georgia's Supreme Court reversed the aggravated child molestation conviction but ruled that the statutory rape conviction would stand. Dixon had served the one-year sentence for that charge.Dixon was a Black 18-year-old and one of the top football prospects in the state of Georgia when a 15-year-old girl, who was white, accused him of rape.“I always point to that because it did everything one can ask in a story,"" Gumbel said. “It was compelling story, but it basically saved and changed a young man’s life. It also righted a wrong, and that’s about all you can expect to do when you are in a position like we are in. You try to find something where you can do some good and help somebody else.”Gumbel did another profile of Dixon in 2021 when he was an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Rams. Dixon is now the defensive line coach with the Denver Broncos.“I’ve always been a sports fan, but I’ve always been less interested in the scores than I was the story elements of sports,” the 74-year old Gumbel said of “Real Sports,” which airs monthly. “I’m overly selfish about it, but I’m enormously proud of it.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849617,Muslim leader for Scotland a sign of UK political diversity,"LONDON (AP) — Humza Yousaf was confirmed as first minister of Scotland on Tuesday, becoming the first person of color to head the Scottish government, and the first Muslim national leader in any Western democracy.The milestone comes five months after the U.K. got its first Hindu leader in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Britain’s capital city is headed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants.All three politicians reflect the accelerating diversification of politics in Britain, a country whose imperialist past has – uncertainly and sometimes painfully – forged a multi-ethnic present.“There’s an expectation now, or a familiarity with diversity in British politics, that we don’t see in other European countries,” said Sunder Katwala of British Future, a think-tank that studies identity and race.Lawmakers in the Edinburgh-based Scottish parliament voted on Tuesday to confirm 37-year-old Yousaf as first minister, a day after he was elected leader of the governing Scottish National Party. Scotland, a country of 5.5 million people, is part of the United Kingdom, but has a semi-autonomous government with broad power in areas including health and education.In an acceptance speech on Monday, Yousaf said he was “forever thankful that my grandparents made the trip from the Punjab to Scotland over 60 years ago.”“As immigrants to this country, who knew barely a word of English, they could not have imagined their grandson would one day be on the cusp of being the next first minister of Scotland,” he said. “From the Punjab to our parliament, this is a journey over generations that reminds us that we should celebrate migrants who contribute so much to our country.”The U.K. has not always heeded that reminder: migrants have often experienced racism and hostility both covert and overt. That hostility remains government policy for people who arrived by unauthorized means: Sunak’s government plans to detain and deport anyone who crosses the English Channel in small boats, and wants to send some asylum-seekers on a one-way trip to Rwanda.But British society and politics have grown markedly more diverse. About 18% of the population is non-white, and many people have roots in countries the British Empire once ruled, including India, Pakistan and Caribbean nations such as Jamaica.Yousaf was born in Glasgow in 1985. His father’s family came from Pakistan, his mother’s from East Africa, part of an exodus of South Asian families who faced post-independence discrimination. One grandfather worked in a Singer sewing machine factory, while a grandmother was a Glasgow bus conductor.At primary school, Yousaf later recalled, “there was only me and one other brown face.” He attended a private high school, then studied politics at the University of Glasgow — after breaking it to his parents, who had hoped he’d become a lawyer.Yousaf joined the pro-independence SNP in 2005, inspired partly by its then-leader Alex Salmond’s opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, which the U.K. under Prime Minister Tony Blair had joined. Yousaf said he felt independence from the U.K. was the only way to ensure Scotland would not become embroiled in another illegal war.Elected to the Scottish parliament in 2011, he has served in several government roles, most recently health. Opposition politicians are scathing about his political record, citing Scotland’s long waiting times for health care and serious drug-addiction problems.Still, Scottish Labour Party leader Anas Sarwar — also a Muslim Glaswegian — said that “regardless of your politics, this is a significant moment for Scotland.”Yousaf has spoken of the strength he draws from religion, but his Muslim faith drew little comment during the SNP contest. Instead it was the faith of his opponent Kate Forbes, an evangelical Christian, that attracted attention. She was criticized after disclosing her opposition to same-sex marriage, which is legal in Scotland — and which Yousaf supports.Britain is not the only European country whose politics are growing more diverse. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has an Indian father, and Portuguese leader Antonio Costa also has South Asian roots.But Britain has seen rapid political change. Forty years ago there were no ethnic-minority lawmakers in the British Parliament. Now there are 65 – 10% of the total. The foreign secretary, home secretary and trade secretary in Sunak’s government are all people of color.Katwala said a notable feature of the diversification is that “it’s happening in all parties” — Yousaf is a Scottish nationalist, Sunak a Conservative, Khan a Labour Party member.“If you can have a prime minister who is Indian Hindu or a Scottish leader who is Asian Muslim, that must mean those groups are part of the ‘us’ and aren’t now facing the question, ‘Will they govern for their own group or will they govern for everybody?’” he said.“There’s a confidence -- among British ethnic minorities, but (also) reciprocated broadly – that politicians who are Black, Asian or white can represent everybody, not just their own group.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849618,Montenegro's president: EU's neglect gave Russia a platform,"PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Montenegro's pro-Western president criticized the European Union for allegedly allowing Russia to spread its influence in the Western Balkans, saying Tuesday that the volatile region has become a “platform” for anti-EU policies due to the bloc’s “negligence.”President Milo Djukanovic spoke to the Associated Press as he prepares for a Sunday runoff election with a political newcomer who has the support of the Montenegrin government, which includes parties seeking closer relations with Serbia and Russia.“Russia has simply walked into an open space left by the European Union,” Djukanovic said of the EU's position toward the Balkans. “The European Union in the past 10 years didn’t know what to do with the Western Balkans, but Russia did. It has developed its network in the Balkans.”Djukanovic, who has held Montenegro's largely ceremonial presidency since 2018, won the most votes in the first round of the country's presidential election, which was held March 19. Analysts in Montenegro think his challenger in the two-candidate runoff, former Economy Minister Jakov Milatovic, stands a good chance of winning because he has the backing of other candidates and political parties.With an early parliamentary election scheduled for June 11, this weekend's vote is considered an important indicator of the future path of Montenegro, a small NATO member nation of 620,000 people. A political stalemate has stalled the country's EU path and raised fears of instability as the war rages in Ukraine.Djukanovic told the AP the presidential contest presents a choice between his pro-EU policies and the “brutal populism” of the current coalition government, which is dominated by parties that favor closer ties with Serbia and Russia.His Democratic Party of Socialists governed the country more or less unchallenged for three decades. The president alleged that the the ruling coalition that came to power after a 2020 parliamentary vote has devastated Montenegro economically and financially.“For the past 2 1/2 years, we have witnessed serious stumbling by Montenegro,” Djukanovic said.The coalition government has pledged that Montenegro would remain on its European Union path. Milatovic, the president's challenger, also has expressed support for the country pursuing EU membership.Analysts say the Western-educated Milatovic, 36, is seen as the favorite on Sunday against Djukanovic, 61, who as prime minister took Montenegro to independence from Serbia in 2006 and defied Russia in 2017 to secure NATO membership.___Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Serbia, contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849619,PGA Tour fall offers spots in Masters and $20 million events,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A trip to the Masters and a chance to play in two $20 million tournaments are among the incentives for PGA Tour players to play this fall if they don't reach the FedEx Cup playoffs.The PGA Tour sent out a memo Monday that offered a few more details on the overhaul that starts in 2024, and Commissioner Jay Monahan is scheduled to be in San Antonio this week to answer any questions from players.What previously was announced is the top 70 in the FedEx Cup advance to the postseason. The top 50 who reached the BMW Championship — the second playoff event — are locked in for all eight designated events that offer a $20 million prize fund.The fall schedule, which hasn't been announced, is open to everyone. The FedEx Cup points list that starts in January will continue into the fall, but only for those players who finish outside the top 50.Winners still get an invitation to the Masters, and it gets them to Kapalua for the Sentry Tournament of Champions. The extended FedEx Cup points list will be used to determine the leading 10 players who will get into the two designated events after Hawaii (presumably Pebble Beach and Riviera).After that, the 2024 FedEx Cup standings will be used to fill those 10 spots.The tour also provided clarity on the five players who get into $20 million events under the “swing” category. Those will be determined by a separated points list of full-field tournaments between designated events.Once that designated event is over, however, the “swing” category starts anew. Whatever points such a player earns in a designated event won't count toward the next one.Now officials have to figure out where to place the five other designated events after the West Coast swing to keep them properly spaced.Also, anyone winning a PGA Tour event (except for opposite-field events) will be eligible for every designated event the rest of the year. Opposite-field event winners get 300 points, which likely would make them eligible through the current FedEx Cup standings or the swing category.The memo said 750 points would be awarded to the winner of the four majors and The Players Championship, 700 points for the designated events and 500 points to everything else (except for opposite fields, which get 300).Still to be determined are any restriction on who gets the four sponsor exemptions to the $20 million event, and when to reshuffle the ranking of new members coming from the Korn Ferry Tour (30 players), the European tour (10) and Q-school (5).CBS AND LIVThe Masters will be the third major that brings together players from LIV Golf with players who stayed loyal to their tours. As far as CBS Sports is concerned, all are at Augusta National by invitation and trying to win a green jacket.“Listen, we're not going to cover up or hide anything,” Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, said in a conference call. “As I said, our job is to cover the golf tournament. We're not going to show any different treatment of the golfers who play on the LIV tour than we do for the other golfers. And if there's a pertinent point that we feel we should bring up on our coverage ... we're not going to put our heads in the sand.“Having said that, unless it really affects the story that's taking place on the golf course, we're not going to out of our way to cover it,” he said. “But I'm not sure there's anything we could add to the story as it already exists.”NBC and Golf Channel had the U.S. Open and British Open, when LIV Golf was still just starting. Plus, the other two majors were held before LIV players first filed an antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.On the European tour, Rory McIlroy and Patrick Reed had an uncomfortable exchange on the driving range in Dubai, and then they came down to the wire before McIlroy won.How appealing would it be to have a PGA Tour player and a LIV Golf player in contention?“We're not cheerleaders,” said Sellers Shy, the lead golf producer for CBS. “Whoever is on that leaderboard, then we're covering them, because they're invited to the Masters.”LPGA IN MALAYSIAThe LPGA Tour is going back to Malaysia and restoring what could have been another gap in the Asia swing.The Maybank Championship will be Oct. 26-29 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club, replacing the void created when the Taiwan Swinging Skirts LPGA was canceled. The Maybank Championship will have a 78-player field and a $3 million purse.The Maybank Championship was a European Tour and Asian Tour event from 2016 through 2019 until being canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The LPGA Tour previously played the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia at Kuala Lumpur from 2010 until that ended in 2017.“The LPGA and Maybank’s shared values around elevating and empowering women make this an important partnership for us in this region of the world,” LPGA Commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.The Maybank Championship would allow for at least a three-week Asia swing in October that would now go from South Korea to Malaysia to Japan before the tour wraps up in Florida. Still on the schedule, the week before South Korea, is an event in Shanghai.The LPGA lost one week of its three-week Asia swing earlier this year when the Blue Bay LPGA on Hainan Island in China was canceled.MAYAKOBA TO CABOLIV Golf took over at Mayakoba, and now the PGA Tour stop at the Mexican resort is moving to the first golf course Tiger Woods designed.The World Wide Technology Championship will move this year to El Cardonal in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, a course by Woods' design company that opened in 2014.The tour had been at Mayakoba since 2007. LIV Golf opened its 2023 season at Mayakoba, forcing the tour to find another venue. The date of the tournament has not been decided, but it will be part of the fall schedule.SPIETH SPEAKINGThe question was meant as a joke. Jordan Spieth was asked to estimate the size of the book if caddie Michael Greller wrote down everything he said during a round.“Big,” Spieth said, before adding as he walked away that he was trying to cut back. That’s been a theme in recent weeks.Spieth is a dream for golf geeks the way he analyzes shots, before and after he hits them. Put a microphone on him and there would be no need for television commentary. But the goal in the pre-Masters run has been to talk less.“I’ve been trying to work on just hitting and playing and not talking so much,” he said after his first match in the Dell Match Play. “It doesn’t necessarily affect how I play, but it is a lot less energy used up, it feels like, over the last couple weeks.”DIVOTSThe Match Play ended with Americans winning the last six tournaments. ... Germany has produced four European tour winners in the last eight months — Maximilian Kieffer in the Czech Masters, Yannik Paul in the Mallorca Open, Marcel Siem in the Indian Open and Nick Bachem last week in South Africa. ... Sam Burns joined Geoff Ogilvy (2006) and Jeff Maggert (1999) as the only players to win the Match Play on their first attempt. ... U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick will be playing the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with his brother, Alex. ... The field for the eight-team International Crown will be decided after the DIO Implant Open on the LPGA Tour. Danielle Kang has the fourth and final spot on the U.S. team at No. 15 in the world, five spots ahead of Jennifer Kupcho. The tight race is for Australia. Grace Kim is in the fourth and final spot. She is No. 177 in the world, while Sarah Kemp is at No. 178. The International Crown is May 4-7 at Harding Park in San Francisco.STAT OF THE WEEKCeline Boutier won the LPGA Drive On Championship and moved to No. 8 in the world. She is the first French player — male or female — to be in the top 10 of the world ranking.FINAL WORD“I also was thinking, ‘If I’m going to miss my flight, I'm going to make sure I win this thing.' I'm not losing and missing my flight.” — Celine Boutier on her playoff win over Georgia Hall in the LPGA Drive On Championship.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849620,"UN hears Africa, its Sahel region, are new terrorism targets","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — African nations called on the world Tuesday to pay attention to how terrorism targeted their continent, particularly its Sahel region, telling the United Nations Security Council that Africans made up nearly half the world's terror attack victims.Using his country's bully pulpit as Security Council chair for March, Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi told the council that “though terrorism is a global threat, the situation in Africa remains more critical.”His words were echoed by a series of ambassadors from African countries who discussed terror groups' threats to their nations.One global terrorism index shows that 48% of terror victims last year were African, Nyusi said, “and the Sahel region is the new epicenter of terrorist attacks.” Many speakers said they were deeply concerned by terror groups' operations in the vast, semi-arid expanse below the Sahara Desert.“The situation in Africa is especially concerning,” Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the council. “Despair, poverty, hunger, lack of basic services, unemployment and unconstitutional changes in government continue to lay fertile ground ... I am deeply concerned by the gains terrorist groups are making in the Sahel and elsewhere.”Mozambique’s Islamist extremist insurgency, which started in October 2017, is blamed for the deaths of more than 3,000 people and for displacing an estimated 900,000 people. In March 2021 the rebel violence forced the France-based firm TotalEnergies to put on hold its $20 billion liquified natural gas project in the northeast. TotalEnergies invoked force majeure after the insurgents attacked the town of Palma, very near the gas project.Palma was later recaptured by Mozambican and Rwandan forces, and the government has urged TotalEnergies to resume work on the gas project.While gains have been made by Mozambique’s armed forces and its regional allies, the rebels are still capable of carrying out lethal attacks — including on the main north-south road that links the city of Pemba with the gas project in Palma.“Mozambique has been engaged in countering terrorism with some success,” Nyusi said, “thanks to a combination of internal efforts and the support from partners.”The U.N. is undergoing a regular review of its counterterror strategies. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council that when she visited Mozambique in January, among the issues she discussed with officials there was how “we faced a host of challenges, especially when it comes to the dramatic rise in terrorism in Africa.”U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, is on a weeklong visit to Africa, intended to deepen U.S. ties with the continent.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849621,"Column: End of the WGCs with more to come, minus Match Play","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Nick Price and Rory McIlroy are footnotes in World Golf Championships history.Price hit the first shot when this series began in 1999, at La Costa in an opening match against Frankie Minoza of the Philippines. McIlroy hit the last one, a 6-foot par putt on the 17th hole at Austin Country Club to beat Scottie Scheffler.Too bad it was only for third place.That was the last of 2,022 matches over 24 years on six golf courses in two countries. Match Play started and ended the WGCs. In between were 57 others played on 13 courses.The eulogy requires an asterisk.The WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai has a contract through 2025. It was last played in 2019 because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the PGA Tour hasn't said what will happen. The China Golf Association ultimately decides if it gets played, though there is a clear sense the tour would love for this one to quietly go away.But is this really the end of the WGCs? Only in name, or initials.Cameron Young grew up around golf as the son of Sleepy Hollow's head pro, and while he's only 25, he still remembers Tiger Woods winning most of them. Fair enough, since Woods won 18 of the 47 times he played in WGCs.“Not quite the majors, but they were their own thing that was really cool,” Young said after losing the championship match to Sam Burns. ""They kind of filled a unique space. It's been really fun the last two years coming to play this one — unfortunately, the only one left. It's a different experience. You get the best 64 players in the world in one place.“You just know every year this is who you’re going to get and it’s just fun testing yourself against that group of guys.”Gone is the WGC that originally alternated between the U.S. and Europe, then replaced the regular PGA Tour event at Doral in 2007, went to Mexico in 2016 and made a final stop in Florida in 2021. Gone is the WGC at Firestone, which in 2018 took over a regular tournament in Memphis, Tennessee, and then quietly went away when Memphis became a FedEx Cup playoff.And now the Match Play is gone, at least as a WGC. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said earlier this month it “didn't work” in next year's schedule.That's because the 2024 schedule is loaded with WGCs. It's just that now they will be known as “DEs,” which stands for “designated events.” It's an acronym that mostly gets used at the GH (that's an acronym for “global home” the tour uses to describe its headquarters).Think about it. These $20 million tournaments will have limited fields with no cuts for the best players in the world, along with room for a few other players who have earned their way into the field.The difference is that those other players will all be PGA Tour members.To Young's point, in every tournament, you know who you're going to get. They will all be very good. They will fill a unique space. They will be fun to play. And everyone gets rich.Missing, of course, is the avenue for players around the world. Most of them have an ambition of joining the PGA Tour, anyway. But there was a charm about the WGCs in having players from every corner of the globe having a chance to shine on a big stage.One year at Doral, officials were trying to get a rising star in the same group as Woods. They settled on a young South African — Louis Oosthuizen, who two years later had that name engraved on the claret jug at St. Andrews.Shubhankar Sharma of India got into the WGC in Mexico City in 2018 at age 21. He held the 54-hole lead until fading on Sunday. Far more memorable was when Sharma saw Phil Mickelson on the practice green at Chapultepec before the third round and went to introduce himself. Mickelson thought he was media and said: “Not right now. After the round.”Otherwise, the concept hasn't changed. The WGCs started with three, then expanded to four in 2009 with Shanghai. And now think of them as eight.But there needs to be room for match play, even without an acronym.The designated events are successful in their own right or they wouldn't be under consideration to get elevated. That doesn't mean the tour can't find a spot for match play — if not an existing tournament, then a new one.McIlroy is on the PGA Tour board and is one of the strongest voices among players, so his words from Sunday were worth noting.“It's not on the schedule for 2024, but that’s not to say that it won’t be on the schedule for 2025,” McIlroy said. “I think if you look at player sentiment, if you look at public opinion, I think it will be a real shame not to have a match play event on the schedule, no matter what it is or where it is.”The “where” and the “what” do matter.The fact that Sunday's finale was dud — Burns beat Young on the 13th hole — was a reminder that match play is tough on television and typically lacks drama at the end.

Sampling hasn't detected any substance from the spill, and ""models tracking the flow and tide of the Delaware River show the potential threat is passing us,” he said.Health officials in Bucks County, just north of Philadelphia, said Sunday that between 8,100 and 12,000 gallons (30,700 and 120,000 liters) of a water-based latex-finishing solution spilled into the river late Friday because of a burst pipe at the Trinseo Altuglas chemical facility in Bristol Township.Officials said it is nontoxic to humans, and no known adverse health effects have been reported in the county.Philadelphia officials said tests of hundreds of samples from a number of locations had turned up no trace of contaminants related to the discharge. The final all-clear came after days of announcements that water could be guaranteed uncontaminated at least through Monday, then into Tuesday afternoon and finally through Wednesday.“Throughout the whole event, no contaminants were ever found in Philadelphia's drinking water,” said Michael Carroll, deputy managing director for the city’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. He punctuated his words by drinking a glass of water at the podium, as did the mayor at the end of the news conference.Carroll said the all-clear comes after Coast Guard tests of water from the river continued to show no contamination and water brought into the city system from the river for about four hours early Tuesday was contaminant-free.“So we know we have enough water on-hand now to last us for about 48 hours ... and when we open the gates again we know that that water is going to be in that window where there's no contamination in the river,” he said. Elevated tests, however, will continue until environmental officials say it is all right to ease off, he said.Intakes allowing water from the river into the Baxter Water Treatment Plant in northeast Philadelphia about 13 miles (21 kilometers) south of the spill were initially closed. But they were later opened periodically to maintain minimal water levels to avoid damage to equipment and to supply water for fire safety and other essential needs, officials said.Carroll had said Monday night that the city had materials available to treat contaminated water should any enter the system and out of an abundance of caution were also developing plans to distribute water if needed, providing “timely information on a block-by-block basis.”The city's health commissioner, Cheryl Bettigole, said any contamination, if it were to occur, would be at a “very, very low level” after the chemicals had come through the river and through treatment, making any health risks “extremely unlikely,” although officials would want to inform people so they could elect to take precautions.Announcements and an alert sent out Sunday were followed by a run on bottled water in Philadelphia stores that left many bare shelves and “No water” signs posted at some. If bottled water was unavailable, officials said, people could fill empty bottles with tap water.Asher Rosinger, a Penn State University researcher who studies water access, said big, headline-grabbing events casting doubt on water safety could increase distrust in tap water among city residents, something that has already worsened across the nation after the Flint water crisis.Already, 20% of adults nationally say they don’t drink tap water — filtered or not — up from 14% before the Flint crisis, according to a study of federal survey data. The figures are higher among Black adults, with 35% saying they avoid drinking tap, up from 25% before Flint. Among Hispanic adults, the figure rose to 38%, up from 27%.Philadelphia is one of the few major cities that has actively tried to increase trust, running campaigns promoting the cost and safety of its tap water, but distrust is a lingering issue. Among Black residents in 2021, more than 60% said they mostly drank bottled water, compared to 42% of Philadelphia residents overall.“Philly has done a lot to try to increase tap water use and confidence in the tap,” Rosinger said in an email. “This type of spill will set that effort back.”Trinseo said that following an internal review of operations at the plant, which makes acrylic resins and employs about 110 people, the company “expects to resume partial production within the next several days and to resume full production shortly thereafter.”The Delaware Riverkeeper Network said the level of information released to the public has been “incredibly deficient and undermines public trust.” The environmental advocacy group has asked authorities to provide more details on testing and the materials released and for the public to be told where they can report any damage they see to the river.—-Michael Phillis reported from St. Louis.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849623,AP sources: Two groups formally submit bids for Commanders,"PHOENIX (AP) — Dan Snyder's departure from the NFL is moving closer to reality.A group led by Josh Harris and Mitchell Rales and another group led by Canadian billionaire Steve Apostolopoulos have formally submitted fully financed bids for the NFL’s Washington Commanders, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.Two people confirmed the bid from Harris. Both spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because details of the bid have not been publicly announced.The Harris/Rales group includes basketball Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta also has been in the running.ESPN reported both bids came in at Snyder’s $6 billion asking price. Snyder had yet to accept an offer when the league's finance committee met Monday so his future wasn't openly discussed.“The information is very little to none in terms of the 31 of us (owners), and probably even the league office right now,” Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said.That quickly changed in less than 24 hours.Harris, who owns the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils, brought on Rales, a billionaire who also grew up in Maryland, just outside Washington, earlier this year. Johnson, who has ownership experience with Major League Baseball’s Los Angeles Dodgers and others, later joined the group.Apostolopoulos is a Toronto native who went to Harvard and is the founder of a private equity venture company.Three-quarters of the owners would need to approve the sale. A vote could take place at the league meetings in May in Minnesota if Snyder accepts an offer soon, though it's more likely the process will take longer to finalize with both groups involving several owners.Last fall, with multiple investigations ongoing into the team’s workplace culture and finances, Snyder and his wife Tanya hired a firm to explore selling part or all of the team. That decision came two weeks after Irsay said there was “merit to remove” Snyder, which would take an unprecedented vote of 24 of the other 31 owners.Selling the team would avoid going down that road, though Snyder has angered some of his colleagues by demanding that owners and the league indemnify him against future legal liability and costs if he sells the team, a person told the AP.“There would be no reason for us to give any sort of unusual indemnification,” Irsay said.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Snyder’s situation has changed their relationship.“I think that it’s a little more formal, but I think it’s that way because of the various issues that are involved here,” Jones said. “It’s not ‘lovey-dovey,’ but it’s not really strained in any way.”Snyder and the team are still under investigation by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, who was retained by the league to look into various aspects of the organization stemming from a congressional review into workplace misconduct that also included a referral to the Federal Trade Commission for potential business improprieties.A spokesperson declined to comment when asked if Snyder had refused to speak with White, saying it’s a confidential matter between the club and the league.The sale allows Snyder to avoid speaking to White, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell previously said the findings of White's report will be made public at the conclusion of her investigation. One person said the report will still be released even if Snyder sells the Commanders.In a statement responding to news of bids being submitted for the Commanders, lawyers for more than 40 former team employees said their clients want an assurance from the league that the report will be released.Attorneys Lisa Banks and Debra Katz said, “Allowing him to sell the team at what will certainly be a large premium without full accountability for his misconduct would be a travesty of justice.”Dozens of former employees detailing incidents of sexual harassment from their time with Washington beginning in the summer of 2020 prompted the first league investigation by Beth Wilkinson, which led to a $10 million fine and Snyder stepping away from day-to-day operations for a period of time. A lack of a written report sparked the investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which found Snyder played a role in the organization's toxic workplace culture.___Whyno reported from Washington.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849629,Armenia: Growing fears of another war with Azerbaijan,"Gohar has put on a camouflage jacket especially for this training session. It's Friday evening, nearly 8 p.m., in a gym situated on the outskirts of the Armenian capital Yerevan. The place has seen better days.The 27-year-old woman has already completed several rounds of push-ups and squats. A lesson in weaponry is up next.""The situation in our country is so unstable that every Armenian man and woman should know how to handle a firearm,"" she says, ""in case something goes wrong.""Gohar is referring to the fragile ceasefire between Armenia and its neighboring country Azerbaijan. The most recent war, in autumn 2020, lasted six weeks and claimed over 7,000 lives. Six times a week, Gohar partakes in the three-hour paramilitary training lined up by the nongovernmental organization VoMA. She also works as a dentist and is the mother of a one-year-old son.""It's important that all of us, including civilians, are prepared,"" she says.Others share this, as well: Twenty-five participants have shown up for this evening's training session. More than half of them are women. In one corner of the gymnasium, participants simulate mountain climbing, in another, they practice administering first aid to wounded soldiers. Kalashnikov mockups can be seen next to a first-aid box.By its own account, VoMA has already trained between 5,000 and 6,000 volunteers — financed by donations, particularly from Armenians living abroad. Apparently, the demand for paramilitary training has seen a sharp increase since the last war.The conflict between the two former Soviet republics Armenia and Azerbaijan has been ongoing for decades. At its core is the contested Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is mostly populated by Armenians.After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the independent Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh was proclaimed, but it never achieved international recognition. Briefly afterwards, in 1992, a war broke out between Armenia, which had superior forces, and Azerbaijan. It lasted until 1994, claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides, and caused flight and displacement on a massive scale.Subsequently, Armenia occupied the area, despite it being part of Azerbaijan by international law. During the second war over Nagorno-Karabakh in 2020, Azerbaijan gained control over large parts of the region. Human rights organization Amnesty International accuses both sides of having committed war crimes.Officially, the war ended on November 10, 2020, with a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia. The agreement, however, is rather fragile, as a visit to the Armenian village of Sotk, situated a mere five kilometers (3.1 miles) from the Azeri border, reveals.In September 2022, the village was shelled by Azerbaijani forces. Mayor Sevak Khachatryan points to a house that was hit by a grenade.""This used to be the home of a family of seven,"" he says, adding that the attack was launched at night. Now, only remnants of the walls are left, the windows are smashed, broken crockery is lying on the floor, next to a single spoon and an old frying pan. ""It's almost a miracle that nobody was hurt,"" says Khachatryan. ""All occupants managed to escape to safety just before the attack.""However, a young woman was wounded in the house next door. ""She'd come from abroad to visit her mother,"" the mayor explains. In the living room, otherwise completely destroyed, a television appliance evokes happier times.Last September, other villages situated along the border saw attacks as well, with both sides exchanging blame. The Russian peace troops deployed to monitor compliance with the 2020 ceasefire agreement were either unable or unwilling to halt the escalation.Many Armenians feel let down by Russia as their former protector. ""The war in Ukraine affects us Armenians, as well. It has produced a vacuum of power in the southern Caucasus,"" says Tigran Grigoryan, president of the Yerevan-based Regional Centre for Democracy and Security think tank. Now, whenever Azerbaijan breached agreements, Moscow no longer intervened as it would have before, Grigoryan added.In July last year, much to Russia's irritation, Armenia and Azerbaijan approved an EU monitoring mission. Some 100 police officers from various EU countries were assigned to patrol Armenia's border villages and document potential incidents. ""We cannot interfere, we only have binoculars and cameras at our disposal,"" says Markus Ritter, head of the EU mission.Many Armenians are glad about the EU presence, Ritter says. But he is quick to dampen expectations: Observers are not permitted access to Azerbaijani territory. Ritter and his colleagues are therefore unable to detect, for instance, troop movements in preparation of another attack.""Many Armenians believe there'll be a spring offensive by Azerbaijan. If this doesn't happen, our mission is already a success,"" Ritter says.Over the past days, there have been renewed incidents of violence reported. Armenia has accused Azerbaijani troops of killing a serviceman. One week prior, Armenia allegedly shelled Azerbaijani positions.Reports like these motivate Gohar to continue taking part in paramilitary exercises in Yerevan. She has already completed the first half of the three-month training course.""There are two possible scenarios,"" she says. ""The optimistic one is that we will manage to sit down at the table and settle our dispute. The pessimistic one is: We will fight until one of our nations is dead.""Research for this article was supported by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849641,Boy Scouts' $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan upheld by judge,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A $2.4 billion bankruptcy plan for the Boy Scouts of America has been upheld by a federal judge, clearing an important hurdle in the legal challenge by certain insurance companies and dissenting sex abuse survivors.The plan would let the Texas-based organization keep operating while it compensates tens of thousands of men who say they were sexually abused as children while involved in Scouting.The ruling released Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Delaware rejected arguments that the bankruptcy plan wasn't proposed in good faith and improperly strips insurers and survivors of their rights.More than 80,000 men have filed claims saying they were abused as children by troop leaders around the country. Plan opponents say the staggering number of claims, when combined with other factors, suggest the bankruptcy process was manipulated.Judge Richard Andrews said he found no fault with the plan's initial approval by a federal bankruptcy judge in September, although he agreed with the previous judge that it was “an extraordinary case by any measure.”“The appellants have failed to put forth evidence that would demonstrate clear error in the bankruptcy court’s careful findings of facts,” the judge wrote.A spokesperson for lawyers representing several non-settling insurance companies had no immediate comment, but attorneys have previously suggested the case could eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.The Boy Scouts issued a statement describing the ruling as “a pivotal milestone” that “solidifies a path forward for both survivors and Scouting.”“We look forward to the organization’s exit from bankruptcy in the near future and firmly believe that the mission of Scouting will be preserved for future generations,” the statement said.Under the plan — which the Boy Scouts describe as a “carefully calibrated compromise” — the organization itself would contribute less than 10% of the proposed settlement fund. The local Boy Scout councils, which run day-to-day operations for troops, offered to contribute at least $515 million in cash and property, conditioned on certain protections for local troop sponsoring organizations, including religious entities, civic associations and community groups.The bulk of the compensation fund would come from the Boy Scouts' two largest insurers, Century Indemnity and The Hartford, which reached settlements calling for them to contribute $800 million and $787 million, respectively. Other insurers agreed to contribute about $69 million.The Boy Scouts' largest insurers negotiated settlements for a fraction of the billions of dollars in potential liability exposure they faced.Other insurers, many of which provided excess coverage above the liability limits of the underlying primary policies, refused to settle. They argued that the procedures for distributing funds from a proposed compensation trust would violate their contractual rights to contest claims, set a dangerous precedent for mass tort litigation, and result in grossly inflated payments.They also noted that a plaintiffs’ attorney had acknowledged that some 58,000 claims probably couldn't be pursued in civil lawsuits because of the passage of time.When it sought bankruptcy protection in February 2020, the Boy Scouts had been named in about 275 lawsuits and told insurers it was aware of another 1,400 claims. According to plan opponents, the huge number of claims filed in the bankruptcy was the result of a nationwide marketing effort by personal injury lawyers working with for-profit claims aggregators to drum up clients.Insurers opposing the plan contend that Boy Scouts of America is contractually obligated to assist them in investigating, defending and settling claims, as it did before the bankruptcy. They say the organization, desperate to escape bankruptcy, colluded with claimants’ lawyers to inflate both the volume and value of claims in order to pressure insurers for large settlements, then transferred its insurance rights to the settlement trust. The insurers argue that if the Boy Scouts transfers its rights under insurance policies to the settlement trustee, it must also transfer its obligations under those policies.Under the Boy Scouts' plan, insurance companies, local Scout councils and troop sponsoring organizations would receive broad liability releases protecting them from future sex abuse lawsuits in exchange for contributing to the victims’ compensation fund – or even for just not objecting to the plan.Some abuse survivors argued that releasing their claims against non-debtor third parties without their consent would violate their due process rights. The U.S. bankruptcy trustee, the government’s “watchdog” in Chapter 11 bankruptcies, argued that such releases are not allowed under the bankruptcy code, and that the scope of the proposed releases in the Boy Scout plan was unprecedented because it potentially extends to tens of thousands of entities.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849643,Elephant in the dining room: Startup makes mammoth meatball,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Throw another mammoth on the barbie?An Australian company on Tuesday lifted the glass cloche on a meatball made of lab-grown cultured meat using the genetic sequence from the long-extinct pachyderm, saying it was meant to fire up public debate about the hi-tech treat.The launch in an Amsterdam science museum came just days before April 1 so there was an elephant in the room: Is this for real?“This is not an April Fools joke,"" said Tim Noakesmith, founder of Australian startup Vow. ""This is a real innovation.”Cultivated meat — also called cultured or cell-based meat — is made from animal cells. Livestock doesn’t need to be killed to produce it, which advocates say is better not just for the animals but also for the environment.Vow used publicly available genetic information from the mammoth, filled missing parts with genetic data from its closest living relative, the African elephant, and inserted it into a sheep cell, Noakesmith said. Given the right conditions in a lab, the cells multiplied until there were enough to roll up into the meatball.More than 100 companies around the world are working on cultivated meat products, many of them startups like Vow.Experts say that if the technology is widely adopted, it could vastly reduce the environmental impact of global meat production in the future. Currently, billions of acres of land are used for agriculture worldwide.But don't expect this to land on plates around the world any time soon. So far, tiny Singapore is the only country to have approved cell-based meat for consumption. Vow is hoping to sell its first product there — a cultivated Japanese quail meat — later this year.The mammoth meatball is a one-off and has not been tasted, even by its creators, nor is it planned to be put into commercial production. Instead, it was presented as a source of protein that would get people talking about the future of meat.“We wanted to get people excited about the future of food being different to potentially what we had before. That there are things that are unique and better than the meats that we’re necessarily eating now, and we thought the mammoth would be a conversation starter and get people excited about this new future,” Noakesmith told The Associated Press.“But also the woolly mammoth has been traditionally a symbol of loss. We know now that it died from climate change. And so what we wanted to do was see if we could create something that was a symbol of a more exciting future that’s not only better for us, but also better for the planet,” he added.Seren Kell, science and technology manager at Good Food Institute, a nonprofit that promotes plant- and cell-based alternatives to animal products, said he hopes the project “will open up new conversations about cultivated meat’s extraordinary potential to produce more sustainable foods, reduce the climate impact of our existing food system and free up land for less intensive farming practices.""He said the mammoth project with its unconventional gene source was an outlier in the new meat cultivation sector, which commonly focuses on traditional livestock — cattle, pigs and poultry.“By cultivating beef, pork, chicken, and seafood, we can have the most impact in terms of reducing emissions from conventional animal agriculture and satisfying growing global demand for meat while meeting our climate targets,” he said.The jumbo meatball on show in Amsterdam — sized somewhere between a softball and a volleyball — was for show only and had been glazed to ensure it didn’t get damaged on its journey from Sydney.But when it was being prepared — first slow baked and then finished off on the outside with a blow torch — it smelled good.“The folks who were there, they said the aroma was something similar to another prototype that we produced before, which was crocodile,"" Noakesmith said. ""So, super fascinating to think that adding the protein from an animal that went extinct 4,000 years ago gave it a totally unique and new aroma, something we haven’t smelled as a population for a very long time.”___Associated Press reporter Laura Ungar contributed from Louisville, Kentucky.",2023/03/29,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849645,Nats' Corbin's belief not dimmed by most losses in majors,"WASHINGTON (AP) — No major league pitcher took more losses in 2022 than Patrick Corbin, with 19. And none accumulated more Ls in 2021 than Corbin did, with 16. Last season’s ERA for the Washington Nationals left-hander was 6.31. A year earlier? 5.82.Hard not to notice those numbers. Hard not to comment on them. Corbin is all too aware.“Doesn’t really matter what other people are saying,” he said Tuesday in the home clubhouse at Nationals Park before Washington beat the New York Yankees 3-0 in an exhibition finale. “I just kind of believe in myself and what I’ve done.”That includes, most notably, a starring role as a starter and reliever as the Nationals won the 2019 World Series championship. If that seems as if it was forever ago, it’s probably because it is, in some ways, for a franchise that has finished last in the NL East every year since and was 55-107 in 2022.When the Nationals host the Atlanta Braves on Thursday, there will be only two players on Washington’s 26-man roster who were around for the title four years ago: Corbin and center fielder Victor Robles.On the mound will be Corbin, a 33-year-old in the fifth season of a six-year, $140 million contract that was earned, at least in part, by being an NL All-Star with a 3.15 ERA for Arizona in 2018. It's his second consecutive opening day start for a rotation currently missing World Series MVP Stephen Strasburg and top prospect Cade Cavalli because of injuries.“Look, he’s a veteran guy. He’s done it before. Toward the end of spring, he really threw the ball really well. He really did,” manager Dave Martinez said about Corbin. “We had a lot of conversations about putting everything that’s happened behind him. In the past. Let’s move forward. Let’s start fresh.""One thing that never changed about Corbin was an ability to be ready for every start. He made 32 in 2017, 33 apiece in 2018 and 2019, 31 apiece in 2021 and 2022.Those numbers are appreciated by any manager, even if the other numbers associated with Corbin lately were not ideal.“He is not a very demonstrative type of person, but it bothered him. He would be the first one to tell you that he didn’t perform up to his expectations,” pitching coach Jim Hickey said. “But he never pointed fingers or made excuses. And give him credit: He took the ball every five days and he never, ever backed down. He never wanted out of a ballgame. Hopefully things go a little bit better for him this year — and I think they will.”Corbin’s success was based on a top-notch slider paired with his fastball. He worked this spring on improving both of those pitches — adding more shape to his slider, keeping his fastball down — and mixing in a changeup more frequently.“When things are going well, sometimes you feel you can do nothing wrong and you just go out there and pitch. And sometimes when things aren’t going well, you might feel good or sometimes not, but you’re always kind of searching or trying to find a way to turn it around. Maybe that was the case,” he said. “We’ve cleaned up some things. Sometimes you just have to simplify it, get back to what you’re good at, get back to what you’ve had success at. For me, that’s my slider.”MAKING DECISIONSYankees LHP Nestor Cortes, who allowed one unearned run in four innings Tuesday in his third exhibition start, is on track to begin the season in the rotation. ...

However, he would have to testify about any potential illegal acts committed by the former president, the person said.Pence and his attorneys had cited constitutional grounds in challenging a grand jury subpoena issued weeks ago. They argued that, because he was serving in his capacity as president of the Senate that day, he was protected from being forced to testify under the Constitution's “speech or debate” clause, which is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts.Trump’s lawyers had also objected to Pence complying, citing executive privilege.A Trump spokesman criticized the decision in a statement, accusing the Justice Department of “continuously stepping far outside the standard norms in attempting to destroy the long accepted, long held, constitutionally based standards of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”“There is no factual or legal basis or substance to any case against President Trump,"" they added, but did not respond to questions about how Trump's legal team might respond.Pence said Tuesday evening that his team was evaluating the judge's ruling and would make a decision whether to appeal in the coming days.“I’m pleased that the court accepted our argument and recognized that the Constitution’s provision about speech and debate does apply to the vice president,” Pence said during an appearance on Newsmax. “But how they sorted that out and what other testimony might be required, we're currently reviewing.”The sealed ruling from U.S. District Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg sets up the unprecedented scenario of a former vice president being compelled to give potentially damaging testimony against the president he once served. And it comes as Pence has been inching closer to announcing a run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination — a decision that would put him in direct competition with his former boss.In addition to the Justice Department probes, Trump is under investigation in Georgia and in New York, where a grand jury has been hearing testimony about hush money paid to women on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 campaign. That grand jury will not take up the inquiry again this week, two people familiar with the matter said Tuesday, meaning any potential vote on a possible indictment will not happen until next week at the earliest.In Washington, Pence was subpoenaed earlier this year to appear before the federal grand jury investigating election interference. In public appearances, he has cast that action as unconstitutional and unprecedented and has said he would pursue the matter as far as the Supreme Court.Still, he told ABC’s “This Week” that he might be open to testifying about matters not directly related to his congressional role.“I’ve actually never asserted that other matters unrelated to January 6 would otherwise be protected by speech and debate,"" he told the network. “We’re gonna make that case, but I promise you we’ll respect the decisions of the court.""A Justice Department special counsel, Jack Smith, is investigating attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election to keep Trump in the White House. Multiple Trump aides have already appeared before the federal grand jury, as well as before a separate panel examining allegations of Trump mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment. A lawyer for Pence did not return messages seeking comment.Pence has spoken extensively about Trump’s pressure campaign urging him to reject Biden’s victory in the days leading up to Jan. 6, including in his book, “So Help Me God.” Pence, as vice president, had a ceremonial role overseeing the counting of the Electoral College vote, but did not have the power to impact the results despite Trump's contention otherwise.Pence has said that Trump endangered his family and everyone else who was at the Capitol that day and history will hold him ""accountable.”___Colvin reported from New York.",2023/03/29,,World

Jessica Whaley, and Army Maj. Amanda Feindt filed pre-litigation claim forms with the Navy late Monday, which will allow them to later file a federal lawsuit in Honolulu, their attorneys said.In 2021, jet fuel spilled from a drain line at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, flowed into a drinking water well and then into the Navy’s water system serving 93,000 people in and around Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. Nearly 6,000 sought medical attention, complaining of ailments such as nausea, headaches and sores. The military put about 4,000 families in hotels for several months.The Hawaii Department of Health ordered the Navy to shutter the facility after the spill, which also contaminated the ground beneath the tanks and threatened the health of an aquifer that provides water to 400,000 people in Honolulu.A separate lawsuit was filed on behalf of more than 100 civilians. Their attorneys say they expect to add thousands of others to the lawsuit.A doctrine typically bars service members from making claims while in the line of duty. But in the claims, their attorneys said their injuries at home, ""during non-duty hours, were not ‘incident to service,’ and the United States is liable for them.”The Navy doesn't comment on ongoing litigation, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849649,AP source: Guardians nearing deal with All-Star 2B Giménez,"CLEVELAND (AP) — The Cleveland Guardians are close to signing All-Star second baseman Andrés Giménez to a long-term contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday.Giménez, who batted .297 and won a Gold Glove for the AL Central champions last season, could sign the deal within days, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team has not announced any agreement.The Guardians also are nearing a deal with reliever Trevor Stephan, the person said.ESPN reported that Giménez has agreed to a seven-year, $106.5 million package that includes a club option for an eighth year.A year ago, Cleveland announced All-Star third baseman José Ramírez's seven-year, $141 million new contract on the eve of opening day. Now, they're on the verge of locking up Giménez as they embark on 2023.The 24-year-old Giménez has quickly developed into one of the league’s best all-around middle infielders. He hit 17 homers, drove in 69 runs and stole 20 bases last season and was one of four Gold Glove winners for Cleveland.Giménez came to the Guardians in 2021 as part of the trade that sent shortstop Francisco Lindor to the New York Mets. He arrived along with shortstop Amed Rosario, and the two have allowed the Guardians to remain among the league's top teams despite parting with another All-Star player.Cleveland also has discussed extensions with Rosario and outfielder Steven Kwan, who was one of baseball's top rookies in 2022.Stephan was an invaluable piece of Cleveland’s strong bullpen last season. The right-hander went 6-5 with a 2.69 ERA and three saves in 66 games.The Guardians are leaving their spring training complex Tuesday for Seattle, where they'll open the season on Friday against the Mariners.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849650,Elena Rybakina hits 10 aces in Miami for 12th straight win,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Reigning Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina extended her winning streak to 12 matches by delivering 10 aces — her fourth consecutive outing with at least that many — in a 6-3, 6-0 victory over 25th-seeded Martina Trevisan on Tuesday in the Miami Open quarterfinals.Rybakina has 46 aces through four matches at the hard-court tournament in Florida and a WTA-leading 201 this season.The 23-year-old, who represents Kazakhstan, improved to 20-4 in 2023, including a run to the Australian Open final in January and a title at Indian Wells, California, last week.She is trying to become only the fifth player to win the women's trophies at Indian Wells and Miami in the same season. Top-ranked Iga Swiatek did it a year ago; she withdrew from Miami this time because of a rib injury.“Of course it would be amazing to achieve something like that,” the 10th-seeded Rybakina said about the prospect of completing what's known as the Sunshine Double, “but it’s still far away.”So far in Rybakina's career, 13 of her 18 semifinal appearances have come on hard courts. She will face No. 3 Jessica Pegula for a berth in the final after the American fought off two match points and outlasted No. 27 Anastasia Potapova 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2) in a match that ended just before 1:30 a.m. after play had been delayed by rain.“I haven’t been that physically tired in just a really long time,"" Pegula said. ""Just the humidity was taking so much out of me, and I haven’t been able to play in humidity like that in a while. It was just really tough, so really, it was just pure will.”Trevisan reached the French Open semifinals in 2022.In fourth-round men's action Tuesday, No. 2 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was beaten 7-6 (4), 6-4 by No. 14 Karen Khachanov, while defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz and Jannik Sinner all beat seeded opponents in straight sets.Alcaraz, who returned to No. 1 in the ATP rankings last week, got past Australian Open semifinalist Tommy Paul 6-4, 6-4 to set up a meeting against Fritz, the top-ranked American man and seeded ninth in Miami.Fritz compiled twice as many winners, 22, as unforced errors, 11, and only dropped serve once during a 6-3, 6-4 victory over No. 7 Holger Rune. That put Fritz into his first quarterfinal in seven appearances in Miami — and his first matchup against Alcaraz, a 19-year-old from Spain who won the U.S. Open in September for his first Grand Slam title.“I’m really excited for it,” Fritz said. “I think that a lot of people are really excited for that, too.”No. 10 Sinner eliminated No. 6 Andrey Rublev 6-2, 6-4 and has yet to drop a set in the tournament.Sinner's next opponent will be unseeded Emil Ruusuvuori, a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 winner against No. 26 Botic van de Zandschulp.No. 4 Daniil Medvedev, forced to start late and off his scheduled court after the rain, beat Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2. He will face American Christopher Eubanks, who edged Adrian Mannarino in a pair of tiebreakers.Khachanov will play Francisco Cerundolo, a semifinalist in Miami last year, in the other men's quarterfinal.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849651,Visitors flock to see David sculpture after Florida uproar,"FLORENCE, Italy (AP) — Visitors flocked to see Michelangelo’s David sculpture in Florence on Tuesday, following an uproar over a Florida school’s decision to force the resignation of the principal over complaints about a lesson featuring the Renaissance masterpiece.Tourists, many of them Americans on spring break or studying abroad, posed for selfies in front of the giant marble statue, which features the Biblical David, naked with a sling over his shoulder and a rock in his hand, ready for battle with Goliath.Florence’s Galleria dell’Accademia, which houses the sculpture, reopened Tuesday after its weekly Monday closure, and both tourists and locals alike couldn’t get over the controversy.“It’s part of history,” said Isabele Joles from Ohio, who is studying French and Italian art with her school group. “I don’t understand how you can say it’s porn.”She and other visitors were reacting to the decision by Tallahassee Classical School board to pressure Principal Hope Carrasquilla to resign last week after an image of the David was shown to a sixth-grade art class.Carrasquilla believes the board targeted her after three parents complained because they weren’t notified in advance that a nude image would be shown, while a third called the iconic statue, which is considered the height of Renaissance sculpture, pornographic. The school has a policy requiring parents to be notified in advance about “controversial” topics being taught.Over the weekend, both Florence’s mayor and the museum director voiced incredulity over the ruckus and issued invitations for the ousted principal and the school community to come and see the sculpture for themselves.“We are talking about the roots of Western culture, and ‘David’ is the height, the height of beauty,” museum director Cecilie Hollberg said in an interview Tuesday, as tourists brushed past her snapping selfies with the statue.The controversy wasn't only a topic of conversation in Florence. On Monday night in Tallahassee, a large crowd showed up for a school board meeting with public comment on the issue of the David statue controversy lasting over an hour, the Tallahassee Democrat reported. Some parents and teachers criticized the board and even asked chairman Barney Bishop to step aside.“Given the dissatisfaction of all these parents with your leadership, would you be willing to lead us by integrity by resigning?” asked teacher Ben Steigner.Bishop refused, saying he intends to remain as chairman through the end of his term in May and then another year on the board, the newspaper reported. The five trustees are elected by themselves, not the parents, and serve three-year-terms. New Principal Cara Wynn told the school board that nine students had left the school since the David controversy began, but that three had enrolled.Tallahassee Classical is a charter school. While it is taxpayer-funded and tuition-free, it operates almost entirely independently of the local school district and is sought out by parents seeking an alternative to the public school curriculum. About 400 students from kindergarten through 12th grade attend the three-year-old institution, which is now on its third principal. It follows a curriculum designed by Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school in Michigan frequently consulted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on educational issues.The Florida Department of Education, however, has distanced itself from the controversy and the school’s decision.“The Statue of David has artistic and historical value. Florida encourages instruction on the classics and classical art, and would not prohibit its use in instruction,” the department said in a statement. “The matter at the Tallahassee Classical School is between the school and an employee, and is not the effect of state rule or law.”At the museum on Tuesday, tourist Brian Stapley from Seattle Washington said he was sad for the school’s children.“It’s one of the most incredible parts of our history,” he said as he waited on line to get into the museum. “I feel incredibly sorry for the children that don’t get to see it.” ___Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849652,Court backs victim's family in Adnan Syed's 'Serial' case,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — A Maryland appellate court on Tuesday reinstated Adnan Syed's murder conviction and ordered a new hearing in the case, marking the latest development in the protracted legal odyssey chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial.”Though Syed's conviction has been reinstated, he will not immediately be taken back into custody.In a 2-1 decision released Tuesday, the Appellate Court of Maryland ruled a lower court failed to give sufficient notice to the victim’s family when it scheduled the September hearing that vacated Syed’s conviction and allowed him to regain his freedom after more than two decades behind bars.The intermediate court's order does not go into effect for 60 days, which delays any immediate consequences and allows the parties time to decide whether to appeal and schedule upcoming proceedings accordingly.Syed’s attorney Erica Suter said they will ask the state supreme court to review the case.Maryland law provides victims with the right to prior notice of conviction vacatur hearings, and that right was violated in the case of Hae Min Lee's brother, the appellate court ruled. Syed was convicted in 2000 of killing Lee, his high school ex-girlfriend whose body was found in a makeshift grave after her disappearance in 1999.Baltimore prosecutors moved to vacate Syed's conviction in September after they reviewed the case and found alternative suspects and unreliable evidence used at trial. The lower court then quickly scheduled a hearing on the state's motion to vacate.Lee's brother, Young Lee, was notified on a Friday afternoon that the hearing would take place the following Monday. Giving him only one business day before the hearing was “insufficient time to reasonably allow Mr. Lee, who lived in California, to attend the hearing in person,” instead requiring him to attend remotely, the appellate court ruled.Young Lee attended the hearing via Zoom after the judge denied his request to postpone the proceedings one week to allow his in-person attendance.The Lee family spent decades believing justice had been served, only to be treated as an afterthought when prosecutors decided their case was actually flawed from the beginning, their attorneys have argued. The appellate court largely agreed.“Allowing a victim entitled to attend a court proceeding to attend in person, when the victim makes that request and all other persons involved in the hearing appear in person, is consistent with the constitutional requirement that victims be treated with dignity and respect,” the court ruled.The court also said the new hearing should be more transparent, requiring that “evidence supporting the motion to vacate is presented, and the court states its reasons in support of its decision.”David Sanford, an attorney representing Young Lee, said that piece of the ruling in particular has serious implications because it means there will be “evidence for the world to see and examine.”“We are delighted that the court agrees with Mr. Lee,” he said. “Decisions made by courts should not be based on secret evidence.”But Suter said “there is no basis for re-traumatizing Adnan by returning him to the status of a convicted felon.”“For the time being, Adnan remains a free man,"" Suter said.After Syed's conviction was vacated, Baltimore prosecutors had 30 days to decide whether to retry him. They announced their decision to drop the charges eight days before the deadline was up — while an appeal from the Lee family was pending.The appellate judges interrogated that timeline and concluded the state acted “with the purpose ... of preventing Mr. Lee from obtaining a ruling on the appeal,” which Syed's attorneys later argued was moot because there were no underlying charges.During oral arguments last month, the three-judge panel focused much of their questioning on whether the appeal should be considered moot.The judges also considered whether crime victims or their representatives have a “right to be heard” at conviction vacatur hearings, as the Lee family asserted in their appeal. The judges said they were not persuaded by that argument, ruling victims have no right to substantive participation in such hearings, which could include presenting evidence. They said a ruling to the contrary would “result in a huge shift in practice.”What happens next remains somewhat unclear.The Baltimore State's Attorney's Office is reviewing the ruling.Their position is further complicated by a recent change in leadership. The current state's attorney, Ivan Bates, took office in December — not long after his predecessor, Marilyn Mosby, decided to drop the charges against Syed, saying additional DNA testing had excluded him as a suspect. That was after her office conducted a yearlong review of the case and found prior prosecutors made significant missteps. Prosecutors knew about two alternative suspects but failed to disclose that information to the defense, Mosby's office wrote.Her decision to re-examine the case came after Syed's appeals were repeatedly denied. Even after the “Serial” podcast raised numerous questions about the evidence that resulted in Syed's conviction and garnered a massive following of supporters, Syed remained behind bars for several more years. In social media posts Tuesday, many of his supporters asked whether the appellate court decision would ultimately return Syed to prison.Mosby issued a statement saying that the “decision sets a dangerous precedent over a prosecutor’s ability to reverse an injustice.”“We notified the victim’s family in line with Maryland law and best practices, and they attended virtually and spoke,” she said. “To now send this case back to court prolongs the pain for the Lee family, and leaves a cloud hanging over a man who deserves to be free, Adnan Syed.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849653,"Apple rolls out buy now, pay later service: What to know","NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is getting into the buy now, pay later space with a few tweaks to the existing model — including no option to pay with a credit card. The company will roll out the product to some consumers this spring, and will begin reporting the loans to credit bureaus in the fall.Since the start of the pandemic, the option to “buy now, pay later” has skyrocketed in popularity, especially among young and low-income consumers who may not have ready access to traditional credit.If you shop online for clothes or furniture, sneakers or concert tickets, you’ve seen the option at checkout to break the cost into smaller installments over time. Companies like Afterpay, Affirm, Klarna, and Paypal already offer the service, typically with late fees for missed payments and the option to use a credit card or bank account to make installment payments.Apple's version, which is integrated with Apple Pay and facilitated by MasterCard, will require the consumer to use a debit card and a bank account to make those payments, the company said, and will not charge flat or percentage late fees. Instead, missed payments will eventually result in the consumer losing access to these kinds of loans.Here's what you need to know:HOW DOES BUY NOW, PAY LATER WORK?Branded as “interest-free loans,” buy now, pay later services require you to download an app, link a bank account or debit or credit card, and sign up to pay in weekly or monthly installments. Some companies, such as Klarna and Afterpay, do soft credit checks, which aren’t reported to credit bureaus, before approving borrowers. This is how Apple's product will operate as well. Most users are approved in minutes. Scheduled payments are then automatically deducted from one's bank account or charged to one's card.The services generally don’t charge more than a customer would have paid up front, meaning there’s technically no interest, so long as one makes the payments on time.But if a customer pays late, they may be subject to a flat fee or a fee calculated as a percentage of the total owed. These can run as high as $34 plus interest. If a customer misses multiple payments, they may be shut out from using the service in the future, and the delinquency could hurt one's credit score.In Apple's case, the company said there will be no late fees, either flat or as a percentage — only the possibility of missed payments reported to credit bureaus, and a loss of access to the loans. If a user wishes to defer payments, or set up a different payment plan, Apple said they can contact support. Several services allow users to defer payments in this way.ARE MY PURCHASES PROTECTED?In the U.S., buy now, pay later services are not currently covered by the Truth in Lending Act, which regulates credit cards and other types of loans (those paid back in more than four installments).That means you could find it more difficult to settle disputes with merchants, return items, or get your money back in cases of fraud. Companies can offer protections, but they don’t have to. Apple's protections are offered through Mastercard.Lauren Saunders, associate director at the National Consumer Law Center, advises borrowers to avoid linking a credit card to buy now, pay later apps whenever possible. If you do, you lose the protections you get from using the credit card while also opening yourself up to owing interest to the card company.“Use the credit card directly and get those protections,” she said. “Otherwise, it’s the worst of both worlds.”Apple's decision not to permit consumers to link a credit card to its buy now, pay later product means the consumer avoids stacking debt in this way.WHAT ARE THE OTHER RISKS?Because there’s no centralized reporting of buy now, pay later purchases, those debts won’t necessarily appear on your credit profile with major credit rating agencies.That means more companies may let you buy more items, even if you can’t afford them, because the lenders don’t know how many loans you have set up with other companies.Payments you make on time aren’t reported to credit rating agencies, but missed payments are.“Right now, buy now, pay later can’t generally help you build credit, but it can hurt,” said Saunders.Elyse Hicks, consumer policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, a progressive nonprofit, said people may not consider seriously enough whether they’ll still be able to afford payments down the road.“Because of inflation, people may think, ‘I’m going to have to get what I need and pay for it later in these installments,’” she said. “But are you still going to be able to afford the things you’re affording now six months from now?”WHY DO RETAILERS OFFER BUY NOW, PAY LATER?Retailers accept the backend fees of buy now, pay later services because the products increase cart sizes. When shoppers are given the option to pay off purchases in installments, they’re more likely to buy more goods in one go.When Apple announced it would be creating its own buy now, pay later service, Josiah Herndon, 23, joked on Twitter about “paying off 6 carts of (things) I can’t afford with Apple, Klarna, Afterpay, PayPal Pay in 4, Shop Pay in 4, & Affirm.”Herndon, who works in insurance in Indianapolis, said he started using the services because it was taking a long time for him to be approved for a credit card, since his age meant he didn’t have an extensive credit history. He’s since used them to pay for high-end clothes, shoes, and other luxury goods. Herndon said he lines the payment schedules up with his paychecks so he doesn’t miss installments, and called the option “very convenient.”WHO SHOULD USE BUY NOW, PAY LATER?If you have the ability to make all payments on time, buy now, pay later loans are a relatively healthy, interest-free form of consumer credit.“If (the loans) work as promised, and if people can avoid late fees and don’t have trouble managing their finances, they have a place,” said Saunders, of the National Consumer Law Center.But if you’re looking to build your credit score, and you’re able to make payments on time, a credit card is a better choice, she said. The same goes if you want strong legal protections from fraud, and clear, centralized reporting of loans.If you’re uncertain whether you’ll be able to make payments on time, consider whether the fees charged by buy now, pay later companies will exceed the penalties and interest a credit card company or other lender would charge.HOW WILL ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AFFECT BUY NOW, PAY LATER?As the cost of living increases, some shoppers have started breaking up payments on essentials, rather than just big-ticket items like electronics or designer clothes. A poll by Morning Consult last fall found 15% of buy now, pay later customers were using the service for routine purchases, such as groceries and gas, sounding alarm bells among financial advisors.Hicks points to the rising number of delinquent payments as a sign that buy now, pay later could already be contributing to unmanageable debt for consumers. A July report from the Fitch ratings agency found delinquencies on the apps increased sharply in the 12 months that ended March 31 of last year, to as high as 4.1% for Afterpay, while credit card delinquencies held relatively steady at 1.4%.“The increasing popularity of this is going to be interesting to see over these different economic waves,” Hicks said. “The immediate fallout is what’s happening now.”___Follow all of AP’s financial wellness coverage at: https://apnews.com/hub/financial-wellness___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849656,NCAA takes seat on bench in the political game,"The NCAA has taken a seat on the bench in the political game.The organization that governs college athletics was once at the forefront of hot-button issues such as the Confederate flag and transgender rights.But that stance evolved quickly as one Republican-controlled state after another rushed to pass laws that supporters hail as a war on “wokeness,” even as critics deride them as exclusionary and a step backward in human decency.The NCAA's new approach came into sharper focus during March Madness as Texas — which has largely banned abortion and was debating a host of proposals that would limit gay and transgender rights — prepares to host both the men's and women's Final Four this weekend.Nary a word has been spoken about moving these events out of Houston and Dallas.“It's just an extraordinary time, which requires extraordinary courage, an uncommon courage,” said Ricardo Martinez, the CEO of Equality Texas. “I'm disappointed that the NCAA is not being as vocal as they once were”Clearly, the member-led organization now sees little benefit from getting involved in a culture war that has divided the nation into two distinctly different camps, with little room for compromise.“It's so important to think of who composes the NCAA — specifically, the Division I institutions, which are predominantly public institutions,” said Teresa Valerio Parrot, whose firm, TVP Communications, focuses on clients in higher education. ""When they vote with the NCAA on where to hold events, they may be seen as passing judgment on their own home state.”There was a time when the NCAA was more than willing to pass judgment.More than two decades ago, the organization approved a ban on staging championship events in states that prominently displayed the Confederate flag, a policy that impacted Mississippi (where the state flag incorporated the Civil War banner), as well as Alabama and South Carolina (which flew the flag at their state capitols).That ban is now moot since Alabama and South Carolina took down their flags, while Mississippi changed its official state banner in 2020 to remove the Confederate battle emblem.In 2016, the NCAA also imposed a championship ban on North Carolina after that state passed a so-called “bathroom bill,” a law that restricted which public restroom transgender people could use and limited protections for LGBTQ people in the state.The NBA imposed its own sanctions, moving the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans.After the law was repealed and replaced with a compromise bill, the NCAA rescinded its ban — with some reluctance — while the NBA returned to Charlotte with an All-Star weekend a couple of years later.As recently as two years ago, Major League Baseball yanked its All-Star Game out of Atlanta after the Georgia Legislature passed a voting law that opponents claimed was an attempt to limit participation by people of color.Since then, numerous states have approved or are considering bills that address a wide range of disputed issues, from voting restrictions to abortion access to gun laws to LBGTQ rights to transgender athletes to drag shows.Any thoughts of the NCAA — or any professional sports league, for that matter — taking a significant stand in these debates has been largely overwhelmed by the sheer volume of legislation.“The NCAA has to be wise in its use of its position and its communications,” said Greg Sankey, commissioner of the powerful Southeastern Conference. “You also have to understand states are going to make their decisions, then we’re going to have to follow those decisions.”The NCAA did not respond to requests for an interview, but did issue a brief statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday evening.“The NCAA and its member schools are committed to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion,” it said. “Each host site is expected to provide an environment that is safe, healthy and free from discrimination.”Martinez, whose group works to protect LBGTQ rights in Texas, said 140 bills targeting that community have been filed in the current legislative session — a nearly five-fold increase over just two years ago.He said the NCAA has squandered a chance to stand with marginalized groups in Texas during both Final Fours, even without the steep logistical challenges of moving those events to other cities.“Silence is as big a message as any,” Martinez said. “Had they approached this with more attention with the local organizers, they could have figured out ways to contribute to fostering and creating a safe space.”Instead, he said, “I haven’t heard anything. They haven’t contacted me, and we are the largest statewide organization.""Former Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker took over this month as the NCAA's sixth full-time president — and the first to come from the world of politics rather than higher education.He set a tone for compromise when asked during an interview with The Associated Press about the NCAA's stance on transgender athletes, who've been at the center of a heated debate since Lia Thomas, who had transitioned from male to female while at Ivy League Penn, won a national title in women's swimming last year.“I think our championships need to reflect the fact that we’re in all 50 states, but the people who actually host those championships need to make sure that every kid who participates in them gets the kind of positive experience out of it that they should get,” Baker told the AP.Sankey senses that someone such as Baker assuming the role as president “is probably a good opportunity for the NCAA to evaluate how it uses its leadership position in an effective way while also making sure it focuses on its core function, which is supporting high-level competition and educating young people.”Jon Steinbrecher, who has been commissioner of the Mid-American Conference since 2009, noted how difficult it is to match political sentiments with expanding and ever-changing conference alignments,“I’ve got a league of 12 public institutions from five different states and they’ve got different viewpoints across the board and different majorities across those states,"" he said. “You have to pick your battles. If you want to stand up for something, then make sure it’s a broad enough issue that it’s worth the fight.”Good luck finding an issue that has broad support across political and cultural lines in today's divided America.Besides, the NCAA finds itself largely consumed with issues such as Name, Image and Likeness and the transfer portal, which have quickly revolutionized the way the college game is played.Adding to the complexity of NIL are states considering their own laws governing the benefits an athlete can receive through endorsement deals or even outright payments.""With name, image and likeness, which isn’t a moral issue, but this state does this and that state does that, which makes it a challenge,” Steinbrecher said.Parrot is wondering whether college athletes will be willing to take their newfound clout into the political arena.“If they're saying that student athletes have the right to choose where they go to school, how they earn NIL money, how they use the transfer portal,” she said, “what happens when they choose to hold events in locations that don't allow, let's say, women making a decision about the autonomy of their own bodies?""Parrot pointed to a recent survey that showed 25% of students had ruled out an institution based on the laws and policies of the state where it was located.Of course, she quickly noted, college athletes likely have far different priorities than the student body as a whole. For top-level recruits in sports such as football and basketball, signing with a school that enhances their chances of getting to the pros is sure to remain the top priority.“If there’s an issue that as a team we want to stand up for, then we’ll do it,” said UConn freshman Alex Karaban, whose team is headed to the men's Final Four. “But as of now, we're focused on the basketball side of it.”There also could be a difference between the attitudes of male and female athletes, especially regarding abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.“It's going to be interesting to see if any of this influences where student athletes enroll,"" Parrot said, “and where they don't.”___Paul Newberry is a national sports writer for The Associated Press.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849657,Man charged with firebombing Wisconsin anti-abortion office,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — After nearly a year of searching, investigators used DNA pulled from a half-eaten burrito to capture the man they believe firebombed a prominent Wisconsin anti-abortion lobbying group's office.The U.S. attorney's office in Madison announced that police arrested 29-year-old Hridindu Sankar Roychowdhury at Boston's Logan International Airport on Tuesday. He was charged via the complaint with one count of attempting to cause damage by means of fire or an explosive.He made an initial appearance in federal court in Boston on Tuesday. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald L. Cabell set a detention hearing for Thursday. Roychowdhury’s attorney, Brendan O. Kelley, who is listed in online court records as a federal public defender, declined comment when reached by phone after Tuesday’s hearing.Federal agents have been searching for almost a year for whoever tossed a pair of Molotov cocktails into the Wisconsin Family Action office in Madison on May 6. One of the firebombs failed to ignite; the other set a bookcase on fire. The message “If abortions aren't safe then you aren't either” was spray-painted on the building's exterior. No one was in the office at the time.The attack came about a week after a draft opinion suggesting the Supreme Court would overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that legalized abortion, leaked. The release sparked abortion rights supporters to mount protests across the country.  Two Catholic churches in Colorado were vandalized in the days leading up to the Madison firebombing. And someone threw Molotov cocktails into an anti-abortion organization's office in a suburb of Salem, Oregon, several days later.The court officially overturned Roe v. Wade in June, putting Wisconsin's 1849 ban on abortion back into play.According to the criminal complaint against Roychowdury, investigators pulled DNA samples from three individuals from evidence at the scene of the Wisconsin attack. But the samples didn't match any profiles in the U.S. Department of Justice's DNA database.As time went on, Wisconsin Family Action President Julaine Appling offered a $5,000 reward for any information leading to an arrest. She accused Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes of being more interested in empathizing with abortion rights activists than bringing any suspects to justice.This past January, police assigned to protecting the state Capitol building in Madison reviewed surveillance video of a protest against police brutality. The footage showed several people spray-painting graffiti on Capitol grounds. The graffiti resembled the graffiti at the Wisconsin Family Action office.The footage showed two people leaving the area in a white pickup truck, which investigators tracked to Roychowdhury's residence in Madison, according to the complaint. Police began following him.On March 1, he pulled into a Madison park-and-ride and threw away a bag of fast food. After he left, police retrieved the bag from the trash can. DNA on a burrito in the bag matched DNA taken from the Wisconsin Family Action office, according to the complaint.The U.S. attorney's office said in a statement that Roychowdhury traveled from Madison this month to Portland, Maine. He had a one-way ticket for a flight from Boston to Guatemala City, Guatemala, that was scheduled to depart Tuesday morning when he was arrested, the office said.Investigators have been unable to match the other two DNA profiles from the scene to anyone, the complaint said.Appling had no comment Tuesday on Roychowdhury's arrest.“I'm very proud of the tireless and determined efforts the combined federal, state and local team put in to identify and arrest this individual,” said William McCrary, the special agent in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives' St. Paul Field Division, which handles crimes in Wisconsin. “It is very satisfying to me to see that this alleged perpetrator has been placed in custody.”",2023/03/29,,World

(AP) — The brother of the late New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez is facing criminal and motor vehicle charges in Connecticut, accused of throwing a brick onto the ESPN headquarters campus and eluding police during brief pursuits in other towns.Dennis John Hernandez, 36, who also has been known as D.J. and Jonathan, was given a misdemeanor summons for breach of peace Thursday by Bristol police in connection with the ESPN incident, according to a police report.Hernandez, who played quarterback and wide receiver at UConn in the mid-2000s, went to ESPN in a car, possibly an Uber, and threw a bag containing a brick and a note onto the property, police said. He then left.The note said: ""To all media outlets, It’s about time you all realeyes the affect media has on all family members. Since you’re a world wide leader maybe you could lead how media and messages are delivered brick by brick. Clean it up! Yours truly, Dennis J. Hernandez,” according to police.Hernandez did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. No lawyers for him are listed in court records. Hernandez grew up in Bristol and recently had lived in Riverview, Florida.His younger brother, Aaron Hernandez, a tight end for the Patriots, killed himself in 2017 in a prison cell while serving a murder sentence.Earlier Thursday, Bristol police said they received an anonymous complaint from someone who said they were concerned about Dennis Hernandez because he said he wanted to destroy property at the state Capitol and at ESPN.An ESPN spokesperson said the company was cooperating with police and declined further comment.Also Thursday, Cheshire police charged Hernandez with reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit and other motor vehicle charges in connection with events on March 8, court records show.Police said Hernandez eluded Southington and Cheshire police during chases but was later caught in Bristol. Bristol police said Hernandez was having a mental health problem and was taken to a hospital for an evaluation.Police said Hernandez told them he had been driving around Connecticut that day trying to get arrested “because he no longer wanted to stay at his mom's house.”",2023/03/29,,World

A post-census report card on the quality of the count showed that Hispanics were undercounted by almost 5%.The latest figures on Hispanic racial identity in the once-a-decade census back up arguments from proponents of changing the federal government's race and ethnicity categories. The White House’s Office of Management and Budget is set to decide on new classifications next year and is accepting public comment on its proposals through next month.The proposed changes would combine the race and ethnic origin questions into a single query because some advocates say the current method of asking about race and separately about ethnic origin often confuses Hispanic respondents. With the revisions, the government would try to get more detailed answers on race and ethnicity by asking about country of origin.The preliminary proposals also would create a new category for people of Middle Eastern and North African descent, also known by the acronym MENA, who are now classified as white but say they have been routinely undercounted.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849661,'Bachelor' creator Mike Fleiss exits reality TV franchise,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mike Fleiss, the creator of “The Bachelor,” has exited the reality TV franchise more than two decades after the iconic dating show launched.His departure was confirmed Tuesday, a day after “The Bachelor” aired its season 27 finale.“I want to thank WBTV and ABC for 21 extraordinary years,” Fleiss said in a statement shared with The Associated Press. The statement did not include the reason for his exit.While Fleiss has been the face of the “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and other spinoffs since the shows' inceptions, trade publications report he hasn't led day-to-day operations in around a decade.For years, “The Bachelor” and its associated shows have wielded significant cultural influence and stoked controversy all along. In recent years, the show has been beset by waning ratings, competition from newer reality dating shows and a series of scandals — including accusations of racism that ejected longtime host Chris Harrison.Fleiss described the show as lightning in a bottle and said the creative team taking over will keep the franchise “bold and moving forward.”“Let the journey continue,” he said.Taking the helm as executive producers and showrunners for the franchise are three franchise stalwarts: Claire Freeland, Jason Ehrlich and Bennett Graebner. Freeland is a former showrunner for Canada's version of “The Bachelor” and associated shows, while Ehrlich has served as the showrunner for several seasons of “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor Pad.” Graebner has been with the franchise for more than 15 years and was an executive producer of its current offerings — “The Bachelor,” “The Bachelorette” and “Bachelor in Paradise.”The trio had already begun working on the upcoming season of “The Bachelorette,” which will be that show's 20th. The new season premieres in June and features Charity Lawson — a fan favorite and the third runner-up of the most recent season of “The Bachelor.”That season ended Monday with the engagement of lead Zach Shallcross and Kaity Biggar.“I wish them a long and happy life together,” Fleiss said in his statement.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849662,Nets' Simmons won't play again this season because of back,"NEW YORK (AP) — Ben Simmons won't play again this season because of a nerve injury in his back, ending his disappointing first full season with the Brooklyn Nets after just 42 games.Simmons saw multiple specialists this week who determined that he should be shut down for the season because of a nerve impingement and begin a rehabilitation program. Coach Jacque Vaughn said Tuesday a full recovery was expected.It's the second straight year that Simmons was unable to play because of a back injury. He had surgery in the offseason to repair a disk problem, but was bothered this season by a sore left knee before his back problems returned.Simmons finishes with averages of 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds and 6.1 assists.The No. 1 pick in the 2016 draft didn't play after the All-Star break in February. The 26-year-old had fallen out of the starting lineup before that, unable to regain the form that earned his three All-Star selections in Philadelphia.He was traded to the Nets last February after initially refusing to play for the 76ers in the 2021-22 season, citing mental health concerns. His back problems then surfaced as he worked to get himself prepared to play for the Nets.Simmons is making $35.4 million this season, and is due $78.2 million more over the next two seasons.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849663,"Seattle, feds seek to end most oversight of city's police","SEATTLE (AP) — The U.S. Justice Department and Seattle officials asked a judge Tuesday to end most federal oversight of the city’s police department, saying its sustained, decade-long reform efforts are a model for other cities whose law enforcement agencies face federal civil rights investigations.Seattle has overhauled virtually all aspects of its police department since DOJ investigators in 2011 found officers were too quick to use force and too often escalated encounters to the point where force was necessary.Since then, officials say, the use of serious force is down 60% and the department has new systems for dealing with people in crisis, responding to complaints of biased policing, supervising officers and identifying any who get physical too often.Both sides asked U.S. District Judge James Robart to terminate their 2012 settlement agreement, known as a consent decree, which gave the court oversight of reform efforts.However they agree that more work remains to be done in two key areas — police accountability and crowd control, especially following the department’s violent and heavily criticized response to racial justice protests in 2020. Robart would continue to oversee reform work related to those topics under a new agreement.“Seattle stands as a model for the kind of change and reform that can be achieved when communities, police departments and cities come together to repair and address systemic misconduct,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, told a news conference in Seattle.Seattle has spent about $200 million on its efforts, including the cost of new policies, database systems and other expenses.Tuesday's announcement served to highlight a way forward for city, county and state law enforcement agencies around the country that have found themselves under Justice Department scrutiny. Such investigations are often unwelcome due to the expense of making reforms and because the efforts can drag on for a decade or more.Earlier this month the department found that police in Louisville, Kentucky, have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discrimination against the Black community following an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor. It also announced a new review of the police in Memphis, Tennessee, following the beating death of Tyre Nichols.Federal civil rights investigations are also underway involving police agencies in Minneapolis, Phoenix, Lousiana and New York.Meanwhile court-enforced oversight remains in effect in other jurisdictions such as Oakland, California, where police have been under federal oversight for two decades. Last month the department lost its seventh chief in as many years over the alleged cover-up of an officer’s misconduct.Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said the money the city has devoted to police reform has been well spent.“We look at it as an investment in our city — keeping everyone safe, keeping our businesses safe,” he said. “It was an emotional investment for many of us as well. ... We made these investments, and it's paying off.”The judge has found that Seattle has not complied with the consent decree's terms on officer accountability. He cited the case of Adley Shepherd, a former officer who was fired for punching a handcuffed, inebriated woman during a 2014 arrest, breaking a bone in her face.Then-Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole fired Shepherd, but a disciplinary review board reinstated him before a state appeals court ultimately upheld the dismissal.Robart said an accountability system that allows a review board to overturn a police chief’s decision in such a case was not consistent with the city's obligations under the consent decree.The Justice Department launched its Seattle investigation in response to calls from the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington and other groups outraged over uses of force by officers — most notably the fatal 2010 shooting of Native American woodcarver John T. Williams, who had crossed the street in front of a police cruiser while carrying a small knife.Enoka Herat, an attorney with the ACLU chapter who focuses on policing and immigration, said that while some data shows improvement by the department, other statistics reveal continued problems, including that Seattle police are four times more likely stop Black people than white people and nearly six times as likely to stop Native Americans.“This is not a ‘mission accomplished’ moment,” Herat said. “Whatever the court decides, we'll continue to be watching to make sure Seattle police continue engaging in constitutional policing and that officers are held accountable.”",2023/03/29,,World

The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.The inspections have been dormant since 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussions on resuming them were supposed to have taken place in November 2022, but Russia abruptly called them off, citing U.S. support for Ukraine.

The attack was considered to be imminent and to be intended to cause extensive loss of life.The suspects were charged Tuesday with terrorism offenses, while a third man believed to be outside Greece has been charged in absentia with similar offenses.A statement from Netanyahu's office maintained that the attackers were linked to Iran.“After the start of the investigation of the suspects in Greece, the Mossad rendered intelligence assistance in unraveling the infrastructure, its work methods and the link to Iran,” the statement said.“The investigation revealed that the infrastructure that operated in Greece is part of an extensive Iranian network run from Iran and spanning many countries.”Greek authorities have not identified the foreign intelligence agency that provided assistance in the investigation, but said they were investigating the possibility that the suspects were also planning other attacks in Greece.“Their aim was not only to cause the loss of life of innocent citizens, but also to undermine the sense of security in the country, while hurting public institutions and threatening (Greece’s) international relations,” a police statement said.The two suspects both entered Greece illegally from neighboring Turkey and had been in the country for at least four months, according to two Greek officials who spoke to the Associated Press. As part of their investigation, police searched multiple sites in Athens as well as in southern Greece and on the western island of Zakynthos.The two men in custody are believed to be part of an overseas network and are scheduled to be questioned by a public prosecutor Friday, the officials said.Greece’s anti-terrorism police division and National Intelligence Service were involved in the arrests.“The operation demonstrates that the country’s security authorities maintain a high state of readiness for all Greeks and all visitors to our country,” Public Order Minister Takis Theodorikakos said in a tweet.___ Kantouris reported from Thessaloniki, Greece, Federman reported from Jerusalem.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849679,MLB unveils new replay technology and marketing approach,"NEW YORK (AP) — A season of seismic changes for baseball gets underway Thursday highlighted by significant new rules designed to speed up the pace of play and create more action on the field.Major League Baseball also hopes fans noticed more transparency around replay reviews and efforts to boost marketing of players.Improved replay technology and a refreshed marketing strategy designed to focus on players were among the notable changes unveiled at MLB's Innovation and Fan Engagement Showcase on Tuesday.The sprawling replay facility resembles a television production truck and features workstations with umpires assigned to two games simultaneously with a replay operator, who required about four to five weeks of training.Once a close play is spotted, they notify another group watching the isolated angles from television feeds.“Us having access to all the angles at the ballpark is what leads us to be faster and faster every year,” said Jim Sensale, director of replay operations. “We’re hoping to have the call before they even come to headset.”In terms of feedback from current umpires, Sensale said the feedback is positive“They love it now,” Sensale said. “They don’t want to be in the papers for getting the call wrong. They know they have this backup system and we’re going to get the call right in here and help them out on the field.”The new feel of the replay room was unveiled about two weeks after MLB reached a deal with Zoom Video Communications Inc. allowing on-field umpires to watch the replay operations center evaluating contested calls.Another new feature of the replay room includes limited number of telecasts getting access to the Zoom videos being seen by umpires on Apple TV+ and MLB Network Showcase telecasts. New technology may also become available for postseason broadcasts, and ballpark videos will have access to the Zoom views on telecasts.The new quicker pace of replay decisions is in conjunction with new initiatives cut down the average time of game. The average time of a spring training game dropped about 26 minutes this season, to 2 hours, 35 minutes.The reduced time occurs after respondents to MLB’s fan research said they wanted to see games lasting less than three hours and more events such as doubles, triples, stolen bases and defensive plays.“Two pretty self-evident themes emerged from that research,” MLB Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Morgan Sword said. “The first was that fans want a pretty crisper pace of play. They want shorter games, pace to be improved.“And when you asked them an open-ended question, how long do you want a baseball game to be, the immediate answer is two hours and 30 minutes.”According to Sword, last year the average time between seeing a ball put in play was nearly four minutes and stolen bases were up by nearly 50% during spring training.“Players that have the ability to steal bases are exciting, athletic players who we want to see more of on rosters and fans want to me of in the game,” Sword said.MLB also unveiled several new ads highlighting the rule changes, including one where actor Bryan Cranston says “Shift This” in an ad focused on the outlawing of infield shifts. Another features Mets designated hitter Daniel Vogelbach contemplating stealing a base because of decreased distances between bases.MLB also held its first ever player marketing session last month in Arizona. Twenty-eight players from 13 teams participated in seminars involving lifestyle photoshoots, personality driven content and capturing content for social media.“I think it was an opportunity that we put some resources behind and finally highlight the process and relationships discussions with players and their management,"" Karin Timpone, MLB Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer said.___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World

(AP) — As Nashville residents reeled from a fatal grade school shooting that left six dead, a federal judge quietly cleared the way to drop the minimum age for Tennesseans to carry handguns publicly without a permit to 18 — just two years after a new law set the age at 21.The move marked yet another relaxation of gun laws in ruby red Tennessee, where GOP leaders have steadily chipped away at firearms regulations and lambasted those who have warned that doing so comes at a cost.It's a familiar scene playing out across the United States, with Republican-dominant states rebuffing calls to strengthen gun safety laws in the wake of violent tragedies and Democrats in blue states championing gun control proposals.""This isn’t freedom. Our families don’t deserve this. I am sick of living in fear that our loved ones won’t make it home because of gun violence,"" said state Sen. Raumesh Akbari, a Democrat from Memphis, shortly after Monday's shooting.“Prayers are good, but faith without works is dead,"" she said, referencing a common Bible verse. ""Let’s not let another preventable tragedy unfold without this legislature taking real action.""In a video statement released late Tuesday, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee called on Tennesseans to pray, but added: “Prayer is the first thing we should do, but it's not the only thing.”He made no mention of guns or gun laws but vowed to take action. He said that his wife had been friends with two of the victims in Monday's shooting and that the three had once taught together.""""We can all agree on one thing, that every human has great value,"" said the Republican governor. “And we will act to prevent this from happening again. There's a clear desire in all of us, whether we agree on the action steps or not, that we must work to find ways to protect against evil.”In Tennessee, Monday's school shooting isn't expected to move the political needle on gun regulation. Republicans control every major political office throughout the state and face little serious opposition against Democrats who call for stricter gun laws.In 2019, Lee told religious leaders he believed if Tennesseans prayed to God to favor the state, God would answer those prayers — ranging from diminishing the state’s opioid epidemic and improving Tennessee’s educational outcomes, to avoiding school shootings.But last year, when asked if he would support restricting firearms in response to recent mass shootings across the U.S., Lee voiced his opposition.“We can’t control what we can’t control,” he said in the days following the gunning down of 19 elementary school students and two teachers in Texas.Instead, Lee signed an executive order calling for enhanced safety measures, but without any mention of guns. He has also called for adding a school resource officer in every school while stating that he has not considered arming teachers to help boost school security.In his video statement Monday, Lee said steps have been taken to strengthen school safety “and that work was not in vain.”Recently resurfaced photos of U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles and his family from 2021 further capture Tennessee’s relaxed gun culture. The images show the Republican and his family posing with firearms in front of their Christmas tree. The caption read: “The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains evil interference — they deserve a place of honor with all that’s good.Ogles, whose district includes Nashville, said after Monday's school shooting that his family was “devastated by the tragedy.”Already this year, Republican lawmakers have introduced bills that would make it easier to arm teachers and allow college students to carry weapons on campus. Democratic-led efforts to strengthen gun safety measures have faltered. On Tuesday, lawmakers delayed taking up any of the contentious gun related bills, saying they wanted to offer respect to the community.The most significant movement involves the state's permitless carry law. In 2021, Lee led the charge to allow most adults 21 and older to carry handguns without first obtaining a permit that requires clearing a state background check and training. Thereafter, gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson announced plans to relocate its headquarters to Tennessee due to the state's ""support for the 2nd Amendment.”Nevertheless, the law was met with a lawsuit from a gun rights group arguing the minimum age should be 18. By late last year, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office negotiated a settlement rather than defend the law, citing last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling expanding gun rights.Skrmetti proposed a deal to allow 18- to 20-year-olds to carry handguns publicly. That agreement was approved Monday — the same day a 28-year-old former student shot through the doors of a Christian elementary school in Nashville and killed three children and three adults.Skrmetti's office declined to comment on the settlement.Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are moving to change the law so it reflects the court deal. The legislation is still making its way through the Capitol.The Tennessee Highway Patrol had already stopped enforcing the prohibition for 18- to 20-year-olds to carry handguns without a permit before the judge signed off on the settlement, Department of Safety lobbyist Elizabeth Stroecker told lawmakers last week.Separately, Tennessee does not have a “red flag” law, which allows police to take firearms away from people who threaten to kill. On Tuesday, Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said the suspect in Monday's shooting, 28-year-old Audrey Hale, was under the care of a doctor for an “emotional disorder” but no law is currently in place that would have allowed authorities to confiscate the weapons Hale had purchased.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849681,EPA cites 2 oil and gas firms over Permian Basin pollution,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two Texas companies have resolved Clean Air Act violations with the Environmental Protection Agency by agreeing to reduce emissions of planet-warming methane and other harmful pollutants wafting from the nation's largest oil and gas producing region.EPA announced Monday that Matador Production Company has agreed to pay $6.2 million in fines and mitigation measures related to 239 oil and gas well pads in New Mexico. Permian Resources Operating agreed earlier this month to pay $610,000 and make improvements to its equipment to settle environmental violations.The enforcement actions came after EPA flew a helicopter equipped with a special infrared camera that can detect emissions of hydrocarbon vapors that are invisible to the naked eye.EPA announced a new round of overflights in August, four days after publication of an investigation by The Associated Press that showed 533 oil and gas facilities in the region are emitting excessive amounts of methane and named the companies most responsible.Colorless and odorless, methane makes up about 95 percent of natural gas and a potent greenhouse pollutant that traps 83 times more heat in the atmosphere over a 20 year period than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.The AP used 2021 data from the group Carbon Mapper to document massive amounts of methane venting into the atmosphere from “super emitters” across the Permian Basin, a 250-mile-wide bone-dry expanse along the Texas-New Mexico border.A partnership of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and academic researchers, Carbon Mapper used an airplane carrying an infrared spectrometer to detect and quantify the unique chemical fingerprint of methane in the atmosphere. Hundreds of sites were shown persistently spewing the gas across multiple overflights.EPA has said the timing of its 2022 overflights was not related to AP’s story and that similar aerial surveillance had been conducted in years past. The federal complaint filed against Matador said unlawful emissions were observed in 2019, while Permian Resources was cited for evidence collected during overflights in 2020.EPA spokesman Timothy Carroll said federal regulators have initiated additional enforcement actions based on the agency's 2022 flyover. He declined to provide the number of additional companies currently facing potential sanctions, citing the ongoing investigations.Methane emissions in themselves are not illegal under current federal law, but the Clean Air Act does regulate other pollutants also contained in the gasses emitted during fossil fuel production, such as volatile organic compounds that contribute to health problems including asthma, lung infections, bronchitis and cancer.“Air quality in the Permian Basin is at risk of not meeting national standards,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. ""We will continue to work with the State of New Mexico to ensure that oil and gas production operations are operating within the law to improve air quality and public health in surrounding communities.”EPA said its settlement with Matador will result in a reduction of more than 16,000 tons of air pollutants that are harmful to human health. There will be additional reduction in emissions of methane and other greenhouse gases equal to about 31,000 tons of carbon dioxide — equal to taking more than 6,000 gasoline-powered vehicles off the road for one year.Emails and a voicemail seeking comment from Matador Resources Company, the Dallas-based corporate parent of Matador Production Company, received no response.Emails to Permian Resources, based in Midland, Texas, also received no response. The voicemail for a phone number at the company listed for media inquires was not accepting new messages on Tuesday.___Follow AP Global Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849682,Cold temps help contain chemicals in North Dakota derailment,"The cold weather in North Dakota kept chemicals that spilled from a derailed Canadian Pacific train from spreading very far, authorities said.Richland County Emergency Management Director Brett Lambrecht said Tuesday that with temperatures well below freezing all of the chemicals that leaked remained within about 100 feet of the derailment that happened Sunday night in a rural area about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Fargo. The high temperature in the area was forecast to reach only 17 degrees Fahrenheit (-8 degrees Celsius) Tuesday.“The weather conditions helped a lot,” Lambrecht said.No injuries or fire were reported in the derailment and no one had to be evacuated in the two nearby farm houses or in the town of Wyndmere a couple miles away. There are no waterways near the derailment.Lambrecht said that the liquid asphalt and ethylene glycol that spilled from six railcars involved in the derailment mostly hardened and remained on the surface of the ground because of the cold weather. Some propylene gas also leaked from a tank car that was punctured in the crash, but officials were able to patch the leak on that car. He said the liquid asphalt looked like “sheets of black plastic” after it froze.Officials aren't yet sure how much of the chemicals spilled, but none of the railcars that leaked spilled all their contents.A total of 31 of the 70 cars on the train derailed. Canadian Pacific officials have said they believe a broken rail caused the derailment.The railroad was able to clear the tracks and resume running trains through the area Monday evening, but Canadian Pacific is still working on clearing all the damaged cars from the site.“It has been a good fast recovery really when you look at it,” Lambrecht said.The cleanup of the chemicals is expected to take about two weeks. The railroad's own hazardous materials experts are working with local officials.Last month's fiery derailment outside East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border renewed interest in railroad safety. Federal regulators and members of Congress proposed a number of safety reforms after that Norfolk Southern derailment. The major freight railroads also said they would install about 1,000 more trackside detectors in the wake of that derailment to help spot equipment problems before they could cause future derailments.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849683,Terry says he always felt confident he'd earn Texas job,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Rodney Terry held Texas together in crisis. Then he took the Longhorns on their deepest NCAA Tournament run in 15 years.His reward: Texas removed the “interim” tag from his title and made him the full-time head coach.“I felt confident the whole time to be honest with you,"" Terry said Tuesday at his news conference, where the former assistant was introduced as head coach. ""I’d prepared my whole life for this opportunity.”Not everyone was so calm about it. As the season wore on and Texas advanced deeper in the NCAA Tournament, the university's wait-and-see approach became one of the biggest stories of the postseason as fans and players, past and present, wondered what more did he have to prove?For some, March Madness was being mad at Texas for being slow on the decision.Texas finally announced Monday — about 24 hours after the Longhorns' season ended in the Elite Eight — that Terry was indeed the new head coach.“You had a very long job interview,” Texas President Jay Hartzell said Tuesday. “And I would say you nailed it.”Texas officials put Terry in charge when Chris Beard initially was suspended, then fired, midseason after a felony domestic violence arrest.He'd been a Texas assistant for a decade under Rick Barnes before head-coaching stints at Fresno State and UTEP, before returning to the Longhorns as an assistant in 2021.“My time and Fresno and UTEP prepared me for this opportunity,” Terry said. “No one knows this place better than me and how to be successful at an elite level (at Texas).”Once in charge, Terry did just about everything anyone could ask. He guided an experienced, senior-laden team to a second-place finish in the Big 12 Conference, the third-most wins in school history, a Big 12 Tournament championship and its first Elite Eight since 2008.The university did not immediately release a copy of the contract under a public records request from The Associated Press. University of Texas System Board of Regents Chairman Kevin Eltife said Terry got a five-year deal for $3 million per year.“Coach Terry is just everything we want in a leader,"" Eltife said. “We all want to win. But you also want someone who is a role model for our student. Class, integrity and character. And look at the way he handled himself after the incident we went through.""Attending the news conference were Terry's players from this season, as well as several former prominent Longhorns and NBA players, including LaMarcus Aldridge and T.J. Ford. Both played at Texas while Terry was an assistant.“Everyone was worried what would happen” after Beard was fired, Aldridge said. “He bonded those guys together.”Beard was arrested on Dec. 12 after his fiancée told police he strangled, bit and hit her during a confrontation at his home. She later said Beard didn't choke her. Texas fired Beard on Jan. 5, calling him “unfit” to lead the program.The district attorney dismissed the charge in February. Prosecutors said they could not prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt and the fiancée did not want to go to trial.Beard has since been hired at Mississippi.Terry said Beard reached out to congratulate him on Monday, adding he wished Beard “nothing but success” at Ole Miss.Terry credited the Longhorns players for not fracturing under the stress of having their head coach fired midseason.""No team faced the challenge you guys faced this year,"" Terry said.Texas should be regular contenders for the Elite Eight and beyond, he said. Texas went to the Final Four in 2003 and advanced to the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight four more times in his first stint as an assistant.“We set a high bar for ourselves” this season, Terry said. “We want to get back to that Elite Eight game. Obviously we want a different outcome when we get to that game and have a chance to get to the Final Four.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/29,,World

His representatives later said that they had not received any such indication on timing from Manhattan prosecutors.The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is leading the investigation, has taken several steps seen as signaling that it could be close to wrapping up, including inviting Trump to testify.Still, the exact status of the probe remained unclear, and it's possible that the schedule could be complicated by the Passover holiday next week.The people who confirmed that no additional action related to Trump was expected this week were not authorized to speak publicly about secretive grand jury proceedings and did so on condition of anonymity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849687,Saudi-backed Newcastle's ownership called into question,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The ownership of Saudi-backed Newcastle was under renewed scrutiny on Tuesday when Premier League chief executive Richard Masters was asked by a member of the British parliament if the league was investigating the club’s backers. Masters told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee that he was unable to comment.The question came in light of fresh uncertainty about who controls Newcastle, which was bought for $409 million in 2021, with Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) having an 80% ownership stake.At the time, a legally binding promise was made to the league that Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund was separate from the country’s government.That has since been brought into question after an American court document filed by lawyers for Saudi-backed LIV Golf claimed the PIF should be regarded as “a foreign state.”“I can’t really comment on it,” Masters said when asked by Clive Efford MP about potential investigations. “I mean, even to the point of saying, ‘Is the Premier League investigating it?’, we can’t really comment on it.“Obviously we are completely aware. And you’re correct about the general nature of the undertakings that we received at the point of takeover. But I can’t really go into it at all.”After Newcastle’s protracted takeover was completed, Masters told the BBC that the Saudi state would not control the club. He added that if it was proved untrue, “we can remove the consortium as owners.”PIF says it has assets under its management valued last year at $620 billion. It is chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, and six of the other eight board members listed on its website are government ministers.Lawyers for LIV Golf argued in a case against the PGA Tour that PIF and its governor, Newcastle chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan, were “not ordinary third parties” and should be exempted from some standards in the discovery phase of the case.“They are a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the filing said. It added that the discovery order was “an extraordinary infringement on the sovereignty of a foreign state.”Newcastle has thrived under its new ownership. It has been transformed from a team that was battling to avoid relegation from English soccer’s top flight, to one that is challenging for qualification for next season's the Champions League.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849688,Deadly fire highlights immigration pressures on Mexico,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The fire that killed 38 people at an immigration detention center in Mexico happened as Western hemisphere countries face pressure to address the extraordinary number of people fleeing their homes.Mexico has expanded its network of dozens of detention centers while working closely with the United States to limit movement of asylum-seekers through its territory to the U.S. border, including to Ciudad Juarez, where authorities said migrants set mattresses on fire late Monday in a detention center after learning they would be deported.Here are some questions and answers about the conditions and policies that led to one of Mexico's deadliest events at an immigration detention center.WHY WERE THESE MIGRANTS DETAINED?Specifics have yet to be released, but Mexico has emerged as the world’s third most popular destination for asylum-seekers, after the United States and Germany. It is still largely a transit country, though, for those on the way to the U.S.Asylum-seekers must stay in the state where they apply in Mexico, resulting in large numbers being holed up without work in Tapachula, near the country’s southern border with Guatemala.Tens of thousands are also assembled in border cities, including Ciudad Juarez, often arriving illegally after harrowing journeys or paying someone off. A sprawling network of lawyers, fixers and middlemen has sprung up to provide documents and counsel to migrants who can afford to speed up the system.More than 2,200 people are believed to be at Ciudad Juarez migrant shelters, and more are living elsewhere in the city after arriving from Guatemala, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and El Salvador, according to a report issued last month by the Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin.Mexico carried out more than 106,000 deportations last year, with about 8 out of every 10 sent to Guatemala or Honduras.HOW ARE U.S. POLICIES AT WORK?The Trump and Biden administrations have relied increasingly and heavily on Mexico to curb a flow of migrants that has made the United States the world's most popular destination for asylum-seekers since 2017, according to U.N. figures.Guatemalans were the largest group among those killed or injured in Monday's blaze, according to Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office. Others were from Honduras, El Salvador, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador.Guatemalans have been disproportionately affected by a U.S. policy in effect since March 2020 to return people who enter the U.S. illegally to Mexico. The practice suspended their rights to seek asylum on grounds of preventing COVID-19.Mexico takes back Guatemalans and some other nationalities, while people from other countries are often released in the U.S. to pursue their cases in immigration court. That's due to the costs and diplomatic challenges of sending them home.On May 11, the Biden administration plans to end the pandemic-era rule, known as Title 42, and replace it with a sweeping new policy that largely bans asylum for anyone who travels through Mexico without first seeking protection there.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security received more than 11,000 comments on the new policy before a Monday deadline for public feedback. The U.N. refugee agency said “key elements of the proposal are incompatible with principles of international refugee law.”The American Federation of Government Employees, the main union representing asylum officers, opposes the change.The proposal is subject to revisions based on public comment and will almost certainly be challenged in court.Amid the uncertainty and rapid change, frustration is running high among many migrants about a glitch-plagued app called CBPOne, which was expanded in January to grant some exemptions to the asylum restrictions. The U.S. has been admitting about 740 migrants daily at land crossings through CBPOne.About 80 migrants are being admitted daily from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso using CBPOne, according to the Strauss Center.WHY CIUDAD JUAREZ?The Biden administration has been under intense pressure after the tally of illegal border crossings reached its highest levels ever recorded last year. Traffic has slowed sharply since January, when the administration extended humanitarian parole to Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who enter through an airport with a financial sponsor.At the same time, Mexico agreed to start taking back people from those four countries who crossed the border illegally. Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said at a Senate hearing Tuesday that the policy on those four countries has been “tremendously successful.”Toward the end of last year, El Paso became the busiest of the Border Patrol's nine sectors along the Mexican border, causing many migrants to sleep outside or in overcrowded shelters upon their release and prompting Joe Biden's first visit to the border as president.El Paso, with its expansive network of shelters in Ciudad Juarez, remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings in February, when migrants were stopped more than 32,000 times. Nearly half of those incidents involved people from Mexico.___This story has been corrected to show that eight of 10 people Mexico deports are sent to Guatemala or Honduras, not four.___Associated Press writers Maria Verza in Mexico City and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849689,"McTominay scores twice again, Scotland defeats Spain 2-0","GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — With another brace by Scott McTominay, Scotland earned its first win against Spain in nearly four decades.McTominay continued his good scoring form by netting twice for the second straight game to give the hosts a surprising 2-0 win over Spain on Tuesday in qualifying for the 2024 European Championship.The Manchester United midfielder found the net once in each half to help Scotland defeat La Roja for the first time since a 3-1 win in World Cup qualifying in 1984.“The manager (Steve Clarke) said this is our chance to create legacies as Scotland players and these are the nights in 20, 30 years that people remember,” McTominay said. “We did really, really well. We knew they’d have lots of the ball and the manager said to be clinical when we had the opportunities.”The result also extended Scotland’s unbeaten streak in European qualifying to seven games and handed it the early lead in Group A with six points from two matches, three more than Spain.Spain had not been beaten in Euro qualifying in 20 matches since 2014, when it lost 2-1 at Slovakia ahead of the 2016 tournament in France. La Roja had won 34 of its last 38 European qualifying matches, with three draws.“It was a tough night for us,” Spain midfielder Mikel Merino said. “We couldn't take advantage of our chances and they got the goals in transitions.”It was an eighth win for Scotland in its last 10 home matches, with a draw and a loss.After opening qualifying with a 3-0 win over Norway, Spain dominated possession but wasn't able to threaten much at a loud Hampden Park. McTominay opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a shot from inside the area after Spain right back Pedro Porro slipped and lost possession just outside the box. The Man United player then sealed the victory with a 51st-minute volley after Spanish defenders failed to clear a cross in front of the net.McTominay had not started in Scotland’s 3-0 win over Cyprus on Saturday but came off the bench to score two late goals.Norway drew 1-1 at Georgia in the other Group A match.It was a disappointing second game for Spain under coach Luis de La Fuente, who replaced Luis Enrique after the World Cup in Qatar last year. He made eight changes to the squad that defeated Norway at home. Spain had also struggled in that match, needing two late goals by substitute Joselu to secure the victory. Joselu was among those earning a starting spot on Tuesday, as was Osasuna defender David García who made his debut for the national team.Joselu had one of the best chances for Spain, hitting the crossbar with a header in the first half.“It was a very complicated and complex match due to the characteristics of our opponents,"" said De la Fuente, who was already receiving criticism back home. ""We generated chances but two small details cost us.”Scotland visits Norway in the next round in June. Spain’s next qualifying match isn't until September, when it visits Georgia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849690,LSU's Mulkey senses reunion in trip to Texas for Final Four,"DALLAS (AP) — Kim Mulkey is returning to Texas for another Final Four, keenly aware that her LSU Tigers will play a short road trip from the school she made synonymous with women's basketball.Mulkey is the third coach to take multiple schools to the Final Four, doing so in her second season back in her home state of Louisiana after leading Baylor to the national semifinals four times in 21 seasons.The Bears won three national championships under Mulkey, combined for 23 regular-season and tournament titles in the Big 12 Conference and made the NCAA Tournament in all but one of her seasons.“You never spend 21 years of your life building a dynasty, and that’s what we did at Baylor. I think we can all agree with that,” Mulkey said Tuesday. “I still have a home there. My grandchildren are there. So my heart will always be there.”Mulkey and the Tigers (33-2) will face first-time Final Four qualifier Virginia Tech (31-4) in the opener Friday night in Dallas, about 100 miles (160 km) north of Mulkey's former college home in Waco. Defending champion South Carolina (36-0) plays Iowa (30-6) in the late game.Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer took three teams to the Final Four, and Gary Blair made it that far with two.Blair's second was Texas A&M in 2011, when he won an Elite Eight showdown with Mulkey at American Airlines Center. Five years later in Dallas, the Bears again fell one win short of the Final Four.Mulkey is back in Dallas with a new team after a 54-42 Elite Eight victory over Miami.“There will be Baylor people sitting in my section that are heartbroken that I left,” Mulkey said. “I get it. Someday when I’m retired, maybe I’ll write another book and have more details, but I love Baylor University, the fans there, the Lady Bear fans there. But it was time. Timing is everything in life.”South Carolina coach Dawn Staley has fonder memories of the home of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. The Gamecocks won their first national title there five years ago, beating Mississippi State after the Bulldogs ended Connecticut's 111-game winning streak in the semifinals.“Dallas, it will be etched in my memory forever,” said Staley, whose team — the No. 1 overall seed — earned a return trip with an 86-75 victory over Maryland. “I remember vividly the police escorts. I remember our fans. I remember UConn losing. That was a huge moment in college women's basketball.”Virginia Tech coach Kenny Brooks is a Dallas Cowboys fan, so he remembers seeing star quarterback Dak Prescott in the stands five years ago rooting for his alma mater, Mississippi State.Prescott remembers the “huge moment” to which Staley referred. His reaction to Morgan William's buzzer-beating game-winner in overtime made the rounds on social media five years ago.“That was a surreal moment,” Brooks said. “But my surreal moment was last night.”That's when the No. 1 seed Hokies beat Ohio State 84-74 to reach their first Final Four in Brooks' seventh season. Iowa, which beat Louisville 97-83 in the Elite Eight, has advanced this far for the first time since 1993, when Stringer became the first coach to lead multiple teams to the Final Four.Stringer had done it with Cheyney in the inaugural tournament season of 1982, and after the Iowa trip, she went twice more with Rutgers in 2000 and 2007.“She called me immediately after we beat Louisville,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “In fact, she was my first voice message I got that night. I know coach Stringer is behind us. I haven’t been able to get back to her yet, but I will soon.”Mulkey’s Bears were one of the top seeds in 2017, hoping to chase a title just up the road from their Waco campus. Mississippi State beat Baylor in overtime in the Elite Eight before the OT thriller against UConn.The Tigers are this deep in the tournament for the first time since the last of five consecutive Final Four appearances in 2008, all of which ended in the semifinals.Mulkey was asked if she felt the burden of living up to those glory years.“We’ve already done that,” said Mulkey, who has now reached the NCAA Tournament in 19 consecutive seasons as a coach. “Winning a national championship will only put an exclamation mark on it. We have exceeded probably what anybody could just realistically say was possible this quickly.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849691,McConnell opposes as Senate nears repeal of Iraq war powers,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell says he opposes repeal of the 2002 and 1991 authorizations of force against Iraq, arguing that that authority “bears directly on the threats we face today in Iraq and Syria from Iran-backed terrorists.”McConnell, who is home recovering from a fall earlier this month, is weighing in for the first time as the Senate is poised, as soon as Wednesday, to repeal the decades-old authority for the Iraq war. While supporters say the repeal would reinforce today’s strategic partnership between Iraq and the United States, McConnell and other Republican opponents say a withdrawal of those war powers would project U.S. weakness in the Middle East and embolden Iran and other terrorist groups.“I am opposed to Congress sunsetting any military force authorizations in the Middle East,” McConnell said. “Our terrorist enemies aren’t sunsetting their war against us. And when we deploy our servicemembers in harm’s way, we need to supply them with all the support and legal authorities that we can.”The pushback from McConnell comes amid a growing rift in the Republican Party on the U.S. role in the Middle East, with some echoing former President Donald Trump's “America First” message to argue against military intervention abroad. Other Republicans are concerned Congress is giving too much leeway to the president in matters of war.Almost 20 GOP senators have signaled they will vote for the repeals, likely giving Democrats the votes they need to approve the two measures.“I think a lot of lessons have been learned over the last 20 years,” said Indiana Sen. Todd Young, the lead Republican sponsor of the repeal. He said that those supporting the legislation “want to ensure that the American people can hold us accountable, rather than delegating those important authorities to an executive branch and then lamenting the unwitting wisdom of the executive branch if things don’t go well.”The October 2002 votes to give President George W. Bush broad authority for the invasion were a defining moment for many members of Congress. After the initial March 2003 invasion, American ground forces quickly discovered that Bush administration’s allegations of nuclear or chemical weapons programs were baseless. In the end, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and nearly 5,000 U.S. troops died in the war.Young noted that there is other existing authority for President Joe Biden, along with past and future presidents, to order military action. But lawmakers fear the Iraq war powers could be used for purposes Congress never intended.Trump’s administration cited the 2002 Iraq war resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani, but it has otherwise been rarely used.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican who voted for the Iraq war authorization in 2002 but is now voting for repeal, said that two decades ago there was more deference to a president’s authority in the case of an imminent threat. But since the Iraq war, she said, “there’s more hesitation to have open-ended authorizations for the use of force, and the fact that these authorizations have been in effect for so many years diminishes the role of Congress in declaring war.”The Senate rejected several Republican amendments to the bill Tuesday that were intended to put the brakes on the repeal, including some aimed to ensure that the U.S. is able to protect troops and personnel against potential Iranian aggression.GOP senators opposing the repeal raised concerns about recent attacks against U.S. troops in Syria, including a drone strike last week that killed an American contractor and wounded five troops and another contractor, followed by a rocket attack that wounded another service member. Iranian-backed militants are believed responsible for the attacks.“Iran right now is the threat,” said Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican who offered an amendment that would require the Director of National Intelligence to assess that the repeal would not “degrade the effectiveness of United States-led deterrence against Iranian aggression.” The amendment was rejected, 38-57.Supporters of the repeal, including Biden and his administration, have argued that it would not affect any response to Iran. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both said at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that American troops have the ability to protect themselves and respond to attacks, including Article 2 of the Constitution, which gives the president the authority to protect troops from attack.Austin noted that a separate 2001 authorization for the use of military force against al-Qaida and other insurgents allows the U.S. to have forces in the region conduct missions against the Islamic State group. That would remain in place under the Senate bill.“As we go forward, it’s always good to look at the authorities and make sure that we evolve them if that’s required, and so you have my commitment to work with leadership and with you to continue to do that,” Austin said.It is unclear whether the House will take up the legislation. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has signaled possible support, even though he previously voted against it. When the House voted on a similar repeal two years ago, 49 Republicans voted with Democrats to withdraw the measures.Republicans opposed to the repeal have argued that the Biden administration has not been tough enough on Iran, and that vacating the war powers in place now will not help.“While the Senate’s been engaged in this abstract, theoretical debate about rolling back American power, Iran has continued its deadly attacks on us,” McConnell said in his statement.Young argued the opposite.“He’s ignoring the fact that over recent decades, we’ve had the 2002 authorities on the books, and that has, in no way deterred attacks from occurring,” Young said of McConnell’s statement. “Game, set and match.”",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849692,"Budding Wild star Boldy more willing to shoot, and it shows","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Matt Boldy was unable to resist a smile in the aftermath of his second hat trick in five games for the Minnesota Wild, a young right wing and reluctant star trying to make sense of a remarkable hot streak.Does the puck feel as if it's automatically going in the net these days each time he shoots?“Yeah, it does,” Boldy said in the locker room after leading the first-place Wild to a 5-1 win over Seattle. “My linemates are playing great. Hopefully you guys are giving them a lot of credit. You look at some of those goals — just putting it on a tee for me.”This non-attention-seeker has found himself squarely in the NHL spotlight. Boldy has 11 goals in nine games since Wild superstar Kirill Kaprizov was sidelined with a lower-body injury to raise his goal total to 28, in part because he's been more willing to shoot. With vision and stickhandling as strengths and the humility of being a second-year player, it's easy to be in a pass-first mindset.“Everybody kind of took turns talking to him. But it’s not that he didn’t want to. A lot of times a situation like that where a guy’s got that skillset, it’s a real unselfish quality, right?"" coach Dean Evason said. ""But I think he gets now that he helps the team a lot when he scores goals.”The Wild were confident enough in Boldy's scoring ability to commit a seven-year, $49 million contract extension to him earlier this winter, after all.“I think I’ve always had that mentality, but sometimes you just get into spots and it comes off your stick good,” Boldy said. ""When things are going well, the puck goes in the net.”'The Wild are 6-1-2 without Kaprizov. Boldy is a big reason why.“You go through the slumps, you learn what you need to do to score. I think he’s found a good way to be in the right spot and shoot the puck when he had a good opportunity,” center Joel Eriksson Ek said.The Wild have only won one division title in 22 years, the five-team Northwest Division in 2007-08. They're leading the eight-team Central Division with eight games to go, with both Colorado and Dallas too close for comfort. They haven't won a playoff series since 2015.With Kaprizov due back before the postseason and Boldy on this heater, a Wild team that ranks just 23rd in the league in goals per game (2.93) ought to have a better chance to advance. Eriksson Ek and Marcus Johansson have been ideal linemates for the Boston College product and Massachusetts native.Since the Wild entered the league in the 2000-01 season, only five NHL players have had more hat tricks at age 21 or younger than Boldy with three: Patrik Laine (eight), Marian Gaborik (five), Steven Stamkos (five), Alex DeBrincat (four) and Connor McDavid (four). Boldy turns 22 next week, so there's still time for one or two more.“He’s big. He controls the puck a lot. He’s got a good shot, good release. He’s smart. He switches it up. He’s got good moves on breakaways. He’s a total player,"" goalie Marc-Andre Fleury said. ”Fun to watch him grow this year.""___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849693,"Girl's body pulled from Ecuador landslide, raising toll to 8","ALAUSÍ, Ecuador (AP) — Rescuers on Tuesday pulled the body of a 6-year-old girl from the rubble of a house buried by a big landslide in central Ecuador, raising the confirmed death toll to eight while the search continued for more than 60 people still missing.The girl’s body was the first to be found in about 40 hours of searching after the initial landslide Sunday night, reflecting the difficulty rescuers were having digging through the mud, rocks and rubble. The landslide buried at least 50 houses in the Andean town of Alausí.The girl was found at a depth of 5 meters (5 yards) on one side of the lower part of the avalanche. Rescuers expanded the search in the area to look for the girl’s uncle and two cousins, who relatives said were with her when the landslide struck.The head of one of the rescue teams, Jorge Torres, told The Associated Press the conditions of the terrain made the search very difficult since the bodies “must be between 20 and 30 meters underground.” He said rescuers were feeling tremors in the ground and feared another landslide.Torres said the first hours are essential for finding survivors and hopes of finding people alive fade as the days go by. But he said they will continue searching hoping “to rescue someone alive or at least provide peace of mind amid the pain with a body for relatives to mourn.”The head of the Quito Fire Department, Esteban Cárdenas, told local media the area is covered by more than 2 million cubic meters of earth, mud and rocks that have buried houses of up to three stories.The searchers, who were using heavy machinery, were joined by dozens of Indigenous people from nearby areas. Fire department, army, police and Red Cross rescuers were exhausted but vowed to keep searching.A reason the death toll was not higher was that at the end of February, authorities warned about the risk of earth movements in the area due to heavy rains. When cracks in the ground began to widen, officials recommended that people evacuate. Some did, others didn’t.Milton Taday said he was able to move his disabled mother into the house of a neighbor on more stable ground who let them use a couple of rooms.“But now everything is closing, people are leaving everything out of fear,” he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Gonzalo Solano in Quito, Ecuador, contributed to this report.",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849694,"Blackhawks' Toews returns to ice, hints at retirement","CHICAGO (AP) — Longtime Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews returned to the ice Tuesday but hinted his stellar NHL career could be winding down after 15 years.Toews, 34, skated with teammates prior to Chicago's game with the Dallas Stars. It was his first time practicing with them since a game in Edmonton on Jan. 28.He made a statement through the team on Feb. 19 saying he would be stepping away because of the effects of Chronic Immune Response Syndrome and “long COVID.”In meeting with reporters Tuesday, Toews stopped short of saying he hoped to play in any of last-place Chicago’s nine remaining games. His eight-year, $84 million contract is set to expire at the end of the season.Toews said he’s feeling stronger, but isn’t sure if he’ll be able to play again for the Blackhawks or another team.“Both if I’m being fully honest,” Toews said. “I feel like I’ve said it already, that I’ve gotten to the point where my health is more important.“When you’re young and you’re playing for a Stanley Cup and everyone’s playing through something, that means something and it’s worthwhile. But I’m at that point where it feels like more damage is being done than is a good thing.”Toews, the Blackhawks' first-round draft pick (third overall) in 2006, joined the team in 2007 and was a pillar of Stanley Cup championship clubs in 2010, 2013 and 2015.At the peak of his career, he was one of the NHL's top two-way centers, winning the Selke Trophy as the league’s top defensive forward in 2013.In 1,060 regular-season games, Toews has 371 goals and 509 assists. In 139 playoff games, he's posted 45 goals and 74 assists, and he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 2010.Toews missed the entire 2020-21 season with Chronic Immune Response System, which caused debilitating inflammation and fatigue.He appeared in 71 games in 2021-22, then started this season with renewed energy before slowing and eventually shutting himself down.Entering this season, it looked as if Chicago might deal him, as it did fellow star Patrick Kane, before the March trade deadline. But Kane went to the New York Rangers and Toews to injured reserve.Toews believed he was progressing before a relapse in January left him so sore and tired that he could barely “put on my skates or roll out of bed to come to the rink.”Toews said his progress over the past month has been “pretty encouraging” and he’s delighted to be back among his teammates. He has no timetable beyond that.“We’re just going to go day by day here,” Chicago coach Luke Richardson said. He deserves anything he wants to try to achieve here.”Richardson hoped Toews “can take that next step later in the week and hopefully (he) gives us the green light to go in a game.""But Toews emphasized his long-term health and ability to lead a “normal life” is most important. He wants to go out on a positive note and not hit the ice for a game playing through excessive pain and dysfunction.“It’s definitely on my mind that this could be my last few weeks here as a Blackhawk in Chicago,” Toews said. “It’s definitely very important for me to go out there and enjoy the game and just kind of soak it in and just really appreciate everything I’ve been able to be part of here in Chicago.""___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4849695,"Scotland upsets Spain, Croatia wins, Belgium beats Germany","GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Scott McTominay scored twice as Scotland upset Spain 2-0 in qualifying for the European Championship on Tuesday, its first win in 39 years over one of soccer’s biggest heavyweights.McTominay’s goals came after he also scored two in a 3-0 win over Cyprus on Saturday and ended Spain’s 19-game unbeaten run in European qualifiers. The result also puts Scotland top of Group A with six points from two games.Mateo Kovačić also scored twice as Croatia defeated Turkey 2-0 away for its first win in Group D.Romania and Switzerland both won in Group I, continuing their perfect starts.A look at the Euro 2024 qualifying games across Europe on Tuesday:GROUP ASpain’s players were warned after McTominay scored two late goals in Scotland’s opening win over over Cyprus.But few expected him to do it again Tuesday against a team that had not lost a European qualifying game since a 2-1 loss to Slovakia ahead of the 2016 tournament. Spain had not lost to Scotland since Maurice Johnston scored two and Kenny Dalglish added another in a 3-1 World Cup qualifier in November 1984.New Spain coach Luis de la Fuente made eight changes to the lineup to the team that started Euro 2024 qualifying with a 3-0 win over Norway. Joselu went closest for the visitors when his header hit the crossbar midway through the first half.Georgia and Norway drew 1-1 in the other group game.GROUP DCroatia was forced to rely on goalkeeper Dominik Livaković to deny Turkey’s Cengiz Ünder and Kerem Aktürkoğlu early on in Bursa.Kovačić opened the scoring from close range in the 20th and nabbed the second just before the break.Kieffer Moore scored just before halftime for Wales to beat 1-0 in the other group game.GROUP ISwitzerland earned a 3-0 win at home over Israel, giving coach Murat Yakin his second qualifying victory from two games after its 5-0 win over Belarus in Serbia on Saturday.Romania defeated Belarus 2-1 to maintain its winning start, while Kosovo and Andorra drew 1-1.FRIENDLY RESULTKevin De Bruyne steered Belgium to a 3-2 friendly win over Germany in new coach Domenico Tedesco’s return home.De Bruyne set up both opening goals then sealed the victory just as Germany was threatening an equalizer after recovering from a very poor opening half hour.It gave Tedesco, the former Leipzig and Schalke coach, a second win from his first two games after his team started Euro 2024 qualifying with a 3-0 win in Sweden last week.___ More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/29,,World
