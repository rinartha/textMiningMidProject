https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825709,Controversial Internet Personality Andrew Tate to Appeal Third Arrest Extension in Romania,"Romania – Professional kickboxer and controversial internet personality Andrew Tate is set to appeal his third arrest extension in Romania. The 35-year-old Briton was taken into custody by Romanian authorities on February 24th, 2023, on charges related to alleged drug possession and distribution.Tate has been a subject of controversy in recent years due to his controversial statements and behavior on social media. He is known for his far-right views and has faced backlash for his comments on topics such as race and gender.Tate’s legal team is set to challenge the third extension of his arrest in a Romanian court. The defense argues that the charges against Tate are baseless and that the authorities are unfairly targeting him due to his public profile.This is not the first time Andrew Tate has faced legal trouble. In 2021, he was arrested in the UK on charges of assaulting a police officer and possession of illegal weapons. He was released on bail pending trial.Tate has maintained his innocence and has accused the authorities of a smear campaign against him. In a statement released on his social media accounts, he said, “I am innocent of these charges, and I will fight to clear my name. This is a politically motivated attack on me, and I will not be silenced.”The case has attracted international attention, with supporters and critics of Tate weighing in on social media. The appeal is set to take place in the coming weeks, and the outcome will be closely watched by those on both sides of the controversy.Tate’s arrest in Romania occurred after authorities reportedly found drugs in his possession during a routine traffic stop. He has been charged with possession and distribution of narcotics, which carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison if convicted.Tate has been vocal on social media about his experiences in Romanian custody, claiming that he has been mistreated by prison officials. In one post, he alleged that he had been denied food and water for several hours.The Romanian authorities have denied any wrongdoing and have defended their actions in Tate’s case. In a statement, a spokesperson for the police said, “We take all allegations of mistreatment very seriously and investigate them thoroughly. However, in this case, we have found no evidence to support Mr. Tate’s claims.”Tate’s case has also sparked a debate about the use of social media by public figures and the responsibility they have to their followers. Critics have accused Tate of using his platform to spread hate and promote dangerous ideas.Despite the controversy surrounding him, Tate remains a popular figure on social media, with over one million followers across various platforms. His supporters have rallied behind him, launching a hashtag campaign on Twitter in support of his release.The appeal is expected to be a closely watched event, with both sides preparing to present their arguments in court. Whatever the outcome, Tate’s case is a reminder of the power of social media and the responsibilities that come with having a large following.",2023/03/02,,

One of the essential components of using Windows 10 Pro is acquiring and activating the Windows 10 Pro product key. In this article, we will provide you with a guide on how to obtain and use the product key to activate Windows 10 Pro.What is a Product Key?A product key is a unique 25-character code that verifies that the copy of Windows 10 Pro installed on your device is genuine and licensed. Without a product key, Windows 10 Pro will run in a trial mode with limited functionality, and you will not be able to access all of the features of the operating system.How to Obtain a Product Key?If you are purchasing a new device with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed, the product key should be included in the device’s packaging or documentation. Alternatively, if you purchase Windows 10 Pro as a standalone product, you can obtain the product key through the Microsoft Store or an authorized retailer.If you already have a device with Windows 10 Pro installed but do not have a product key, you can use a key retrieval tool to extract the product key from your device’s BIOS. However, this method is not recommended, as it may violate the terms of your license agreement and could potentially compromise your device’s security.How to Activate Windows 10 Pro Product Key?Once you have obtained a product key, you can activate Windows 10 Pro by following these steps:If the product key is valid, Windows 10 Pro will be activated, and you will have access to all of its features. If the product key is not valid, you will need to obtain a new product key or contact Microsoft support for assistance.Additionally, it is important to note that product keys are typically only valid for a single device. If you plan to transfer your license to a new device, you will need to deactivate your current device’s product key and reactivate it on your new device.To deactivate your current device’s product key, follow these steps:Once the product key is deactivated, you can reactivate it on your new device by following the steps outlined above.It is also worth noting that product keys for Windows 10 Pro may be subject to regional restrictions. If you purchase a product key from an international retailer, it may not be valid in your region. Always ensure that you purchase product keys from authorized retailers or directly from Microsoft to ensure that you receive a valid product key.In conclusion, acquiring and activating a product key is an essential step in using Windows 10 Pro. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your copy of Windows 10 Pro is genuine, licensed, and fully functional.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825841,Greece train crash: Government admits 'decades of failure',"The Greek government on Thursday admitted failures in its state railway system as the death toll rose to 46 after two trains collided in Greece's worst ever rail tragedy.Fire Service spokesman Yiannis Artopios said the grim recovery procedure was ongoing ""centimeter by centimeter"" while Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that ""everything shows that the drama was, sadly, mainly due to a tragic human error.""Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis has resigned over the accident and angry protests have broken out.A probe into the tragedy would focus on the ""chronic delays in implementing railway works, delays caused by chronic public sector malaise and decades of failure,"" government spokesman Yiannis Economou told reporters in Athens.""I believe the responsibility, the negligence, the error has been confessed by the station master,"" Economou said.The 59-year-old station manager has been arrested in the wake of the tragedy where two carriages were demolished and a restaurant car caught fire, trapping victims inside.On Wednesday evening, protesters hurled rocks at train company offices in Athens, before being dispersed by riot police using tear gas. Anger also spilled onto the streets of Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city in the north of the country, and the destination for one of the trains involved in the collision.The other train was a freight train.On Thursday, trains were brought to a halt in a one-day strike against what unions claimed was successive governments' refusal to listen to repeated demands to improve safety.The Greek state railway company OSE has been heavily criticized in the wake of the crash. According to media reports, railway trade union members had long warned of the possibility of accidents due to the electronic control system on the Athens-Thessaloniki line was not functioning properly.The latest warning came just three weeks ago, according to the newspaper Naftemporiki, which reported that there have been repeated minor accidents or close calls along the route between the two cities.""As long as no protective measures are taken for the workplaces and the safe operation and traffic of the trains, the accidents will not come to an end,"" says the union's letter, dated February 7.The communication stated the dangerous situation could no longer be tolerated. ""What are you waiting for to intervene? What more needs to happen?""Another letter sent by the Train Drivers' Association to the Ministry of Transport last November also highlighted shortcomings.The collision occurred at around 11:30 pm on Tuesday (2130 GMT) near Larissa in the Tempe Valley of Thessaly, some 380 kilometers (236 miles) north of Athens, on the main railway line between the capital and Thessaloniki.The passenger train, with 342 passengers and ten employees on board, crashed into a freight train heading in the opposite direction on the same track, officials said.All ten train employees are believed to have died in the tragedy.jsi/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/03/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825842,Pakistan: Drug companies head for shutdown amid faltering economy,"A pharmaceutical crisis in Pakistan is heating up amid a delay in releasing crucial bailout funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the tune of $1.1 billion (€1.03 billion).Medicine production in the South Asian nation has plunged by 21.5% in recent months — mainly due to the prolonged refusal of commercial banks to facilitate the import of raw materials.Syed Farooq Bukhari, chairman of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told DW that the banks resumed issuing letters of credit (LCs) in January this year as a formal guarantee to pay for imports. But in light of low foreign exchange reserves, the banks only granted around 50% of requests for the documents, which are issued to goods importers guaranteeing payment within a fixed period.Bukhari pointed out that granting 50% of LC requests results in ""medicine shortages as well as hoarding by wholesalers and retailers.""Officials blame the LC problem on the country's alarmingly low foreign exchange reserves and insist that it would last until the IMF released the $1.1 billion bailout tranche.Last month, a team of IMF negotiators held talks with Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in Islamabad — but returned to the United States without striking a deal to unlock the funds.Most of the medicines and pharmaceutical products manufactured in Pakistan use imported raw materials, whose rates have been driven up by the massive devaluation of the Pakistani rupee over the past year.The medicine retail prices are fixed by the federal government on the recommendation of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP).However, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif's administration is not accepting the industry's request for a 38.5% across–the–board medicine price hike, fearing a public backlash as inflation already jumped to about 31.5%.DRAP recently approved a slight hike in the prices of 19 medicines, including pain relievers and fever reducers — a move rejected by the industry as insufficient.Bukhari said the production of some pharmaceutical products had become unfeasible as the value of the US dollar jumped from 230 Pakistani rupees to around 270 rupees in a matter of weeks, while fuel rates and utility charges were also escalating.""Four pharmaceutical MNCs [multinational companies] have already left the country and another has gone for force majeure, while 40 local companies have formally told us that they're heading for a shutdown due to the unaffordable cost of production,"" he said.He insisted that litigation had delayed relief on medicine pricing to the industry.Pharmaceutical companies have also complained that scores of ships and containers carrying raw materials and medical devices imported from China, Europe and the United States are stuck at seaports due to payment delays caused by dollar shortages on the market.Pakistan's prime minister had formed a committee two months ago to look into the issues of the pharmaceutical industry but it has yet to meet medicine manufacturers. Meanwhile, the deepening medicine crisis threatens patient care as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs.Shortages of medicines and pharmaceutical products have been reported across Pakistan.Muhammad Noor Mehar, chairman of the Pakistan Drug Lawyers' Forum Chairman, pointed out that around 10% of imported lifesaving medicines were in short supply.He also claimed the unavailability of diabetes, heart, renal and asthma medicines on the market and said that some imported medicines and raw materials awaited clearance at ports.Doctors at the Federal Government Polyclinic — the second-largest public-sector hospital in the capital city Islamabad — confirmed medicine shortages and said they included Ketaconzole (fungal infection), Risek injection (gastroesophageal issues), Vita 6 (tuberculosis), Treviament (diabetes), Neuromet (anemia and nerve damage), and Herparin injection (blood thinning).An epilepsy hospital patient, who requested anonymity, told DW that the acute shortage of Tegral tablets used to relieve nerve pain had driven her family from pillar to post.""Though doctors have put me on alternative medicine, it's really frustrating to see patient care being neglected so callously by those at the helm,"" she said. ""It's a pity that even if you've got the money, it's not necessary that you'll get the required medicines and treatment.""The Centre for Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy in Quetta is the only cancer hospital in the southwestern Balochistan province.Its oncologist and principal medical officer, Jamila Shuja, told DW that the prices of almost all chemotherapy medicines had doubled in a few months, and since most cancer patients were very poor, their medical prognosis and treatment were badly affected.""Injections Doxorubicin and Kopaque, which are administered to cancer patients, aren't available at pharmacies, but they're sold on the black market at rates 10 times higher than the notified ones,"" she said.Muhammad Waheed, a salesman at Najeeb Pharmacy, Islamabad, said Arinac (cold and sinusitis) and thyroid medicines had been out of stock for a long time.There are also reports that government hospitals have postponed important surgeries due to the unavailability or shortages of imported oxygenators, coronary stents, transplant kits and syringes.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/02,,

In particular, he criticized how it shares intelligence with other counter-terrorism agenices.""There was a significant missed opportunity to take action that might have prevented the attack,"" Saunders said in his third and final report into the bombing, the deadliest in the UK since the July 2005 attacks in London.He added, ""There was a realistic possibility that actionable intelligence could have been obtained which might have led to actions preventing the attack.""The July 22, 2017, bombing at the Manchester Arena was carried out by Islamist extremist Salman Abedi.His brother Hashem was sentenced to 55 years in prison in 2020 for aiding and abetting the attack.A third brother, Ismail, was convicted last July over charges that he fled England to avoid giving evidence to the inquiry.Most of the victims of the attack in front of the arena where US pop singer Grande was performing were concertgoers or parents waiting to pick up their children from the show.Richard Scorer, a lawyer who represented 11 of the families at the inquiry, said, ""The failures exposed in this report are unacceptable.""es/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825866,How healthy are India's 1.4 billion people?,"India's population reached 1.4 billion people at the end of last year, according to estimates from the World Population Review. That's 5 million more than in China, which has held the top spot since 1950 when the United Nations began keeping a track of national demographics.The news came at a time when several developed nations like Germany, the UK and Japan are facing shrinking workforces, and their governments are introducing immigration policies which invite high-skilled individuals to set up home there.On the other hand, India's growing population has historically been seen as something negative given the stress it puts on basic resources. More recently, though, there seems to have been a shift in perspective as some parties argue that having the world's largest and youngest population has its perks.Either way, India has the world's attention, and everyone has one underlying question: Is India's rising population going to propel it into accelerated development?India's population has been growing for a long time. ""It [India] becoming the most populous country in the world doesn't change anything on ground,"" Belgian-born Indian developmental economist Jean Dreze told DW.If anything, India's fertility rate has dropped from an average of 6 children per woman in 1964 to 2.1 children per woman in 2020, according to UN data. That's marginally below the replacement rate of 2.2 — i.e., the required number of births per woman to maintain a population. Strides in health care and increasing life expectancy are likely to continue the momentum of population rise for a few more decades, according to experts.Data projections predict that India's population will slowly grow to 1.7 billion by 2064 but then fall drastically. The US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicted that India's population could fall back to around 1 billion by the end of the century.""What I'm saying is that I don't see a population crisis,"" said Dreze. ""India has been a large country all this time and nevertheless the economy is growing, and it is able to improve people's living conditions, albeit slowly. And population growth is not going to continue much longer.""With more than half of India's population under 30 years of age, several argue that the country's young people give its economy an edge in the form of a demographic dividend — the economic growth potential which comes from the shift in a population's age structure.Dreze, however, argued that the expectation is exaggerated.""What they don't realize is that the demographic dividend is already over, by and large,"" he said.The economist pointed out that the dependency ratio of children and elderly who don't earn on those who do, has dropped drastically over the past decades.""It [dependency ratio] is not going to decline much more now. We are already past that stage. In the future, there may not be as many children, but elderly dependency will rise,"" he said.Overpopulation of a country, by simple rules of demand and supply, will inevitably put pressure on natural and manmade resources.""Rapid population growth makes eradicating poverty, combating hunger and malnutrition, and increasing the coverage of health and education systems more difficult,"" said Li Junhua, head of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.For example, as India's population grew by a billion in the last 70 years, health care infrastructure did not grow at a proportional rate. As a result, the out-of-pocket cost of health care has risen.The cost of health care in India is still significantly lower than peer countries and per capita income has also been rising.But the majority of India's population growth comes from rural and underprivileged areas around the Ganges basin while the rise in income comes from the urban, privileged population. Inequality has been on the rise.On the education front, 65% of India's population has finished secondary education and is eligible for higher levels such as PG diplomas, MBAs and doctorates — an impressive statistic comparable to developed nations. However, only a quarter of the population actually enrolls in such courses.Despite a larger, younger population, a significant chunk of India is malnourished, unskilled and marginalized — and hence unable to meaningfully contribute to the nation's development.The employment rate has been steadily declining since 2005.Economics Professor Jayan Thomas of Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, outlined the mismatch between demand and supply of labor in an interview with Business World.""The difficulty is that the labor supply growth in India is accelerating during a period in which the employment elasticity of growth has declined significantly,"" Thomas said.""Due to automation and other technological changes, the production of one ton of steel or garments requires much fewer workers today than it did two or three decades back.Therefore, it will be difficult for India to replicate China's success in absorbing massive amounts of labor into its export-oriented industries during the 1990s and 2000s.""Per capita income — while rising — is still among the lowest in all of G20 countries.Over 70% of India's population cannot afford a healthy diet as of 2020. That is despite having a fairly low cost of food when compared to India's peers.Key social and economic indicators apart, India is seriously lagging in other arenas such as overall happiness of masses, press freedom, safety of women and minorities.""Having a large population is one thing but for that to be advantageous, we need to focus on the quality of the population,"" Dreze said.""And that's something India can improve on.""Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/02,,

They often encounter difficulties finding jobs, leaving many of them destitute.In 2014, India's Supreme Court recognized non-binary or transgender persons as a ""third gender,"" paving the way for millions of transgender people to attain legal status and better social protection.Three years later, the court made an individual's sexual orientation an essential attribute of their privacy.But despite the ruling and even after courts overturned a colonial-era law that had criminalized same-sex relationships, social prejudice persists.The transgender community continues to face discrimination and rejection by their families. They're often denied jobs, education and health care.""I think this initiative has proved to be a great opportunity for transgender persons and given the right impetus and encouragement. This could help them in a big way,"" Lokanath Misra, head of Aruna, an NGO working with sexual minorities and people living with HIV and AIDS, told DW.""More such efforts need to be made to bring members of the community to mainstream society.""Edited by: Srinivas Mazumdaru",2023/03/02,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825882,Blood teak for the super rich props up a cruel regime,"One of the most expensive woods on the market, teak is predominantly found in the dense jungles of Myanmar. Growing slowly over decades, it is durable and has a uniform golden brown color that makes it highly desirable, particularly for high-end furniture and luxury yachts. Just one square meter (ca. 10.7 square feet)  of teak decking can cost up to €1,000 ($1,066).But the pricetag has done little to slow its popularity. Demand from the €8.5 billion yacht industryis fuelling teak logging in the forests of Myanmar. According to the United Nations, the southeast Asian country’s forests are already facing devastation, with almost 15 million hectares lost between 1990 and 2015 — more than the entire forests of Germany.Much of the timber — often dubbed ""blood teak,"" as it funds the brutal military junta that has killed nearly 3,000 people since a February 2021 coup — is exported illegally. Such are the findings of Deforestation Inc., an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and various media outlets, including DW.The investigation into Myanmar's teak trade was based on leaked tax agency files, publicly available trade data, and interviews with traders in 11 countries. The confidential files ー mostly from 2021 and 2022 ー were shared with the ICIJ by the human rights group Justice for Myanmar, the UK-based news outlet Finance Uncovered, and the online data transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets.When the junta seized power from Myanmar’s democratically elected government two years ago, the EU, UK, Canada and the US responded with sanctions on relevant individuals and state-owned enterprises. This included Myanmar Timber Enterprise (MTE) which has a de facto monopoly over the country’s timber sector.The aim of the sanctions was to limit the military leadership’s income from exploiting Myanmar's natural resources. Yet according to DW’s analysis of trade data, timber ー including teak ー worth almost €45 million has entered the EU since the military coup.Under EU regulations, timber only has to be inspected at the port of arrival. Once it is in the bloc, it can be shipped from one country to another.And although states such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands have ceased direct imports from Myanmar, EU trade data suggests that is not true for Croatia, Greece and Italy — which has become the hub of the teak trade in Europe.Deforestation Inc. found that some Italian yachtdeck manufacturers and timber merchants import teak products from Myanmar through middlemen, who obscure the origin and harvest date of the wood, and then export the goods to customers in other European countries.Leaked files from Myanmar’s tax agency show that between April and September 2021 alone, Comilegno Srl, who describe themselves as ""importers and suppliers of timber for flooring in the nautical industry,"" imported more than €665,000 worth of teak. Comilegno Srl is just one of 27 companies mentioned in the leaked documents.Lieutenant Colonel Claudio Marrucci of the Italian Forestry Service, interviewed by the Italian investigative platform IRPIMedia as part of Deforestation Inc., said Italy takes a lenient approach towards teak because it is crucial for the country's almost €2.8 billion boat industry.""It is a crime,"" he said in reference to the imports of teak despite sanctions, ""but considered as serious as the killing of birds.""Because the Turkish government didn't impose sanctions on importing materials from Myanmar after the coup, companies across Turkey have been freely able to continue importing valuable teak.In fact, since the sanctions imposed by the EU and others, teak imports to Turkey have skyrocketed. In 2021 imports to the tune of €2.2 million were recorded officially, while preliminary figures for 2022 put the value at €10.6 million. And early figures for the first month of this year suggest that Turkish traders imported teak worth more than €3.2 million. But some of it is moved on to other countries.A Turkish teak importer, speaking to DW on condition of anonymity, said he had been approached by Italian companies asking that he change the documented origin of Myanmar teak and sell it them.""Italian companies are very aggressive on this issue,"" he said.Though he said he knew of no Turkish companies that had bowed to pressure from Italian traders, official statistics analyzed by DW show that in 2022, Turkey exported €500,000 worth of teak to Italy. It was the first teak export for more than 20 years.According to records shared with Deforestation Inc., construction company Cengiz Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. imported Myanmar teak worth €3 million in just six weeks towards the end of last year.The company's chairman, Mehmet Cengiz, who has a close friendship with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is estimated to be worth €2 billion. According to the World Bank, Cengiz Holding is one of the top three companies in the world with most public tenders won between 2002 and 2020.At the time of publication, Cengiz Holding had not responded to DW's request for comment on the planned use of the teak.Besides Turkey and Italy, Deforestation Inc. revealed that India, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and USA also kept importing considerable amounts of Myanmar teak.The continued teak trade not only helps to fill the coffers of the military junta, which according to the UN Refugee Agency, has waged a campaign of mass arrests and caused the displacement of more than a million people since coming to power. It is also having a devastating impact on Myanmar's once pristine forests.As they are cleared at an unprecedented rate in bid to generate income, the junta has been cracking down on environmental activists and their families.According to the UK-based NGO, the Conflict and Environment Observatory, the situation is dire. The group says deforestation in Myanmar could become one of the worst environmental disasters in the world's conflict zones, with severe consequences for local ecology and the people who depend on it.""Justice for Myanmar"" spokeperson Yadanur Maung says the only option is to stop sourcing teak. ""No yacht or deck chair can justify the fatal cost of this trade to the lives of the people of Myanmar, and the destruction of its forests.""Contributing reporters: Scilla Alecci Reporter, Jelena Cosic, (ICIJ), Giulio Rubino (IRPIMedia).Edited by: Tamsin Walker",2023/03/02,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825911,King Kong: A brief history of a 90-year-old movie icon,"As one of the best-known monsters in film, King Kong is an international pop culture phenomenon alongside popular superheroes and comic book characters.The first ""King Kong"" film was made in 1933, and was the brainchild of Merian C. Cooper, directed and produced together with Ernest B. Schoedsack.A concoction of adventure, horror and fantasy, ""King Kong"" remains a pioneering technical masterpiece, featuring early use of stop-motion photography and special effects by Willis H. O'Brien.The film was also one of the first ever to have a special music score composed to accompany it.Released in US theaters on March 2, 1933, it became a huge success and the inspiration for fairground attractions, video games and a series of 12 ""King Kong"" films.The original ""King Kong"" takes as a starting point that gorilla stories were in demand in the 1930s, as settings that seemed ""exotic' in the eyes of US moviegoers often became box office hits.So a film crew led by director Carl Denham sets out to find a giant gorilla on the fictional Skull Island, near Indonesia, where Kong is worshiped as a god by the natives.The film crew captures him and brings him back to New York to present him to the public. Overwhelmed, King Kong breaks free from his shackles and flees.Obsessed with Ann Darrow, the lead actress from the film crew, King Kong kidnaps her and takes her to the top of the Empire State Building, where he is shot to death by US military aircraft. Ann Darrow survives unharmed.King Kong, who was much more brutal in the uncut version than in the final cut, is shown not only as a perpetrator but also as a victim of human greed.In Nazi Germany, the film was initially banned by censors, but Adolf Hitler liked the film and allowed its release.The sequel came out the same year.The story takes place a month after Kong's death. Carl Denham is liable for Kong's havoc. Facing bankruptcy from lawsuits, he flees to Captain Englehorn's ship. After numerous adventures, Denham ends up back on Skull Island for a treasure hunt together with Englehorn, a singer called Helene, and another shady captain by the name of Helstrom.They encounter Kong's son, an albino giant ape, whom they rescue from quicksand. In the end, Kong Junior returns the favor when the island is hit by an earthquake. He brings Denham and Helene back to the boat before drowning in the ocean surrounding the sinking island.The first King Kong film in color came out in 1962 as a Japanese film in the Kaiju monster genre. Directed by Ishiro Honda, it was also the third Godzilla film.""King Kong vs. Godzilla"" tells the story of the prehistoric dinosaur Godzilla breaking free from an iceberg and threatening to destroy Japan. At the same time, King Kong, captured by scientists, arrives in Japan. The giant gorilla escapes, runs into Godzilla, attacks him, and loses. As a result, he is forced to retreat.The scientists send Kong to fight Godzilla again. Kong feeds on electricity voltage, which makes him stronger than ever.During their final battle on Mount Fuji, the two beasts cause chaos and destruction. The battle climaxes with a fall into the sea, where Godzilla is defeated and King Kong swims back to his home island.The 1967 Japanese sequel was also directed by Ishiro Honda. Like its predecessor and the entire Godzilla series, the film was produced by Toho.This time, the giant gorilla Kong is clearly the good guy of the film, infatuated with a nurse named Susan.A mad scientist named Dr. Who is failing to mine a radioactive element in the Arctic with the help of his robot Mechani-Kong — created in the image of King Kong. So, he abducts Kong, hoping he will get him to finish the job.Kong manages to escape, but Mechani-Kong chases him up to the Tokyo Tower for a final showdown between the two apes. Kong wins and yet again swims back to his homeland.In the 1976 film, King Kong gets a modernized remake of the original story: An oil company disrupts Kong's peaceful island existence and abducts him to New York.The film, directed by John Guillermin, stars Jessica Lange and Jeff Bridges. Producer Dino De Laurentiis had a 12-meter-tall mechanical King Kong figure built especially for the film, which cost $1.7 million (€1.6 million) and was completely covered with horse hair. But unfortunately, the model was defective and could only be seen for a few seconds in the finished film. For the remaining scenes, special effects had to be used.Ten years later, the sequel ""King Kong Lives"" followed. John Guillermin was also the director, but the cast completely changed.Kong did not die in his fall from the Empire State Building, but was in a coma for a decade, hooked up on life-support. After receiving a blood transfusion from a female giant ape named Lady Kong, Kong awakens, kidnaps the female, and flees from the military.After they mate, the couple is discovered by soldiers and Lady Kong is imprisoned while Kong is presumed dead.Months later, Kong kidnaps the pregnant ape again. in the end, the couple is confronted by the military and Kong dies from the soldiers' bullets after witnessing the birth of his son. Lady Kong and Kong's son are then taken back to their native Island of Borneo.In 2005, star director Peter Jackson (""The Lord of the Rings"") fulfilled a childhood dream by venturing into the King Kong material. According to Jackson, the original ""King Kong"" had sparked his career as a filmmaker.Shot in New Zealand, Jackson's remake stars Naomi Watts, Adrien Brody and Jack Black.Jackson followed the 1933 original very closely in terms of plot. He also recreated a spider scene that was removed from the original film by censors in the 1930s.The critically-acclaimed film garnered several award nominations and won three Oscars, but had a slow start at the box office.2017's ""Kong: Skull Island"" is the second film in the MonsterVerse multi-media franchise, which produces blockbuster movies starring the likes of King Kong, Godzilla, and other Toho monsters.Hollywood stars Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, Samuel L. Jackson and John Goodman star in Jordan Vogt-Roberts' fantasy adventure film.In real life, the apelike-beast would be more than 30 meters (around 100 feet) tall, making it the tallest King Kong in the franchise to date.The remake is set in the early 1970s, when a squad of soldiers, government officials and civilians explores a mysterious island. Their helicopter is brought down and they quickly find out that a giant ape lives on the island.Although this is the ""king"" of the island, there are many other monsters against which the group must assert itself.The role of war photographer Weaver, played by Brie Larson, is quite different from the original Ann Darrow character, the passive actress.After the great success of ""Kong: Skull Island,"" which grossed $567 million (approx. 534 million euros) worldwide, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" followed in 2021.An untitled Godzilla vs. Kong project is now set to be released in 2024. It will be the fifth film in the MonsterVerse franchise.As the iconic giant ape turns 90, King Kong remains a box-office star.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/02,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825930,"Blinken, Lavrov meet for first time since Ukraine invasion","NEW DELHI, March 2 (Reuters) - Russia and the United States' top diplomats spoke face-to-face on Thursday for the first time since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine on the sidelines of a G20 meeting where ministers traded blame over the conflict.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to end the war and urged Moscow to reverse its suspension of the New START nuclear treaty, a senior U.S. official said.The Russian foreign ministry said Lavrov and Blinken spoke ""on the move"" for less than 10 minutes at the end of the closed-door session, and did not engage in any negotiations, Russian news agencies reported.Blinken later told a news conference he had told Lavrov to engage in diplomacy during the unscheduled encounter.“I told the foreign minister that no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War,” Blinken added.A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. is not expecting further formal senior-level dialogue with Russia in the near term, and that it did not believe Blinken and Lavrov's ""brief encounter"" will change Moscow's attitude.Earlier in the meeting of foreign ministers, the United States and European allies urged the Group of 20 (G20) nations to keep up pressure on Moscow to end the conflict, now in its second year.Russia, which calls its actions a ""special military operation"", hit back, accusing the West of turning work on the G20 agenda into a ""farce"" and said Western delegations wanted to shift responsibility for their economic failures onto Moscow.'PRESSURE RUSSIA'""We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability,"" Blinken said in remarks released after his address at the closed-door meeting.He was backed by his counterparts from Germany, France and the Netherlands.""Unfortunately, one G20 member prevents all the other 19 from focusing all their efforts on these issues the G20 was created for,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told the meeting, according to the German delegation.Baerbock, addressing Lavrov, urged the Kremlin to return to full implementation of the New START nuclear arms treaty and to resume dialogue with the United States.President Vladimir Putin last week announced Russia's decision to suspend participation in the latest START treaty, after accusing the West - without providing evidence - of being directly involved in attempts to strike its strategic air bases.Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, speaking at a U.N. conference in Geneva, said the United States had attempted ""to probe the security of Russian strategic facilities declared under the New START Treaty by assisting the Kyiv regime in conducting armed attacks against them"".The Pentagon later said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest the U.S. was providing Ukraine with intelligence for targets inside Russia.French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said the war in Ukraine had hurt ""almost every country on the planet, in terms of food, energy, inflation"".'FARCE'Russia's Lavrov, however, blamed the West for global political and economic crises.""A number of Western delegations turned the work on the G20 agenda into a farce, wanting to shift the responsibility for their failures in the economy to the Russian Federation,"" Lavrov said, according to a Russian statement.He said the West had created obstacles to the export of Russian agricultural products.He accused it of ""shamelessly burying"" the Black Sea grain initiative that facilitates the export of Ukraine's agricultural products from its southern ports, the RIA Novosti news agency reported.The G20 includes the rich G7 nations as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other countries with major economies.India, which holds the bloc's presidency this year, has sought to highlight the economic impact of the war as well as issues such as climate change and poorer countries' debt.But New Delhi's efforts to bridge differences and produce a joint statement or a communique stumbled due to differences over the war. The meeting produced an ""outcome document"" instead.India has declined to blame Russia for the war and has sought a diplomatic solution while boosting its purchases of Russian oil.""There were differences on the Ukraine issue which we could not reconcile between various parties who held differing positions,"" Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told reporters at the end of the meeting.",2023/03/03,160,World

U.S. jobless claims numbers fell, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he favored ""slow and steady"" quarter-point U.S. rate increases to limit risk to the economy.
That helped Wall Street stocks rebound from an initial decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose around 1%, boosted by Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), whose shares jumped about 11.5% after the cloud-based software provider gave an upbeat full-year profit forecast and doubled its share repurchase program.
The S&P 500 (.SPX) and Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) both gained around 0.75%, even as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) fell nearly 6% after the company did not unveil a much-awaited small, affordable electric vehicle.
After initially sagging, European shares (.STOXX) rose 0.5, even as euro zone inflation numbers justified what is widely expected to be another 50 basis-point hike in the European Central Bank's already decade-high rates this month.
Consumer price inflation in the 20 countries sharing the euro currency barely eased to 8.5% in February from 8.6% in January on lower energy prices, above the 8.2% economists polled by Reuters had expected.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares (.MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.37%.
Stock and bond markets in recent weeks have been driven by different factors, said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild & Co. The chief concern in stocks is the expectation of pressured corporate profits, while bonds are sensitive to inflation and rate expectations.
""The economic impact of tightening remains a puzzle. Profitability might not be that fragile, at least, not yet,"" he said.
Overnight, both benchmark government bonds and shares had taken a blow, as inflation indicators from Germany and the United States reinforced expectations interest rates would go higher and stay there for longer.
Germany's 2-year government bond yield rose to its highest since October 2008.
In the United States, manufacturing activity contracted for a fourth straight month in February, but a gauge of prices for raw materials increased last month, stoking concerns that inflation would remain stubborn.
""Economic data has surprised to the upside,"" said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments. Any unexpected result in the data would drive policymakers to be more aggressive, and that has reset market expectations, he said.
PRESSURE POINTS
U.S. government bond yields marched higher. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were near a four-month high at 4.066%, while two-year yields also advanced to 4.889%, around a fresh 16-year high.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825933,Consumer inflation in Japan's capital city off 42-year peak,"TOKYO, March 3 (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Japan's capital, a leading indicator of nationwide trends, rose 3.3% in February from a year earlier, slowing sharply from a nearly 42-year peak hit last month in a sign the boost from rising raw material costs may be ebbing.
But inflation in Tokyo still exceeded the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the ninth straight month, keeping the central bank under pressure to phase out its economic stimulus.
The rise in the Tokyo core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes fresh food but includes fuel, matched a median market forecast.
It followed a 4.3% increase in January, which was the fastest year-on-year increase since May 1981, government data showed on Friday.
The data heightens the chance that nationwide consumer inflation will peak in February as the effect of past increases in fuel and raw material costs begin to taper off, analysts say.
The pace of inflation slowed due in part to the government's energy subsidies to ease the pain on households from soaring electricity bills.
An index for Tokyo excluding both fuel and fresh food costs, which is closely watched by the BOJ as a gauge of price pressures driven by domestic demand, was 3.2% higher in February than a year earlier, picking up from January's 3.0% rise.
Nationwide core consumer prices rose 4.2% in January from a year earlier, hitting a fresh 41-year high, as an increasing number of companies passed on higher costs to households.
With inflation exceeding its 2% target, the BOJ has seen its yield curve control (YCC) policy come under attack from investors betting it will soon have to change policy and allow a near-term interest rate hike.
Markets are rife with speculation the central bank will phase out or abandon YCC under incoming BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda, who succeeds incumbent Haruhiko Kuroda in April.

The culling and disinfection took place on Wednesday (March 1), per CNA.Taiwan has reported avian flu on 26 poultry farms this year, mostly due to H5N1. Poultry farms are required to report to the authorities about suspicious bird flu cases or face a fine of up to NT$1 million (US$32,675) pursuant to the Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Diseases (動物傳染病防治條例).A global H5N1 outbreak has resulted in the deaths of millions of chickens, causing a strain on egg supplies and driving up egg prices. Japan’s agriculture ministry said Thursday (March 1) that the number of birds and chickens culled this winter will exceed 15 million, a record high.An 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died from the virus last month as the detection of infections among mammals including minks has caused concern. According to a WHO report released on Feb. 24, a total of 868 cases of human infection with avian influenza (H5N1) were reported between January 2003 and January 2023 from 21 countries, 457 of them fatal.",2023/03/03,804,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825954,"Toll from deadly Greek train crash reaches 57, prompts strike","Family members awaited the results of DNA testing to identify victims of a train crash that killed nearly 60 people in Greece, as workers went on strike Thursday saying the rail system is outdated, underfunded and dangerous.The government has blamed human error, and a railway official was charged with manslaughter.Emergency crews, meanwhile, inched through the mangled remains of passenger carriages in their search for the dead from Tuesday night’s head-on collision, which has left 57 confirmed dead — a number that rescuers fear will increase.The collision of a passenger train and a freight train was the country’s deadliest ever, and more than 48 people remained hospitalized — with six in intensive care — most in the central Greek city of Larissa.Larissa residents lined up to give blood, many waiting in heavy rain for more than an hour, while the city’s hotel association provided free accommodation to relatives of the crash victims.DNA matching was going fast, with at least four families — in the presence of psychologists — receiving confirmation Thursday that their relatives were among the dead, said police spokeswoman Constandia Dimoglidou.Dimoglidou said the process usually takes several days but authorities are making an effort to finish by Friday. She said 24 bodies have been identified through DNA so far. The testing was necessary because many of the bodies were burned or mangled beyond recognition.Among the dozens of grieving relatives who spent a second day at the hospital awaiting results Thursday was Dimitris Bournazis, whose father and 15-year-old brother remain unaccounted for. He said phone calls to Italian-owned train operator Hellenic Train have been fruitless.“I’ve been trying since yesterday afternoon to communicate with the company to find out what seat my father was in,” he said. “Nobody has called me back.”Railway workers’ associations called strikes, halting national rail services and the subway in Athens to protest working conditions and what they described as a dangerous failure to modernize the rail system. A second 24-hour strike was called for Friday.Two separate protests in central Athens were held by left-wing groups, with one resulting in clashes between stone-throwing youths and riot police. Protests were also held in Thessaloniki and Larissa.Critics blame a lack of public investment during the deep financial crisis that spanned most of the previous decade and brought Greece to the brink of bankruptcy. It was during the crisis, in 2017, that the rail operator, then heavily losing money, was privatized and bought by Italy’s Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Group.Greece has a limited rail network that doesn’t reach much of the country. Despite years of modernization projects, much of the key rail control work is still manually operated.The head of the engine drivers’ union, Costas Genidounias, said an up-to-date traffic control system was supposed to have been ready three years ago. He said that starting in 2020, union representatives sent legal notices to the company responsible for Greece’s railway infrastructure, OSE, as well as government and regulatory officials, but received no reply.OSE issued a statement Thursday expressing condolences to the victims’ families but it has not publicly commented on the criticism.Markos Bekris, a union representative who took part in the peaceful Athens protest Thursday, said the collision was “a crime waiting to happen.”He argued that Hellenic Train, OSE and the current and previous governments “share responsibility, as they ignored requests from employees who weekly, daily, raised concerns over health and safety issues and the possibility of a serious accident.”“A FOREST OF RESPONSIBILITY”Transportation Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned following the crash and officials launched a judicial inquiry to determine how two trains traveled in opposite directions on the same track for more than 10 minutes without anyone raising the alarm.The Larissa station manager was charged Thursday with multiple counts of manslaughter and causing serious physical harm through negligence. His name was not released.The stationmaster’s lawyer, Stefanos Pandzardzidis, said his client was “devastated” and accepted “his portion of the responsibility.”“But beyond that ... we must not focus on the tree while there’s a whole forest beyond it,” he said. “There’s a forest of responsibility.”Bournazis agreed that the responsibility for the crash should go far beyond the stationmaster.“We can’t dump all the blame on one person for making one mistake,” he said.He said the crash should lead to a full safety overhaul of the country’s rail system.“I’ve lost my brother, my father. That can’t change, I know it,” he said. “But the point is for us not to mourn victims like that again. They bought 50 tickets to death.”Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis pledged in a televised statement Wednesday night to get to the bottom of the disaster.“Responsibility will be assigned. We will work so that the words ‘never again’ ... will not remain an empty pledge,” he said. “That I promise you.”“CENTIMETER BY CENTIMETER”Amid the growing criticism, emergency workers continued their grim recovery effort, proceeding “centimeter by centimeter” through mounds of twisted steel, shattered glass and scattered luggage, said Fire Service spokesman Yiannis Artopios.“We can see that there are more (bodies) of people there. Unfortunately they are in a very bad condition,” he told state television.Rescuers were focusing on the restaurant car, which was crushed under the first carriage from the force of the collision, said fire official Vassilios Vathrakogiannis.“This morning we removed seven burned bodies from that carriage,” he said.He added that the entire operation was expected to be concluded by midday Friday.About 350 people were on the passenger train, many of them students returning from a holiday weekend and annual Carnival celebrations around Greece.Andreas Alikaniotis, a 20-year-old survivor, described how he and fellow students escaped from a jackknifed train car as the fire approached, smashing windows and throwing luggage outside to use as a makeshift landing pad.“It was a steep drop, into a ditch,” Alikaniotis, who suffered a knee injury, told reporters from his hospital bed in Larissa.“The lights went out. ... The smoke was suffocating inside the rail car but also outside,” Alikaniotis said.He said he was “one of the few around who had not been seriously injured.”“Me and my friends helped people get out.”___Paphitis reported from Athens, Greece.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825955,"Taiwanese fishing boat found overturned in Indian Ocean, crew still missing","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Taiwanese fishing vessel has been found capsized in the Indian Ocean, but its crew of 16 is still missing.The overturned hull of Lien Sheng Fa (聯昇發), which is registered in Kaohsiung under CT4-2896 with the radio call sign BJ4896, was located by Mauritian authorities, reported Taiwan's Fisheries Agency on Feb. 26. However, after the vessel was searched by divers, no one was found inside and the lifeboats were missing.Because it appears its Taiwanese captain and 15 Indonesian crewmembers may have taken the lifeboat, there is a possibility that they are alive at sea. Currently, Taiwan's Fisheries Agency is asking Mauritian authorities and nearby ships to continue to assist in the search and rescue efforts.The 98-ton ship departed from Port Louis in Mauritius on Oct. 7, 2022 and was last reported to be operating about 490 nautical miles to the northeast of the port before radio contact was lost on Feb. 19. The Fisheries Agency received a report that it was missing on Feb. 23 and immediately requested ships in the area to assist with the search.On Feb. 25, the agency received a report from a Taiwanese fishing boat that it had found what it suspected to be the overturned hull of the Lien Sheng Fa. Mauritian authorities then dispatched a team of divers to inspect the wreckage and confirmed that it was the Lien Sheng Fa.Liberty Times cited a source in the fishing industry as saying that lifeboats are standard equipment and are generally equipped with simple rations and drinking water. The source said that most modern lifeboats are tied to a fixed point on the ship and must be manually untied by crew members to be deployed.Such lifeboats are now generally designed to automatically inflate when they hit the water, said the source. For these reasons, there is a possibility that the crew survived the capsizing of the ship and were able to board the lifeboats.The fishing boat was found 150 nautical miles from the last location it had broadcast from. This means that the search area is vast and time is running against the crew.",2023/03/03,1057,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825958,Taiwan Nation group pushes to have Chiang Kai-shek's remains buried,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A pro-Taiwan independence group has filed a lawsuit against Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an (將萬安) in an attempt to compel him to bury his great grandfather, Chiang Kai-Shek (蔣介石).Taiwan Nation (台灣國) Chairman Chen Chun-huan (陳峻涵) on Wednesday (March 1) criticized the mayor’s opportunism in using his family’s legacy during his election campaign and then failing to take responsibility for their historical wrongdoings once elected. He said Chiang should take responsibility and dismantle the Taoyuan mausoleum where Chiang-Kai Shek’s coffin is currently preserved and bury his coffin, per CNA.Chen said that according to Taiwan law, apart from during ceremonies conducted on the day of a funeral, corpses are not allowed to remain in coffins unburied. According to the Mortuary Service Administration Act, Chen’s assertion is correct, though this may conflict with Taiwan’s National Burial Act, which allows for a memorial hall to be established for citizens of the “Republic of China with special service or an outstanding contribution to the improvement of the status of the nation.”Whether or not Chiang Kai-shek’s contribution to the nation was outstanding remains controversial, as Taiwanese still live with the memory of his authoritarian military dictatorship. Chiang Kai Shek originally wished for his remains to be repatriated to China on the assumption there would be an eventual “national reunification” with the mainland.Chiang Kai-Shek died in 1975 and his mausoleum and the surrounding eight-acre grounds continue to receive annual government funding.",2023/03/03,941,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4825989,Bus driver indicted for killing family on crosswalk in central Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Prosecutors have indicted the bus driver that struck a family of three at a pedestrian crossing late last year with negligent homicide (過失致死罪).On Dec. 27, 2022, a family of three, including a 30-year-old Taiwanese woman surnamed Lee (李), a 32-year-old Iraqi man identified as Azeez, and their one-year-old son had gone out for a late meal at McDonald's but found it was closed. As they headed back home, they began to cross the street at a zebra crossing at the intersection of Yicai Road and Xueshi Road in Taichung City's North District.The 53-year-old driver surnamed Chen (陳) of the Fengyuan Bus Transportation Co. Route 280 bus, drove down Xueshi Road and allegedly failed to slow down to look for pedestrians as he turned left onto Yicai Road, running into all three family members. Azeez suffered minor injuries, but Lee and their son were fatally struck.All three were rushed by ambulance to China Medical University Hospital for emergency treatment, but doctors were unable to resuscitate the mother and son, and they were both declared dead at 12:04 a.m. on Dec. 28. Physicians at the hospital said that although the mother and son had no obvious trauma to the head, they had suffered multiple abrasions and bruises on the torso.According to physicians, the abdomen, liver, spleen, and other organs of the victims suffered massive hemorrhaging, causing acute shock and impaired brainstem function. Meanwhile, Azeez had his left wrist bruised.At the scene of the accident, Chen told Azeez and police officers that he did not see the family when he began to make his turn onto Yicai Road due to dim lighting. That afternoon, Chen went to the hospital to personally apologize to Lee's father and husband and in a video of his apology, he could be seen bowing and kowtowing multiple times saying, ""I'm very sorry. I know you are very sad because my own mother recently died, and I can understand your feelings.""Azeez told the media that Chen was driving too fast and that he had failed to stop before entering the zebra crossing, which is a violation of the law that will soon incur steeper fines. ""If he had stopped, my child and wife might still be alive,"" said Azeez.During an investigation by prosecutors, Chen admitted that he did not pay attention to the pedestrians crossing the road when he drove the bus into the intersection, reported UDN. When prosecutors reviewed surveillance camera footage, bus dash cam footage, and photos from the scene of the accident, they determined that Chen's line of sight was not hindered by weather conditions, dim lighting, or any obstacles at the time of the accident.After the investigation, based on witness testimony, relevant evidence, and other information gathered, prosecutors indicted Chen for negligent homicide. In addition, because Chen's failure to yield to pedestrians while driving through the crossing resulted in injury and death, prosecutors recommended the court increase his punishment.",2023/03/03,1789,Society

He said that during the preliminary stages of revision he would be collecting opinions and having discussions from different groups throughout society.Draft revisions of Taiwan’s laws are made available to the public for a minimum of 14 days.

Cambodia is set to hold elections in July.After the verdict, Kem Sokha was taken to his home, where he will be placed under house arrest and only allowed to meet family members.Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 over accusations he conspired with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for nearly four decades. Kem Sokha, who headed the now-disbanded Cambodia National Rescue Party, had denied the charges. Washington called the allegations ""fabricated conspiracy theories.""The US ambassador to Cambodia called the conviction a ""miscarriage of justice.""More to come on this breaking news story.sms/zc (AFP, Reuters, AP)",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826036,Taiwan Matsu Island’s 'Baiming' tradition: A colorful celebration of culture,"Touted as the most-anticipated cultural event of the year on Matsu Island, “Baiming (擺暝) took place in February and saw the diaspora of local residents return to their hometown, along with international tourists, to attend an event that reflects the faith of the traditional fishing village.Located on the west-northwest side of the Taiwan Strait and closer to China than Taiwan, Matsu has celebrated the Baiming or “Beiman” (in the local Fuzhou dialect), for around a century. The annual event starts with the Lantern Festival, and in 2019 the Ministry of Culture registered the Matsu Baiming Festival as the 21st national intangible cultural heritage.For the people of Matsu, Baiming is an occasion to celebrate and socialize. It takes place over several days and features colorful lanterns, traditional ceremonies, and lively village celebrations.Baiming is traditionally held in the evenings at 79 temples and ancestral shrines across Matsu Island, where rich offerings include food, incense, and flowers, to worship the gods and pray for peace. It is a lively event with each temple holding activities such as carrying a palanquin of the deity in a procession, or giving out fortune poems and blessings to believers.The main celebration usually falls on the 13th to 15th day of the lunar calendar, while some villages celebrate it as early as the 7th day of the lunar calendar. In Longjiaofeng, Qinbi, Village on Beigan Island, the event is held on the 29th day of the lunar calendar.Baiming activities have their own characteristics, according to the different areas of Matsu Island. The one on Beigan Island is the most traditional and spectacular.Each year, the main shrine and temple of each village take turns hosting the event, and in 2023, the hosting temple was Yanggong Bashishi Temple (楊公八使宮) in Houwo Village, Beigan Island. The main deity worshipped is Yang Gong Bashishi, a famous Taoist master.The 2023 Matsu Beigan Baiming Festival comprised six main events, starting with the ""Colorful Baiming Lamp Lighting Ceremony"" on the 12th day of the lunar calendar, which fell on Feb. 2 this year. The entire village lit diamond-shaped “wind lamps” in Houwo Village, Tanghoudao (塘後道) Beach to start off the event.This was followed by ""burning horse feeding,"" carrying palanquins of the deity in a procession, feasting at the temple, giving blessings to newlyweds, praying for dreams, and the palanquins joining forces. People followed the pilgrimage and visited the six major temples in Qiaozi village, to pray for good fortune and wealth.",2023/03/03,716,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826043,Transport minister outlines plan to lift Taiwan from 'pedestrian hell',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Minister of Transportation and Communications Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材) has outlined measures he believes will release Taiwan from its pedestrian hell.Wang told reporters today that removing obstacles from footpaths, clamping down on drivers endangering pedestrians, subsidies for footpath improvements, building better roads around schools will help improve Taiwan’s pedestrian environment, per UDN.Wang said that he will work with the road safety association to strengthen the removal of obstacles from footpaths, and encouraged the public to work together with the government to ensure footpaths are obstacle free. He also said that an evaluation of footpath obstructions will be carried out annually.Police will also be clamping down on poor driving behavior that endangers pedestrians, accompanied by a government information campaign to increase awareness of the issue. On Thursday prosecutors indicted a bus driver who killed two and injured another after he struck them while crossing the road in a grim example of Taiwan’s road safety record.With regard to illegal parking endangering pedestrians, Wang said that in the past the number of violations reported to the police was too high for the police to cope with, per CNA. He said that while the police will still be dealing with this issue, there will be additional reviews into the matter.Wang also said that there are more than 400 schools with poor pedestrian facilities that need to be remedied. He said that this would be done in cooperation with county and city governments, along with police.Fines for motorists failing to yield to pedestrians at zebra crossings were raised by 80% in late January, from NT$2,000 to NT$3,600 (US$120). The Ministry of Transportation said that the higher fines should lead to better behavior on the road.One road safety advocate, Lin Chih-hsueh (林志學), disagrees that fines and punishments for poor road user behavior will be effective, saying that ""the focus should be on designing better road infrastructure and enhancing drivers' education.""",2023/03/03,2889,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826053,Fall of Taiwan to China could cost US$2.5 trillion annually,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan on Thursday (March 2) warned that if Taiwan falls to China, it may cost the global economy US$2.5 trillion per year and advocated the ""STAND with Taiwan Act"" to serve as a deterrent.Sullivan was speaking at an event hosted by the Hudson Institute titled ""A Test of Will: Why Taiwan Matters."" Sullivan said the information provided in his speech was based on a question he had posed to intelligence agencies, other think tanks, and combatant commands: ""What would the world look like in the aftermath of a successful invasion of Taiwan by the CCP?""Sullivan said Taiwan produces 92% of the world's most advanced semiconductors. ""Imagine what would happen if that was not only taken offline but controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)?""He said the Commerce Department estimated the U.S. economy suffered US$240 billion in damage from low-end chip supply shortages caused by the pandemic.Based on a U.S. State Department report, Sullivan said the global economy would suffer NT$2.5 trillion dollars in losses per year if Taiwan was invaded by China. He said it would also impact U.S. advanced weapons systems such as F-35 fighter jets, radars, and missile defense capabilities.Citing former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's memoirs, he said the loss of Taiwan would compromise the security of Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Okinawa. Sullivan said the fall of Taiwan would be an event that ""breaks China out of the constraints of the first island chain.""He warned that a China no longer constrained by the first island chain would then threaten the second island chain, which includes the U.S. territories of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. He said that residents of these islands are American citizens and the U.S. has key military bases on Guam.The senator said that once China takes Taiwan, it will likely seek to gain more territory in the region. He predicted that after an invasion of Taiwan, it would be ""very unlikely that that massive force stays put.""He added that Chinese victory in Taiwan would encourage the CCP's brand of authoritarian rule. It would boost the narrative of China's model of ""techno-authoritarian control"" and lead to new acts of ""CCP aggression"" both regionally and globally.The senator then proposed the ""STAND with Taiwan Act"" with ""STAND"" an acronym for ""Sanctions Targeting Aggressors of Neighboring Democracies."" The act would sanction members of the CCP and affiliated institutions and industrial sectors; prohibit U.S. institutions from investing in CCP-affiliated entities; prohibit the listing or trading of such entities on U.S. stock exchanges; and prohibit the imports of goods mined, produced, or manufactured in China.",2023/03/03,12794,Politics

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, BisReport published Global Systemic Oral Azoles Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Systemic Oral Azoles market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, BisReport published Global Well Plates Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global Well Plates market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826146,German Centre Shanghai Chooses Sennheiser TeamConnect Ceiling 2 to Deliver Advanced Audio Experience,"TeamConnect Ceiling 2 takes hybrid meeting and events experience to the next level

  SHANGHAI, CHINA -  Media OutReach - 3 March 2023 -  German Centre Shanghai installed five Sennheiser TeamConnect Ceiling 2 (TCC 2) array microphones across two of its conference rooms, 'Munich' and 'Berlin', to enhance the audio experience during hybrid meetings and events. Spanning 200 square metres each, the conference rooms can be used separately or combined into a 500 square metre space that can accommodate up to 600 people for a stand-up reception.    German Centre Shanghai, located in Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in the heart of Pudong, Shanghai, is a 33,000 sqm international office and service complex that offers modern facilities, commercial space, conference and meeting facilities as well as networking opportunities and advisory services for its tenants and partners. It is now home to nearly 130 companies, including small and mid-sized German companies and international corporations.   A quest to satisfy the changing needs   Due to the pandemic and the increase in demand for better audio solutions to support hybrid events that are becoming increasingly popular, German Centre Shanghai decided to install five TCC 2 array microphones to meet the needs of its tenants and partners.       German Centre Shanghai installed 5 TCC 2s in its combined large meeting room     ""With the large meeting space and capacity that we can accommodate, we often needed to cater for staff to be on standby to pass microphones around the meeting hall. This is not only time consuming and inefficient, but also poses hygiene risks in the current climate. We realized that our old setup was outdated and due for an upgrade,"" said Mr. Christian Sommer, CEO and Chairman of German Centre Shanghai.   A high versatile audio and conferencing solution  TCC 2's adaptive beamforming technology and TruVoicelift functionality can automatically detect and follow the active speaker, which greatly increases speech intelligibility, regardless of the room configuration, and allows participants to be heard clearly from every corner of the room. This flexibility proved to be the perfect solution for the modular event space. Speakers now have freedom of movement and can interact with participants without barriers.       TCC 2's TruVoicelift and adaptive beamforming technology increases speech intelligibility, regardless of the room configuration     One of the highlights of the conference rooms is the semi-automatic glass ceiling, which is stylish and allows natural light into the meeting rooms. However, the large area of glass on the ceiling also added many layers of complexity to the integration and audio solution design process. Glass causes sound reflection and extends reverberation time, which can affect speech intelligibility. Thankfully, TCC 2's super narrow 30° automatic beam can perfectly pick up sound from the direct audio source and significantly increase speech intelligibility.   With Sennheiser Control Cockpit, users can also define advanced exclusion zones to eliminate unwanted background noise, as well as priority zones within the meeting room, for focused and uninterrupted speech pick-up.   Making collaboration and learning easier  The workflow of TCC 2 is simple and straightforward. IT managers and end users can easily operate the system with no prior technical knowledge. This is in line with the mission of Sennheiser's Business Communication division to become the first choice for advanced audio technology that makes collaboration and learning easier.   ""With this installation, we truly had a taste of Sennheiser's highest standard of professionalism, service standard, as well as quality advanced solutions. This project has helped to modernize and improve our offerings and our customers' experience. We hope that, in the future, more of our partners will get to experience Sennheiser's professional audio solutions,"" said Christian Sommer.   German Centre Shanghai is very satisfied with this collaboration with Sennheiser and believes that its tenants will continue to benefit from the elevated and fuss free audio and conferencing experience that it delivers. TCC 2 is compatible with leading video collaboration platforms and is certified for Tencent Meeting, DingTalk, Zoom as well as Microsoft Teams when deployed with Microsoft-certified DSPs.

Organizer udnFunLife said on its Facebook page there had been a move to stop the performance of Russian productions, even though “Swan Lake” was part of global culture.In order to prevent misunderstandings, the United Ukrainian Ballet company decided to scrap its shows of “Swan Lake,” including the three performances planned for Taipei City on April 29 and 30. Nevertheless, the group would replace Tchaikovsky’s work with what it called even more exciting ballets, including “Don Quixote,” “Peer Gynt,” “Giselle,” and the traditional Ukrainian “Forest Song,” udnFunLife said.",2023/03/03,1358,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826169,"Gérard Latortue, former interim Haitian premier, dies at 88","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Gérard Latortue, a former interim prime minister of Haiti who helped rebuild and unite the country after a violent coup in the mid-2000s, has died. He was 88.

            Prime Minister Ariel Henry announced Latortue's death Monday, saying it was a tremendous loss for the nation. He described Latortue as “a reformer, a convinced patriot, an eminent technocrat, a voice of change, of development (and) a supporter of democracy.”

            Latortue was a former exile who was sworn in as interim prime minister in March 2004 following months of bloodshed and political strife that left more than 300 dead and culminated in the ouster of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The turmoil at the time prompted the U.S. military to escalate its mission in Haiti.











            In a July 2004 interview with The Associated Press in Washington, Latortue vowed to fight corruption and disarm powerful gangs as he requested $1.3 billion from the international community to help rebuild Haiti after the violent revolt.

            In September 2005, he welcomed former U.S. State Secretary Condoleezza Rice to Haiti, where she stressed the need for local officials to accelerate the process to hold general elections.

            Latortue said at the time that his administration shared the same concerns as the U.S. government and the international community, and that the administration would honor the results of the upcoming elections.

            “This government has no concerns whatsoever as to who will be the next president. Whoever that is, we will greet that person with open arms and pass power on to him or her,” Latortue said at the time.

            In February 2006, Haiti held general elections to replace the interim government of Latortue, who was succeeded by former Prime Minister Jacques-Édouard Alexis. The provisional president, Boniface Alexandre, was succeeded by former President René Préval.

            On Tuesday, former Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant tweeted that Latortue was “a pragmatic politician who knew how, in a very difficult context, to lead the country to free and democratic elections.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826170,Study: Back-to-back hurricanes likely to come more often,"What used to be a rare one-two punch of consecutive hurricanes hitting about the same place in the United States weeks apart seems to be happening more often, and a new study says climate change will make back-to-back storms more frequent and nastier in the future.

            Using computer simulations, scientists at Princeton University calculate that the deadly storm duet that used to happen once every few decades could happen every two or three years as the world warms from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, according to a study in Monday’s Nature Climate Change.

            Louisiana and Florida residents have already felt it.











            In 2021, major Hurricane Ida blasted Louisiana with 150 mph winds. Just 15 days later a weakening Nicholas came nearby, close enough for its wind, rain and storm surge to add to the problems, said study co-author Ning Lin, a risk engineer and climate scientist at Princeton. Her study looked at not just the storms but the problems back-to-back hurricanes caused to people.

            The Ida-Nicholas combo came after Louisiana was hit in 2020 by five hurricanes or tropical storms: Cristobal, Marco, Laura, Delta and Zeta. Laura was the biggest of those, packing 150-mph winds.

            After Laura, relief workers had set up a giant recovery center in a parking lot of a damaged roofless church when Delta approached, so all the supplies had to be jammed against the building and battened down for the next storm, said United Way of Southwest Louisiana President Denise Durel.

            “You can't imagine. You're dumbfounded. You think it can't be happening to us again,” Durel recalled 2 1/2 years later from an area that is still recovering. “The other side of it is that you can't wish it upon anyone else either.”

            Florida in 2004 had four hurricanes in six weeks, prompting the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration to take note of a new nickname for the Sunshine State — “The Plywood State,” from all the boarded-up homes.

            “We found a trend,” Lin said. “Those things are happening. They’re happening more often now than before.”

            There’s a caveat to that trend. There haven’t been enough hurricanes and tropical storms since about 1950 – when good recordkeeping started – for a statistically significant trend, Lin said. So her team added computer simulations to see if they could establish such a trend and they did. 

            Lin’s team looked at nine U.S. storm-prone areas and found an increase in storm hazards for seven of them since 1949. Only Charleston, South Carolina, and Pensacola, Florida, didn’t see hazards increase.

            The team then looked at what would happen in the future using a worst-case scenario of increasing carbon dioxide emissions and a more moderate scenario in line with current efforts worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases. In both situations, the frequency of back-to-back storms increased dramatically from current expectations. 

            The reason isn’t storm paths or anything like that. It’s based on storms getting wetter and stronger from climate change as numerous studies predict, along with sea levels rising. The study looked heavily at the impacts of storms more than just the storms themselves.

            Studies are split on whether climate change means more or fewer storms overall, though. But Lin said it’s just the nastier nature and size that increases the likelihood of back-to-back storms hitting roughly the same area.

            Any increased frequency in sequential storms in the past was likely due to a reduction in traditional air pollution rather than human-caused climate change; when Europe and the United States halved the amount of particles in the air since the mid-1990s it led to 33% more Atlantic storms, a NOAA study found last year. But any future increase will likely be more from greenhouse gases, said two scientists who weren't part of the study.

            “For people in harm’s way this is very bad news,” University of Albany hurricane scientist Kristen Corbosiero, who wasn’t part of the study, said in an email. “We (scientists) have been warning about the increase in heavy rain and significant storm surges with landfalling TCs (tropical cyclones) in a warming climate and the results of this study show this is the case.”

            Corbosiero and four other hurricane experts who weren’t part of the study said it made sense. Some, including Corbosiero, say it is hard to say for sure that the back-to-back trend is already happening.

            Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach said the emphasis on worsening effects on people was impressive, with storm surge from rising seas and an increase in rainfall from warmer and stronger major hurricanes. 

            “You have to have faith and be able to move forward. You've just got to be in constant motion,” Durel, the Louisiana United Way president, said. “Our neighbors mean much more than wallowing in aggravation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826173,KMT legislator says 228 not worth commemorating in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Kuomintang (KMT) legislator for the island county of Kinmen has said the 228 Memorial Day is not worth commemorating, and that the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis is more worthy of national commemoration.“People in Kinmen feel that 823 is more important, and it is more important than 228 for the Republic of China” said Chen Yu-chen (陳玉珍), per Newtalk, referring to the heavy shelling of Kinmen that occurred on Aug. 23 1958, in what is now known as the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis. At this time, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) fired artillery at Kinmen and Matsu islands, directed at the Kuomintang forces stationed there.Chen said the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis was important for the consolidation of Taiwan as a nation. She added that prioritizing a memorial of this day would remind people of the horrors of war and the 228 Memorial had become highly politicized, according to Watchout.Chen is no stranger to controversial statements and stunts. In 2021 she donned leather motorcycle gloves for a brawl in Taiwan's legislature to protest the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.She said that Taiwan was at a critical point in choosing between peace and war, and claimed revisions to the “All-out Defense Mobilization Readiness Act” would require students over the age of 16 to go to the battlefield in the event of a conflict. Chen made the comments before Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) addressed these concerns, saying Friday (March 3) there was “absolutely no question” of calling students to the battlefield, or to make weapons.Chen’s comments follow five KMT legislators submitting a petition to the islands' Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headquarters calling for the county to be turned into a permanent demilitarized zone. The councilors noted concerns over mounting tensions between China, Taiwan, and the U.S., saying that they did not want history to repeat itself.The 228 Memorial Day commemorates the up to 28,000 Taiwanese who died at the hands of the KMT in the 228 Massacre, and the subsequent 38-year period (The White Terror) of human rights abuses, arbitrary detentions, and executions of political dissidents under martial law in Taiwan that followed.",2023/03/03,1815,Politics

In financial hubs like Singapore and Switzerland, the call to regulate issues concerning cryptoassets is increasing as legislators, regulators, investors and entrepreneurs around the world begin to pay attention to activities surrounding it. This has led to several of them issuing statements and instruments to curb unregulated crypto activities.   Currently, it has reached a turning point in the lifespan of cryptoassets - informed dialogues aimed at bringing clarity and convergence in policy approaches in the crypto field are urgently needed.   The cryptoassets in Asia project represents the maiden efforts of ABLI and its parent, the Singapore Academy of Law, to contribute to this regional and global discourse on the regulation of cryptoassets.   This is an ongoing project of ABLI which aims to develop cryptoassets-related regulatory and practical legal frameworks in Asia. This project involves industry experts, such as Integrity Consulting, as well as legal academics and experts in the surrounding regions. The project aims to cater to all players in the ecosystem, including legal professionals, investors, and intermediaries, such as banks and non-banking institutions, connecting all stakeholders so their voices and perspectives can be considered.   As part of ABLI's project, Sinyee contributed a chapter on Singapore's regulatory treatment of cryptoassets. Some of the points covered in the guide are ""Are cryptoassets-related activities regulated as financial services?"", ""How may cryptoassets be regulated under the Payment Services Act?"", and ""How are stablecoins regulated?"" The chapter aims to share with the public how cryptoassets fit into existing financial services rules and regulations. The third report published under the project also summarises and collates the various regulations in Singapore as a starting point for readers interested in the regulatory treatment of cryptoassets in Singapore.

Over the past 16 years, the company has typically raised its membership fee every 5.5 years and the last time it increased the price was in June 2017.During a call with analysts to discuss quarterly earnings, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti was asked whether a membership fee hike was imminent. Galanti acknowledged that January 2023 marked five years and seven months since the last hike and that an increase is due ""about now,"" but said that it is not imminent, reported Business Insider.""It's a question of when, not if,"" the executive said. He added there is no particular analytical framework the firm uses to make decisions on the matter other than ""we feel very good about our membership and our strength. And if we wanted to do it yesterday, we could,"" reported CNBC.Hinting at a possible timeline, Galanti said, ""If we want to do it six months from now, we can.""The warehouse club's annual fee in the U.S. for its Gold Star Membership is US$60, while Executive membership is US$120. However, in Taiwan, the individual fee is slightly less at NT$1,350 (US$44), while a business card costs NT$1,150.The last time Costco Taiwan raised its annual fee was in September 2016, when it increased the price for the individual membership card from NT$1,200 to NT$1,350, a 12.5% hike, while its commercial card rose from NT$1,00 to NT$1,150, a spike of 15%. At that time, Costco branches in Japan and South Korea also boosted their membership fees.Taiwan News has yet to receive a response from Costco Taiwan to comment on when a membership fee increase may occur.",2023/03/03,2301,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826280,8 imprisoned for Taiwan's largest ever marijuana operation,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taoyuan District Court has handed down prison sentences to eight people following Taiwan’s biggest-ever marijuana bust.Two Taiwan nationals said to be the head of the growing and distribution operation received prison sentences of 11 and 9 years. Six Indonesian migrant workers also involved in the operation received two-year prison sentences and deportation orders upon their release.Taoyuan prosecutors seized the marijuana from a field next to an army base in Longtan District in September 2022. They confiscated 4,218 marijuana plants in total with a market value of more than NT$1.26 billion (about US$40 million).The trial revealed the two Taiwanese involved in the operation had legal jobs, but began to grow the marijuana to earn extra money. They obtained the marijuana seeds from a third party, now deceased, and employed six migrant workers to provide manual labor.The trial revealed that some of the migrant workers believed they were engaging in legal gardening work. After discovering there were marijuana plants, they were not able to easily find other employment that would continue to allow them to support their families back home.The plant had not been harvested at the time of seizure, so there were no proceeds to be confiscated. One of the Taiwanese sentenced was on a monthly salary and earned nearly NT$500,000 in total, which will be confiscated according to the law.Of the migrant workers, three were employed for less than a month and likewise received no income. The other three received salaries but were providing for their low-income families in Indonesia, and may not have been aware the crop was marijuana, so the full amount of their salaries would not be confiscated, according to the verdict.Cannabis is illegal in Taiwan, and the manufacturing, transporting, or selling it is punishable by up to lifetime imprisonment by law. Under Taiwan law, it is in the same class as fentanyl and methamphetamine.In 2022, Taiwan reduced the penalty for growing marijuana for personal use from five years to one year, and lowered the fine from NT$5 million to NT$1 million.Despite this, a lack of social awareness of marijuana and its use in Taiwan means it remains highly taboo, a Taiwanese lawyer, Zoe Lee (李菁琪), told the Hong Kong free press in 2021. “All education basically teach(es) us that weed is a kind of drug and it will poison you and if you start (using) weed right now, the next day, you’ll start using heroin, and you’ll start to rob people, you’ll start killing for money, then you’ll have more money to buy more drugs,” she said.",2023/03/03,2561,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826315,How China's new No.2 hastened the end of Xi's zero-COVID policy,"HONG KONG/BEIJING/SHANGHAI, March 3 (Reuters) - As unprecedented protests against China's zero-COVID policies escalated in November, Li Qiang, the man recently elevated to No.2 on the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee, seized the moment.Top Chinese officials and medical experts had been quietly formulating plans over the preceding weeks to dismantle President Xi Jinping's zero-COVID strategy and gradually reopen the country towards the end of 2022, with the aim of declaring a return to normality in March, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Li, who is set to be named the country's new premier this month, took a more urgent view.He abruptly drove a decision to activate the reopening plans sooner than intended, in an effort to contain the economic toll of the zero-COVID campaign and protests that had rattled the leadership, said the four people and another person with knowledge of the matter. The upshot was a chaotic reopening in December, when China suddenly ended lockdowns, mass testing and other restrictions.Beijing has not publicly explained its decision-making process behind its U-turn on the zero-COVID approach. Xi and Li, as well as the State Council, China's cabinet, did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters submitted via the State Council Information Office (SCIO) about the discussions regarding reopening the country.Reuters assembled this account of China's path to reopening after speaking to more than half a dozen people with knowledge of the discussions. The previously unreported details offer a rare window into deliberations among top Chinese officials and healthcare experts, including differences between Li and Xi about the pace of reopening. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the subject's sensitivity or because they weren't authorised to talk to the media.The protests in November marked a turning point in Xi's handling of COVID management as he started to take a less hands-on approach and allowed Li, his long-time ally, to take charge, two of the people said.Top leaders ultimately opted for a hurried reopening that would pacify the young protesters because the threat the dissenters could pose to the regime's stability was seen as more politically risky than allowing the virus to spread unchecked, two of the sources said.PREPARING SCENARIOSAt a Communist Party congress in mid-October where he secured a precedent-breaking third term and unveiled his new leadership team, Xi had extolled his zero-COVID policy, saying it was achieving positive results. Yet, before the month was out, officials gathered in Beijing to consider how to unwind that strict approach.Wang Huning, deputy head of the party's central COVID taskforce since early 2020 and a member of China's elite seven-man Politburo Standing Committee, held a closed-door meeting in late October with top medical experts and senior officials, including those from the propaganda apparatus, according to three of the sources.Wang repeatedly asked the attendees how many deaths an abandonment of COVID controls would cause in a worst-case scenario, and pressed them to work on various reopening roadmaps with differing paces, two of the people said. Wang did not respond to a request for comment submitted via the SCIO about his role in the talks.Officials from the National Health Commission (NHC) proposed benchmarks for full reopening, the key being improving the elderly vaccination rate, said two of the sources.Meanwhile, some local-level party workers and healthcare officials were grappling with growing challenges in implementing the zero-COVID policy.A local leader of a sub-district in Beijing with over 100,000 residents told Reuters that by the second half of last year it had run out of money to pay testing companies and security firms to enforce restrictions.""From my perspective, it's not that we set out to relax the zero-COVID policy, it's more that we at the local level were simply not able to enforce the zero-COVID policy anymore,"" the official said.Beijing's local government, which did not respond to a request for comment, spent nearly 30 billion yuan ($4.35 billion) on COVID prevention and controls last year, official data show.Party leaders are expected to present plans to help the economy recover from pandemic curbs at China's annual meeting of parliament starting March 5.NUMBER CRUNCHINGAs officials worked on reopening plans, the virus was already outpacing the government's ability to contain it.An official at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in one of the country's largest cities said that as infections soared in the autumn, staff tasked with collating infection data would regularly ask senior CDC managers if the number they were seeing was ""too high"", and whether they should report a lower figure to the public. Doing so could make it seem the outbreak was under control, the person said.""At that point, I was cutting up to 50%,"" said the official, adding that local authorities were running out of money and salaries for some CDC officials were cut last year.The CDC did not respond to a request for comment about China's case data and its involvement in reopening talks.In response to a Reuters request for comment, the NHC said China had continuously optimised and adjusted prevention and control measures with the aim of protecting health, and had transitioned smoothly to reopening in a relatively short time.RISE OF LITalks about reopening coincided with Li's rise. Before his promotion in October, the 63-year-old was in charge of Shanghai, where he oversaw a harrowing two-month lockdown of the city's 25 million people last year.After the congress, Li took charge of China's battle against the virus as head of the party's central COVID taskforce, which reports to the Politburo Standing Committee, according to two of the sources. On Nov. 11, China announced a modest set of 20 measures to loosen restrictions.Xi himself had begun to take fewer personal precautions. He started to appear in public without a mask both in Beijing and overseas, as shown by his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden on Nov. 14 before the Group of 20 summit in Indonesia, as well as a bare-faced confrontation of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.But when daily cases mounted after China's easing measures took effect, Xi wavered, and wanted to revert to the zero-COVID approach, said three people familiar with the matter. In mid-November, when Xi was still in Southeast Asia, he ordered Chinese authorities to ""unswervingly"" execute the zero-COVID policy, said two of the people, after which some cities retightened curbs.Xi's vacillating led to renewed debate on COVID policy among top leaders during mid to late November, one of these people and another person said. By then, there were enough indications to suggest that economic growth was set to slump to one of its worst levels in nearly half a century.In discussions after Xi returned from overseas on Nov. 19, Li resisted pressure from the president to slow the pace of reopening, two of the people said. Reuters was not able to establish how Xi reacted.As the virus continued to spread, Li encouraged local party officials, including in Shijiazhuang, capital of Hebei province, to stick with the 20 easing measures, two of the sources added. In mid-November, Shijiazhuang halted routine community testing as it was reporting hundreds of new infections daily.A Shijiazhuang government representative declined to comment on any engagement with Li or the effects of pandemic policies on residents.TURNING POINTAround this time, millions of people in China were tuning in to the soccer World Cup in Qatar, where footage of packed stadiums and maskless fans led Chinese social media users to complain about the stark contrast with their situation.A final trigger for accelerating reopening came in late November. After a deadly fire in China's Xinjiang region, protests calling for an end to zero-COVID swelled into the biggest show of dissent in mainland China since Xi took power.Xi blamed the protests on youth frustrated by the pandemic. But he said the Omicron variant, rather than the more-lethal Delta, was now dominant in China, paving the way for fewer restrictions, senior European Union officials told Reuters after European Council President Charles Michel and other senior EU figures met Xi on Dec. 1.Finally, on Dec. 7, China announced sweeping changes to its COVID policy, abruptly ending many curbs such as lockdowns, mass testing and local travel restrictions. Plans for the reopening initially would have maintained mass testing, but Li pushed successfully for a broader relaxation that eschewed it, two of the sources said.Immediately following the reopening, the virus was unleashed, hospitals and crematoriums were overwhelmed and pharmacies stripped bare. Undeterred, Li urged officials during a nationwide teleconference on Dec. 25 to promptly deploy resources and secure medication and treatment for key groups, including the elderly and children.Li told the officials that ""the timing is right and the basic conditions are in place"" to manage COVID as a less severe, Category B disease, per a written summary of the meeting reviewed by Reuters and confirmed as authentic by one of the sources.On Feb. 16, Xi declared a ""decisive victory"" over COVID in a meeting with top leaders, according to Xinhua, describing the party's judgment and decisions, including the ""major adjustments"" to the pandemic strategy, as ""completely correct"", effective and well received by the public.",2023/03/03,581,World

Arul and Najib both pleaded not guilty.On Friday, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that the prosecution had failed to establish a case against them, their lawyers told reporters.""(The court) found that there was no element of gratification... absolutely no element of corruption in Najib's role in these charges,"" Najib's lawyer Shafee Abdullah said.Arul, who was present at the news conference, said he felt vindicated by the court decision, adding that he had been ""honest and straightforward"" about his role at 1MDB.The Attorney-General's Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Malaysia's 1MDB is the subject of corruption and money-laundering investigations in at least six countries.An estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates between 2009 and 2014, the U.S. Justice Department has alleged.Najib is facing three more cases related to corruption at 1MDB and other state entities.He has also sought a judicial review against his conviction in a 1MDB-linked case, with Malaysia's highest court expected to decide on the application this month, according to local media.Other Malaysia politicians facing corruption charges include deputy premier, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, the leader of Najib's coalition Barisan Nasional. Zahid has pleaded not guilty to 47 charges of corruption and money laundering.Barisan is a key partner in Anwar's administration, which needed its support to form a government after a divisive election last year.",2023/03/03,109,World

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 3 March 2023 - Organized by National Geographic magazine and presented by Wheelock Properties, the Hong Kong Photo Contest 2022 closed for submissions on December 5, 2022. Despite being limited to photographs taken within Hong Kong, the Contest was highly competitive, with many photography enthusiasts from mainland China, Taiwan, Macau, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the United Arab Emirates competing alongside local Hong Kong photographers.       Vice Chairman & Managing Director of Wheelock Properties Limited and Wheelock Properties (Hong Kong) Limited Mr. Ricky Wong, Director & Group Financial Controller of Wheelock Properties (Hong Kong) Limited William Lo, National Geographic Chinese Explorer, renowned wildlife photographer Xi Zhinong and filmmaker Cheung King-wai taking group photo with winners.      The Contest was divided into six categories: City, Wildlife, Landscape, People, Mobile, and Short Video, with a total of 8,580 entries. The judging panel consisted of National Geographic Chinese explorer, renowned wildlife photographer Xi Zhinong, Hong Kong filmmaker Cheung King-wai, and Lee Yungshih, the Editor-in-Chief of the Chinese version of National Geographic magazine.   Wildlife photographer Xi Zhinong said: ""It is an honor to participate in the judging of the Hong Kong Photo Contest 2022. The Contest inspires photographers and Hong Kong citizens to constantly discover the changes in Hong Kong. The works in the six categories allow us to approach Hong Kong more comprehensively, while also showing the relationship between the city and nature. The most precious thing about Hong Kong is the wilderness that is so close to the high-rise buildings. The wildlife photography works in this Contest are not exciting enough. I hope that with the continuous holding of the Contest, more and better wildlife images can emerge.""   Another judge, director Cheung King-wai, said: ""The works are all beautiful, stunning, and dazzling. The judging process is like choosing a wife from a crowd of beautiful women. Since the beauty is there, we focus on the 'uniqueness,' exclude the monotony, and then look at the 'thoughtfulness,' to see if the works can stimulate the viewers' imagination. We also spent a lot of time checking whether the photos were 'over-processed,' becoming too 'artificial' and 'fake.' It was exhausting and demonstrated the problems caused by technology. Both in aesthetics and as people, it is best to be as natural and sincere as possible. ""   Lee Yungshih, the editor-in-chief, believed that ""the Hong Kong Photo Contest 2022 once again attracted many wonderful works, which is gratifying. In particular, many photos captured the special journey that Hong Kong has experienced over the past two years, leaving behind a certain historical significance. This is the second time for Short Video as a category of the Contest, we gradually saw more videos with 'storytelling' attempts, rather than just a collection of fragments. We look forward to seeing more creative and innovative works in photography and video in the future.""   ""We are deeply honoured to have co-organised the Hong Kong Photo Contest with National Geographic for the sixth consecutive year. It is also our pleasure to have received over 8,500 entries. Each of them revealed the mesmerising beauty of the metropolis, and the entries in the Short Video category even told extraordinary stories of our city. Now that the pandemic is behind us, life in Hong Kong returns to normal. We hope every photo enthusiast will continue to support the Hong Kong Photo Contest by showing the unique charisma of Hong Kong to the world."", says Ricky Wong, Vice Chairman & Managing Director of Wheelock Properties Limited and Wheelock Properties (Hong Kong) Limited.

Porcelain tiles are similar to ceramic tiles but have different production methods and materials. Ceramic tiles are made from fine clay materials and are best for use on walls. Porcelain tiles can be used for floors, but porcelain tiles are made from highly refined and purified compounds that are better suited to flooring.











Ceramic tiles can absorb water at a rate of up to 4 percent depending on their quality. Porcelain has a lower water absorption rate, however. The region has abundant raw materials that can be used to make tiles. This is fuelling the growth of the regional market. Strong demand for electrical ceramics will increase the demand for technical clays in the region. Meanwhile, the European Ceramic and Porcelain Tiles Market is expected to drive the demand for technical clays in the region.

            The demand for porcelain and ceramic tiles is expected to increase in both residential and commercial applications. This will propel the Ceramic And Porcelain Tiles Market forward. Construction is another major contributor to the overall market’s success. Porcelain tiles can be more expensive than other materials. Porcelain tiles can sometimes be too expensive for people with tight budgets. Porcelain could prove to be a good investment over the long term, due to its durability.

            The Ceramic and Porcelain Tiles market has been growing steadily in recent years, driven by factors such as increasing construction activity, rising disposable incomes, and growing demand for aesthetically appealing interiors and exteriors. The market is highly competitive, with several established players and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826517,Why do Germans love to travel?,"Martin Lohmann knows exactly what motivated him when he was planning his winter vacation in the Austrian valley of Kleinwalsertal. ""It was several reasons,"" he tells DW. ""I needed a change of scenery to get away from the grey winter in northern Germany — to get some fresh air and be in nature and spend time with my wife and kids.""Lohmann is one of more than 50 million Germans who go on vacation every year. He's also an expert on what motivates Germans to travel. Lohmann, who holds a degree in psychology, is former head of the Institute for Tourism Research in Northern Europe (NIT). He helped carry out the annual travel analysis of the Forschungsgemeinschaft Urlaub und Reisen (Research Association for Holidays and Travel), a population-representative survey on the travel behavior of Germans that's been conducted since 1970.The survey looks at why Germans love traveling so much. The most common reasons for travel given by survey participants included ""getting away from it all,"" ""having fun, enjoying oneself,"" ""sun, warmth, good weather,"" ""recharging your batteries,"" and ""spending time together.""Meanwhile, reasons such as ""experience a new atmosphere,"" ""Being on the road,"" ""Experiencing other countries,"" ""Doing something related to culture and education,"" or even ""Playing sports"" ranked low on the list.To put it bluntly, the vast majority of Germans simply want to lie on the beach and relax. According to Lohmann, this has been the primary travel motivation for Germans for the past 50 years. ""Self-centered motives predominate,"" he says. ""People are primarily concerned with changing their situation.""Christina Miro, a psychologist, travel therapist and passionate traveler, agrees with the results, although sitting on a beach isn't how she prefers to travel: ""Personally, I'm attracted to the foreign and the unknown,"" she says. She is particularly interested in the culture, language and learning about the way of life of the local population in her selected destination, she says. ""I find it exciting to learn more about other countries.""For the vast majority of people, on the other hand, vacations are essentially a way to leave familiar surroundings and take some distance — both physically and mentally — from everyday life. Naturally, this isn't always easy to do in one's everyday life or home, points out Miro. ""After a stressful period at work, one longs for rest and relaxation on vacation. And vacations are mainly associated with warmth, sun, beach and sea,"" she says.As in previous periods of crisis, the coronavirus pandemic didn't have a lasting effect on Germans' appetite for travel. Just as terrorist attacks or environmental catastrophes only briefly slowed down the  tourism industry, the sector quickly picked up again after pandemic-related travel restrictions were lifted.In many places, last year's tourism figures were nearly back on par with those of 2019, and Christina Miro isn't surprised. ""We lacked positive experiences during the pandemic,"" she says. The need for leisure activities, social contact and variety could only be satisfied to a limited extent, just as the desire to leave familiar surroundings and travel remained unfulfilled. ""We're making up for that now,"" she adds.Regardless of people's motives, travel has a significant effect on the body and mind. ""The fact that so many people travel repeatedly must have something to do with the fact that it has done them good,"" says tourism researcher Martin Lohmann.Vacations can give a feeling of relaxation that can last long after the trip has ended. This feeling of relaxation usually dissipates three to four weeks after the trip, Lohmann says.The effects on health, however, are more long-term, adds Lohmann. A spa vacation, for example, can greatly improve one's health, he says. But there are other kinds of positive elements that can last a lifetime, for example, the knowledge one gains when learning about a new culture. ""This knowledge stays with you forever,"" says the travel expert.Social recognition is another positive effect of taking a trip. People enjoy hearing words of admiration from friends, family or colleagues when they recount their travel adventures, says Lohmann. ""'What, you climbed that mountain?!' People enjoy that effect, even though it may not be the reason they took the trip,"" Lohmann explains. Not to mention that watching the likes and comments flow in when posting on Instagram and Facebook also gives a form of instant gratification that has come to be associated with travel.Traveling can also have a positive impact on self-confidence, especially if one takes on a challenge while on vacation, like practicing a foreign language or doing a difficult physical activity. Lohmann experienced the latter on his vacation in Kleinwalsertal. ""We did a pretty challenging snowshoe hike there,"" he says. ""It was a great feeling afterwards to be able to say 'Great! I can do that.'""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826518,"Ukraine updates: Russia cannot wage war with impunity, says US","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia on Friday that Russia cannot be allowed to wage war with impunity.""If we allow with impunity Russia to do what it’s doing in Ukraine, then that’s a message to would-be aggressors everywhere that they may be able to get away with it too,"" Blinken told the so-called Quad group in India.The group met in the capital, New Delhi, on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Apart from Blinken, the group consisted of Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.They said in a statement that the use, or threat of nuclear weapons in Ukraine was ""inadmissible.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Friday, March 3:Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner mercenary group, said on Friday that his forces had all but surrounded the small but strategically important town of Bakhmut in eastern Ukraine.Russia has been trying to take control of Bakhmut — which it refers to by its Soviet-era name of Artyomovsk — as a launchpad for further advances toward bigger cities in the area.Prigozhin said in a video that there was only one road left for Ukrainian forces to retreat from the city, and called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to order the withdrawal.""Units of the private military company Wagner have practically surrounded Bakhmut. Only one road is left [open to Ukrainian forces]. The pincers are getting tighter,"" the mercenary leader said.He also showed what appeared to be three captured Ukrainians — an old man and two young boys. Prigozhin said these increasingly made up the opponents that his forces were facing.The US is set to announce a new military aid package of $400 million (€376 million) for the Ukrainian government to help Kyiv fight against Russian forces. The announcement will be made on the same day that German Chancellor Olaf Scholzis visiting the White House.""Tomorrow, just unilaterally, the US will have another round of assistance for Ukraine. It will include mostly ammunitions and munitions that Ukrainians will need for the systems that they already have,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.The aid is expected to comprise mainly ammunition including Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) for HIMARS launchers, ammunition for Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as well as armored vehicle launched bridges, US officials told Reuters.The US has already provided nearly $32 billion in weaponry to Ukraine.Ukrainian Defense Minister Olexey Reznikov told German newspaper Bild that he feels optimistic the war will end this year.""I am an optimist, I see the situation on the battlefield, I see the development of support and I really see that there is a chance to end this war this year with our victory,"" he said.He rejected the possibility of negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. When asked about Scholz's pledges to support Kyiv, he said, ""Ukraine must receive real security guarantees.Switzerland's Defense Ministry said it had received a request from the German government to allow German defense manufacturer Rheinmetall AG to acquire some of Switzerland's mothballed Leopard 2 tanks.The tanks would not be sent to Ukraine but be used to fill the gaps created by the handover of Leopard 2 tanks by Germany and its NATO and European allies, a ministry spokesperson told Reuters agency.Germany, Poland, Portugal, Finland and Sweden are among countries that have committed to sending Leopard tanks to help Ukraine defend itself, creating gaps in their own arsenals.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he saw a ""small improvement"" in diplomacy with Moscow after a Group of 20 meeting that saw a rare encounter between US top diplomat Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.""At least this time he stayed and he listened. This is a small improvement but it's important. I think it's better than nothing,"" Borrell said at the Raisina Dialogue, a forum in New Delhi.He was referring to the last G20 meet in Bali last year, where Lavrov reportedly stormed out.Borrell said he was against any effort to remove Russia from the G20 group of the world's top economies. Russia was evicted from the G8 a decade ago, which made it the G7.DW got a close-up look at how Ukrainian soldiers continue to risk their lives in the war against invading Russian forces. They rely on mortar shell attacks despite the dangers of short range combat.Germany has said it wouldn't be buying Russian crude oil this year as it weans itself off its erstwhile biggest energy supplier. But an oil deal with Kazakhstan means Moscow would continue to hold some sway over Berlin.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a speech in parliament in which he asked China not to support Russia with weapons in its war against Ukraine.ab, tg/nm (dpa, AFP, Reuters)",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826522,"""The future is now"": Jewish war refugees in Ukraine","Viktoria Maksymovych places freshly brewed tea and a cake on the kitchen table. When she and her husband Oleg Krassnyi discuss the horrors of the war in Ukraine, their perilous escape and exile within their own homeland, there's nothing pleasant about what they have to say. Words like ""bombs,"" ""destruction"" and ""horror"" come up repeatedly in their stories.The couple sits in the small apartment in Chernivtsi in western Ukraine where they've been living, together with their 15-year-old son, since early 2022. There's a generator in the corner that runs on gas. It's not turned on at the moment, because the apartment has electricity — for the time being.The Jewish-Ukrainian couple is originally from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Like millions of other Ukrainians, they suffered incredible losses after the country's war with Russia. Their jobs, almost all of their savings, and life as they knew it before have all gone. Fortunately, they haven't lost any close family members or loved ones so far.The conversation alternates between recollections of their wartime experiences in Kharkiv and the harrowing story of their escape. At times when they are talking, they sound out of breath, as if someone were holding a knife to their throats.Theirs is a tale of wartime tragedy, like so many others from Ukraine, but there is something unique about their story: they're Jewish. To them, Russia's propaganda about so-called fascism in Ukraine and purported efforts by its military to ""denazify"" the nation seems both absurd and cynical.Viktoria and Oleg were both born in Kharkiv, and Oleg spent some years in Israel. Viktoria, 37, studied economics, and Oleg, 45, is a jeweler. The two of them are practicing, non-Orthodox Jews. Though they identify as Ukrainians and speak the language, their first language is Russian, as it is for the majority of people in Kharkiv.Before the war, the pair lived in a middle-class district in the north of Kharkiv, where they ran a successful cafe together that employed several people. Their life was happy.That all changed on February 24, 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They woke up that morning to the sound of explosions.""It was terrifying. The explosions were close to our apartment block, just a few hundred meters away,"" Viktoria says. Her husband Oleg says the two of them never imagined that Russia would have attacked Ukraine on such a scale.Following the invasion, the family quickly packed their things and took a car to the center of Kharkiv to stay with Viktoria's brother at his apartment. They thought it would be safer there than in the city's northern outer suburbs. A few days later, the building where their cafe was located was destroyed in an attack. Their apartment block was damaged, but it's still standing. ""Everything imaginable was dropped on Kharkiv: missiles, grenades, artillery — everything except atomic bombs,"" says Viktoria. ""I guess they did that because Kharkiv is such a patriotic city. Its residents were not about to surrender.""The couple tells of nights spent at metro stations, of lining up for hours for food, and of getting so used to explosions that they were no longer frightened by them. They eventually learned how to tell from the sound how far away the explosions were, and how much danger they were in. The disbelief in their voices is unmistakable when they describe everything they've been through.After three weeks of Russian bombardment, the family decided to leave. They traveled a day and a half by car to Chernivtsi, where they reached out to the local Aviv Jewish community for help.A congregation had rented out an entire hotel for a few months specifically to house Jewish refugees arriving from other parts of Ukraine. Viktoria and her family initially stayed at the hotel. Then, thanks to a stroke of luck, they were able to rent the two-room apartment where they live now.Today, around 260,000 people live in Chernivtsi, which is 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) from the Romanian border. For a long time, the city was a major center of Jewish culture in Europe. Capital of the historical Bukovina region, Chernivtsi was under Habsburg rule. Between the two world wars, the area belonged to Romania.Chernivtsi has a rich history of Yiddish and German-speaking Jews. Poets like Rose Ausländer and Paul Celan were born here. At the same time, the city was also heavily influenced by Ukrainians, Germans, Poles and other nationalities.During the Holocaust, much of the city's Jewish population were massacred by Nazi German soldiers and allied Romanian troops, or deported to concentration camps. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of the survivors and their families emigrated to Israel.Today, no one knows the exact number of Jews remaining in Chernivtsi, but before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the number was estimated to be just a few hundred.""Sometime after the millennium, there were still 2,000 practicing Jews here,"" says Lev Kleiman, head of the city's Aviv congregation. It's one of several places of worship for Jewish people in the city. ""Many left after that. Now there are probably about 2,000 Jews living here, thanks to the many refugees who have arrived from Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa. Our congregation has around 200 members. That's almost twice as many as before the invasion.""Kleiman says that people like Chernivtsi because it's quiet, beautiful, and not too big. The city's rich history shaped by diverse ethnicities means more Russian is spoken there than in other parts of Ukraine. ""That's why a lot of Russian-speaking Jews from eastern and southern Ukraine feel at home.""Fascism accusations ""completely absurd""Lev Kleiman was born in Chernivtsi. The 37-year-old marketing expert is friendly and open. He sees himself and his family staying in the city long-term. Kleiman says the city has been lucky so far because it hasn't experienced any major bombing attacks. That might be because there's little military activity or important infrastructure here that could potentially be targeted and destroyed by Russia. Chernivtsi's close proximity to Romania, a NATO member, may also be one reason why the city has yet to be attacked.Kleiman also emphasizes that there are no conflicts among the city's different Jewish congregations. They help each other, particularly when it comes to caring for refugees, he says. Asked about Nazis in Ukraine, Kleiman simply shakes his head.""Russia's claims about Nazis ruling Ukraine are completely absurd,"" he says. ""We have a Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He doesn't go to the synagogue, but still! People can walk around wearing a kippah in Chernivtsi without worrying and without any trouble. No one even looks twice at someone for doing so. How can conditions like these be called fascist?""When the discussion turns to the future of the Jewish community, Kleiman remains silent for a long time. Then he responds with a famous saying: ""If you want to hear God laugh, tell him your plans.""He says planning more than two weeks in advance is impossible in Ukraine at the moment. ""We'll think about what tomorrow will bring tomorrow,"" Kleiman says with a smile.Viktoria Maksymovych and Oleg Krassnyi also don't know what the future has in store for them. They still haven't been able to find work in Chernivtsi and they are living from their savings.In the summer of 2022, Viktoria worked for several months as a volunteer in Romania, where she helped refugees from Ukraine. The couple spends a great deal of time with the local Jewish community, whether it's on the Sabbath or on Jewish holidays. They also sometimes just cook and make music together with other Jews, or engage in discussions with them about the Jewish faith. Victoria and Oleg say Chernivtsi's Aviv community has become their new family. ""It's like being taken in by family members we haven't seen for ages,"" say Viktoria and Oleg. ""The community is a great source of psychological support.""The cake on the table in Viktoria and Oleg's kitchen is still uneaten. Viktoria and Oleg aren't full of laughter, but they don't seem bitter either. Smiles flash across their faces, tinged with melancholy.After a while, Viktoria speaks: ""This war is a reminder that you can lose everything from one day to the next,"" she says. ""It just isn't worth chasing after material things. It's also a reminder of how important family, friends and life itself really are. The worst part is that Russia has annihilated our past, and we don't have a future. So for us, the future is now.""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/03,,

He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter.The carriages were thrown of the track and with several being engulfed in flames.Greece's main railworkers union said it has been ""sounding alarm bells for so many years, but it has never been taken seriously.""The union wants to meet with the new transport minister, who was appointed after the crash, to prevent such an accident happening again.The government has declared three days of mourning.Family members of the victims had gathered outside the hospital in Larissa on Thursday, looking for answers. Their anger was directed toward the government who they blame for years of neglect.Thousands took to the streets in Athens and Thessaloniki on Thursday evening, protesting the unsafe state of the country's rail network.Greece's protest tradition of violent clashes with the police reared its head as some protesters threw Molotov cocktails.Fresh protests were called for Friday, with the support of left-wing party Syriza, under the slogans ""We mourn our dead"" and ""We demand the truth.""ab/nm (dpa, Reuters)",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826543,Taiwan's Nantou prepares for legislative by-election on Saturday,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Voters in Nantou County’s second district will go to the polls on Saturday (March 4) to elect a new representative to the Legislative Yuan.The by-election is being held after Hsu Shu-hua (許淑華) was elected as the chief executive of Nantou County in late 2022. Hsu, a member of the KMT, was elected as a legislator in a 2015 by-election, and vacated the seat to take her new position as county executive.The two primary candidates vying for office in Saturday’s election are Tsai Pei-hui (蔡培慧), representing the DPP, and Lin Ming-chen (林明溱), who hopes to hold on to the seat for the KMT.Lin was the previous executive of Nantou County, having served from 2014 to 2022 until Hsu’s election to the office. Lin also has experience as the legislator for Nantou’s second district. He was elected in 2008 when the constituency was formed and served until he was elected county executive in 2014.Tsai also has experience as a member of the Legislative Yuan, having served from 2016 to 2020. As a legislator who was nominated by the DPP based on proportional representation, she did not represent a specific district. However, Tsai previously campaigned in Nantou's first district for a legislative seat in 2016. In that election, she lost to the KMT’s Ma Wen-chun (馬文君) who has held the seat since 2009.On Thursday (March 2), Lin received an endorsement from Foxconn founder Terry Gou (郭台銘). Touting Gou's endorsement and his previous experience in office representing Nantou, Lin has expressed confidence that he will be re-elected to his former office.President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and other notable DPP politicians made their way to Nantou on Friday (Mar. 3) to drum up support for Tsai Pei-hui on the eve of the election.Since the two current legislative constituencies in Nantou were established in 2008, the county has never been represented in the Legislative Yuan by members of the DPP. In previous legislative elections, the KMT has taken about 55% of the vote share on average in both of Nantou’s two districts, with the DPP taking between 40% and 46%.While the DPP hopes that Tsai can gain the confidence and support of people in Nantou in this year’s by-election, the KMT is eager to hold onto the legislative seat in what it considers a reliably blue county.Despite the KMT’s confidence after their strong showing in last year’s municipal elections, Saturday’s by-election will not change the DPP’s majority in the Legislative Yuan.",2023/03/03,555,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826560,"Infineon to acquire GaN Systems, strengthening its GaN portfolio and further reinforcing its global leadership in Power Systems","MUNICH, GERMANY AND OTTAWA, CANADA -  Media OutReach - 3 March 2023 - Infineon Technologies AG (FSE: IFX / OTCQX: IFNNY) and GaN Systems Inc. (""GaN Systems"") announced that the companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Infineon will acquire GaN Systems for US$830 million. GaN Systems is a global technology leader in the development of GaN-based solutions for power conversion. The company is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada, and has more than 200 employees.   ""GaN technology is paving the way for more energy-efficient and CO2-saving solutions that support decarbonization. Adoption in applications like mobile charging, data center power supplies, residential solar inverters, and onboard chargers for electric vehicles is at the tipping point, leading to a dynamic market growth,"" said Jochen Hanebeck, CEO of Infineon. ""The planned acquisition of GaN Systems will significantly accelerate our GaN roadmap, based on unmatched R&D resources, application understanding and customer project pipeline. Following our strategy, the combination will further strengthen Infineon's leadership in Power Systems through mastery of all relevant power technologies, be it on silicon, silicon carbide or gallium nitride.""   Jim Witham, CEO of GaN Systems, said: ""The GaN Systems team is excited about teaming up with Infineon to create highly differentiating customer offerings, based on bringing together complementary strengths. With our joint expertise in providing superior solutions, we will optimally leverage the potential of GaN. Combining GaN Systems' foundry corridors with Infineon's in-house manufacturing capacity enables maximum growth capability to serve the accelerating adoption of GaN in a wide range of our target markets. I am very proud of what GaN Systems has accomplished so far and cannot wait to help write the next chapter together with Infineon. As an integrated device manufacturer with a broad technology capability, Infineon enables us to unleash our full potential.""   As a wide bandgap material, GaN offers customer value by higher power density, higher efficiency, and size reductions, especially at higher switching frequencies. These properties enable energy savings and smaller form factors, making GaN suited for a wide range of applications. By 2027, market analysts expect the GaN revenue for power applications to grow by 56% CAGR to approx. US$2 billion (source: Yole, Compound Semiconductor Market Monitor-Module I Q4 2022). As such, GaN is becoming a key material for power semiconductors, alongside silicon and silicon-carbide, and coupled with new topologies, such as Hybrid Flyback and multi-level implementations. In February 2022, Infineon announced doubling down on wide bandgap by investing more than €2 billion in a new frontend fab in Kulim, Malaysia, strengthening its market position. The first wafers will leave the fab in the second half of 2024, adding to Infineon's existing wide bandgap manufacturing capacities in Villach, Austria.   The planned acquisition of GaN Systems in an all-cash transaction will be funded from existing liquidity. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.      Hashtag: #Infineon #GaN #semiconductor #acquisition

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826633,DW speaks with Nobel laureate Maria Ressa,,2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826634,Love songs by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,"This episode of DW Festival Concert combines Mozart arias with Alban Berg's ""Lyric Suite.""Soprano Anna Prohaska and the Hamburg-based Ensemble Resonanz collaborated on this program. The conductor of today's show, Italian Riccardo Minasi, is recognized as a Mozart expert.Anna Prohaska is one of the most exciting young singers in European opera today, and she brought an unusual and special program to the 2022 Beethoven Festival in Bonn.Prohaska's career started quite early. At 18, she made her debut at the Komische Oper Berlin as Flora in Benjamin Britten's opera ""The Turn of the Screw."" Then at 23, she joined the Berlin State Opera as a permanent ensemble member. Her debut at the Salzburg Festival in 2009 cemented her reputation as one of today's preeminent interpreters of Mozart.And we're going to hear her perform his music in this show, starting with the well-known recitative and aria from Mozart's legendary opera, ""The Marriage of Figaro. It tells the story of Susanna and Figaro, who are servants to Count and Countess Almaviva and who are getting married. The count tries to seduce Susanna, an act that angers Figaro.In this recording, we'll hear Prohaska sing ""Giunse al fin il momento…Deh vieni non tardar,"" or ""The moment has finally arrived…come, don't delay."" In the opera, it is sung by the chambermaid Susanna.In that aria from the opera's final act, the chambermaid Susanna is dressed up as the countess, who she serves, in an attempt to expose the count's inappropriate lustful advances toward her. But Susanna's newlywed husband, Figaro, is also listening in on her, and she knows this. So what sounds like a simple, beautiful love song is actually quite complex.After the first aria, we'll listen to the first three movements from Alban Berg's ""Lyric Suite."" The philosopher Theodor Adorno even once described Berg's piece as a ""hidden opera.""  This secret story of Berg's composition was only brought to light in 1977, when the American music researcher George Perle discovered a pocket score of the work that had written on it, ""to Hanna Fuchs.""Berg met Hanna in May 1925 and fell madly in love with her. He began composing the Lyric Suite in September that same year and eventually finished it just over a year later. Originally composed for string quartet, Berg considered the piece to be ""a small monument to a great love.""The suite, which we'll hear arranged for string orchestra, was primarily composed according to the 12-tone system, which means it lacks a tonal center, with every note being given equal weight. However, various reoccurring elements are written in B and F Major. This is a sort of secret code for Hanna's name, since the note B in German musical notation is called H. So that's actually H and F major: Hanna Fuchs.Berg's ""Lyric Suite"" is followed directly by soprano Anna Prohaska singing the aria ""Non piu di fiori,"" or ""No more flowers,"" from Mozart's opera, ""La Clemenza di Tito,"" or ""The Clemency of Titus."" It is sung by the character Vitellia, the daughter of a deposed emperor.She then follows up with another Mozart aria, which is not from an opera. It is called ""Ch'io mi scordi di te?"" or ""Will I forget you?""Alban Berg's fourth, fifth and sixth movements from his ""Lyric Suite,"" which follow Prohaska's arias, complement this melancholy-romantic mood. The fourth movement, ""adagio appassionato,"" bears the title ""Days after"" and the fifth movement is entitled, ""The fears and torture that now come."" This is a ""scherzo"" in five parts that expresses the madness caused by unfulfilled love. Things don't sound so rosy anymore.The sixth and final movement, the ""largo desolato,"" expresses losing the will to live. Over the notes in the score, Berg penned the poem ""De profundis clamavi"" by French writer Charles Baudelaire. It begins: ""Out of darkest night sounds my call to you, my one and only."" This text isn't always performed, but we'll be treated to Anna Prohaska singing this part in a German translation by Stefan George.Immediately after that, we'll hear Prohaska sing another Mozart aria: ""Come scoglio,"" or ""Like a rock,"" Fiordiligi's famous aria from the opera ""Cosi fan tutte,"" or ""They're all like that."" The giant interval leaps represent a rocky cliff in a stormy sea, a symbol of steadiness and loyalty,We're going to end today with their recording of Mozart's Symphony 41, the ""Jupiter"" Symphony. It was Mozart's last symphony, and it's the last piece in today's show.Thanks to sound engineer Thomas Schmidt and producer Anastassia Boutsko, and thanks to you for listening.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826635,Cambodia: Is Kem Sokha sentence a step toward tyranny?,"Cambodian opposition leader Kem Sokha was sentenced to 27 years of house arrest by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court on Friday on charges of conspiring with foreign powers to incite a ""color revolution"" in the country.The 69-year-old was arrested for alleged treason in September 2017, just months before his CNRP, the country's only viable opposition party, was forcibly dissolved by the authorities on the accusations of plotting a US-backed coup.During the three-year trial, prosecutors appeared to rely primarily on a short two-minute extract of a speech Kem gave in Australia in 2013 in which he thanked the US for supporting him since the 1990s.Kem asserts that he was merely talking about the financial backing the US and other foreign lenders gave to the human rights organizations he helped to found.""It was obvious from the start that the charges against Kem Sokha were nothing but a politically motivated ploy by Prime Minister Hun Sen to sideline Cambodia's major opposition leader and eliminate the country's democratic system,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, in a statement.The move against Kem ""isn't just about destroying his political party, but about squashing any hope that there can be a genuine general election in July.""Following the CNRP's dissolution in 2017, Prime Minister Hun Sen's long-ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) went on to construct a de facto one-party state after winning all National Assembly seats at the 2018 general election. Most opposition figures have either fled the country or have been imprisoned.Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985, plans to soon hand over power to his eldest son and current military chief Hun Manet, who was nominated as his successor by the ruling CPP in late 2021.Analysts had expected courts to convict Kem. In addition being banned from politics and voting indefinitely, the opposition leader will not be able to meet anyone except his family members. His lawyer, Ang Udom, said he will appeal the verdict.""This verdict is an unmistakable warning to opposition groups months before national elections,"" Amnesty International's deputy regional director, Ming Yu Hah, said in a statement.A number of officials from the Candlelight Party — now the country's largest opposition group — have been hit with costly fines by the courts for allegedly defaming the ruling CPP.Other opposition politicians have quit their parties or defected to the ruling CPP to avoid legal prosecution from the authorities.In early February, Hun Sen ordered the authorities to close down Voice of Democracy, one of the last independent news outlets, over claims it had defamed his son and de facto military leader Hun Manet.In recent days, Hun Sen has claimed that new elements in the country are plotting a foreign-backed ""color revolution"" — a spurious charge. This week he alleged that the CIA had sent spies to foment trouble in Phnom Penh.""The United States is deeply troubled by the conviction of respected political leader Kem Sokha,"" the outgoing US Ambassador to Phnom Penh, W. Patrick Murphy, said in a statement on Friday morning.""The multi-year process to silence Kem Sokha based on a fabricated conspiracy is a miscarriage of justice,"" he added.The UK Embassy in Cambodia tweeted that ""the handling and outcome of this case is deeply concerning and will further damage Cambodia's image. As we consider the implications, my thoughts are with Kem Sokha's family at this distressing time.""At the time of publication, neither the European Union nor individual European embassies in Phnom Penh had issued statements on the verdict.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Phnom Penh late last month and met with Kem Sokha during his visit.""President Steinmeier told me that Germany, the EU, as well as the international community have been monitoring my court case as well as observing how much political freedom I have,"" Kem wrote on Facebook following their meeting.Many pundits believe that Kem could possibly be given a royal pardon after the upcoming general election in July, with the express condition that he retires from all political activity.Such a pardon would need to be requested by Hun Sen, who has a long history of providing amnesty to his opponents once they have been jailed or exiled.Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826640,Revising James Bond novels won't affect their sexist core,"Half a century ago, on April 13, 1953, author Ian Fleming published the first James Bond novel: ""Casino Royale"" introduced the world to British secret agent James Bond, code number 007, who would go on several missions to defeat villains in 14 books that also served as the basis for a popular film franchise.To mark the first novel's 70th anniversary, the James Bond books are to be reissued in revised form. Some outdated racist language and descriptions have been removed, among them the use of the N-word.This was announced by Ian Fleming Publications, the company managing the author's literary estate. ""Some racial words likely to cause great offense now, and detract from a reader's enjoyment, have been altered, while keeping as close as possible to the original text and the period,"" the Fleming family said in a statement published on the website of the company.The decision has triggered controversy in the UK and among fans around the world.Some critics see this as a form of censorship. Meanwhile, others point out that even though references to Black people have been reworded, terms mocking other ethnicities, such as East Asian and Korean characters, remain in the books, as reported by the UK's Independent.The books also include a disclaimer saying that the contents may contain expressions and attitudes that a modern audience could find offensive.The revisions have avoided tackling sexist and homophobic terms and descriptions, however, which the novels retain, including the ""sweet tang of rape,""  and ""blithering women,"" while homosexuality is referred to as a ""stubborn disability,"" as the UK's Daily Telegraph reports.One scene in a striptease club has been slightly revised, but altogether, it would be impossible to change Bond's sexist attitude, which remains central to the character. As Sam Barsanti wrote for culture website AV Club, ""editing that stuff out of the James Bond series might make them structurally unsound.""For Australian author Clementine Ford, who has written on sexism in the Bond universe, the goal of retroactively erasing the racism of the Bond universe is ""to ensure Bond remains both admirable and popular in a modern climate,"" she told Time magazine. In that context, ""one has to ask why sexism and the dehumanization of women is not considered anathema to Bond's appeal, but central to it,"" she added.James Bond ""has a history of raping, objectifying, and using women. And Bond movies often glamorized that behavior. The character taught generations of men that misogyny was cool,"" wrote Eliana Dockterman in 2021, in her Time magazine review of ""No Time to Die,"" the latest 007 movie starring Hollywood actor Daniel Craig.This is not set to change in the revised editions of the books.Ford points out that this creates an implausible character: ""Consent is an absent concept in Bond's world, but somehow audiences, and women in particular, are expected to embrace this as part of his cultural appeal,"" she told the Independent. ""Are we to have a Bond who rails against the scourge of white supremacy, yet somehow overlooks the impact misogyny has on women?""The revisions made to Fleming's novels follow a heated debate about revised editions of works by beloved British children's author Roald Dahl. Dahl's novels have recently been revised with the assistance of ""sensitivity readers,"" who pointed out content that could offend or be construed as harmful.For example, a woman in Dahl's books will no longer be referred to as ""fat"" but as ""enormous."" Author  Salman Rushdie, who fell victim to a knife attack in 2022 for speaking out for freedom of expression, called the changes ""absurd censorship.""Even the British Queen Consort intervened: Camilla, wife of King Charles III, called on authors ""to remain true to your calling, unimpeded by those who may wish to curb the freedom of your expression or your imagination.""In the case of Roald Dahl, and prompted by the Queen Consort's comments, the publisher rowed back: Publisher Penguin Random House will now put out two editions, one of which will contain the original text.Ian Fleming Publications, on the other hand, has called on readers to grab a copy of the revised editions and ""make up your own minds.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826641,Kashmiri skiers defy conflict to reclaim winter paradise,"The route to Gulmarg in Kashmir is lined with barbed wire, with armed soldiers keeping watch from their bunkers. The resort town is located just a few kilometres (miles) from the Pakistani border, the signs of conflict between India and Pakistan are everywhere, and security restrictions seem to be more stringent than ever.And yet, Ahmed Dev, a 30-year-old local skier from Srinagar, says Gulmarg is his second home in the wintertime. Growing up during the peak years of the Kashmir conflict, Dev felt that the military's heavy presence had robbed him of enjoying the pristine mountains. Due to restrictions prompted by political unrest in 2019 and then the global pandemic, Dev was forced to stay indoors for nearly two years. As restrictions lifted, Dev turned to skiing as a way to find relief from lockdowns. He now participates in ski tournaments each year. He is eager to share his love for the sport that he credits with saving his life.""For me skiing is a kind of therapy,"" Dev told DW. ""As a child I always wanted to be part of the mountain slopes. These slopes were home to me and I always felt they belonged to us.""Other young Kashmiris are also embracing their love for skiing. Sabiya Nabi,  a 24-year-old girl living in the Gulmarg village, says skiing for her means freedom.""I faced my own set of challenges and hurdles in this male-dominated sport but my family supported me through it. Now skiing has given me independence and sense of freedom. I can't imagine and live without it anymore,"" she told DW. For many young women like Sabiya, skiing on snowy slopes, wearing sport clothing that does not conform to societal norms, and competing alongside boys is a liberating experience.These Kashmiri skiers don't have the easiest of lives. Many of them have never known a time without soldiers patrolling their streets. Many struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues. Some have resorted to drugs. After years of lockdowns imposed by the military and health officials, skiing has become a ray of hope.Western tourists have been skiing in Gulmarg for decades. Locals tended to watch from a distance. In recent years, however, intensive ski training programs organised by Kashmiri skiers have spurred interest among local children and youth, and they are now enthusiastically taking to the slopes.Local ski guide Waseem Raja has been training both young Kashmiris and tourists for the last ten years. The choice of profession for Raja was not only a matter of money, but was also driven by his passion for the sport. Raja grew up watching his father as a ski guide. His father, an ex-militant, gave up arms to work as a ski guide and accompanied foreign tourists to ski destinations for many years. Now Waseem is following in his father's footsteps out of his own love for the mountains.""Five years ago, it was only foreigners who would come to Kashmir and ski on these mountains. But now things have changed. We see young Kashmiri everywhere on these slopes and they are the ones who lead skiing in Gulmarg. Several locals have also set up adventure shops in this area,"" Waseem told DW.Everyday Waseem takes new groups of skiers to the mountain slopes. After an hour of skiing, they rest in a mountain hut huddled around a wood stove. During the break, Waseem interacts with the young skiers and cautions them about potential risks, as some slopes have experienced heavy avalanches. The latest has left two Polish tourists dead.For many in the valley, Gulmarg in the winter has become the only place offering a respite from the decades-long conflict.Kashmir's first winter Olympic Skier, Gul Mustafa Dev, wishes more young people would have joined the sport back in his day. During the 1990s, Mustafa and his friends could hardly convince anyone to take up skiing, and the athlete still remembers how tough it was to gain access to equipment and to train. He believes that the war in the valley discouraged and deprived many talented skiers from follow their passion. As things change in Gulmarg, the 59-year-old Olympian has high hopes for the next generation of athletes.""My dream is to see more Kashmiris joining this sport and representing the Valley in Olympics,"" he told DW.Edited by: Darko Janjevic",2023/03/03,,

The dual political sessions are expected to endorse a list of top officials for key government positions, pass a plan to overhaul several government agencies and institutions, while also formally confirming Chinese leader Xi Jinping's precedent-busting third term in power.Typically called the ""two sessions,"" the meetings in Beijing include the gathering of China's rubber-stamp parliament — the National People's Congress (NPC) — and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which is an advisory body.This year's two sessions, which typically last about two weeks, mark the start of a new five-year term for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and experts say delegates are expected to implement key policies laid out by the 20th Party Congress last October.""We need to see the NPC as a continuity of the Party Congress, and it's sort of an implementation of key congress decisions,"" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.During October's Party Congress, Xi cemented his unprecedented third term as the general secretary of the CCP, while further consolidating his power base by eliminating political rivals and appointing loyalists to the Politburo Standing Committee, the CCP's top decision-making organ. This weekend will see him be declared China's president for the third time.Some analysts say they expect the theme of centralizing power to dominate the meeting.""While the two sessions were mainly about personnel appointment and institutional reform in the past, the fact that the CCP has determined the leaders of several key government agencies prior to the meetings means this year's focus will be on institutional reform,"" said Hsin-Hsien Wang, an expert on Chinese politics at National Cheng-Chi University in Taiwan.""Regardless of how the CCP decides to reform key government institutions, it's clear that centralizing power to the party will be the main theme,"" he told DW.""This move is mainly caused by the situation defined in the communique of the second plenum session of the CCP, which emphasized that China is facing a complicated international environment and the difficult task of kicking off reform while maintaining stability at home.""Apart from reforming top party and government institutions, some analysts expect the party to consolidate Xi's leadership still further by potentially incorporating political slogans into the Chinese constitution.""We are likely to see the incorporation of 'the two safeguards,' meaning safeguarding the core status of Xi Jinping within the party and safeguarding the centralized authority of the party, into the constitution,"" said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University.""This is a continuation of what we saw five years ago when they abolished the term limits. This time around, they are making inroads in reflecting not just the party's leadership over the country but more specifically, Xi Jinping's unique role in Chinese history,"" he told DW.Since the CCP's high-ranking officials are all Xi loyalists, experts say the final lineup, due to be revealed after the two sessions, will show that having a strong relationship with Xi is key. A track record of loyalty will determine who is assigned to positions of greater importance.""Even in an era when he has achieved winner-takes-all politics, Xi still isn't completely comfortable about the loyalty of the people around him,"" said Sung.Chinese politics expert Wang added that with the CCP's power so concentrated on Xi, he now lacks the ""firewalls"" that used to exist to shield him from any unexpected crisis. It's a situation that could ultimately prove dangerous for the president.""In the past, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang would always help shoulder the responsibility when things happened, but when that layer of protection is gone, everything will be directed at Xi and the party's top leadership,"" Wang told DW.Former Shanghai party chief Li Qiang is expected to become China's new premier, while He Lifeng — in charge of the National Development and Reform Commission — is poised to become the new vice premier in charge of all economic affairs. ""He is likely taking over the current position occupied by Liu He,"" said Alfred Wu from NUS.Following the pandemic, which seriously impactedChina's economic growthover the past three years, some experts expect China's GDP growth target for 2023 to be between 5.5% and 6%.""I expect the target to be pretty high, because China's economy is rebounding,"" said Iris Pang, the chief economist for Greater China at ING.""There must be some substance to support the GDP number. While I'm not concerned about consumption, I have more hesitance towards infrastructure investment, because the issuance of local governments' special bonds has been a lot less this year so far,"" she told DW.""That makes me think perhaps infrastructure investment may not be a very good growth engine this year.""On top of that, the ongoing technology war between the United States and China will likely push Beijing to highlight the importance of technology self-reliance during the two sessions, according to Pang.""China has been reacting quite slowly and I think there must be some precise policy regarding how to tackle the problem during the two sessions,"" Pang said.""There must be investment and personnel support. That's not easy at all.""Edited by: Keith Walker",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826664,Turkey's opposition split over Erdogan challenger,"Turkey's right-wing nationalist Good Party (IYI) withdrew from the country's opposition alliance Friday over the selection of Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu as the candidate to challenge incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in upcoming national elections.The split comes just weeks before Turkish voters will head to the polls. Erdogan — who has been in power for two decades — this week said the vote, originally scheduled for June, would be staged on May 14.Meral Aksener, who leads IYI, the second largest party in the opposition alliance, said IYI would not ""bow down"" to accept what they felt was a weak candidate, instead putting forth the names of the mayors of Istanbul and Ankara as preferable.In making her argument, Aksener cited polls showing that both Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu would beat Erdogan handily.She and the other party leaders had agreed to Kilicdaroglu's candidacy Thursday, with Aksener herself announcing, ""We have reached a common understanding concerning our joint presidential candidate."" Yet she revised her stance after long consultations at IYI party headquarters in Ankara Thursday night and Friday morning.""I'm sorry to say that, as of yesterday, the Table of Six has lost its ability to reflect the will of the nation in its decisions,"" said Aksener.""It is no longer a platform through which potential candidates can be discussed,"" she said, ""but a table that works to rubber-stamp a single candidate.""Though Kemal Kilicdaroglu has made his candidacy clear for months, voters have little faith in him as he has failed to win a single election in 13 years of leading the CHP. The mayors, on the other hand, wrested office in two Erdogan strongholds in Turkey's 2019 municipal elections.Despite the untimely split, Kilicdaroglu seemed to take the issue in stride, saying, ""don't worry, all the pieces will fall into place.""Still, Kilicdaroglu's candidacy could play into Erdogan's hands at a time when observers saw him potentially weakened.His chances of overcoming voter misgivings about his performance — with an economy in the doldrums and public opinion shifting away from him for his response to the recent devastating earthquakes that killed more than 45,000 people in Turkey — would seem boosted by the prospect of a split opposition putting forth multiple candidates.js/rc (AP, Reuters)",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826665,Germany steps up fight against child obesity,"A chocolate candy with arms, legs, and oversized glasses hurtles down a rollercoaster. A voice says, ""It tastes like fun!"" before it goes on to talk excitedly about sweepstakes to win free admission to an amusement park. This is a standard commercial for candy on German TV, aired in the afternoon.If the Green Party's Cem Özdemir has his way, this ad will soon be banned. The German food minister wants no advertising for unhealthy foods aimed at children to appear between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. on TV, radio, and the internet. This would also apply to influencers, for example on YouTube or TikTok. On top of that, billboards advertising sweet, fatty, or salty foods in bright colors are to be banned near schools, kindergartens, and playgrounds.""We must ensure that children can grow up healthier,"" Özdemir said when presenting his plans in Berlin earlier this week. This is crucial in the fight against obesity and other diet-related diseases, he argued, before adding that ads for unhealthy foods have been shown to influence children's eating behavior.But representatives of the German food industry dispute the idea that a ban on advertising can prevent obesity, among them Carsten Bernoth, managing director of the Association of the German Confectionery Industry (BDSI). As he takes a seat at the table in the BDSI conference room in Bonn for a DW interview, there's no plate with cookies on the table, or any snacks, just a few water bottles.A ban on advertising will not lead children to eat less candy, says Bernoth, and yet: ""Advertising is essential in a market economy. It enables you to take a market share from other competitors."" German candy manufacturers reported sales of around €14 billion ($14.8 billion) last year, and they spend about one billion on advertising.Bernoth fears that Özdemir's plans would lead to an almost complete ban on advertising for his industry, after all, commercials intended for adults but would potentially be seen by children could also fall under the planned ban. ""We are arguing that the consumer has a free choice,"" Bernoth says. ""They need to be able to make an informed choice. Information and education are key here. And it's not up to the state to make any stipulations here, or to postulate any bans.""So could an advertising ban protect children from unhealthy food or not? Anette Buyken, professor of public health nutrition at Paderborn University, says that the data is not complete. ""The main problem is that there are very few countries that implement such measures and really follow up with good effectiveness research,"" she told DW.But Buyken cites Chile as a positive example. There, the world's strictest rules for candy advertising aimed at children were put in place in 2016. In addition to a ban on advertising, unhealthy foods must also be labeled with warnings, similar to those for cigarettes. Chilean researchers then immediately collected data on the effectiveness of the measures and found they really changed people's choices, Buyken said.Now they are investigating whether this change also improves health in the long term. The focus, he says, shouldn't just be on obesity. ""The most important thing is to get started, observe, and then adjust if necessary,"" Buyken added. ""We have enough evidence, from Chile and other countries, on how to address something like this.""In many countries, the number of overweight children and adolescents has risen sharply in recent decades. About one in six children in Germany is now overweight or even obese, according to Germany's public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Among 11- to 13-year-olds, the figure is even one in five.The parents of such children often call Andrea Gerschlauer and ask for help. A nutritionist since 2018, her certificate from the German Society for Nutrition (DGE) is hanging on the wall of her consultation room in her practice in Bonn. In the corner of the room, there's a toy kitchen where young children can play, and on a magnetic board, there's an image of the nutrition pyramid: Plenty of unsweetened drinks as a base, lots of vegetables, fruit, whole grain products and potatoes on top, moderate amounts of milk, meat, fish and egg, and right at the top: a small measure of sweets and fatty foods.Gerschlauer places a beverage carton on the table, marketed as a ""thirst quencher,"" with bright fruit on the packaging. ""Tell me how many sugar cubes are in here,"" she asks, before answering the question herself: ""18! That won't quench your thirst. Products like these really con consumers.""Gerschlauer hopes the ban on advertising unhealthy foods in Germany will come soon. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, some children have gained a lot of weight in a relatively short period of time, she argued: ""I see a connection with the fact that children have been watching more television. There's a lot of snacking when you watch TV. And when you add the effect of commercials to that, it's very hard for kids to break free from the thought of sweets."" Children from socially deprived families are said to be particularly affected by this trend.Gerschlauer distinguishes between the internal and external factors that lead to decisions about whether or not to eat something. The biggest factor is the child's family - parents are role models and are responsible for everyday food selection. ""But I am convinced that small children's brains are especially influenced by advertising. I myselfcan still recite advertising slogans from my childhood — and that was 50 years ago,"" said Gerschlauer. ""That sticks.""Gerschlauer wants new measures to go even further than a ban on advertising. She advocates higher taxes on unhealthy foods — modeled on the taxes for tobacco and cigarettes — or a reduction in VAT for foods that are beneficial to health, such as vegetables, fruit, and whole grains. ""Otherwise, we're going to have a huge problem in 30 years' time,"" she says. ""When these overweight children grow up, they are at risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and other diet-related diseases. There's a lot of suffering and high costs coming.""But Özdemir's advertising ban is already likely to have a hard time getting through parliament, or even though the coalition government. In their coalition agreement from 2021, the three parties agreed to ban advertising for unhealthy things ""in broadcasting and media formats for under 14-year-olds."" But now the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) are digging in their heels. Özdemir's proposal means ""more bureaucracy, more bans, less innovation and less quality of life,"" Gero Hocker, agricultural policy spokesman for the FDP in the Bundestag, posted on Twitter this week.And what do children and young people in Germany think about the planned advertising ban? If you ask children of daycare and elementary school age, you might get the feeling you're meeting a hardcore sugar lobby. But many teenagers aren't keen on the ban either.Like the teenagers enjoying their lunch break in Bonn's Südstadt district on this sunny day in March: They leave the schoolyard in a throng, cross the street to the supermarket and after a while, they return, holding chocolate cookies, canned lemonade, chips, and sweet pastries.Noah, 18, follows the group, carrying no candy. ""I think advertising for unhealthy things should be banned,"" he tells DW. ""You just have to look at how many people are overweight these days - I see it every day at school."" The young man in the black jacket is in a hurry; his class is about to start. ""I'm an athlete. I try to give up sweets,"" he says. And those chocolate candies from the commercials? They may taste like fun, but they're made up of 52% sugar, he points out.This article was originally written in German.",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826666,Russian chess queen Kosteniuk switches to Swiss federation,"Russian chess grandmaster Alexandra Kosteniuk, a former women's world champion and one of the top 10 women players in the world, completed her switch to the Swiss chess federation on Friday, she said on Twitter.She had been seeking to change federations in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has had a severe impact on chess, given the huge influence of Russian and Ukrainian players.""Now it's official. Representing Switzerland since 03.03.2023,"" Kosteniuk wrote, embedding an image of her new player profile page on the Swiss chess federation website.Already a dual Russian-Swiss citizen, 38-year-old Kosteniuk and the Swiss federation had announced in January that the 12th women's world champion would be making the switch starting in 2024.However, a recent change in rules by world chess governing body FIDE has facilitated an earlier move.In normal cases, players who switch federations are expected to pay a fee in compensation to the federation they are leaving.FIDE recently decided that it would waive this fee for Russian players — but provided they were joining another European federation — who wanted out as a result of President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Typical waiting periods were also waived.""Players previous belonging to the CFR [Russian chess federation] will be allowed to represent their new federation with immediate effect, from the next day of submitting their application, without any restrictions. All transfer fees, to FIDE or CFR, are waived,"" FIDE said when announcing the decision late last month.Kosteniuk became women's world champion in 2008 and lost the title in 2010, but she's still among the top 10 women players by rating and was the overall winner of last month's Munich International Tournament, part of the FIDE Women's Grand Prix series.Chess has taken a similar approach to sports like tennis but a milder one than sports like football responding to the invasion of Ukraine.Russia as a country is banned from international team tournaments, but individual Russian players are still eligible to compete in all competitions under a neutral flag.Russia's chess federation also recently moved from the European group of federations to the Asian group, after the European Chess Union suspended the Russian and Belarussian chess federations in the aftermath of the war. This will eventually mean Russian players are no longer eligible for Europe-only tournaments, but it will likely also pave the way for Russian teams to return to international team competition.""We are the first sport to see its governing body facilitate its federation in Russia to evade sanctions by switching to Asia,"" European Chess Union vice president Malcolm Pein said of the decision. World governing body FIDE's ties to Russia are well documented and close.Several high profile Russian grandmasters have left the country since the war broke out, and others who have stayed have also made critical comments. Those who have left include Dmitry Andreikin, Vladimir Fedoseev, Alexander Predke and Alexey Sarana.Forty-four top Russian players published an open letter to President Vladimir Putin calling on him to stop the war in April last year, Kosteniuk among them, as well as Russian world championship hopeful Ian Neopmniachtchi.Kosteniuk told the chess.com website late last year that she was ""completely in shock"" when the war broke out.""In Russia there are people who like to repeat that Russia 'has never attacked anyone in history,'"" she said. ""I used to gladly believe such stories, that Russia had never invaded other countries, but unfortunately, it's not true. Of course, at the beginning of the year, we were following the news, and there were rumors about a possible invasion, but we refused to believe for a single moment these stories. That's why we were so shocked when it actually happened.""Kosteniuk is also an ambassador for the Monaco-based charity Peace and Sport, which says she had launched several programs looking to use chess teaching as a tool for peace, particularly in Colombia and Israel and the Palestinian Territories.Edited by: Richard Connor",2023/03/03,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826678,"Fire at Swiss cheese facility destroys 12,000 wheels of Gruyere","Firefighters in the Swiss canton of Freiburg put out the last embers of a warehouse fire Friday but not after it had destroyed the building and the 12,000 wheels of Gruyere cheese inside.Authorities say the fire broke out in the storage basement of a 5,575 square meter (60,000 square foot) warehouse in Vuisternens-en-Ogoz — roughly 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of Bern — Thursday before spreading to engulf the entire facility.Witnesses claimed hearing explosions as a large cloud of smoke blanketed the area, traffic was rerouted and water service was interrupted into Friday as small fires inaccessible to firemen due to a collapsed roof, continued to burn.Residents were instructed to keep doors and windows closed as well as conserving water before the all clear was later given late Thursday evening.Some 150 firefighters, police and medical personnel were at the scene. Twenty-five individuals were evacuated and seven were treated for possible smoke inhalation. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined.Late Thursday, Freiburg police confirmed the entire building and its contents had been lost and announced an investigation had been launched. Total damages said authorities, could not yet be calculated.A cheesemaker at the scene told the local La Liberte newspaper, ""I guess we lost about 12,000 wheels of Gruyere.""A representative from the Migros Cooperative, which owned half the cheese in the building, said the supply of Gruyere to Migros supermarkets would not be affected.",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826679,Indonesia: Fire at fuel storage station kills several,"A massive fire at a fuel storage station on Friday in the Indonesian capital city Jakarta has killed at least 16 people and injured dozens of others, officials said.The fire broke out at a facility located near a densely populated area in northern Jakarta, forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate their homes.At least 42 people were injured in the fire, according to the Army Chief of Staff Dudung Abdurachman, though numbers in other outlets put the figure at a slightly higher figure of 50.Jakarta's acting governor Heru Budi Hartono told reporters that most of the people injured were suffering from burns and that the government would pay for their treatment.He said three children were among those injured and that they were in a serious condition.The cause of the fire, which broke out at around 8 p.m. local time (1300 GMT/UTC), is yet to be determined.The fuel storage facility is run by state energy company Pertamina, which issued a statement saying it was ""focused on handling the fire and evacuating workers and residents nearby to a safer location.""The fire was finally brought under control and ""extinguished"" several hours after it first broke out, Dudung Abdurachman told reporters.But officials said residents were still being evacuated to a nearby mosque and village.At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines battled the fire, Satriadi Gunawan, the head of Jakarta's fire and rescue department said.""The fire caused several explosions and quickly spread to residential houses,"" he said.Videos broadcast on television showed hundreds of people running in panic as thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky.rm/rc (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/03/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4826680,Ukrainian soldiers carry out risky mortar shell attacks on the front,"""We're facing the enemy,"" explains a Ukrainian soldier with the battle name Kalyna. He points in the direction of Svatove, a town which lies in the Russian-occupied region of Luhansk. ""It's our duty to hold off the enemy and not let them gain more ground in Ukraine.""Kalyna's combat unit is stationed in the east of the Kharkiv region . Though Ukrainian forces freed the area from Russian occupation last September, it remains on the frontline. The Russian army is stationed just three kilometers (1.8 miles) away, in occupied Luhansk.""I never would have thought I'd go to war,"" says Kalyna with a shrug. The small man with a thick beard is from the Lviv region in western Ukraine, where he worked in construction. ""I repaired roofs,"" he recalls, while glancing at bombed-out houses. ""When I look at all of this, I see so much hardship,"" he continues. After the war, Kalyna intends to help repair damaged apartment buildings. ""I've already posted ads in as many places as possible,"" the commander jokes.On the street, a tipsy older man, the only civilian around, recalls that at one point, there were as many as 2,000 people living in this village. Now, it has fewer than 200 residents. The conversation is suddenly interrupted by a whistling sound and explosions. Despite the potential danger, the man takes his time to go home, which hasn't yet been damaged.""The enemy still doesn't intend to push forward in our direction,"" Kalyna tells DW reassuringly. ""There's an artillery battle raging. We're using our artillery to try to keep the enemy at bay, and Russia is using its artillery to try to take ours out."" Kalyna was trained to operate mortar shells. ""The highest caliber weapons are deployed on this section of the frontline. These shells can put soldiers and light armored vehicles out of action.""Kalyna explains that Russian soldiers mostly stay in their lookout posts. ""They have these dugouts that they watch us from. We try to hit them and drive them as far back as possible, so they can't see us anymore.""He explains that Ukrainian reconnaissance teams supply information about the location of such foxholes so that the soldiers can determine where they can best launch their mortar shells from. Then he leads a group of soldiers to one such position. The path to the spot winds through a wooded area with cliffs. When a mortar shell flies through the air, everyone takes cover on the snow-covered ground. The bright sunlight does not help either, as this makes it easier for the Russians to spot the soldiers.The Ukrainian soldiers set up their mortar launchers in front a field that's covered with wilted sunflowers still lingering from last summer. Kalyna gives the order to open fire on the Russian troops, and then there is a slew of deafening explosions in rapid succession. The soldiers turn away, bend down, and cover their ears.One of the soldiers lights a cigarette during a short pause. He hasn't quite finished it when Kalyna orders the men to cease fire. They quickly dash back into the forest before the Russians can figure out their location and return fire.Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian soldiers have to leave their shelter to hop into their vehicle. The dust that falls from their clothes glitters briefly in the setting sun. As they drive onto the street, a Russian mortar shell can be heard exploding behind the vehicle. ""In order to hit the enemy, we have to get very close, which is very dangerous,"" Kalyna says. ""We need large caliber mortars that would allow us to attack from safer positions.""The men are tired after the attack. Nevertheless, Kalyna says with a smile on his face that the exhaustion will be gone in the morning. ""This is just how it is for us in wartime. We have to reclaim what belongs to us.""This article was translated from German.",2023/03/02,157,
