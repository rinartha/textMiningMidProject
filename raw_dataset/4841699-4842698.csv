https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841703,March Madness rout as Lady Vols reach 2nd straight Sweet 16,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee is starting to look a lot more like the dominating Lady Vols of old, especially after a second straight rout to open the NCAA Tournament.Reserves Sara Puckett and Jillian Hollingshead led five Lady Vols in double figures with 13 points apiece as fourth-seeded Tennessee dominated No. 12 seed Toledo 94-47 Monday night to advance to their second straight Sweet 16 in the Seattle 3 Regional.This is the first time since 2015 and 2016 that Tennessee (25-11) has reached consecutive Sweet 16s and the first in coach Kellie Harper's fourth season. The Lady Vols now have reached the Sweet 16 for the 36th time — most for any men's or women's team — as the only program to play in all 41 NCAA Tournaments.“We're so excited to be going back to the Sweet 16, and I'm really proud of our team and how we've played in these first two games,” Harper said. “I think we've played really well from top to bottom, our starters and our bench.”Puckett was 5-of-7, making all three of her 3s. Rickea Jackson and Jasmine Powell each added 12, and Jordan Horston had 10 points and eight rebounds. The Lady Vols were 11-of-21 from 3 (52.4%), one made 3 away from matching their season high. Seven different players made at least one 3.Yet the Lady Vols smothered the quick Rockets, holding them to 29% shooting (18 of 62). Harper said defense set the tone.“To me, the bigger growth is the defensive end and our attention to detail defensively, our aggressiveness, our focus and and really just the belief,” Harper said. ""And that’s where we can win games.”Toledo (29-5) snapped a program record 17-game winning streak and missed out on its first Sweet 16. The Rockets lost for the first time since Jan. 18 at Bowling Green, which was avenged in the Mid-American Conference Tournament championship for their first NCAA Tournament berth since 2017.Rockets coach Tricia Cullop said Tennessee's size, athleticism and length is tough to prepare for in one day. She said they also needed the Lady Vols not to shoot well from 3 because of the size disadvantage.“That didn’t work out so well,” Cullop said. “They were very hot from 3, which made it very difficult for us to match up, because we needed the double team in order to match up on the post.”Quinesha Lockett led Toledo with 19 points.“We really just tried our best to pack it in the paint, and once we did that they was hitting 3s, so really nothing we could do about that,” Lockett said.Tennessee never trailed and improved to 30-3 all-time in the second round and 24-1 on the court named for the late Pat Summitt.The Lady Vols, who won at least 25 games for a 38th season, scored the first three points. Toledo got within 5-4 on a Lockett layup. Then Tennessee took control and led 19-8 after the first quarter.Karoline Striplin knocked down a pair of 3s within the first 50 seconds of the second, and Tennessee hit 6-of-8 beyond the arc in the quarter. The last came from Puckett with 41.7 seconds remaining for their biggest lead yet at 50-21 before going into halftime up 50-22.“We knew what we needed to come in here and do, and we did exactly that,” Puckett said. “We’re not going to let our foot off the gas. That’s a big confidence boost for the team, but also me personally.”The Lady Vols led 72-40 going into the fourth. Then they outscored Toledo 22-7 to finish, not allowing the Rockets to score even a single bucket over the final 6:11.BIG PICTUREToledo: The Rockets head home still looking for the program's first Sweet 16 berth. They are 4-9 all-time in NCAA Tournament play, Cullop will have her leading scorer back in Lockett along with four juniors, including starters Khera Goss, Sammi Mikonowicz and Jessica Cook. ... The Rockets had hoped to use their speed to counter Tennessee's height but were outscored 17-4 on the fast break.Tennessee: The Lady Vols have locked down on defense in the first two games. They held Saint Louis to 50 points in the first round, the fewest they had allowed in this tournament since giving up 46 to Northwestern State on March 22, 2014. Then nearly matched that tournament low in this game as they dominated across the court.According to ESPN, this is just the fourth time a team has won each of its first two games in the tournament by 45 points each. UConn did it in 2001, 2010 and 2016, winning the national title in 2010 and 2016.DOUBLY SWEETWith this win, the Lady Vols joined the men who will play in the East Regional on Thursday night in New York. It's the seventh time in school history both the women and men have reached the regional semifinals and first since 2016.“I will say that right now is a lot of excitement on Rocky Top obviously with our men in the Sweet 16 as well,” Harper said. “It's just a lot of fun, great vibes.”UP NEXTThe Lady Vols get a rematch in the Sweet 16. They lost 59-56 on Dec. 4 to then-No. 9 Virginia Tech as part of the Jimmy V Women's Classic in Knoxville without forward Rickea Jackson. That also was center Tamari Key's last game before blood clots ended her season.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841704,Teacher shot by 6-year-old describes challenging recovery,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Virginia teacher who was shot and wounded by her 6-year-old student said she has had four surgeries and is going through a challenging recovery.Speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 6 shooting, first-grade teacher Abby Zwerner said during an exclusive interview with NBC's Savannah Guthrie that she has some days when she “can't get up out of bed,"" while others she is able to go about her day and make it to appointments.“For going through what I've gone through, I try to stay positive. You know, try to have a positive outlook on what's happened and where my future's heading,” Zwerner said in a portion of the interview that was aired Monday on “NBC Nightly News.”Zwerner was hospitalized for nearly two weeks after being shot in the chest and left hand as she taught her class at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia. The shooting rattled the military shipbuilding community and sent shock waves around the country, with many wondering how a child so young could get access to a gun and shoot his teacher.Zwerner’s attorney, Diane Toscano, told reporters in January that concerned staff at the school had warned administrators three times that the 6-year-old had a gun and was threatening other students in the hours before Zwerner was shot. Toscano said the school administration “was paralyzed by apathy” and didn’t call police, remove the boy from class or lock down the school.In early February, Zwerner’s legal notice of her intent to sue the school district said the boy who shot Zwerner had constantly cursed at staff and teachers, tried to whip students with his belt and once choked another teacher “until she couldn’t breathe.”Two days before the shooting, the boy allegedly “slammed” Zwerner’s cellphone and broke it, leading to a one-day suspension. When the boy returned to her class the following day, he pulled his mother’s 9mm handgun out of his pocket and shot her while she sat at a reading table, the legal notice said.The Newport News School board fired its superintendent in the wake of the shooting. Ebony Parker, an assistant principal who was a primary focus in Zwerner’s intent to sue notice, resigned.Newport News’ top prosecutor said earlier this month that he would not seek charges against the 6-year-old because the child lacked the competency to understand the legal system and what a charge means. But Newport News Commonwealth’s Attorney Howard Gwynn said his office hadn't decided if any adults would be held criminally accountable.The boy used his mother’s legally purchased gun, according to police. James Ellenson, a lawyer for the child’s mother, stated in January that the weapon was secured on a high closet shelf and was locked away.Ellenson said it was unclear how the boy got access to the gun. He also said that the boy “was under a care plan at the school that included his mother or father attending school with him and accompanying him to class every day.”In a statement released through Ellenson, the boy's family said the week of the shooting “was the first week when we were not in class with him. ""“We will regret our absence on this day for the rest of our lives,” the statement said.More of the interview with Zwerner will be aired during the “Today” show Tuesday morning.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841705,2 missing Florida boaters found dead in lake near Legoland,"WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say they recovered the bodies of two boaters Monday afternoon, nearly two days after they went missing following an accident on a central Florida lake near the Legoland theme park.The bodies of Orlando Ortiz, 30, of Winter Haven, and Jeffrey Marrero, 34, of Auburndale, were located in Lake Eloise about 150 yards (meters) apart, according to a Polk County Sheriff's Office news release.Sheriff Grady Judd previously said at a news conference that the two men had jumped into Winter Haven lake to save a third person from their group, a woman, who was struggling in the water. The men became separated from the boat and had not been seen since Saturday evening.The third person, 38-year-old Velcky Velazques, was rescued by sheriff's deputies who had been summoned when a 10-year-old girl on the boat dialed 911 on a cellphone. That child and an 8-year-old girl remained on the boat as it drifted and were rescued safely by deputies aboard a fishing boat, Judd said.The lake, adjacent to Legoland in Winter Haven, was rough on Saturday with 20 mph (32 kph) winds and some whitecaps, Judd said. He added that the weather issues were compounded by inexperience on the part of the boaters, who had rented the vessel for an outing that day.Ortiz was Velazques's boyfriend, and Marrero was the father of the two girls.Winter Haven is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Tampa.Legoland put out a statement Saturday saying the incident “is not connected with us in any way.” It added that a boardwalk at its hotel was used by officials as a command center.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time,” it said.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841706,QB Joshua Dobbs returning to Browns as Watson's backup,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Joshua Dobbs is back with the Browns as a backup.The free agent quarterback, who spent most of last season with Cleveland, agreed Monday to a one-year contract and will be the team's No. 2 quarterback behind Deshaun Watson next season.Dobbs' agent, Mike McCartney, congratulated his client with a post on Twitter. McCartney wrote: “pumped for @josh_dobbs1 agreeing to a 1 year contract with the @Browns.”Financial terms were not immediately available.Dobbs made a great impression with the Browns last season, winning the backup job in training camp. He was the No. 2 QB behind Jacoby Brissett before being waived in November when Watson returned from his 11-game NFL suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy.The Browns explored some other options — Brissett was too expensive to bring back and signed with Washington — before returning to Dobbs because of their familiarity with him. He's got a strong arm and is mobile like Watson, and therefore could keep Cleveland's offense clicking in case of an injury.QB Kellen Mond is also on Cleveland's roster.After he was let go by Cleveland, Dobbs signed with Tennessee and wound up starting the Titans' final two games, losses to Dallas and Jacksonville. Dobbs completed 40 of 68 passes for 411 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.Dobbs was drafted by Pittsburgh in the fourth round in 2017. He spent two seasons with Steelers and appeared in six games.The Browns also signed a pair of special-teamers, giving one-year deals to linebacker Jordan Kunaszyk and cornerback Mike Ford. They should help new special teams coordinator Bubba Ventrone, hired after Mike Priefer was fired last month.___AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841707,Russia to hold UN meeting on Ukraine kids taken to Russia,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia plans to hold an informal meeting of the U.N. Security Council in early April on what it said is “the real situation” of Ukrainian children taken to Russia, an issue that has gained the spotlight following the International Criminal Court’s arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes related to their abduction.Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told a news conference Monday that Russia planned the council meeting long before Friday’s announcement by the ICC. Russia holds the rotating presidency of the council in April.The court said it was seeking Putin’s arrest because he “is allegedly responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of (children) and that of unlawful transfer of (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.”The announcement of the warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, was welcomed by Ukraine as a first step toward accountability by Russia for crimes following its Feb. 14, 2022, invasion. It was dismissed by Moscow, which is not one of the 123 countries that are parties to the court, calling the action “legally void” and “outrageous.”The announcement followed a report Thursday by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine that said there was evidence of the illegal transfer of hundreds of Ukrainian children to Russia.The commission said both parents and children faced many obstacles in establishing contact, with the burden falling primarily on the children, with young children likely unable to make any contact. It concluded that the forced deportations “violate international humanitarian law, and amount to a war crime.”The Ukrainian government claims 16,221 children have been taken to Russia since the war began.ICC prosecutor Karim Khan was quoted by the Courthouse News Service as telling Russia during a conference of justice ministers from more than 30 countries in London on Monday: “Return the children, repatriate the children.”Russia’s Nebenzia called the issue of the children “totally overblown” and said Moscow wants to explain at the Security Council meeting, around April 6, that they were taken to Russia “simply because we wanted to spare them of the danger that military activities may bring.”Nebenzia was asked whether Russia planned on returning the children. “When conditions are safe, of course. Why not?"" the Russian envoy replied.",2023/03/21,,World

Newton, a free agent, led the Tigers to a national championship in 2011 and was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft later that year by the Carolina Panthers.He spent 11 years in the league, the first nine with the Panthers. Newton turns 34 in May.Newton hasn’t played in the NFL since 2021 when he rejoined the Panthers midseason for a second stint, a move he later admitted wasn't the best decision of his career. He was 0-5 as a starter with Carolina in his return and was benched for the final two games of the season by former coach Matt Rhule.Newton has a 75-68-1 record as a starting NFL quarterback and has run for more touchdowns than any quarterback in league history. He’s thrown for more than 32,000 yards and 194 touchdowns during his career.Newton’s last full season came in 2020 when he played for the New England Patriots. He was 7-8 as a starter with eight TD passes and 10 interceptions.His best season came in 2015 when he earned MVP honors, combining for 45 touchdowns and led the Panthers to the Super Bowl 50 where they lost 24-10 to the Denver Broncos.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841709,Siegrist leads Villanova into Sweet 16 for 2nd time ever,"VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — As Maddy Siegrist hugged and high-fived every Villanova fan down the front row of seats in a wild celebration following the biggest win of her career, it was hard for the All-American not to think about far the Wildcats have come in just four seasons.Siegrist's journey saw her dominate as the program's career leading scorer, lead Villanova into the kind of elite team that can pack a postseason game in their own house and now this milestone, a Sweet 16 berth for the first time in 20 years.“Everyone wants to leave their mark,” Siegrist said.Siegrist sure left hers on the Main Line.Siegrist scored 31 points, had four blocks, four steals and sent the winningest team in Villanova history into the Sweet 16 for the second time in program history with a 76-57 win over 12th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast on Monday night.“What Maddy has done and continues to do is off the charts,” coach Denise Dillon said.The fourth-seeded Wildcats (30-6) won their record 30th game and celebrated the March Madness milestone in front of another packed house at the Pavilion. Siegrist, the first-team AP All-American, made 13 of 24 shots in what was likely her final home game. The four-year star has left some wiggle room that she could return for a fifth season, but all signs point toward her playing in the WNBA this summer.One thing is sure, Siegrist is headed to the Sweet 16.The Wildcats are going for the first time since the 2003 team reached the Elite Eight -- the coach of that team, Harry Perretta, watched this one from behind the basket -- and they will No. 9 Miami, which upset No. 1 seed Indiana.“To me, Villanova is a Final Four-level team,” FGCU coach Karl Smesko said. “I wouldn't be surprised if they get there.""He's not the only one. President Joe Biden picked the Wildcats to win it all in his March Madness bracket.One sign from the student section said it all, “It’s On! March Maddyness.” Another fan shouted during halftime warmups, “No one can guard you, Maddy!”Siegrist checked out to a rousing standing ovation with 1:57 left in the game and the star forward hugged every teammate down the bench. Her teammates mobbed her after the final horn as the Wildcats danced on the court and flashed the “V” sign for their fans.“If this is my last game at home, this is a great way to go out,” Siegrist said.Siegrist sank two free throws with 5:18 left in the third quarter to give her 21 points, which made it 36 straight games this season for the two-time Big East Player of the Year with at least 20 points.The Wildcats actually scored the first eight points of the game before Siegrist got on the board. Siegrist may be the star who topped 1,000 points this season alone but she’s had plenty of help along the way.Against the Eagles (33-4), it was Lucy Olsen’s shot to turn this one into another March victory. The 5-foot-9 guard who averaged 12.9 points scored nine in the first quarter. The Wildcats seemed poised to run away with this one, blocking FGCU’s first two shots, grabbing every rebound and loose ball raced to a 26-11 lead.But a 3:28 scoreless drought trimmed Villanova’s halftime lead 39-33.Here’s the thing, Siegrist wasn’t going to let Villanova lose on its home court and become the latest men’s or women’s tournament single-digit seed to suffer an upset. Ole Miss stunned top-seeded Stanford a night earlier to somewhat open up the women’s bracket.With Hall of Fame coach Jay Wright watching from behind the team bench, the Wildcats showed again what makes them a dangerous matchup in March.The nation's leading scorer, Siegrist converted a three-point play and then picked the ball clean on a steal and layup that stretched Villanova’s lead to 46-33.“She's the best player,” Smesko said. “To game plan for her in one day is extraordinarily difficult.”Each time FGCU tried to make a run, Siegrist and Olsen pushed back. Olsen buried a 3 late in the third for a 61-41 lead and the road to the Sweet 16 was completely clear. She finished with 23 points and 10 rebounds.“I wouldn't want to win it with anyone else,” Olsen said.BIG PICTUREFlorida Gulf Coast: Sha Carter led them with 11 points. The Eagles are looking for their first Sweet 16 in team history. They still have the record for overall wins in the tournament by a 12 seed with three.“We were a little rattled,” Carter said.Villanova: Dillon won her 400th career game and 71st at Villanova. She went 329-211 in 17 years at Drexel. The Wildcats won 24 of their final 26 home games. That helped them win 30 games, topping the 1981-82 team that went 29-4 and advanced to the AIAW Final Four.UP NEXTThe Wildcats are headed to Greenville, South Carolina for the Sweet 16.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841710,IMF to assess Sri Lankan governance as part of $3B bailout,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it is assessing Sri Lanka’s governance in the first case of an Asian country facing scrutiny for corruption as part of a bailout program.The IMF executive board approved a nearly $3 billion bailout plan for the bankrupt nation Monday and about $333 million was to be disbursed immediately to help alleviate the country's humanitarian crisis. The approval also will open up financial support from other institutions.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt last year as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that forced out Sri Lanka’s president. The economic situation has improved under current President Ranil Wickremesinghe, but his plans to privatize state companies have raised objections.The senior mission chief for the IMF in Sri Lanka said the development lender was “conducting an in-depth governance diagnostic exercise which will assess corruption and governance vulnerabilities in Sri Lanka and provide prioritized and sequenced recommendations.”“Sri Lanka will be the first country in Asia to undergo a governance diagnostic exercise by the IMF. We look forward to further engagement and collaboration with stakeholders and civil society organizations on this critical reform area,” Peter Breuer told reporters.Sri Lankans took to the streets since last year demanding accountability for alleged corruption and demanding recovery of assets allegedly stolen by members of a former ruling family. Graft has been a main factor behind the country's economic meltdown, critics of the government say.“Sri Lanka has been facing tremendous economic and social challenges with a severe recession amid high inflation, depleted reserves, an unsustainable public debt, and heightened financial sector vulnerabilities,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement Monday.“Institutions and governance frameworks require deep reforms,"" she said.The IMF's approval will unlock financing of up to $7 billion from it and other international financial institutions, Wickremesinghe's office said.Earlier this month, the last hurdle for the approval was cleared when China joined Sri Lanka's other creditors in providing assurances for debt restructuring.“From the very start, we committed to full transparency in all our discussions with financial institutions and with our creditors,"" Wickremesinghe said in a statement from his office. ""I express my gratitude to the IMF and our international partners for their support as we look to get the economy back on track for the long term through prudent fiscal management and our ambitious reform agenda.”The president said he has made some tough decisions to ensure stability and debt sustainability and to grow an inclusive and internationally attractive economy.Sri Lanka increased income taxes sharply and removed electricity and fuel subsidies, fulfilling prerequisites of the IMF program. Authorities must now discuss with Sri Lanka's creditors on how to restructure its debt.“Having obtained specific and credible financing assurances from major official bilateral creditors, it is now important for the authorities and creditors to make swift progress towards restoring debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported program,"" Georgieva said.“The authorities’ commitments to transparently achieve a debt resolution, consistent with the program parameters and equitable burden sharing among creditors in a timely fashion, are welcome,” she said.Sri Lanka's foreign reserves ran short as tourism and export revenues dried up during the COVID-19 pandemic and it faced heavy debt payments for megaprojects funded by Chinese and other international lenders that did not generate enough income. It also used its currency reserves to try to stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee.Since Wickremesinghe took over from ousted ex-President Gotobaya Rajapaksa he has managed to reduce shortages and ended hours-long daily power cuts. The central bank says its reserves have improved and the black market no longer controls the foreign currency trade.However, trade unions oppose Wickremesinghe plans to privatize state companies as part of his reform agenda, Public resentment may flare if he fails to take action against the Rajapaksa family, who people believe were responsible for the economic crisis.Wickremesinghe's critics accuse him of shielding the Rajapaksas, who still control a majority of lawmakers in Parliament, in return for their support for his presidency.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841713,Putin meets 'dear friend' Xi in Kremlin as Ukraine war grinds on,"Vladimir Putin and his ""dear friend"" Chinese leader Xi Jinping planned more talks on Tuesday after a Kremlin dinner where the isolated Russian president showcased his most powerful ally in the face of Western opposition to the war in Ukraine.Washington denounced Xi's visit, saying the timing just days after an international court accused Putin of war crimes indicated Beijing was providing Moscow with ""diplomatic cover"" to commit additional crimes.It was Xi's first trip abroad since he obtained an unprecedented third term last month. The Chinese leader has been trying to portray Beijing as a potential peacemaker in Ukraine, even as he deepens economic ties with his closest ally.Putin and Xi greeted one another as ""dear friend"" when they met in the Kremlin on Monday, and Russian state news agencies later reported they held informal talks for nearly 4-1/2 hours, with more official talks scheduled for Tuesday.In televised comments, Putin told Xi he viewed China's proposals for resolution of the Ukraine conflict with respect. He confessed to being ""slightly envious"" of China's ""very effective system for developing the economy and strengthening the state"".Xi, for his part, praised Putin and predicted Russians would re-elect him next year.Moscow has been publicly promoting plans for a visit by Xi for months. But the timing gave the Chinese leader's personal support new meaning, after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on Friday accusing Putin of war crimes for deporting children from Ukraine.Moscow denies illegally deporting children, saying it has taken in orphans to protect them. It opened a criminal case against the court's prosecutor and judges. Beijing said the warrant reflected double standards.The West says the warrant should make the Russian leader a pariah.""That President Xi is travelling to Russia days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for President Putin suggests that China feels no responsibility to hold the Kremlin accountable for the atrocities committed in Ukraine,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.""Instead of even condemning them, it would rather provide diplomatic cover for Russia to continue to commit those grave crimes.”White House spokesman John Kirby said Xi should use his influence to press Putin to withdraw troops from Ukraine, and Washington was concerned that Beijing might instead call for a ceasefire that would let Russian troops stay.China has released a proposal to solve the Ukraine crisis, largely dismissed in the West as a ploy to buy Putin time to regroup his forces and solidify his grip on occupied land.Russia and China ""do not have the same network of friends and partners"" around the world as the United States, and that's why they are tightening their relationship now, Kirby said.""It's a bit of a marriage of convenience, I'd say, less than it is of affection,"" Kirby told reporters.Washington has said in recent weeks it also fears China might arm Russia, which Beijing has denied.KYIV CAUTIOUSKyiv, which says the war cannot end until Russia pulls out its troops, cautiously welcomed Beijing's peace proposal when it was unveiled last month.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that China arming Russia could lead to World War Three, but also that he believed Beijing was aware of this risk. He has called for Xi to speak to him.Putin signed a ""no limits"" partnership with Xi last year shortly before the Kremlin leader ordered the invasion of Ukraine. Putin claims he aims to end a threat to Russia from its neighbour's moves towards the West; Kyiv and the West call it an unprovoked attack on an independent state.Russia's invasion has laid waste to Ukrainian cities, caused millions of people to flee and killed tens of thousands of civilians.The spectre of a wider war persisted. Russia's defence ministry said a Russian Su-35 fighter jet was scrambled over the Baltic Sea on Monday after two U.S. strategic bombers flew in the direction of the Russian border, but that it returned to base after they moved away.The development followed the March 14 crash of a U.S. military surveillance drone into the Black Sea after it was intercepted by Russian jets, in the first known direct military encounter between Russia and the United States since Russia invaded Ukraine.Several European Union countries agreed in Brussels on Monday to jointly buy 1 million rounds of 155 mm artillery shells for Ukraine. Both sides fire thousands of rounds per day.The United States announced its latest military aid package, worth $350 million, including more ammunition for HIMARS rocket launchers, howitzers and Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, plus HARM missiles, anti-tank weapons and river boats.Ukraine's defence ministry said on Monday that an explosion in the north of the Crimean peninsula destroyed Russian cruise missiles intended for use by Russia's Black Sea fleet.Fierce fighting continued Tuesday in the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut, where Ukrainian forces have held out since last summer in the longest and bloodiest battle of the war.Moscow, which has not scored a major victory since August, has launched a massive winter offensive involving hundreds of thousands of freshly called-up reservists and convicts recruited from jails.Ukraine, which recaptured swathes of territory in the second half of 2022, has kept mainly to defence since November, aiming to deplete Russia's attacking forces before launching a planned counteroffensive of its own.(Reporting by Reuters bureaux; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2023/03/21,226,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841718,New York City braces for Trump indictment after ex-president urges protests,"Workers erected barricades around a Manhattan courthouse on Monday as New York City braced for a possible indictment of Donald Trump over an alleged hush-money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 campaign.It would be the first-ever criminal case against any U.S. president. On Saturday, Trump urged followers on social media to protest what he said was his looming arrest.In his call for protests, Trump raised concerns for law enforcement that supporters might engage in violence similar to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington.Fearing a trap, however, several far-right grassroots groups have opted not to heed his call, security analysts said.A grand jury, which heard further testimony on Monday, could bring charges as soon as this week. Trump, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the White House again in 2024, had predicted he would be arrested on Tuesday.On Monday the grand jury heard from a witness, lawyer Robert Costello, who said Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen had handled the hush-money payments without Trump's involvement.""Michael Cohen decided on his own - that's what he told us - on his own, to see if he could take care of this,"" Costello told reporters after testifying to the grand jury at Trump's lawyers' request.Cohen, who testified twice before the grand jury, has said publicly Trump directed him to make the payments on Trump's behalf.An indictment could hurt Trump's comeback attempt. Some 44% of Republicans say he should drop out of the presidential race if he is indicted, according to a seven-day Reuters/Ipsos poll that concluded on Monday.The investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is one of several legal challenges facing Trump. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to federal campaign finance violations tied to his arranging payments to Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, and another woman in exchange for their silence about affairs they claimed with Trump.Trump has denied that any such affairs took placeThe Manhattan District Attorney's office had asked that Cohen be available as a rebuttal witness, but he was told on Monday afternoon that his testimony was not needed, according to his lawyer Lanny Davis. Cohen told MSNBC he had not been asked to return on Wednesday.NO SIGN OF UNRESTNew York Mayor Eric Adams told reporters police were monitoring social media and keeping an eye out for ""inappropriate actions"" in the city. The New York Police Department said there were no known credible threats.If charged, Trump would likely have to travel from his Florida home for fingerprinting and other processing. Law enforcement officials met on Monday to discuss the logistics, several media outlets reported.Sources have said Bragg's office was presenting evidence to a grand jury about a $130,000 payment made to Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 campaign.Trump's fellow Republicans have widely criticized the probe as politically motivated.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump's rival for the Republican presidential nomination, said on Monday Bragg was imposing a ""political agenda"" that compromised the rule of law, but he also took a veiled swipe at Trump.""I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,"" he told reporters.Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives launched an investigation of Bragg's office with a letter seeking communications, documents and testimony related to the probe.Trump and other Republicans have also said the Manhattan District Attorney's office should focus more on tackling crime.Asked to comment on the letter, a spokesperson for the DA's office, citing statistics that homicides and shootings were down this year, said:""We will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law.""Trump was impeached twice by the House during his presidency, once in 2019 over his conduct regarding Ukraine and again in 2021 over the attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. He was acquitted by the Senate both times.SEVERAL MORE LEGAL CHALLENGES REMAINBragg won a conviction last December against Trump's business on tax fraud charges.But legal analysts say the hush-money case may be more difficult. Bragg's office will have to prove that Trump intended to commit a crime, and his lawyers will likely employ a range of counterattacks to try to get the case dismissed, experts say.Trump, meanwhile, has to contend with other legal challenges, raising the possibility he will have to shuttle between campaign stops and courtrooms before the November 2024 election.Trump's lawyers on Monday asked a Georgia court to quash a special grand jury report detailing its investigation into his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 statewide election defeat.The filing in Fulton County Superior Court also seeks to have the county district attorney, Fani Willis, recused from the case, arguing her media appearances and social media posts demonstrated bias against Trump.Trump is also seeking to delay a civil fraud trial, scheduled for Oct. 2, brought by the New York attorney general that alleges a decade-long scheme to manipulate the value of his assets to win better terms from bankers and insurers.Trump faces two civil trials involving former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who claims that Trump defamed her by denying he raped her. A federal judge on Monday denied a request from both sides to combine the two cases into one.(Additional reporting by Kaniska Singh, Jason Lange, David Morgan and Costas Pitas; Writing by Andy Sullivan; Editing by Scott Malone, Howard Goller and Lincoln Feast.)",2023/03/21,217,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841719,Trump's unprecedented call for protests is the latest sign of his aim to degrade America's institutions,"In a social media post on March 18, 2023, former President Donald Trump announced that he would be arrested on March 21 on charges stemming from an investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Bragg’s office is probing hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, an adult film star, which were allegedly made to spare candidate Trump embarrassment on the eve of the 2016 presidential election.“THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. PROTEST, TAKE OUR NATION BACK!” wrote Trump.Scholar Shelley Inglis spent more than 15 years with the United Nations, where she advised governments and democracy advocates on how to strengthen the rule of law, human rights and democratic governance. We asked her about Trump’s post.Let me begin by quickly describing populism, because it’s important to my thoughts about Trump’s post. Populist movements portray “the people in a moral battle against elites,” as scholars Jane Mansbridge and Stephen Macedo describe it. Some level of populism is inherent in democracies where candidates appeal to be elected by “the people.”But what I call autocratic populists use this narrative to claim they are the sole voice of “the people” and those against them are “bad” or even “evil.” They undermine any and all opposition to them and attempts to hold them accountable, including independent institutions like courts, elections and the media. This is how such populists become so dangerous for democracy and the rule of law.Trump has that autocrat’s populism, in which he says that not only is he anti-elite but that he is “the only one” who can represent the people and calls on the public to question legitimate democratic institutions – which he did even when he was the head of those institutions.Scholars like me know that protests play an important role in societies, and the freedom to protest is part of a democratic society. The idea of peaceful protests is to hold the government accountable and for people to have an avenue for free speech and be able to participate in demonstrating their demands. But I believe protests are most valuable when they originate from civil society or advocacy groups.It’s really a red flag if a political party or leader is using people in protest in a democracy like the U.S. That devalues the idea that protests come from the people or what we call civil society. Instead, it’s a manipulation of a democratic society.He was asking for a protest on his behalf because of what an independent institution is doing. It’s a protest about and for him.It’s hard for me to think of an example in recent history when political leaders in a democracy like the U.S. demanded that people protest, even on an issue, let alone for them. So Trump’s call is a real populist move that is intended actually to undermine respect for democratic institutions, whereas popular protests and advocacy can be a sign of a vibrant and healthy democracy.Demonizing the institution and alleging that the institutions are controlled by an agenda is part of the narrative that Trump has created. It is the populism of “us” versus “them.” Even when he was the head of the government and its institutions, he was fomenting this narrative by effectively saying things like, “This election is going to be unfair … even though I’m president of the United States. I’m already saying that this election, run by my own government, though at multiple levels, is going to be unfair.”Once populists get in power, they degrade any kind of accountability, any checks and balances, and they debase the opposition through very clever ways of creating a narrative that it’s somehow justified.He’s continued with that narrative, which is basically to say he’s the only one who represents the people of the United States as a legitimate voice. And anything that is done against him actually is against the United States. So his phrase in that post, “Take our country back,” means “Give back power to me, or do something against institutions that might be holding me to account.”For me, it is important for people to appreciate that protest is productive and healthy for democracy when it comes from the bottom up. But when it’s manipulated by political actors, calling on people to protest for them and seek to overturn U.S. institutions, like on Jan. 6, it can actually be highly threatening to democracy.",2023/03/21,275,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841730,"Xapo Bank Announces Updated Member Benefits Including 4.1% interest on US Dollars, 1% Interest on Bitcoin, and GBP Transfer Capabilities through the Faster Payment System (FPS)","BANGKOK, THAILAND -  Media OutReach - 21 March 2023 - Xapo Bank, the world's first international private bank to combine traditional banking with Bitcoin, has announced its members worldwide will earn an interest rate of 4.1% on US Dollar deposits*. Xapo Bank has also introduced 1% interest on Bitcoin, divided over the year and paid out daily, and from this week, Xapo Bank has also added support for GBP through the Faster Payment System. This means members will be able to make payments directly to UK Banks and participating territories as well as to wallets like Wise, Revolut or many exchanges.            This interest increase on US Dollar deposits doubles the rate the bank previously offered and is significantly higher than the industry average. The raise is part of the bank's interest rates restructuring, which is based on market conditions and aims to ensure that Xapo Bank members can continue to earn sustainable returns on their deposits.   Before the increase to 4.1%, Xapo Bank was paying a 2% interest rate on USD deposits, an already-competitive rate in today's market. This latest increase brings Xapo Bank far above the industry average, making the Gibraltar-based financial pioneer's proposition particularly attractive to consumers. Xapo Bank members also receive protection on fiat deposits up to 100,000.00 US Dollars. This guarantee is provided by the Gibraltar Deposit Guarantee Scheme – a robust level of protection that's equivalent to that provided by leading banks in Europe and the UK.   Xapo Bank's 4.1% interest rate on US dollars and 1% interest rate on Bitcoin is available to all new and existing members around the world.   Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, said: ""We are committed to helping our members grow and protect their wealth in a responsible manner. Offering a market-leading interest rate is just one of the ways we do this, alongside operating to some of the highest global standards of private banking and security.""   Xapo Bank's decision to introduce GBP payments comes in reaction to uncertainty and turbulent markets.   Seamus Rocca continued: ""The ongoing issues related to bank closures in the US and the increased regulatory pressures around crypto could certainly push players to look for alternative jurisdictions and maybe even alternative currencies in which to operate.   ""Xapo Bank took a business decision in 2019 to sell our Institutional Custody business and focus on retail, so we are not a B2B bank in the same way that Silvergate or Signature are. Consumers are expressing the need for trusted institutions in the space that offer diverse routes to transfer and receive their funds in a crypto-native way. In addition to its existing Bitcoin offering and its integration into the Faster Payment System, as of this week, Xapo Bank is also activating USDC payments, enabling members to send and receive USDC to their Xapo Bank account, promptly and without any transfer fees.""   These updates follow Xapo Bank's recent announcement that it has become the only fully licensed private bank in the world to partner with Lightspark and integrate with the Lightning Network to enable lightning-fast Bitcoin payments for its customers. The partnership enables Xapo Bank members to pay for small purchases of up to $100 instantly to any vendor who accepts Lightning payments without suffering high transaction fees and long blockchain confirmation waiting times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841731,House GOP demands info from NY prosecutor about Trump case,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — House Republicans rallied to the defense of former President Donald Trump before his possible indictment, demanding that the Manhattan district attorney who is investigating him turn over documents and come for an interview.The Republican chairmen of three House committees sent a letter Monday to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, seeking information about his actions in the Trump case, which they characterized as an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.” They requested testimony as well as documents and copies of any communications with the Justice Department.No authorities wanted to take the case but then ""what changed? President Trump announces he’s running for president and shazam,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said shortly after sending the letter.The letter to Bragg — effectively demanding transparency in the middle of a criminal investigation — suggested that Republicans intend to use their House majority to defend Trump as he mounts a second run for president.Both Bragg and the Justice Department seemed unlikely to respond to the request, given the long-standing practice of prosecutors not divulging information about active cases.Bragg's office said in a statement it would not be intimidated by what it characterized as attempts to undermine the justice process.Without saying whether Bragg would comply with the chairmen's request, the statement said the prosecutor's office would not let “baseless accusations” deter it from fairly applying the law. It said its prosecutions follow the law “without fear or favor.”The grand jury case revolves around hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with Trump. Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization.Prosecutors have not said when their work might conclude or when charges could come. But law enforcement in New York has been making preparations for any unrest, should Trump face charges.However, Rep. Brian Steil, chair of the House Administration Committee, said the potential actions of the prosecutor are pretty darn unprecedented.” Steil, whose committee oversees election law, said lawmakers are looking to see whether federal resources have been used by Bragg throughout his investigation.“I think there’s a broad concern about the politicization of the judicial system, and we are better served as a country if our judicial system writ large is not politicized,” Steil said in an interview.Democrats on Monday called Republican efforts to seek information from an ongoing investigation “an astonishing and unprecedented abuse of power.”Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the Oversight committee, assailed the Republican majority's efforts to use its new power to “obstruct a possible criminal indictment.”He added, ""Former President Donald Trump demanded this nonsensical interference over the weekend, and these Committee chairs have acted totally outside their proper powers to try to influence a pending criminal investigation at the state level.”House Republicans were stalwart defenders of Trump while he was in office and have mostly stood by him even after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, an unprecedented assault that was fueled by Trump's lies about a stolen election. His claims were rejected by state and local officials, the courts and his own Justice Department.House Republicans are in Orlando, Florida, on a party retreat to plot strategy for the year, but Trump's legal peril quickly became the main focus, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and others faced questions about Trump's call for supporters to protest and “take back our nation.”McCarthy, a California Republican, said that there should be no protests or violence in response to the DA's decision.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841732,Last call: Dodge unveils last super-fast gasoline muscle car,"DETROIT (AP) — The last gas-powered muscle car from Dodge isn't leaving the road without some squeals, thunder and crazy-fast speed.The 2023 Challenger SRT Demon 170 will deliver 1,025 horsepower from its 6.2-liter supercharged V-8, and the automaker says it will be the quickest production car made.Stellantis, formed in 2021 by combining Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot, says it can go from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) in a scary 1.66 seconds, making it faster than even electric supercars from Tesla and Lucid.It's what the performance brand from Stellantis is calling the last of the rumbling cars that for decades were a fixture of American culture on Saturday night cruises all over the country.Stellantis will stop making gas versions of the Dodge Challenger and Charger and the Chrylser 300 big sedan by the end of this year, squeezed out by stricter government fuel-economy regulations and an accelerating shift to electric vehicles to fight climate change.The Canadian factory that makes all three cars will be retooled to make electric versions of larger cars starting next year. Stellantis hasn't said whether all three models will survive, but it did show off a Charger Daytona SRT electric concept muscle car back in August.Tim Kuniskis, CEO of the Dodge brand and the unofficial spokesman for America's gas-powered rubber-burners, said that, while he'll miss the traditional muscle, he's excited about making electric performance vehicles.“It's the end of an era, for sure,” he said Monday. “Electric products, they're very fast. Muscle cars, one of the primary ingredients is to be a fast accelerating car. So I've automatically got the power. Now I've just got to figure out ways to bring all the other elements in of the excitement of the driving experience.”Since last summer, Dodge has been rolling out powerful special-edition “Last Call” versions of its gas powered muscle cars, culminating with an event Monday night to show the Challenger Demon 170 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway drag strip.The new Challenger Demon, a descendant of a car that first went on sale in 1969, also produces 945 pound-feet of torque, or rotational force — so much power that the company had to strengthen the rear drive shaft and differential with aerospace-grade metals.According to Stellantis, the car will be the first production vehicle to run a quarter-mile (0.40 kilometers) in under nine seconds — 8.91 to be exact. To do that, it hits a speed of just over 151 mph (243 kilometers per hour). Horsepower and speed depends on how much ethanol is in the fuel.It gets only 13 miles per gallon in the city and 21 on the highway, but it's doubtful anyone buying one will care even as the world deals with climate change.Kuniskis says it's a relatively small number of cars, and he says the ethanol they burn is cleaner than gasoline. Dodge, he said, will have built 2 million muscle cars by the time production of gas versions ends Dec. 31. Dodge's followers, he said, deserve a celebration.“After all these years, we owed it as much to them as to ourselves to celebrate this end, and give them something that produces a lot of pride in the brand that they love,"" he said.The Demon 170 is street legal, even though it comes with wide racing tires . To make it a daily driver, the company is offering a package of smaller, more street friendly wheels and tires.At a devilish $96,666, the car comes standard with only a driver's seat and a basic radio. But it has air conditioning. Front passenger and back seats are optional for $1 each. You can also get leather, a sunroof and a better sound system.Stellantis will make only up to 3,300 of them, and Kuniskis isn't sure if they'll hit that number due to potential parts shortages and a limited production time.If previous limited-edition models are any indication, the Demon 170 should become an instant classic collector's car, Kuniskis said.“If you look at some of the cars that we've had in our past, it's pretty easy to tell which ones people want to collect,” he said. “A lot of times it's the lower (sales) volume, extreme examples, whether its extreme looks or extreme performance. Well, this one happens to have both.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841733,New law puts Wyoming at forefront of abortion pill bans,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming has pushed to the front of state efforts to prohibit the most common type of abortion by instituting the nation’s first explicit ban on pills that terminate pregnancies.Medication abortions, which usually involve taking two prescription medications days apart at home or in a clinic, became the preferred method for ending pregnancy in the U.S. even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade -- and now account for more than half of all abortions according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.More than a dozen states have responded to the Supreme Court's ruling by effectively banning abortion pills through prohibitions on all forms of abortion.Fifteen states restrict access to the pills. Of those, six — Arizona, Indiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota and South Carolina — require a doctor to administer them in person. Arizona also bans mailing abortion pills.But before a law signed Friday by Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, no state specifically banned abortion pills. The law passed alongside a new abortion ban that seeks to sidestep issues with an earlier state ban that’s been held up in court.With these two new abortion laws, the Wyoming Legislature is “kind of trying to cover all its bases” to prohibit abortions, said Elizabeth Nash with the Guttmacher Institute.Gordon allowed the new broad abortion ban to take effect Sunday without his signature. Whether the abortion pill ban he signed takes effect July 1 as planned remains to be seen. It could be delayed in the courts if an abortion provider in the state sues over it. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Texas is considering a case with implications for abortion pill access nationwideHere’s a look at where abortion stands in Wyoming and elsewhere:IS ABORTION NOW ILLEGAL IN WYOMING?Yes. As of Sunday, abortions in all forms are illegal, although a judge in Jackson who suspended the previous ban could decide to suspend this one as well. A court hearing is set for Wednesday.The state’s lone clinic that provided abortions until the ban is in the tourist mountain town of Jackson. Another clinic in Casper, Wellspring Health Access, was set to open last year before it was delayed by an arson; their plans to open next month are now uncertain.Even before the ban, many women in Wyoming drove to Colorado and elsewhere to get abortions because it was more convenient. There’s no prohibition on women in Wyoming continuing to go out of state to seek abortions.WHY DID WYOMING TAKE SUCH AGGRESSIVE ACTION?Wyoming has long been a deeply conservative state but one that often avoided weighing in on social matters — live and let live is a credo of rural life in the West.That’s changing. With a state Legislature more dominated by Republicans than at any point in a century, leaders are able to delve into culture-war issues with hardly any opposition.Last year, Gordon signed an abortion ban that took effect a month after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. Within hours, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens suspended it, ruling that a lawsuit’s claim it would harm pregnant women and their doctors could have merit.The two nonprofits and four women, including two obstetricians, who sued also argued that the ban violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to make one’s own healthcare decisions.Attorneys for the state said that wasn’t the intent of the amendment, which passed in response to the Affordable Care Act seeking to expand healthcare coverage nationwide.This year, Wyoming lawmakers did an end-run around the lawsuit with a new, blanket abortion ban declaring that abortion is not healthcare and therefore is not protected by the state constitution.WHAT ARE LAWMAKERS IN OTHER STATES DOING?Most Republican-controlled states adopted abortion bans or tighter restrictions in anticipation that Roe v. Wade would be overturned eventually.And last year, several Democrat-controlled states adopted protections for abortion access.But that didn’t end the legislative battles.This month, Utah became the first state to pass a law banning abortion clinics altogether. It came as the state’s ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancies is held up by a legal challenge.In Florida, lawmakers are trying to figure out what bans to put into place. Florida previously banned abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which is much looser than what other GOP-controlled states have done; a new measure to ban them after six weeks has been advancing through the Legislature. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a possible 2024 presidential candidate, is expected to sign it if it gets to him.In South Carolina, also GOP-dominated, lawmakers are debating what kind of ban to try next after a ban on abortions after six weeks was rejected by the state’s top court.In Minnesota, where last year’s election gave Democrats full control of the government, the governor this year signed additional protections for abortion access into law.___Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841734,Biden signs measure nullifying DC criminal code revisions,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law legislation nullifying the recent overhaul of the District of Columbia criminal code, but the fight between Congress and local lawmakers is continuing.The signature merely marks the end of a raucous first chapter in a saga that has left district lawmakers bitterly nursing their political bruises, harboring fresh resentments against national Democrats and bracing to play defense against an activist Republican-controlled House for at least the next two years.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy hailed the move in a statement, calling it the end of what he labeled a “soft-on-crime criminal code rewrite that treated violent criminals like victims and discarded the views of law enforcement.”But even before the bill was formally sent to sent to Biden, House Republicans were promising a season of direct congressional intervention in local D.C. affairs.“This is just the beginning,” McCarthy, R-Calif., said earlier this month in a celebratory signing ceremony after the vote to cancel the new criminal code passed the Senate with significant Democratic support. “It is a message for the entire nation.”D.C. Council members sound like they fully believe those promises.“I’m afraid that we’re going to see more of this for the remainder of this Congress,"" D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said. “Does this raise a concern that there are going to be other issues? Yes.”When congressional passage of the measure appeared inevitable and Biden indicated he would sign it, the D.C. Council withdrew the measure. But the move did not spare Biden a politically charged decision on whether to endorse the congressional action.Biden did not issue a statement accompanying the signing Monday. But he tweeted earlier this month that while he supported statehood for D.C., “I don’t support some of the changes D.C. Council put forward over the mayor’s objections — such as lowering penalties for carjackings.”Under terms of Washington’s Home Rule authority, t he House Committee on Oversight and Accountability essentially vets all new D.C. laws and frequently alters or limits them through budget riders. But the criminal code rewrite is the first law to be completely overturned since 1991.House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., has pledged that his committee ""stands ready to conduct robust oversight of America’s capital city.”That robust oversight has already begun. Even before Biden signed the bill, the Oversight Committee sent letters summoning Mendelson, D.C. Councilmember Charles Allen and D.C. Chief Financial Officer Glen Lee to testify at a March 29 hearing. The topic of that hearing, according to the letter, is the ominously vague “general oversight of the District of Columbia, including crime, safety, and city management.”Other House Republicans have already identified areas of interest to target. Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia has introduced a resolution to block a police accountability law known as the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act.Most aspects of that law were passed by the D.C. Council on an emergency basis in 2020, amid the protests against police brutality following George Floyd’s murder; it was made permanent in December 2022. It bans the use of chokeholds by police officers, makes police disciplinary files available to the public, weakens the bargaining power of the police union and limits the use of tear gas to disperse protestors.“Now that Congress has effectively used its constitutional authority to strike down the D.C. Council’s dangerous Revised Criminal Code Act, we must now move to swiftly block this anti-police measure to ensure our nation’s capital city is safe for all Americans,” Clyde said in a statement.Clyde is a longtime nemesis of D.C. loyalists, having publicly stated that his ultimate goal is to completely end Washington's Home Rule authority. That sentiment, once a long-shot fringe position, has edged closer to being a mainstream Republican talking point. Former President Donald Trump publicly stated earlier this month that the “federal government should take over control and management of Washington D.C.”Meanwhile, Oversight Committee member Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has targeted the D.C. Jail for congressional scrutiny. Greene has demanded access to the jail to visit some two dozen detainees from the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. She's also seeking a complete overview of the jail's conditions.Other aspects of D.C. legislation remain ripe targets for activist Republicans, such as the District's strict gun control laws or the decision to essentially decriminalize most psychedelics — a move that was approved by D.C. voters in a referendum.This congressional onslaught of oversight was widely predicted when Republicans took back control of the House in last year's midterm elections. But most local politicians and activists hoped they could count on Democratic control of both the Senate and the White House as a shield. Those hopes rapidly melted away in a storm of political dynamics that amounted to a humiliating setback for the D.C. Council and the larger hopes of Washington ever achieving statehood.House Republicans were able to put Biden and Senate Democrats in a political bind. By defending D.C.’s right to self-governance, they would open themselves to charges of being soft on criminals at a time of rising crime both in the nation’s capital and across the U.S.In the end, Biden signaled before the Senate vote that he would not veto the rejection of the criminal code and 33 Democratic senators voted to overturn it. The moves were regarded by statehood activists as a betrayal that they say exposed the hollowness of Democratic support for D.C. statehood.For now, the D.C. Council maintains that the city's criminal code is dangerously obsolete and desperately in need of reform. But after seeing the initial law turned into a national political issue, there appears to be little appetite to try again in the short term.Mendelson said that changing the aspects that drew criticism, such as the lowering of maximum penalties for crimes like carjacking, would simply lead to other objections from a Republican House that he said is openly looking for a fight.“I don’t plan on installing a hotline to Republican leadership in the House and the Senate and calling them every week and asking them for permission to move forward,” Mendelson said.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841735,March Madness: Van Lith and Louisville pummel Texas,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Louisville rarely opens the NCAA Tournament away from home. The Cardinals could learn to love these early road trips.Faced off with No. 4 Texas on the Longhorns' home court, Hailey Van Lith and the No. 5 Cardinals delivered a swaggering, smothering, romping 73-51 victory Monday night to earn Louisville's sixth consecutive trip the Sweet 16.Van Lith scored 21 points, delivering the early punches and then the late knockout blows for the Cardinals.“Coach (Jeff Walz) told us, ‘How many times can you quiet down the crowd,’” Van Lith said.Louisville didn’t host the first two rounds of the tournament for the first time since 2015, excluding the 2021 pandemic tournament played entirely in Texas. And from the opening tip against Texas, the Cardinals pushed around the Big 12 regular season co-champion and relished the silence as the Longhorns unraveled.Louisville (25-11) led by as much as 27 early in the fourth. The win sends the Cardinals to the Seattle 4 Region to play No. 8-seed Mississippi, which upset No. 1 Stanford on Sunday. Louisville made the Final Four last season.“We wanted to go out and prove we’re the same Louisville tough that this program has been for a long time now,” Van Lith said. She also scored 26 in Louisville's first-round win over Drake.In a matchup of two teams that began the season in the Top 10 only to fall out of the rankings before regrouping late, the Cardinals stifled Texas' standout point guard Rori Harmon all night, stretching a 14-point halftime lead to 21 by end of the third quarter.Harmon missed the November matchup between the teams when Louisville beat the Longhorns in November, and was never a factor in the rematch.Harmon scored 10 points but was mostly shut down after the first quarter. Van Lith, Mykasa Robinson and Chrislyn Carr's defensive rotations allowed Harmon three assists in the first quarter, but no more. Harmon also had five turnovers before limping off the court late in the fourth quarter with an apparent ankle injury.“We just really tried to wear her out,” Robinson said.DeYona Gaston scored 12 points to lead Texas (26-10) after sitting for nearly the entire first quarter because of an early foul.Louisville took control of the game with a 9-0 run to start the second quarter, punctuated by 6-foot-5 center Josie Williams' 3-pointer from the top of the arc, and the Cardinals led by 14 at halftime.Texas cut the deficit under 10 early in the third before Van Lith and Louisville answered with another 9-0 run. Robinson spied Carr in the corner on a fast break for a 3-pointer that put the Cardinals up 49-31.“I thought we played great,” Walz said. “Toughness, it does matter. I will say we shot the ball pretty darn well, too.”Texas coach Vic Schaefer could only shake his head at the rout.“Toughness has been kind of an issue all year long,"" Schaefer said. ""It’s been an Achilles that showed up again today.”BIG PICTURELouisville: The Cardinals' frontcourt of Liz Dixon, Olivia Cochran and Morgan Jones combined for 22 points but most importantly disrupted everything Texas could do near the basket. The Longhorns were just 7 of 22 on layups. Louisville outscored Texas in the paint 38-20.After getting outrebounded 13-6 in the first quarter, Louisville ended the game with a 42-34 advantage on the boards.Texas: With the loss, Schaefer had his string of NCAA Elite Eight appearances snapped at five. Schaefer took Mississippi State to three straight, advancing twice to the Final Four, before accepting the job at Texas. The Longhorns have not reached the Final Four since 2003, when Hall of Famer Jody Conradt was coach.TEXAS MISFIRESThe Longhorns were just 12 of 20 from the free-throw line, stifling any early chances Texas had to stem Louisville’s momentum.“It’s hard to win scoring 51 points,” Schaefer said. “I hate it that we went out like we did today. ... Texas deserves so much better than what I gave them today.” ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World

The Wolves led 109-108 after being ahead by 17 in the first half.His final basket, a three-point play with 42 seconds remaining, cut Minnesota's lead to 137-134, but Randle was beaten to a rebound by Kyle Anderson on Minnesota’s next possession, and a cutting Taurean Prince scored inside with 10.1 seconds left before Mike Conley made a free throw after Randle was called for a technical foul.That left Randle kicking himself for not making the defensive play on a night when the offenses ruled.“Jalen (Brunson) got a defensive stop, we’re down three, it’s my job to come up with that rebound, 14 seconds left,” Randle said. “If we do that, we have a chance to win the game — or not win the game, but at least tie the game. So I didn’t get the job done.”Randle was 19 for 29 from the field and 8 for 14 from 3-point range.“It’s a shame to waste a performance like that,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

Eric Staal and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers, who are 6-0-1 over their last seven games, and Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 20 shots.Barkov recorded a second-period assist, giving him 614 points, breaking a tie with Jonathan Huberdeau for the team record.“It’s great, and I think I’ll realize that even more as time goes by,” Barkov said. “You don’t really think about it during the game, but I’m very happy.”His teammates were just as elated, though they tried to hide their excitement.“We gave him the silent treatment, and I think that’s what he prefers,” Verhaeghe said. “Then we let out a big roar and congratulated him. It’s a crazy accomplishment — he’s the best player this franchise has ever had.”Pius Suter and Dylan Larkin scored for the Red Wings, who have lost 10 of their last 12 games. Ville Husso had 20 saves.The Panthers led 2-1 after the first period.The first Florida goal came after Lucas Raymond's turnover in his own zone. Sam Bennett made the steal and passed it to Tkachuk for his 33rd goal.“Turnovers cost us, especially in the first,” Detroit forward Andrew Copp said. “We have to find a way to play a little more inspired than we did tonight.”Verhaeghe made it 2-0 with a slap shot that got past a screened Husso. The Red Wings challenged for goalie interference, but the goal was upheld after a video review.Just after killing off the subsequent penalty, Detroit got on the board when Suter jammed in a rebound of David Perron's shot.Forsling scored on shot from the point midway through the second period to restore Florida's two-goal advantage. Barkov had the second assist, allowing him to break the franchise points record.“He might be the most humble man I’ve ever met, and he’s certainly the most humble elite player I’ve ever met,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “He’s the all-time leading scorer for our franchise, but he thinks the 13th forward and seventh defenseman are just as important. He treats everyone that way every day.”Larkin scored on a delayed penalty off a pass from Raymond at 7:53 of the third to cut the Panthers' lead to 3-2.Staal scored on a breakaway off a pass from Anthony Duclair with under four minutes left, and Verhaeghe added a power-play goal.Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde was frustrated by the two-man breakaway on Florida's fourth goal.“Easy offense in a couple of situations for them. Obviously, the turnover for the first goal against and then the easy goal on 4.,” he said. “We don’t need that. We had momentum, we were playing well in the period. It’s not us.

Having a nomadic goaltender almost single-handedly send you to a fourth straight loss will do that.Ferguson made 48 saves in his first NHL start as Ottawa dented Pittsburgh's increasingly iffy playoff chances in a 2-1 victory. It was quite a performance by the 24-year-old Ferguson, who was at an airport earlier this month assuming he was heading from one level of the minors to another before the goalie-depleted Senators signed him.“He was awesome,” Senators defenseman Jake Sanderson said. “They got 50 shots or something? He was dialed right from puck drop. I could tell just looking at his eyes.""No need to convince the Penguins.Pittsburgh dominated play for long stretches — at one point during the second period the Senators were pinned in their own end for over four minutes — and finally broke through on Rickard Rakell's goal with 5:21 to play in regulation.But much like a significant portion of the Penguins' uncharacteristically uneven season, their momentum quickly faded. A hooking penalty on Chad Ruhwedel gave Ottawa a power play, and Drake Batherson jammed home a shot by Tristan Jarry from just outside the crease with 2:09 to play.Ferguson did the rest as the Senators won in Pittsburgh for the first time since April 13, 2014.“It’s still sinking in, to be honest,” Ferguson said. ""My big focus tonight was just go out there and be me. Don’t try to be anything I’m not. Stay in the moment. I felt like I did that.”The Penguins, who have made the playoffs 16 straight years, fell behind Florida in the race for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference with 12 games to go.“The playoffs have started for us already it feels like kind of,” Pittsburgh forward Jake Guentzel said. ""So we’ve just got to keep going. We’ve got to worry about ourselves and make sure we get as many points as we can. Not look at other teams.”The Penguins were missing three of their top defensemen. Jeff Petry and Jan Rutta both missed their second straight game with injuries, and Marcus Pettersson was placed on long-term injured reserve earlier Monday after getting hurt in a 6-0 loss to the New York Rangers on Saturday.Mark Friedman, Taylor Fedun and Ruhwedel played well for the most part, though they spent most of the game in Ottawa's end of the ice watching Ferguson have the best night of his professional life.Ferguson began the night having played nine minutes at the NHL level as a 19-year-old for Vegas early in the Golden Knights' debut season in 2017-18. He has bounced around various levels of the minors ever since and was in the process of being sent down to the ECHL by the AHL's Toronto Marlies earlier this month when the Senators signed him to a two-way deal.Something clicked. He played well enough in six games for Ottawa's AHL affiliate in Belleville to receive a call-up on Sunday. Just over 24 hours later, the Senators made Ferguson the sixth goaltender they've used this season when they gave him the nod against the star-studded Penguins.Ferguson looked like he belonged from the opening faceoff. He made a series of sharp saves early, including a couple of stops from in close against Guentzel and a flashy glove save on a slap shot by Evgeni Malkin.Not bad for a player who, as Ottawa coach D.J. Smith put it, spends every summer looking for a job. Maybe not anymore.""Can’t feel better for a guy that when he gets his opportunity, makes good on it,” Smith said.Ferguson outplayed Jarry, a two-time All-Star who has struggled since returning from an extended absence due to multiple injuries. Jarry — who was pulled in New York on Saturday — made 19 saves but now finds his team on the outside of the playoffs looking in with three weeks left in the regular season.“We have to bring it,"" Jarry said. “Obviously, we put a lot of pucks on net. Eventually, goals are going to go in.”UP NEXTSenators: Travel to Boston on Tuesday to face the NHL-leading Bruins.Penguins: Start a difficult back-to-back on the road on Wednesday when they visit the Avalanche in Denver.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

Hayward's 3-pointer with 3:32 left put the Hornets ahead for good.The Pacers turned the ball over 21 times resulting in 35 Charlotte points.“At that point, you're just giving it away,” Carlisle said.The Pacers (32-40) looked like they might blow out the Hornets early, bolting to a 40-22 lead behind Turner, who had 15 points in the first quarter on 9 of 9 shooting from the foul line.The lead got as big as 21 in the second quarter, but the Hornets (23-50) battled back to take the lead in the third quarter when JT Thor buried a 3-pointer from the wing off an assist from Hayward.“Tonight, they were really good early, and we were really bad,” Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. ""But you could tell in the huddle, guys were talking, ‘stay with it,’ talking about the corrections they had to make. We played better and better, so they were rewarded tonight, which is great.”Nick Richards was strong in the second half for Charlotte, finishing with 14 points and 17 rebounds.HIELD'S ENDURACEWhile some NBA players have missed a game here or there for load management reasons, Hield has now played in all 72 games for the Pacers.“He is very prideful about playing,"" Carlisle said before the game. “He hates missing games, plays hurt, and is very unique. He has a tremendous level of endurance, stamina, and he works at it. He’s also wired to love the game and he just loves to play.”BALL IN THE FALLHornets point guard LaMelo Ball said he expects to return for training camp in the fall after undergoing season-ending surgery on his broken right ankle on March 1.Ball, who has been limited to 36 games this season, said he isn't sure if he'll begin wearing ankle braces next season after spraining his left ankle three times this season prior to sustaining a season-ending fracture in the other ankle.TIP INSPacers: Played without Tyrese Haliburton (right ankle sprain), Chris Duarte (left ankle soreness) and Kendall Brown (right tibia stress fracture). ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841742,Los Angeles schools shut down as staff strike for better pay,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Thousands of service workers backed by teachers began a three-day strike against the Los Angeles Unified School District on Tuesday, shutting down education for a half-million students in the nation's second-largest school system.Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 30,000 teachers’ aides, special education assistants, bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers and other support staff, walked out amid stalled contract talks.Teachers joined rain-soaked picket lines early Tuesday as workers demanded better wages and increased staffing before heading to a huge rally outside the district's headquarters in downtown Los Angeles. Some held signs that read “We keep schools safe, Respect Us!” The district has more than 500,000 students from Los Angeles and all or part of 25 other cities and unincorporated county areas. Nearly three-quarters are Latino.Bus driver Mike Cervantes began his day of protest with a 4 a.m. rally at a bus yard before joining a demonstration at a school and then heading downtown.“I'm going to be here, rain or shine,” he said. “This is historic.”Lydia Vasquez searched for her husband in the crowd as demonstrators chanted “we are the future.” He works as a school custodian and she couldn’t remember the last time he got a raise. ""We really need to be out here having our voices heard,” she said.Leaders of United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing 35,000 educators, counselors and other staff, earlier pledged solidarity with the strikers.“These are the co-workers that are the lowest-paid workers in our schools and we cannot stand idly by as we consistently see them disrespected and mistreated by this district,” UTLA President Cecily Myart-Cruz told a news conference.Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho accused the union of refusing to negotiate and said that he was prepared to meet at any time day or night.“We remain ready to return to negotiations with SEIU Local 99 so we can provide an equitable contract to our hardworking employees and get our students back in classrooms,” the superintendent said in a statement Tuesday.Liev Kaplan, 6, marched with his mom, Tiffany, an adaptive physical education teacher. “We want to fight for everyone so they can have fair pay,” the first-grader said. His dad teaches math. “We are an education family,” Tiffany Kaplan said. “But we can’t educate if the kids are not fed, if they’re not feeling safe. We have to support our support staff.”During the strike, about 150 of the district's more than 1,000 schools remained open with adult supervision but no instruction, to give students somewhere to go. Dozens of libraries and parks, plus some “grab and go” spots for students to get lunches also planned to be open to kids to lessen the strain on parents now scrambling to find care.“I will make sure the wellbeing of L.A. students always comes first as I continue to work with all parties to reach an agreement to reopen the schools and guarantee fair treatment of all LAUSD workers,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement.Jerilyn Lopez Mendoza said she supports the walkout because she wants staff to be compensated fairly, but she worried how missing three days of school might affect her 15-year-old daughter, who is autistic. For the sophomore it means three days away from her social circle and the routine that school provides, her mom said.“I’m obviously in favor of the strike and want to be supportive of the workers and their requests for fair pay and working conditions, but it also does affect my family negatively,"" Lopez Mendoza said.Workers, meanwhile, said striking was their only remaining option.Instructional aide Marlee Ostrow, who planned to join picket lines, said she’s long overdue for a raise. The 67-year-old was hired two decades ago at $11.75 an hour, and today she makes about $16. That isn’t enough to keep pace with inflation and rising housing prices, she said, and meanwhile her duties have expanded from two classrooms to five.Ostrow blames the district’s low wages for job vacancies that have piled up in recent years.“There’s not even anybody applying because you can make more money starting at Burger King,” she said. “A lot of people really want to help kids, and they shouldn’t be penalized for wanting that to be their life’s work.""The union says district support staffers earn, on average, about $25,000 per year and many live in poverty because of low pay or limited work hours while struggling with inflation and the high cost of housing in Los Angeles County. The union is asking for a 30% raise. Teachers want a 20% pay hike over two years.The district has offered a cumulative 23% raise, starting with 2% retroactive as of the 2020-21 school year and ending with 5% in 2024-25. The package would also include a one-time 3% bonus for those who have been on the job more than a year, along with more full-time positions and an expansion of healthcare benefits.“This offer addresses the needs and concerns from the union, while also remaining fiscally responsible and keeping the District in a financially stable position,” Carvalho's statement said.The White House said President Joe Biden supports workers' right to strike and the collective bargaining process.“We urge both sides to work in good faith toward a mutually acceptable solution so that there can be a quick resolution and the kids, and school employees, can get back to where they want to be, which is in school, especially the kids,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.The strike has wide support among union members.SEIU members have been working without a contract since June 2020, while the contract for teachers expired in June 2022. The unions decided last week to stop accepting extensions to their contracts.Teachers waged a six-day strike in 2019 over pay and contract issues but schools remained open.___Associated Press writers John Antczak in Los Angeles and Collin Binkley, Sarah Brumfield and Josh Boak in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World

Llano thanked Taiwan for its assistance in Paraguay’s development over the years, particularly the offering of scholarships for many Paraguayan youths and the establishment of the Taiwan-Paraguay Polytechnic University, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.
Many scholarship recipients went to Taiwan for their studies and returned to Paraguay to promote economic development and social prosperity, Llano said. He reiterated firm support of Taiwan-Paraguay friendship and said Paraguayans are grateful for Taiwan's selfless assistance and contributions over the years.
Senator Fernando Alberto Silva Facetti, a member of Llano’s delegation, pointed out that Paraguay President Mario Abdo Benitez’s visit to Taiwan last month fully demonstrated the country's support for Taiwan. Silva praised Taiwan as the most open democratic country in Asia and said that ""the darker the night, the closer the dawn.""










A new era is coming and Paraguay will always forge ahead side by side with Taiwan, he said.
Wu welcomed Llano and his delegation’s arrival in Taiwan and said that the friendship between Taiwan and Paraguay will not be separated by distance. Bilateral ties have been friendly and close since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 65 years ago, he said.
The two countries share universal values such as democracy, freedom, and human rights, Wu said. In order to promote the well-being of the two peoples and cultivate talent, the governments of the two countries have promoted various cooperative projects that benefit people's livelihood, he said.
Taiwan is willing to share its development experience with Paraguay and is happy to see the continuous and stable growth of bilateral trade between the two countries in recent years, the foreign minister said. Taiwan looks forward to deepening mutually beneficial investment, economic, and trade relations with Paraguay, he added.
In January, President of the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay Carlos Maria Lopez Lopez visited Taiwan, while Paraguay President Mario Abdo Benitez visited in February to reaffirm bilateral ties.
Paraguay is set to hold its presidential election in April, the outcome of which will likely determine whether Taiwan's sole South American ally will stick with Taipei or drop diplomatic ties in favor of Beijing.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Paraguay Senator Blas Antonio Llano Ramos and Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) reaffirmed bilateral relations during a meeting on Monday (March 20).Llano thanked Taiwan for its assistance in Paraguay’s development over the years, particularly the offering of scholarships for many Paraguayan youths and the establishment of the Taiwan-Paraguay Polytechnic University, per a Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release.Many scholarship recipients went to Taiwan for their studies and returned to Paraguay to promote economic development and social prosperity, Llano said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841780,Saudi Arabia frees American imprisoned over critical tweets,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A 72-year-old American imprisoned more than a year in Saudi Arabia over tweets critical of the Saudi crown prince was back with family members in Riyadh on Tuesday, but it remained unclear whether the kingdom would drop a travel ban to allow him to return home to Florida.Saudi Arabia on Monday freed Saad Almadi, a dual U.S.-Saudi citizen who had been a retiree living in Florida until Saudis detained him when he arrived for a 2021 family visit to the kingdom. Saudi courts subsequently sentenced Almadi to 19 years in prison over his years of past posts on social media.A State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, on Tuesday welcomed the news of Almadi's release, but would not comment on the ban Saudi Arabia had imposed earlier to keep the Florida man from returning home after he finished his prison sentence for the tweets. “Each country is going to have its own sovereign laws and each case is different, so I’m not going to speak about this,"" Patel said.Almadi is now at home with family members who live in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, said his son, Ibrahim Almadi. Saudi officials dropped all charges against the elder Almadi, Ibrahim Almadi and advocates familiar with the case said.The Florida man's imprisonment over tweets had been one of several alleged human rights abuses that had soured relations between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and President Joe Biden. That included Saudi officials' killing of a U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside a Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018, and prison sentences and travel bans that Saudi Arabia under the crown prince's tenure has given Saudi rights advocates and perceived rivals and critics of the powerful crown prince.Both Prince Mohammed and the Biden administration recently have taken steps toward restoring better relations. The two countries are partners in a decades-old security arrangement in which the U.S. provides security for Saudi Arabia and the oil-rich kingdom keeps global markets supplied with oil.Saudi Arabia had sentenced Almadi last year to 16 years in prison, saying his critical tweets about how the kingdom was being governed amounted to terrorist acts against it.As U.S. officials worked to win his release, and after Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia last summer in an attempt to improve relations with the oil-rich nation, a Saudi appeals court tacked an additional three years on to his sentence.Ibrahim Almadi had campaigned hard and publicly for his father's freedom. The son had pushed the Biden administration to formally declare his father as wrongfully detained by the kingdom, and had accused U.S. officials of holding back on criticism in the case in the interest of mending relations with the oil giant.“Now we have to fight travel ban,” he added.Saudi Arabia did not acknowledge Almadi’s release. However, the kingdom routinely pardons prisoners ahead of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which could begin as soon as Tuesday night.A retired project manager in the United States, Almadi was arrested in 2021 when he arrived for what was to have been a two-week visit to see family in the kingdom. Once in custody, he was confronted by Saudi authorities with tweets he had posted over several years from his home in Florida, his son says.Almadi's tweets included one noting Prince Salman's consolidation of power in the kingdom and another that spoke of Khashoggi's killing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841782,"Wolves overcome Randle's 57 points, beat Knicks 140-134","NEW YORK (AP) — Julius Randle scored 57 points in one of the greatest nights in Knicks history. The Minnesota Timberwolves had the most sizzling start in the NBA this season.Even in an era where the scoreboard totals seem to balloon higher all the time, this spectacular display of shooting and scoring felt different.“It was a movie,” Minnesota's Taurean Prince said.The Timberwolves overcame Randle's performance by riding a sizzling start and a steady finish to beat New York 140-134 on Monday night.Prince scored a season-high 35 points and went 8 for 8 from 3-point range for the Timberwolves, while Mike Conley added 24 points and 11 assists. His three free throws gave Minnesota the lead for good with 2:17 remaining.Randle's final basket, a three-point play with 42 seconds remaining, cut it to 137-134, but he was beaten to a rebound by Kyle Anderson on Minnesota's next possession, and a cutting Prince scored inside with 10.1 seconds left before Conley made a free throw after Randle was called for a technical foul.That left Randle kicking himself for not making the defensive play on the night the offenses ruled.“Jalen (Brunson) got a defensive stop, we’re down three, it’s my job to come up with that rebound, 14 seconds left,” Randle said. “If we do that, we have a chance to win the game — or not win the game, but at least tie the game. So I didn’t get the job done.”The Timberwolves made more than 70% of their shots in the first half and led by 17, before Randle carried the Knicks back with a franchise-record 26 points in the third quarter.He finished tied with Richie Guerin behind the only two 60-point games in Knicks history, Carmelo Anthony's 62 on Jan. 24, 2014, and Bernard King's 60 on Christmas Day in 1984. But the Knicks had their three-game winning streak snapped.The All-Star forward threw down a powerful driving dunk in the first quarter but did most of his damage from much farther away. Randle made eight 3-pointers in surpassing his previous career high of 46 points.The Wolves made their first 10 shots and didn't cool off much the rest of the game, finishing at 61.4% and snapping a three-game skid despite playing without Anthony Edwards for a second straight game because of a sprained right ankle.“We’ve got shooters, baby,” center Rudy Gobert said.Gobert's basket made the Wolves the first team this season to make its first 10 shots, and Knicks fans loudly cheered when Jaden McDaniels missed Minnesota's next attempt, nearly seven minutes into the game. The Wolves led 42-32 after one, shooting 16 for 22 (72.7%).Prince's 3-pointer made it 70-53 with 4:35 left in the first half, but the Knicks finally put together some stops to cut it to 79-70 at the break.Then Randle came back and went 9 for 10 in the third, hitting 5 for 6 beyond the arc. He raised his hand to fault himself after the one miss, an ill-advised attempt that missed the rim by a couple feet. But he could hardly be blamed for trying the way almost everything else he threw up was going in.TIP-INSTimberwolves: Coach Chris Finch said Karl-Anthony Towns was “really, really close” to returning from his calf injury.Knicks: Swingman Josh Hart arrived for the game wearing the No. 32 jersey of his great uncle, Yankees great Elston Howard.EDWARDS UPDATEFinch said Edwards hadn’t done anything besides get treatment thus far, but the Wolves didn’t rule him out until Monday, indicating his injury isn’t as bad as originally feared. “For sure there’s some relief,” Finch said. “But you know Ant, like Ant always wants to play. He never thinks he’s hurt, so hopefully it is feeling better, which he says it is. But in terms of pain tolerance, range of movement, stability, all those things, I think we’re trying to figure out where that really is with him.”NEW COACH, FAMILIAR FACEFormer Knicks coach Rick Pitino will be back on the sidelines at Madison Square Garden for some St. John's games after being hired by the Red Storm on Monday. The school announced he'd be introduced during a news conference Tuesday at the arena.“When I was a young coach, I used to watch his practices at Providence,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “So he’s good man, great coach and I know he’ll do a great job with St. John’s.”UP NEXTTimberwolves: Host Atlanta on Wednesday.Knicks: At Miami on Wednesday. ___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

Chicago is jostling for the final playoff spot in the East.“We have a bigger goal in mind,” DeRozan said. “We’re fighting for our life every game. We’re just playing with that desperation right now.”Embiid had 37 points, 16 rebounds and three blocks before fouling out with 3:54 left in the second overtime. It was the 10th straight game in which he has scored at least 30 points.“Tonight could’ve been better,” Embiid said. “Move on and learn from it.”The teams meet again in the second game of a home-and-home on Wednesday night in Chicago.Philadelphia could’ve clinched a playoff spot with a victory, but the 76ers struggled once Embiid left the court after a foul on LaVine.“We couldn’t get anything going offensively really the whole game,” Embiid said.Tyrese Maxey hit an elbow jumper and Tobias Harris followed with a baseline jumper to put the 76ers ahead 105-101 with 2:36 left in the second OT. But those were the last points Philadelphia scored, with Embiid only able to watch from the bench.Maxey, who finished with 17 points, air-balled a pair of 3-point attempts and misfired on a drive. The 76ers still were down by just two late, but Derrick Jones Jr. blocked James Harden’s jumper and Harris missed on a chance. Coby White got the rebound and made two free throws with six seconds to play to clinch it.“Our D kind of kept us in it,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said.The 76ers had a chance to win in regulation, but Maxey’s 3 at the buzzer was off the mark.Chicago could’ve ended it after the first overtime, but DeRozan’s 3 at the buzzer went off the heel of the rim.HURTING HARDEN?Harden had one of his worst performances since joining the 76ers at the trade deadline last season, finishing with just five points while missing 12 of 14 shots, including all six 3-point attempts. He also had five turnovers.Afterward, Philadelphia coach Doc Rivers indicated that Harden’s foot was bothering him. Harden missed Saturday’s 141-121 win over the Pacers due to injury recovery.EMBIID MVP?Embiid has been stating his case for his first NBA MVP award all season. Denver’s Nikola Jokic has won the last two MVP’s, and Giannis Antetokounmpo claimed the previous two. Boston’s Jayson Tatum also is a strong candidate.Rivers said the debate around the award is too vitriolic.“Joel is the MVP,” Rivers said. “I thought he was the MVP last year. But can we stop trying to put people down? All of them are great. We don’t need to put one down to elevate the rest.”HONORING ’83The 76ers honored their 1983 championship team during a halftime ceremony. The team, led by Hall of Famer Julius “Dr. J” Erving met with the current team during shootaround on Monday morning. Rivers said it was a beneficial experience.“It was really cool,” Rivers said. “Great for me, great for our guys. Connecting teams and history is really important.”BALL’S SURGERYBulls point guard Lonzo Ball had surgery for a cartilage transplant in his left knee.“Everything went well,” Donovan said.Ball is out indefinitely after a third surgery on the knee in a little more than a year.“He has a long road to recovery,” Donovan said.Ball hasn’t played in more than a year and Chicago ruled him out for the season last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841784,Miami holds off Indiana rally to advance in March Madness,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Destiny Harden wanted the ball in her hands.After losing to eventual national champion South Carolina on the road last March, after helping her team complete a historic comeback two days earlier and after seeing top-seeded Indiana tie the score on a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left, Harden wanted to close it out.She did.Following a timeout, she got the ball into the middle of the lane and made the tie-breaking shot with 3.5 seconds left, giving ninth-seeded Miami a 70-68 road victory Monday night and its first Sweet 16 trip since 1992.“It was the exact same play as last year so I should have known it was coming to me,” Harden said. “I just thank the coaches for trusting me, the players for trusting me and it feels good to come through and get to the Sweet 16.”Monday’s stunner capped two monumental moments this weekend for Miami (21-12) and a wild second round in the NCAA Tournament with two No. 1 seeds falling in consecutive days. Stanford was upset on its home court Sunday night — marking the first time since 1998 two top seeds were eliminated before the regional semifinals.It came as a huge shock to the 14,000 fans packed into Assembly Hall. But instead of celebrating the Hoosiers taking another big step forward, the fans watched in disbelief as Miami ran around and rolled around on the Hoosiers home court as All-American center Mackenzie Holmes broke down in tears before the handshake line formed.The Hurricanes meant no disrespect.“I tell my players to act like you’ve been here before, but we haven’t been so we were being foolish,” longtime Miami coach Katie Meier said. “I looked around for any player who wanted to hug me.”Lola Pendande led Miami with 19 points and seven rebounds.Harden had 18 points including the biggest basket on a night she scored career point No. 1,000. She also played a key role in Saturday’s rally from a 17-point halftime deficit.The Hoosiers (28-4) never led in front of a raucous crowd that grew increasingly agitated with how the game was called and uneasy about how it played out. Indiana trailed from the moment Miami broke a 2-2 tie until Holmes' layup made it 58-58 with 3:53 left to play and fought its way back from a 12-point halftime deficit.Yet in the waning moments, they blew two chances to take the lead in the final 40 seconds — a missed layup from Chloe Moore-McNeil and an uncharacteristic errant midrange jumper from Grace Berger before Moore-McNeil finally tied it at 68 with a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left.But the Hoosiers couldn't stop Harden then turned the ball over on their final possession, sealing their first home loss all season and the second for Indiana basketball in two nights to Miami, whose men's team also beat Indiana in the second round.Holmes had 22 points and nine rebounds after sitting out Saturday with a sore knee. Berger finished with 17 points, six rebounds and six assists in her final home game.“It's hard to put into words right now. Obviously, I'm very upset,"" Holmes said, her voice cracking as the tears again flowed. “My last game with Grace, she shouldn't go out like this. It's been great to play with her for four years. It hurts to go out this way.”BIG PICTUREMiami: The Hurricanes completed an incredible road trip by getting just enough to hold off the hard-charging Hoosiers. A year ago, they fell short against another No. 1 seed in the second round despite holding the Gamecocks to a season-low 49 points. This time, they're harassing defense got the job done.Indiana: The best season in school history came to a shockingly early end. They won the first outright Big Ten regular-season title in school history, finished a school-best second in the final Associated Press Top 25 poll, picked up their first No. 1 seed ever and expected to be heading to Dallas. Instead, they must contemplate what life without Berger, one of the best players in school history, will look like.SHE SAID IT“It will be weird not to see Grace Berger walk through that door,” ninth-year coach Teri Moren said, referring to her fifth-year star. “She's helped build this program and you know we're not sitting here today without her. We weren't sitting here a year ago, probably three years ago without Grace Berger on this roster.""UP NEXTWhile the Hoosiers begin a long offseason, the Hurricanes head to Greenville, South Carolina, for a showdown with fourth-seeded Villanova, which was ranked No. 10 in the final Associated Press Top 25.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World

Desmond Bane finished with 17 as Memphis won its sixth in the last seven.The win, coupled with Sacramento's loss to Utah, moved Memphis into sole possession of second place in the Western Conference, 3 1/2 behind first-place Denver.Kyrie Irving led the Mavericks with 28 points but missed all eight of his shots in the fourth quarter as Memphis outscored Dallas 29-12 in the period.“Recently, we've had some (large) deficits, and we've tried to figure out how to play better in the fourth,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said.Mavs coach Jason Kidd added that Irving was running the Dallas offense and making plays, but “we just didn’t capitalize.” Part of Irving's performance in the fourth could be attributed to him hurting his foot in the third quarter. Irving was wearing a orthopedic boot in the postgame press conference saying he reaggravated a right foot problem. He said the boot was “just precautionary.”“We got some great looks, they just didn't go down tonight,” Kidd said. “When you look at those looks, we would take those.”Morant did not dress for the game but was on the Memphis bench, coming out to a hearty ovation from the fans just before tipoff. The NBA assessed the suspension after a video from a Denver-area strip club earlier this month showed Morant brandishing a gun.Meanwhile, the Mavericks were again without leading-scorer Luka Doncic, who missed his fifth game with left thigh soreness.That left the Dallas offensive surge to Irving, picked up in a trade deadline deal, along with Christian Wood, who scored 20, as did rookie Jaden Hardy.Dallas built its lead to 16 points in the third quarter, but Memphis crafted a 24-7 run in the fourth, and the game settled into an exchange of leads for both teams until the Grizzlies pulled away.“I thought we were sloppy. We weren't fully engaged,” Jenkins said of the early problems. “Our heads weren't in the right place in the first three quarters, and you can see a (opponent’s) 16-point lead grow.”The Mavericks carried a 60-57 lead into halftime, led by 20 points from Irving. The third quarter belonged to Dallas, stretching lead to 96-83 as Hardy scored 10 in the stanza, while the Mavericks shot 62%.But Memphis turned things around in the fourth as Hardy made the only three field goals Dallas converted in the final frame.“In a situation like that, it's kind of do-or-die at the start of the fourth quarter,” said Grizzlies guard Tyus Jones, who finished with 16 points and six assists. “You've got to go on a run to bring the game back in striking distance.”TIP-INSMavericks: Doncic's absence marked the eighth time in 17 games since acquiring Irving at the trade deadline that one or both of the All-Stars has been out. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841786,Japan's Kishida heading to Ukraine for talks with Zelenskyy,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida was heading to Kyiv early Tuesday for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that coincide with the Chinese leader's visit to Moscow.Kishida will “show respect to the courage and patience of the Ukrainian people who are standing up to defend their homeland under President Zelenskyy's leadership, and show solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine as head of Japan and chairman of G-7,” during his visit to Ukraine, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in announcing his trip to Kyiv.At the talks, Kishida will show his “absolute rejection to Russia's one-sided change to the status quo by invasion and force, and to affirm his commitment to defend the rules-based international order,” the ministry's statement said.Chinese leader Xi Jinping, meanwhile, is in Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Xi to the Kremlin on a visit both nations describe as an opportunity to deepen their “no-limits friendship.”Japan’s public television NHK showed Kishida riding a train from Poland heading to Kyiv. His surprise trip to Ukraine comes just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.Kishida, who is to chair the Group of Seven summit in May, is the only G-7 leader who hasn’t visited Ukraine and was under pressure to do so at home. U.S. President Joe Biden took a similar route to visit Kyiv last month, just before the first anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Due to limitations of Japan's pacifist constitution, his trip was arranged secretly. Kishida is Japan's first postwar leader to enter a war zone. Kishida, invited by Zelenskyy in January to visit Kyiv, was also asked before his trip to India about a rumor of his possible trip at the end of March, denied it and said nothing concrete has been decided.Japan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine.Japan was quick to react because it fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.Kishida is expected to offer continuing support for Ukraine when he meets with Zelenskyy.Television footage on NHK showed Kishida getting on a train from the Polish station of Przemysl near the border with Ukraine, with a number of officials.Due to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has also been limited to non-combative military equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests and drones, and humanitarian supplies including generators.Japan has contributed to Ukraine more than $7 billion, and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance and support for jobs and education — a rare move for a country that is known for its strict immigration policy.",2023/03/21,,World

It’s been a while.”When told that it had been almost three months since the Warriors last got a victory on the road, Kerr continued.“Thanks,” he said. “That doesn’t make me feel any better. We needed it.”Added Thompson: “It’s nice to snap an ugly streak like that. That (was) gross.”The Rockets used an 11-2 run, led by six points from Kevin Porter Jr., later in the fourth to get within seven with about two minutes to go. But Thompson made a 3-pointer to start a 5-0 run that made it 118-106 with a minute remaining.The Warriors, who moved into sixth place in the Western Conference with the win, have been great at home this season (29-7) but have struggled on the road, where Monday’s win improved them to just 8-29.Monday was the fourth game of a season-high-tying five-game road trip that started with losses against the Clippers, Hawks and Grizzlies.“We know we still have to play better,” Curry said. “Nobody’s really celebrating anything.”Kerr was disappointed with the way the Warriors played in the first half, when they had 14 turnovers.“We were not focused at all,” he said. “The second half we did a better job of taking care of the ball and getting some better possessions offensively.”The Western Conference-worst Rockets got 21 points and 12 rebounds from Tari Eason. Jalen Green added 20 on a night when they dropped their second in a row following a season-long three-game winning streak.Houston rookie Jabari Smith Jr. talked about why things got away from the Rockets in the fourth quarter.“Just us being careless a little bit,” he said. “Fatigue set in a little bit from playing (Sunday) against that tough Pelicans team. We fought ... but came up short.”A 3-pointer by Daishen Nix got the Rockets within three early in the fourth quarter before the Warriors scored the next eight points, with 3s from Curry and Anthony Lamb, to make it 98-87 with about nine minutes to go.Josh Christopher made a layup for Houston, but the Warriors took advantage of turnovers on consecutive possessions to score four quick points and push the lead to 102-89 with 7 1/2 minutes to go.Eason added a basket for the Rockets after a timeout. But Golden State used a 6-2 surge, with 3-pointers from Thompson and Lamb, to make it 108-93 midway through the quarter.Houston led by one after a 3-pointer by Usman Garuba with about 2 1/2 minutes left.The Warriors ended the quarter with a 7-2 run, with five points from Jonathan Kuminga, to take an 84-80 lead into the fourth.TIP-INSWarriors: Andrew Wiggins remained out because of a family matter, the team said. … Kuminga had 17 points off the bench. … Kevon Looney had 11 points and 10 rebounds despite dealing with back soreness. … Golden State made 17 of 48 3-pointers.Rockets: Alperen Sengun missed the game with an illness. … Jae’Sean Tate sat out for ankle injury management. … Smith had 17 points and 11 rebounds. ...

Shota Imanaga will start for Japan — Yu Darvish had been set to pitch before a change was announced postgame. Merrill Kelly is likely to start for Team USA, which has won the WBC once.After the game, members of Team Japan rushed the field in triumph, as Mexico players exited with their heads bowed and hands on their hips.“These games are really critical and the foundation of baseball,” Japan manager Hideki Kuriyama said through an interpreter.Ohtani went 2 for 4. The Los Angeles Angels star scored in the seventh when Masataka Yoshida hit a tying, three-run homer off reliever JoJo Romero.Ohtani’s double off losing pitcher Giovanny Gallegos was his fourth of the tournament. He’s batting .450 with nine hits, nine runs and eight RBIs. After Ohtani got the rally started, Yoshida walked to bring up Murakami.In front of a crowd of 35,933 that chanted “¡Si Se Puede!” — translating to “Yes We Can!” — throughout the night, left fielder Randy Arozarena had a signature performance for Mexico. He made a leaping catch in the fifth to preserve a 3-0 lead, signed a few mid-inning autographs, then doubled and scored in the eighth to make it 4-3.“Randy was incredible today,” Mexico manager Benji Gil said. “He gave us the opportunity to come back to the game after a home run that many teams facing this kind of team with so many stars, they could have given up, but, no, he started this rally. We fought. Again, we took the lead. They are warriors.”The game began as a pitching duel between Rōki Sasaki and Patrick Sandoval, but Japan's offensive power proved too much for Mexico's relievers.Sasaki struck out three in four innings in his first appearance on a global stage.Dozens of MLB club officials were in attendance scouting Sasaki, who's entry into the majors is all-but-certainly forthcoming in the future after he became a sensation last year in his second season with the Pacific League’s Chiba Lotte Marines. Many are already mentioning the 21-year-old right-hander in the class of his Samurai Japan teammate, Ohtani.Twenty six of Sasaki’s 64 pitches eclipsed 100 mph.In the fourth, Luis Urías launched Sasaki’s 90.8 mph cutter for a three-run homer to left-center field. The drive scored Rowdy Tellez and Isaac Paredes, who reached with two of the five hits Sasaki gave up.Sandoval struck out six and allowed just four hits in four scoreless innings before he was replaced by José Urquidy.Japan, which trails only Cuba (64) and the U.S. (63) in hits during the tournament, had 10 Monday night, including Yoshida’s home run off Romero’s 2-2 changeup that sailed just inside the right field foul line.Yoshida is about to start his first season in the major leagues with Boston. Over the weekend, Red Sox manager Alex Cora said Yoshida will start out as the team's cleanup hitter.“I know my hand was a little shivering, but I know that there was a good connection,” Yoshida said through a translator. “I believe in myself, and I remember I stepped into the box with a belief in myself.”Paredes gave Mexico a two-run cushion in the eighth when he singled to left field to drive in Jarren Duran. But Japan pulled within a run on a sacrifice fly by Hotaka Yamakawa that scored Takumu Nakano, who was pinch-running for Kazuma Okamoto.OHTANI’S BP BLASTOhtani doesn’t usually take batting practice on the field. He did Monday and smashed a ball with so much force that it soared above the second deck at loanDepot park and bounced off the video board, making a loud thud when it landed. Hundred of young fans gravitated toward the loanDepot Park sign where the ball was hit.AROZARENA’S PREGAME OUTFITArozarena wore a large sombrero and cowboy boots while shagging flies before the game, representing the country he settled in during his early 20s after he defected from Cuba. He also posed with Ohtani.TRAINERS ROOMJapan SS Sosuke Genda played with a broken right pinky finger.UP NEXTThe WBC final at loanDepot Park in Miami starts at 7:05 p.m. EDT Tuesday.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841840,Safety board: Alabama derailed train lacked needed couplers,"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) — A Norfolk Southern train that derailed in Alabama earlier this month lacked required alignment control couplers for two of its locomotives and a company inspection did not identify their absence, federal investigators said Monday.The notation comes in one of three preliminary reports issued Monday by the National Transportation Safety Board about Norfolk Southern train accidents this month as the board investigates the railroad’s safety practices after the fiery February derailment and toxic chemical burn in East Palestine, Ohio.In a report released Monday about a March 9 derailment of two locomotives and 37 rail cars in Anniston, Alabama, the safety board said two of the train’s six locomotives were “waybill locomotives,” or towed cars not used for any tractive power. The cars weren’t equipped with alignment control couplers that “resist lateral coupler movement under compressive in-train forces.” A company rule bars towing waybill locomotives without such couplers, the report said.The waybill locomotives were coupled together and picked up from Bluffton, Indiana, on Feb. 24 and a Norfolk Southern inspection before the first movement involving the coupled locomotives “did not identify the absence of alignment control couplers,” the safety board said.A company spokesperson said in an e-mail Monday that “these locomotives were not owned by Norfolk Southern and the couplers on these locomotives are not common on our network.”“We have taken immediate action to update our manuals with photos and details to implement training with our crews. Safety is a priority at NS and we’ll continue working with the NTSB to identify the final cause of this derailment and implement any other necessary changes,” said Connor Spielmaker, a senior communications manager with Norfolk Southern.No injuries were reported; three derailed tank cars were carrying hazardous material residue but all remained intact, the report said. The safety board said future investigation will focus on Norfolk Southern “communication, maintenance, and inspection practices” as well as locomotive and railcar positioning and train handling.The safety board also said it was examining industry-wide standards and practices regarding railcar wheel and axle assemblies after a train derailment in Ohio earlier this month. Eight wheelsets were recovered from two of the 28 Norfolk Southern railcars that derailed March 4 near Springfield. Photographs taken after the derailment showed three wheels from the eight wheelsets “exhibited movement on their axles,” the board said.Five days after that derailment, the Association of American Railroads issued an equipment inspection order advising railroads to remove from service — wheelsets mounted by National Steel Car between August and March. The association said railroads nationwide initially identified 675 cars affected by the advisory and pulled them off the tracks.The wheelsets and other material from the crash along with wheelsets from elsewhere in the Norfolk Southern fleet have been undergoing analysis since last Wednesday at a Norfolk Southern facility in Altoona, the safety board said.“Future investigative activity will focus on failure analysis of the subject wheelsets and on industry-wide standards and practices for railcar wheel and axle assembly processes, specifications, and quality control,” the safety board said Monday.Soon after the Springfield crash, the safety board announced a broad look at Norfolk Southern's safety culture — the first such investigation within the rail industry since 2014 — and said it had sent investigation teams to look into five significant accidents involving Norfolk Southern since December 2021.In a preliminary report on a March 7 accident that killed a Norfolk Southern conductor when a train and dump truck collided as they simultaneously entered a private rail crossing at a Cleveland steel plant, the safety board said the train was going 9 mph (14 kph), less than the 10 mph (16 kph) limit within the Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. steel plant. The Federal Railroad administration later urged proper training, oversight and crew communication at highway–railroad grade crossings.Following the Feb. 3 derailment outside East Palestine, Ohio, Norfolk Southern announced plans to improve the use of detectors placed along railroad tracks to spot overheating bearings and other problems. Investigators have said the crew got a warning from such a detector but couldn’t stop the train before more than three dozen cars came off the tracks and caught fire.Half of the town of about 5,000 had to evacuate for days when responders intentionally burned toxic chemicals in some derailed cars to prevent an uncontrolled explosion, leaving residents with lingering health concerns. Government officials say tests haven’t found dangerous levels of chemicals in the air or water in the area.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841841,UConn beats Baylor 77-58 for 29th straight trip to Sweet 16,"STORRS, Conn. (AP) — Azzi Fudd is still rounding back into form after missing 22 games with injuries this season.She's only been back for five games and hadn't looked like the player that was dominating the game before suffering two knee injuries.But after going 2 of 8 from the floor in the first half Monday night, the sophomore guard scored 16 of her game-high 22 points in a decisive third quarter, leading second-seeded UConn to a 77-58 win over No. 7 seed Baylor on Monday night. That put the Huskies in a 29th straight Sweet 16.Fudd said she just stayed confident and her shots began to fall.“I definitely wouldn’t say (I took) the team on my back, I think everyone played an incredible role tonight,” Fudd said. “But I think (I just kept) that mindset of being aggressive and having my teammates and coaches continue to remind me, ’Don’t stop shooting, keep shooting, keep looking for your shots.”Aaliyah Edwards added 19 points, Aubrey Griffin pulled down 12 rebounds and Nika Muhl had 10 assists for the Huskies (31-5). Dorka Juhasz chipped in with 11 points and Caroline Ducharme added 10 points.Ja'mee Asberry scored 15 points and Jaden Owens had 14 for Baylor, which finishes its season 20-13. Bella Fontleroy scored 12 points for the Bears, who made 12 3-pointers after hitting 14 in their first-round win over Alabama.But the Huskies dominated inside, outscoring the Bears 36-12 in the paint and outrebounding Baylor 42-31.“I think we settled for too many jump shots,” Baylor coach Nicki Collen said. “We don't want to be 50% of our shots from three. But when they have that size and they're backing up, there's a time and place. Sometimes that's the best shot you're going to get against them.”UConn will play Ohio State in the regional semifinals in Seattle. The Buckeyes held on to beat North Carolina by two points earlier on Monday.The Huskies led by five points at halftime after a shot from just over the half-court line by Muhl.But Edwards, who had 12 first-half points, picked up her fourth foul less than three minutes into the second half.A steal and a layup from Asberry cut the UConn lead to 44-43 and a 3-pointer by Owens tied the game at 46.Fudd then took over. She hit seven of her 12 shots in the third, helping UConn go on a decisive 16-2 run that put the game away.“In that third quarter, we made a concerted effort to make sure (Azzi) touched it in certain spots on the floor and then she did the rest,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “And Nika's great at finding her no matter where she is. And she doesn't hesitate.”The Huskies led 62-50 after three quarters and outscored Baylor 15-8 in the fourth.The game was close early with Baylor holding a 24-18 lead after one quarter. The Huskies clamped down on the perimeter defense and opened the second quarter on a 17-2 run to take a 35-26 advantage.Edwards hit six of her first seven shots, but picked up her third foul late in the second quarter. Baylor fought back and trailed 37-35 after a 3-pointer from Jaden Owens.But just before the half was about to end, Muhl took two steps over half court and heaved a shot that found the bottom of the net.THE OTHER PLAYER OF THE GAMEGriffin scored just four points and when she wasn’t playing, she was on a stationary bike, wrapped in a special heating brace to help her deal with back spasms. On the court, six of her 12 rebounds were on the offensive end and she added three assists, a block and a steal in 19 minutes.“If I could say who was MVP of the game today, that was definitely Aubrey,” Muhl said.BIG PICTUREBaylor: The Bears also lost in the second round last year, falling to South Dakota at home, but Collen said she believes her program is on track to be among the best in the nation next season.“I think we have a chance to be really special,” she said. “Obviously the portal's hopping and you never know who's coming and who is going and we won't look exactly the same a year from now, but I think we'll be able to compete with anyone and that's the plan.”UConn: The Huskies haven't lost a first or second round NCAA tournament game since 1993, going 44-0 in Gampel Pavilion since then and 16-0 in other arenas. The Huskies are looking for a 15th straight trip to the Final Four and a 12th national title.UP NEXTUConn last lost in the Sweet 16 in 2005, falling to Stanford in Kansas City. They will be looking for a 23rd consecutive trip to a regional final.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841842,Federal judge blocks key parts of California handgun law,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked key provisions of a California law that drastically restricts the sale of new handguns in the state, saying parts of the legislation violate the Second Amendment.A lawsuit challenging the law was filed last year by the California Rifle & Pistol Association and other gun rights supporters following a landmark 2022 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court that set new standards for evaluating firearm restrictions. The ruling left many laws aimed at regulating and limiting the sale and use of guns — in California and nationwide — at risk of being struck down.U.S. District Court Judge Cormac Carney, sitting in Santa Ana, wrote Monday that California's requirements for new handguns are unconstitutional and cannot be enforced. Because of these restrictions, Carney wrote, no new models of semiautomatic handguns have been approved for sale since 2013 and Californians are forced to buy older and potentially less safe models.He issued a preliminary injunction to take effect in two weeks, meaning the state would have to stop enforcing the law. The delay gives the state Department of Justice time to appeal.“The fact of the matter is, California’s gun safety laws save lives, and California’s Unsafe Handgun Act is no exception,” Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. “We will continue to lead efforts to advance and defend California’s gun safety laws. As we move forward to determine next steps in this case, Californians should know that this injunction has not gone into effect and that California’s important gun safety requirements related to the Unsafe Handgun Act remain in effect.”In California, state law requires new handguns to have three components: A chamber load indicator, which shows whether the gun is loaded; a magazine disconnect mechanism that will stop the gun from firing if the magazine is not properly inserted; and microstamping capability so law enforcement can more easily link spent shell casings to the guns they were fired from.""No handgun available in the world has all three of these features,” the judge wrote. “These regulations are having a devastating impact on Californians’ ability to acquire and use new, state-of-the-art handguns.”Older handguns have been grandfathered into what’s known as the “roster,” or a list of guns that pass a safety test under state law known as the Unsafe Handgun Act.“Californians have the constitutional right to acquire and use state-of-the-art handguns to protect themselves,” he wrote. “They should not be forced to settle for decade-old models of handguns to ensure that they remain safe inside or outside the home.”Previous attempts to challenge the state law, filed before last year's Supreme Court ruling, failed.Chuck Michel, head of the California Rifle & Pistol Association, said the three requirements were “impossible to satisfy.”“For decades this ‘roster’ law has deprived law-abiding citizens of the right to choose a handgun appropriate for their individual needs,” he wrote in a statement Monday. “If we can hold on to this great Second Amendment win, people will be able to choose from among thousands of the latest, greatest, and safest handguns made today.”Only New York also has a similar microstamping requirement, according to gun congrol group Everytown for Gun Safety.The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the trade association for the firearms industry, hailed the preliminary injunction in a statement Monday.“For too long, the Second Amendment has been significantly infringed upon by elected officials who have taken every opportunity to put roadblocks in front of law-abiding citizens seeking to exercise their Second Amendment rights,” said Lawrence Keane, the organization's senior vice president. “The order is the first step in what will be a protracted legal battle, but it is a significant win.”__Associated Press Writer Lindsay Whitehurst in Washington, D.C., contributed.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841843,Scott Robertson to succeed Ian Foster as All Blacks coach,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Scott Robertson, coach of the successful Crusaders Super Rugby team, will take over as All Blacks head coach after the Rugby World Cup in France in October, regardless of how the New Zealand team performs.New Zealand Rugby confirmed Robertson’s appointment at a news conference Tuesday, ending a contentious selection process which has been criticized by incumbent head coach Ian Foster.Foster will lead the All Blacks to the world tournament in France, knowing he will lose his job even in New Zealand wins the world title for the fourth time.Robertson was one of only two candidates or combinations seeking the coaching role. The other was Jamie Joseph, the former Highlanders and current Japan head coach, who sought the job as a team with his assistant Tony Brown. Robertson, Joseph and Brown all are former All Blacks.Robertson had pushed for an early decision on the coaching job and NZR moved early out of concern Robertson would be targeted by overseas teams.“It’s an honor to be named as the next All Blacks head coach,” Robertson said. “It’s a job that comes with a huge amount of responsibility but I’m excited by the opportunity to make a contribution to the legacy of the black jersey.""Robertson said the early announcement of his appointment would allow him to immediately begin to prepare to take over the team later this year. He has been appointed through the 2027 World Cup.“Having significant time to plan for 2024 and beyond is crucial to setting the All Blacks up for success during the next World Cup cycle,” he said. “I have a job to do with the Crusaders and that will be my main focus through to the completion of Super Rugby.“But I will now have the opportunity to work with NZR to get some key appointments in my coaching and management team finalized so we can hit the ground running next year.”Robertson said he has spoken to Foster about their respective roles through the World Cup.“Look we’re very professional in that regard,” Robertson said. “The coaching profession is really brutal . . . my first thing is to pick up the phone and be a man first before anything else.”Foster already has made clear his bitterness at the way in which the appointment has been handled.A poor 2022 season in which New Zealand lost at home to Ireland and Argentina increased pressure on NZR to consider replacing Foster.He came close to being dismissed and Robertson was on the verge of appointment. But the All Blacks’ Rugby Championship win over South Africa on Johannesburg caused NZR to publicly endorse him as head coach through the World Cup.In a statement earlier this month, Foster said “I felt the best thing for our team and for our entire management group was to have this process done after the Rugby World Cup. That hasn’t happened but we will accept the decision and move on.”Foster said he intended to seek reappointment but changed his mind when NZR announced it would choose his successor before the World Cup, a clear indication he would not be supported for another term.He was first appointed after the 2019 World Cup when he replaced Steve Hansen, to whom he was a long-time assistant. Robertson also was a candidate to succeed Hansen in 2019 but was not even granted an interview.Crusaders teams coached by Robertson since have dominated Super Rugby in its various formats before, during and after the pandemic. He was a popular in 2019 and remains so.Robertson’s critics say he always has coached teams which were successful before he took charge and has not been tested by coaching an under-performing side. There are also concerns that he might favor Crusaders players as has happened in the past when coaches had an affiliation to the Christchurch-based team.“We congratulate Scott on his appointment and look forward to working together in 2024,” New Zealand Rugby said in a statement. “But have also been clear that New Zealand Rugby’s full support this year will be focused on the current All Blacks coaching team as we look toward the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.——- More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841844,Colorado knocks off Duke in OT in March Madness thriller,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Colorado made enough big plays to survive.It was a pretty sweet moment for Quay Miller and the Buffaloes.Miller had 17 points and 14 rebounds, and Aaronette Vonleh converted two overtime baskets in the lane after picking up her fourth foul, helping No. 6 seed Colorado beat third-seeded Duke 61-53 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Monday night.“Our ability to just never wilt,” Colorado coach JR Payne said. “When things get hard, we dig in. We lean into each other.”Jaylyn Sherrod had 14 points and Vonleh finished with 12 as the Buffaloes (25-8) advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 20 years.Colorado outscored Duke 11-3 in overtime after the Blue Devils made a big push in the second half.“I think the best thing that we did was just embrace it,” Miller said. “Even though the crowd was going against us, it’s a beautiful environment and we thrive off that. We’ve been underdogs all season.”Colorado held Duke without a field goal for almost seven minutes to end the game. By the end, the Buffaloes were celebrating with the pep band in the stands after quieting the home crowd.“I just love being the bad guy, and feed off of that and I think the team feeds off that, too,” Sherrod said. “We’ve been in a lot of those situations, so I don’t think it’s anything that shocked us.”Elizabeth Balogun scored 14 points and Reigan Richardson had 10, but the Blue Devils didn’t hit a field goal in overtime. Duke (26-7) overcame a 13-point deficit in regulation.“They were better in that five-minute stretch and that’s why they’re moving on,” Duke coach Kara Lawson said. “It hurts to come up short at this time of the year, but I’m really proud of my group and the season that they’ve had.”Next up for Colorado is Caitlin Clark and Iowa in the Seattle 4 Region semifinals.“I knew we could do it, it was just a matter of actually doing it,” Miller said. “Right now, I just feel extremely blessed. I guess I’m still taking it all in.”Duke lost for the third time in its last four second-round home games in the NCAA tourney.Sherrod scored on a drive with 33.9 seconds left in regulation, but missed a free throw to leave the game tied at 50-all.That capped a hectic stretch.Balogun made a corner 3 and Vanessa de Jesus scored on a fast break as Duke turned a three-point deficit into a 48-46 lead with 3:34 to go.Celeste Taylor’s layup pushed Duke’s advantage to 50-46 before Sherrod’s drive gave Colorado its first points in more than 3½ minutes. The Buffaloes got a defensive stop, called timeout and set up Sherrod’s tying basket.Colorado led 32-26 at halftime, boosted by Miller’s 15 points. The teams combined for 24 first-half turnovers, with Duke committing 13 of them.Taylor finished with eight points, eight assists, 10 rebounds and 10 steals in a terrific all-around performance for Duke. She played a key role in sparking the school's turnaround after the Blue Devils had gone without an NCAA tourney win since 2018.“What this group has done is really changed how we’re looked at, I think, after some down years,” Lawson said.BIG PICTUREColorado: The Buffaloes hadn’t won an NCAA Tournament game since 2003 before Saturday night’s victory over Middle Tennessee.Duke: It was a bitter end as the Blue Devils crumbled on offense. They shot 31.7% from the field and committed 21 turnovers.TIP-INSColorado was in its fourth game that extended into overtime, improving to 2-2. Duke played beyond 40 minutes for the first time this season. ... Vonleh picked up her third foul 11 seconds into the second half and didn’t get another one until overtime. ... Duke finished 14-2 at home, with the other loss to rival North Carolina to end the regular season.UP NEXTColorado will play second-seeded Iowa on Friday.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll",2023/03/21,,World

The Jazz extended their lead to 24 before halftime, going up 59-35 when Olynyk capped a 7-0 run with a corner 3.“We were able to use our pace. It’s been a huge emphasis for us since the trade deadline to try to play faster,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said. “We fed off our defense.

Logan O’Connor and Kurtis MacDermid also scored.Georgiev’s fifth shutout of the season and No. 13 for his career lifted Colorado (41-22-6) into a tie with idle Minnesota for second place in the Central Division with 88 points, one behind Dallas. The Avalanche have played one less game than the Wild and Stars.“We’ve been in this position before where we’ve tracked down the teams in front of us, got real close and then didn’t handle it properly,” coach Jared Bednar said. “Had a little dip in our game. We’re trying to learn from that.”Alex Stalock stopped 27 shots for Chicago, which has dropped two straight.“I thought he was good,” coach Luke Richardson said of Stalock. “In the first period he made that big save on (Nathan) MacKinnon to keep it at 1-0.”Colorado star Cale Makar was scratched, but he is considered day to day with an undisclosed injury. His absence meant the Avs played without three of their top six defensemen. Josh Manson (lower body) has missed three weeks, and Erik Johnson (broken ankle) hasn’t played since Feb. 11.MacDermid replaced Makar in the lineup and took advantage when his goal at 2:45 of the first period ricocheted off the knee of Blackhawks defenseman Ian Mitchell and by Stalock.Malgin made it 2-0 at 6:17 of the second, and Rantanen’s power-play goal midway through the period gave Colorado a three-goal lead.“I think the first two periods we actually had some good chances,” Chicago defenseman Caleb Jones said. “They obviously had a couple there and got one on the power play, but they’re a good team and keep coming at you.”O’Connor and Malgin scored 14 seconds apart late in the third to blow it open. It was Malgin’s 10th of the season.“We’re in a good stretch,” Malgin said. “I hope we can keep it going and keep getting better and better.""Georgiev needed just five saves in the third period to earn the shutout. He has allowed just two goals in his last three games, including a shootout win at Toronto on Wednesday night.“The team is playing great right now and you try to appreciate when things are working out for you,” he said.MAN DOWNColorado winger Evan Rodrigues didn’t play in the third period after getting checked along the boards by Blackhawks defenseman Jarred Tinordi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841850,6 taboos for spring equinox in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Tuesday (March 21) of the lunisolar calendar is Chunfen (春分), the spring equinox, and during this time traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dictates that to balance yin and yang energy one should avoid extremes and excess by observing six taboos.In a Facebook post uploaded on Friday (March 17), numerology expert Hsiao Meng (小孟) pointed out this year's vernal equinox was at 5:24 a.m. on March 21. Hsiao Meng said on Chunfen, the length of day and night are equal in much of the world except for the poles, and after this period in the Northern Hemisphere, the days will become longer than the nights.The lunisolar calendar's 24 solar terms are distinguished by the sun's exposure to the earth. Because the earth rotates 360 degrees around the sun for a year, a solar term corresponds to every 15 degrees of rotation.After Chunfen passes, Hsiao Meng said yang chi (陽氣, yang energy) will start to rise, so the key to staying healthy on this day is to raise yang chi. He suggested it is necessary to nourish and take care of the liver to help this.He recommended people eat more green foods and fresh vegetables, such as cauliflower, edamame, and cabbage. People can also drink goji berry (wolfberry) tea, chrysanthemum tea, and osmanthus tea, which can nourish the liver and fortify the body.1. Spicy or cold foodsChunfen is half of yin and yang, so day and night are equal, and cold and heat are equal. Therefore, he advised people to not consume spicy foods, cold drinks, or ice cream, and to beware of signs of physical discomfort.2. Strenuous exerciseAs Chunfen is marked by semi-cold and semi-hot conditions, strenuous exercise is discouraged and people have to beware of cardiovascular problems.3. Visiting hospital patientsIt is not advisable to visit hospital patients on Chunfen because it is regarded as the beginning of the year in some countries and ""the whole year's planning lies in the spring."" Some Taiwanese believe that visiting the sick on this day could bring bad luck or illness for the whole year.4, Excessive sexChunfen is the day when the seasons are transitioning. Therefore, it is not advisable to have excessive sex on this day. Otherwise, one may become weak and catch a cold easily. Due to the large temperature fluctuations on this day, people are also advised to exercise caution when going outside.5. Fast drivingAvoid driving fast on Chunfen as traffic accidents are likely to occur due to heavy fog.6. Morning mountain climbingDo not go on an early morning mountain climb on this day because the weather is often foggy and will be worse the higher up the mountain one goes. Heavy fog in the mountains makes it easy to lose sight of the trail and could lead to accidents.In addition, the heavy humidity makes mountain paths more slippery and hikers can lose their footing.3 Dos:1. Stand an egg upThe spring equinox starts at 5:24 a.m. on March 21, and it is recommended that people stand eggs upright to ensure good luck all year round.2. Run waterAt 5:24 a.m. on March 21, pour water from a dispenser or tap. Drink the water from a cup and wash one's face. This represents the beginning of spring.3. Eat suncakesAncient emperors would worship the sun on the spring equinox and the moon on the autumn equinox. On Chunfen, it is recommended that people eat suncakes (太陽餅) at 5:24 a.m. on March 21 to welcome the spring equinox and it will also enable one to absorb good magnetic fields brought by the sunlight in spring.",2023/03/21,2765,Culture

Horii, the director of the LDP's Foreign Affairs Division, shared Japan's new “free and open” Indo-Pacific strategy, pointing out that the strategy has four key points, the first of which is the rule of law in the region, Liberty Times reported. One-sided changes to the status quo such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine must be opposed, he said.
Second, regional cooperation is divided into three areas, including how countries respond to climate change, international health issues, and fake news, he said.
Third, all countries and regions must be connected at multiple levels to achieve prosperity, Horii added.










Fourth, in terms of security, Japan will pay more attention to airspace issues, rather than focusing solely on maritime security. In this regard, Japan must strengthen international cooperation in regional security.
This strategy has been endorsed by many countries, including Taiwan, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, and ASEAN countries, Liberty Times cited the politician as saying. The international community must cooperate to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, East Asia, and the Indo-Pacific, he said.
Horii said he strongly expects Tuesday’s 2+2 dialogue will contribute to regional peace and development.
Kokuba, the head of the LDP's National Defense Division, said that Japan and Taiwan share universal values and the friendship and affection between the two countries run deep. He praised bilateral relations, saying it demonstrates the two countries’ determination to contribute to regional peace and stability.
Additionally, Kokuba said Japan’s new national security strategy and defense planning reports published in December are vital to Japan's security and diplomacy. It was the first time in nine years that the strategy was revised, he noted.
The content concerning Taiwan was greatly increased, he added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841881,Southeast Asia SME Software Market Size Forecast Projected To Garner Significant Revenues By 2031,"It seems that Report Ocean has published a market research report on the Southeast Asia SME Software industry, covering over 150 countries and analyzing more than 1,00000 published and forthcoming reports every year. The report was prepared by subject matter experts, researchers, and market research professionals to ensure that the information is compiled from authentic sources and the forecast is highly accurate. The report utilizes various methodologies and analytical approaches, including S.W.O.T. and P.E.S.T.E.L. analysis, and regression analysis, to forecast market growth. The report also examines the regulations and policies that the industry has implemented. The report discusses the industry’s research technology and potential future advancements in the Southeast Asia SME Software  industry.
The Southeast Asia SME software market held a market value of USD 6,326 million in 2021 and is estimated to reach USD 11,505.9 million by the year 2030. The market is projected to list a CAGR of 7.1% during the forecast period.

The Southeast Asia region’s market expansion is being driven by the increased emphasis on customer engagement among organisations and expanding adoption from SME’s, assisted by flexible pricing tactics supplied by providers. According to SoftClouds (a distributor of technology solutions and digital transformation), 82% of businesses utilise CRM solutions for sales process automation and sales reporting. CRM software, according to Salesforce, helps companies increase employee productivity, improve customer engagement and retention, and gain other business benefits. CRM in sales, according to Cloudswave, can enhance the number of purchases clients make with the company. These characteristics are likely to support regional market growth.
Growth Influencers:
Increasing need from SME to manage and optimize businesses
To capitalise on the increased smartphone usage, new firms in the region have adopted e-commerce business methods. As a result, market vendors have been exposed to several opportunities to expand their client base. Furthermore, retailers have been experimenting with consumer data in order to forecast patterns, customer preferences, and extract insights when combined with other data assets. As a result, these businesses have begun combining consumer insights with location data (GIS) to gain fresh insights into where and how customers shop.
Furthermore, omnichannel retailers have been at the forefront of developing consumer segmentations into core shopper profiles in order to respond to where and how each category behaves. For example, Bata, a consumer goods retailer, expanded its omnichannel CRM tactics in the Philippines and Vietnam in collaboration with Singapore-based Capillary Technologies. Following deployment, the company realised 2.2x greater returns from focused marketing in Singapore and 57x ROI from Facebook-based campaigns in Malaysia. Capillary’s Insights and Engage Platform were used by Bata to benefit from unified campaigns and accurate bespoke targeting to name a few.
Increased Efficiency Offered by Accounting Software
Most accounting software, particularly for SMEs, is now cloud-based, making it simple to implement and operate from anywhere. Larger organisations may prefer enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems if they require software that can manage not only accounting but also other areas such as inventory management in a single application. Accounting software, on the other hand, frequently provides the functionality and convenience of use, with more advanced features than Excel, enabling SMEs to manage areas such as budgets, payrolls, and others. Accounting software is generally adaptable and adjustable to an organization’s demands, so whatever accounting/bookkeeping tasks you need assistance with, chances are there’s software that can help. If nothing off the shelf fulfils your requirements, you can design custom accounting software in-house or with a third-party.

The rapid acceptance of satellite mapping technology, as well as its seamless integration into smartphones and Internet of Things (IoT)-connected devices, is driving market revenue growth. The growing use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in 3D mapping, environmental monitoring, machine control, accident investigation, and disaster response to meet the demand for accurate and up-to-date spatial data is driving the mobile mapping market. With the support of the latest 5G internet, the mobile mapping market is encouraging the development of innovative ways for automated and quick data collecting. Digital piracy and data security issues continue to be significant challenges for mobile mapping companies. Mobile mapping data servers store information about municipal planning, transportation, and utility management.
There is a possibility of data hacking, and these data may be exposed by cyberattacks such as phishing, malware, and spam. Some pirates hack into accounts to steal genuine users’ credentials, which can then be sold on the dark web. The risk of data breach and data confidentiality are projected to limit revenue development in the mobile mapping market. Access to public data is strictly regulated by governments in various regions. For example, the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has enforced requirements.
Growth Influencers:
Increasing investment in city planning and smart city projects
Smart cities are rapidly expanding as a result of increased urbanisation and supported government initiatives around the world. A smart city cannot exist without a 3D map.

Furthermore, the improved 5G technology connectivity has unlocked bandwidths of more than 1 GHz, providing quality of service to both users and mobile mapping technology suppliers through a decrease in latency with real-time data transmission. Mobile mapping companies can now depict GIS assets with precise and scalable 3D representations of objects such as buildings, trees, and light posts, as well as night vision photos, thanks to 5G technology. Increased investments in city planning and smart city projects, as well as advancements in 5G internet access, are likely to accelerate this trend.
Increasing demand for terrestrial mobile mapping in logistics and transportation especially for aging population
In applications such as transportation, utility management, and city planning, the mobile mapping market is providing new capabilities for creating new databases and updating old databases. Companies such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and others are continuing to use mobile mapping technology for aerial photogrammetry or terrestrial surveying with the use of 360? long-lasting real sense camera (LiDAR). Companies such as Google, for example, have deployed an estimated fleet of 1,000+ trucks in the United States to provide internet map data. These technological improvements in converting geographical landscape data patterns into real-time 3D visualisation models are propelling the mobile mapping market’s revenue growth.

Over the course of the forecast period, increasing government laws for environmental protection, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, are anticipated to boost the growth of the environmental health and safety (EHS) market. Over the past few decades, increasing public concern about environmental issues has resulted in significant changes to the laws governing how corporations affect the environment. The main factor promoting growth is the expansion of government rules in various economies. Industries that deal with hazardous commodities, such energy and chemicals, use environment health and safety services and software to prevent workplace mishaps.
Demand for software and services for emission control, water conservation, waste management, employee safety, monitoring, and numerous other environmental health and safety parameters has rapidly increased as a result of the existence of strict regulations pertaining to environmental protection and occupational health and safety.
Growth Influencers:
Increase in government initiatives to introduce safety and environmental regulations
Due to the sheer number of IT firms and because the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has such strict requirements, it is predicted that the need for environment health and safety software would increase quickly. Companies around the nation are boosting their investments in order to improve operational effectiveness and follow the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Additionally, the presence of EHS service providers like AECOM Technology Corporation, Tetra Tech, Enablon, and Velocity EHS may help raise awareness, which will likely lead to market expansion.
Businesses operating in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., and Australia are required to adhere to stringent standards for the treatment of industrial waste and the disposal of wastewater, such as those set forth by the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) in Canada, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) in the U.S., and the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) in Australia. Growth in the environment, health, and safety market is anticipated to be fueled by the establishment of these strict standards over the forecast period.
Proliferation of the software-as-a-service deployment model
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, for example, are environmental standards that are met by firms using the EHS services and software. The EHS software’s features connect the TRI-MEweb interface of the EPA to the emissions data. The strict guidelines created by the Environment Canada/CEPA, EPA/RCRA, and European Hazardous Waste Directive are anticipated to increase demand for EHS software. The high usage of the SaaS model is boosting the market growth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841923,Bullfighting ban faces critical legislative vote in Colombia,"VILLAPINZON, Colombia (AP) — A 61-year-old matador nicknamed “Little gypsy of America” fell headfirst into the dust when he was headbutted by a bull. He recovered to the applause of the crowd, and later killed the bull with a sword thrust to the back of its neck.He was among six veteran bullfighters performing for free on a recent Saturday in front of about 150 people at an emerald-green hacienda in Colombia’s Andes. The festival was to raise money for a foundation hoping to save the centuries-old tradition from a national ban being pushed by politicians who argue bullfighting is cruel and unethical.“Colombia’s art and culture must endure,” the matador, Jelain Fresneda, said after the difficult bout, shaking dust off his tight-fitting suit. “We need to ensure our freedoms are respected.”Colombia is one of just eight countries where bullfights are still legal.But the tradition has taken some blows around the world recently with courts and municipal governments in cities like Barcelona, Medellin and Mexico City issuing rulings that have discouraged the events.Colombia’s Senate approved a nationwide ban in December. The House of Represenatives — which narrowly voted down an earlier ban in November — could take up the latest legislation in coming weeks when it returns from its three-month recess.It will be a closely followed vote in Colombia, where bullfights have been held since colonial times but where public sentiment has shifted against the practice over ethical considerations as has happened elsewhere in the world.“We are talking about living and feeling beings” said Andrea Padilla, a recently elected senator and longtime animal rights activist who drafted the anti-bullfighting law.“These are mammals with a nervous system that enables them to feel pain and suffering with the same intensity as humans ... and who shouldn’t be exposed to a slow and painful death.”Padilla’s law proposes banning all bullfights within three years. It also says that bullfights should be adjusted immediately so that the animals aren’t killed in arenas or attacked with pikes and handheld harpoons called banderillas.Bullfighting aficionados say those measures would effectively end the tradition, where the bull is fought and taunted in three stages that last about six minutes each. First, a horseman injures the bull with a long pike. Then, quick-footed assistants rush up to the bull to push sharp harpoons into the animal’s upper back. Lastly, the bull is finished off with the matador’s sword.Supporters of bullfights say the ban would obliterate an art form, deprive rural residents of a popular entertainment, and deny livelihoods to street vendors at bullfights. They also argue that politicians like Padilla are trying to impose their beliefs on others.“Almost every bovine that has been raised by man ends up in a slaughterhouse” said Gonzalo Sanz de Santamaria, a bull breeder who attended the recent festival at the Andean town of Villapinzon, about a two-hour drive northeast of Bogota.“But the bull dies in a temple, admired, applauded, showing its bravery and fighting for its life.”Santamaria is a fourth generation breeder and director of the Cultural Freedom Foundation, a group that supports bullfights, cockfights, rodeos and other traditional events that involve animals.Santamaria said that for breeders like himself bulls are like “gods” that are bred with utmost care in free range pastures, where they are “admired and venerated.”Surveys suggest bullfighting aficionados like Santamaria are a small share of Colombia’s population. In a November poll by Datexco, 85% of Colombians said they agreed with a ban on bullfights, while 13% said they were against plans to ban the tradition.However, in Colombia’s House of Representatives many politicians have been reluctant to vote against bullfights. In November a bullfighting ban presented by congressman Juan Carlos Losada was rejected by a narrow margin of just three votes, with some lawmakers saying they preferred a bill that “moderates” bullfights by making some of the weapons used in these events less invasive.In some parts of Colombia, like the city of Manizales, bullfights still draw thousands of spectators each year. The bullfighting ring in that city is owned by the local chapter of the Red Cross, and the city’s annual bullfighting festival generates thousands of dollars for a childrens’ hospital.“It’s sad that people who don’t know anything about our sector want to make laws about us,” said Sergio Alzate, 22, an aspiring matador and pupil at the city's bullfighting school.Still, Sen. Padilla and thousands of others in Colombia argue that there is no ethical justification for events where animals are killed for entertainment.“Any society that wants to advance in non violence, in peace and in respect for life, needs to ban these cruel spectacles,” Padilla said. She added that her bill directs the government to help create new sources of income for people working in bullfights.Some advocates are focused on the future of Colombia’s herd of fighting bulls, whose market value would plummet after a ban, forcing many breeders to sell them to slaughterhouses.Miguel Aparicio, a businessman who runs a shelter for farm animals outside Bogota says he’s already received eight young bulls from breeders who are downscaling their operations as the number of bullfights in Colombia decreases.He said that bull breeding farms should consider reinventing themselves as ecotourism sites or sanctuaries for fighting bulls, so that people can enjoy these animals without seeing them killed.“Just banning bullfights isn’t going to protect the bulls” Aparicio said. “We need to find a solution that looks out for the interests of these animals.”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841924,Arozarena hopes breakout WBC boosts baseball in Mexico,"MIAMI (AP) — Randy Arozarena dazzled with his bat, glove and style. It wasn't enough for Mexico but won countless fans for his adopted nation and himself.Arozarena jumped at the 8 1/2-foot left field wall to rob Kazuma Okamoto of a home run and preserve a three-run lead, then sparked a two-run rally with a leadoff double in the eighth inning of Monday night's World Baseball Classic semifinal.While Japan rallied for two runs in the ninth off Giovanny Gallegos for a thrilling 6-5 victory and a championship matchup against the United States, the Mexican team was proud of reaching the semifinals for the first time and raising the sport's profile back home in a land where soccer is No. 1.“We lost a baseball game but we won many things,"" Arozarena said. ""Mexican baseball continues to grow. This is the first step.”Mexico had been knocked out in the second round of the 2006 and 2009 WBCs, then failed to advance past the first round in 2013 and 2017.“I think that they are not aware of what they have done for Mexico and for the Mexican boys and girls,” manager Benji Gil said. “These two weeks are going to attract so many young players in Mexico and also Mexicans that live abroad. For that reason, I believe that this was a victory, even when we didn’t win today.”Milwaukee's Luis Urías put Mexico ahead in the fourth inning with a three-run homer off 21-year-old sensation Rōki Sasaki, turning on a belt-high cutter from the pitcher who nearly threw consecutive perfect games in Japan last season.Arozarena preserved the lead with his catch, then stared straight ahead for almost 10 seconds.That stood until the seventh when Masataka Yoshida pulled JoJo Romero's changeup just inside the right-field foul pole for a tying, three-run drive.Arozarena had entertained during batting practice, shagging flies in left while wearing a sombrero and cowboy boots. The Tampa Bay Rays outfielder signed autographs for fans behind the left-field wall during a pitching change.Fans responded, chanting “M-V-P!” at him.“I leave with much joy because of all the love I received from the fans,"" Arozarena said. “It was a beautiful experience for me.”He sparked an eighth-inning rally with a leadoff double against Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the two-time Pacific League MVP who had followed Sasaki and thrown three hitless innings.Alex Verdugo's RBI double and Isaac Paredes' run-scoring single built a 5-3 lead, but Hotaka Yamakawa hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth and two-time Central League MVP Munetaka Murakami hit a two-run double in the ninth that sent Japan's players sprinting onto the field and left deflated Mexicans hanging over their dugout rail.“In the U.S., I hope that baseball grows, but it’s not going to grow that much,” Gil said. “We won’t see an extreme change. In Japan, the same, baseball is No. 1. In Mexico, there will be a radical, extreme change. I don’t know whether tomorrow, in one week, in one month, or in one year, but baseball will start growing. It will be the most important game again.”Arozarena hit .450 with six doubles, one home run and nine RBIs, another big performance in a big event after he hit 10 home runs with 13 RBIs for Tampa Bay in the 2020 postseason.Now 28, he left Cuba for Mexico after the 2015 season, played briefly for Toros de Tijuana and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He was traded to the Rays after the 2019 season and became a Mexican citizen last year.“His personality, he’s infectious and he’s great for the game,” Gil said. “He’s a great character. I think everybody would agree that he is awesome for baseball. He’s awesome for Cuba. He’s awesome for Mexico. He’s awesome for wherever baseball’s played. Wherever this series was watched, he was awesome for that place. Wherever the game — you know, it doesn’t matter. Korea could have been watching these games and he’s a very popular player everywhere around the world.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841925,Army of lobbyists helped water down banking regulations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It seemed like a good idea at the time: Red-state Democrats facing grim reelection prospects would join forces with Republicans to slash bank regulations — demonstrating a willingness to work with President Donald Trump while bucking many in their party.That unlikely coalition voted in 2018 to roll back portions of a far-reaching 2010 law intended to prevent a future financial crisis. But those changes are now being blamed for contributing to the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that prompted a federal rescue and has stoked anxiety about a broader banking contagion.The rollback was leveraged with a lobbying campaign that cost tens of millions of dollars that drew an army of hundreds of lobbyists and it was seeded with ample campaign contributions.The episode offers a fresh reminder of the power that bankers wield in Washington, where the industry spends prodigiously to fight regulation and often hires former members of Congress and their staff to make the case that they are not a source of risk to the economy“The bottom line is that these banks would have faced a tougher supervisory framework under the original ... law, but Congress and the Trump regulators took an ax to it,” said Carter Dougherty, a spokesman for Americans for Financial Reform, a left-leaning financial sector watchdog group. “We can draw a direct line between the deregulation of the Trump period, driven by the bank lobby, and the chaos of the last few weeks.”President Joe Biden has asked Congress for the authority to impose tougher penalties on failed banks. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have started investigations. And congressional Democrats are calling for new restrictions on financial institutions.But so far there is no indication that another bipartisan coalition will form in Congress to put tougher regulations back in place, underscoring the banking industry's continued clout.That influence was on full display when the banking lobby worked for two years to water down aspects of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that had placed weighty regulations on banks designed to reduce consumer risk and force the institutions to adopt safer lending and investing practices.Republicans had long looked to blunt the impact of Dodd-Frank. But rather than push for sweeping deregulation, Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican who led the Senate banking committee, hoped a narrowed focus could draw enough support from moderate Democrats to clear the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster threshold.Crapo broached the idea with Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota — all on the ballot in 2018 — as well as Mark Warner of Virginia. By the fall of that year, the bipartisan group met regularly, according to a copy of Tester’s office schedule posted to his Senate website.A lobbying strategy also emerged, with companies and trade groups that specifically mention Crapo's legislation spending more than $400 million in 2017 and 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of the public lobbying disclosures.The bill was sold to the public as a form of regulatory relief for overburdened community banks, which serviced farmers and smaller businesses. Community bankers from across the U.S. flew in to Washington to meet repeatedly with lawmakers, including Tester, who had 32 meetings with Montana bank officials. Local bank leaders pushed members of their congressional delegation when they returned home.But the measure also included provisions sought by midsize banks that drastically curtailed oversight once the Trump Fed finished writing new regulations necessitated by the bill’s passage.Specifically, the legislation lifted the threshold for banks that faced a strict regimen of oversight, including mandatory financial stress testing.That component, which effectively carved large midsize banks out of more stringent regulation, has come under new scrutiny in light of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, whose executives lobbied on behalf of the 2018 rollback.“The lobbyists were everywhere. You couldn’t throw an elbow without running into one,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who vehemently opposed the bill, told reporters last week.Campaign checks were written. Ads were cut. Mailers went out.As a reward for their work, Heitkamp ($357,953), Tester ($302,770) and Donnelly ($265,349) became the top Senate recipients of money from the banking industry during the 2018 campaign season, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group tracking money in politics.Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer freed members to vote for the bill, a move intended to bolster the standing of vulnerable moderate incumbents. But the move also bitterly divided the Democratic caucus, with Warren singling out the moderates as doing Wall Street's bidding.In the hours before the bill passed the Senate with 17 Democratic votes, Heitkamp took to the chamber floor to inveigh against the “diatribe,” “hyperbole” and “overstatement” from opponents of the bill.Tester, meanwhile, huddled with executives from Bank of America, Citigroup, Discover and Wells Fargo, who were there on behalf of the American Bankers Association, according to his publicly available office schedule.The American Bankers Association, which helped lead the push, later paid $125,000 for an ad campaign thanking Tester for his role in the bill’s passage, records show.Less than a month after the bill was passed out of the Senate, Tester met Greg Becker, the CEO for the now-collapsed Silicon Valley Bank, according to his schedule. Becker specifically lobbied Congress and the Federal Reserve to take a light regulatory approach with banks of his size. Lobbyists with the firm the Franklin Square Group, which had been retained by Silicon Valley Bank, donated $10,800 to Tester's campaign, record show.Heitkamp was the only member of the group invited to the bill signing ceremony, beaming alongside Trump. Later, Americans for Prosperity, the grassroots conservative group funded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, ran an online ad commending Heitkamp for taking a stand against her party.In an interview, Heitkamp pushed back against suggestions that the legislation was directly responsible for the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. She acknowledged, however, that there was an open question about whether new rules put in place by the Fed after the measure was signed into law could have played a role.“I’m willing to look at the argument that this had something to do with it,” Heitkamp said, adding: “I think you will find that (the Fed) was engaged in some level of some supervision. Why that didn’t work? That’s the question that needs to be resolved.”In a statement issued last week, Tester did not directly address his role in the legislation, but he pledged to ""take on anyone in Washington to ensure that the executives at these banks and regulators are held accountable.”Cam Fine, who led the Independent Community Bankers of America trade group during the legislative push, said the overall the bill was a good piece of legislation that offered much needed relief to struggling community banks.But like any major piece of legislation that moves through Congress, final passage hinged on support from a broad coalition of interests — including those of Wall Street and midsize banks.“Was it a perfect piece of legislation? No. But there’s an old saying in Washington: You can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” said Fine.Many of the moderate Democrats who supported the measure did not fare as well.Of the core group who wrote the bill, only Tester won reelection. Others from red states who supported it, including Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Bill Nelson of Florida, lost.Tester will be on the ballot again in 2024. Last week he was in Silicon Valley for a fundraiser.One of the event's sponsors was a partner at a law firm for Silicon Valley Bank.___Sweet reported from New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841926,Trump waits out grand jury as New York braces for protests,"NEW YORK (AP) — Facing the possibility of criminal charges, Donald Trump waited it out in Florida on Tuesday as New York braced for disruptions that could follow an indictment. Republican contenders in the 2024 race sized up the impact a prosecution could have on a campaign in which the former president is a leading contender.Trump over the weekend claimed without evidence that he would be arrested on Tuesday, but there was no indication that prediction would come true. A Manhattan grand jury did appear to take an important step forward on Monday by hearing from a witness favorable to Trump, presumably so prosecutors could ensure the panel had a chance to consider any testimony supporting his version of events.The next steps were unclear, and it was uncertain if additional witnesses might be summoned. But a city mindful of the riot by Trump loyalists at the U.S. Capitol more than two years ago took steps to protect itself from any violence that could accompany the unprecedented prosecution of a former president.Monday's testimony from Robert Costello, a lawyer with close ties to numerous key Trump aides, appeared to be a final opportunity for allies to steer the grand jury away from an indictment. Costello was invited by prosecutors to appear after saying he had information to undercut the credibility of Michael Cohen, a former lawyer and fixer for Trump who later turned against him and then became a key witness in the Manhattan district attorney's investigation.Costello had provided Cohen legal services several years ago after Cohen himself became entangled in the federal investigation into the hush money payments. In a news conference after his grand jury appearance, Costello told reporters he had come forward because he did not believe Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal crimes and served time in prison.“If they want to go after Donald Trump and they have solid evidence, then so be it,” Costello said. “But Michael Cohen is far from solid evidence.”Responding on MSNBC, Cohen said that Costello was never his lawyer and “he lacks any sense of veracity.”There were no signs that Costello's testimony had affected the course of the investigation. Cohen had been available for over two hours in case prosecutors wanted him to rebut Costello's testimony but he was told he was not needed, his attorney said.The testimony came two days after Trump said he expected to face criminal charges and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. In social media posts through the weekend, he criticized the investigation, directing particularly hostile rhetoric toward Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.New York officials have been monitoring online chatter of threats of varying specificity, but even as portable metal barricades were dropped off to safeguard streets and sidewalks, there were no immediate signs that Trump's calls for protests were being heeded.On Tuesday morning, Manhattan court proceedings were temporarily halted by a bomb threat called in via 911, according to a court spokesman. That delayed the start of a hearing in a separate case, the New York attorney general’s lawsuit accusing Trump and his company of a yearslong fraud scheme.Costello briefly acted as a legal adviser to Cohen after the FBI raided Cohen’s home and apartment in 2018. At the time, Cohen was being investigated for both tax evasion and for payments he helped orchestrate in 2016 to buy the silence of two women who claimed to have had sexual encounters with Trump.For several months, it was unclear whether Cohen, a longtime lawyer and fixer for the Trump Organization who once boasted that he would “take a bullet” for his boss, would remain loyal to the president.Cohen ultimately decided to plead guilty in connection with the payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, which he said were directed by Trump. Since then, he has been a vociferous Trump critic, testifying before Congress and then to the grand jury.Trump, who has denied having sex with either woman, has branded Cohen a liar.As the New York investigation pushes toward conclusion, Trump faces other criminal probes in Atlanta and Washington that, taken together, pose significant legal peril and carry the prospect of upending his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.Some of his likely opponents have tried to strike a balance between condemning a potential prosecution as politically motivated while avoiding condoning the conduct at issue.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an expected GOP presidential candidate, criticized the investigation but also jabbed at Trump.“I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Panama City. “I can’t speak to that.”Switching to criticism of the district attorney, he said, ""What I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments, that’s an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that’s fundamentally wrong.”___Tucker reported from Washington. Associated Press journalists Michelle L. Price, Aaron Morrison, Jill Colvin, Ted Shaffrey, David R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841928,Osborne scores career-high 36 to lead UCLA into Sweet 16,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Charisma Osborne has taken a lot on her shoulders during her four years at UCLA. With her team down four points late in the third quarter after blowing an 18-point deficit, the senior guard wasn't about to let a trip to the Sweet 16 go away.Osborne's three-point play was the catalyst in a rally that propelled the fourth-seeded Bruins to an 82-73 victory over No. 5 seed Oklahoma 82-73 in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Monday night.Osborne scored a career-high 36 points in her final game at Pauley Pavilion, including 13 points in the final 10 minutes as the Bruins (26-7) advanced to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2019.“I felt like the light came back in their eyes after that play.,” UCLA coach Cori Close said. ""When they came back to that huddle in between the third and the fourth quarter, I just thought it blew wind into their sails. I thought it really pushed ’em over the hump mentally and emotionally.""The Bruins, who had an 18-point lead in the second quarter, found themselves trailing 54-50 late in the third quarter before Osborne started the comeback. She drove the lane and hit a layup while being fouled by Beatrice Culliton. Osborne made the ensuing free throw to bring them within one.“Honestly, I was just thinking attack, attack, attack because I was getting to my pullup and they weren’t really going in a little bit in the third quarter, so I was just thinking how can I get to the basket,” said Osborne, who was 11 of 21 from the field and made all 12 of her free throws. She also had eight rebounds and four assists.UCLA regained control in the fourth quarter by going on a 6-1 run. Oklahoma was within four with 3:31 remaining before the Bruins scored six straight points to put it away.Kiki Rice added 14 points for the Bruins, who will face top-ranked South Carolina on Saturday in a Greenville Regional semifinal. UCLA hung tough with the Gamecocks earlier in the season before losing 73-64.""It was incredible to see the energy and intensity that she brought to our entire team throughout the entire game,"" Rice said of Osborne. “She really carried us and I just had so much fun watching her go off.”Madi Williams scored 24 points and Ana Llanusa 15 for the Sooners, who end their season 26-7.The Sooners trailed by 13 at the half and 47-32 with six minutes remaining in the third quarter before they went on a 22-3 run over a six-minute span to go up 54-50 with 35 seconds remaining.Llanusa had eight points during Oklahoma's rally, including a jumper with 1:40 remaining that put the Sooners up 50-49 and their first lead since early in the first quarter. The run included 14 straight points as the Bruins were held scoreless for nearly four minutes.“I feel like we were able to get to the rim and we just didn’t respond when we didn’t make them,” Oklahoma coach Jennie Baranczyk said. ""I thought they were hot from 3 as well, and so we needed to guard a little bit better.""Oklahoma jumped out to an early 5-2 lead before UCLA scored eight straight points. It remained a five-point game for much of the first quarter before the Bruins opened things up with 13 straight points late in the first and early in the second. Osborne keyed that run with seven points.UCLA held the Sooners without a bucket for 4:57 until Williams made a layup on a fast break to get Oklahoma to 32-16.STREAK SNAPPEDTaylor Robertson's 78-game streak of making a 3-pointer ended in her final collegiate game. The senior was held two points and was 0 for 3 from beyond the arc in 19 minutes.The last time Robertson was blanked from the perimeter was Feb. 9, 2021, against Iowa State. She will leave Oklahoma as the NCAA women's leader in 3-pointers with 537.BIG PICTUREOklahoma: With the Sooners loss, this is the first time the Big 12 has not had a team advance to the Sweet 16. The conference had six teams make the field with Texas, Baylor and the Sooners all losing on Monday.UCLA: This is the fifth time in Close's 12 seasons she has led the Bruins to the Sweet 16.UP NEXTUCLA is one of only four opponents to not lose to South Carolina by double digits this season. It was tied at the beginning of the fourth quarter on Nov. 29 before the Gamecocks won.“We weren’t able to finish the job in the fourth quarter the first time, so to get another shot at them when we feel like we’ve gotten so much better is a great opportunity for us,” Rice said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841929,South Korea to restore Japan's trade status to improve ties,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Tuesday his government will move to restore Japan’s preferential trade status as he pushes to resolve history and trade disputes with Japan despite domestic opposition.In lengthy, televised comments during a Cabinet Council meeting, Yoon defended his moves, saying that leaving ties with Japan as fraught as they are would be neglecting his duty because greater bilateral cooperation is vital to resolve diverse challenges facing Seoul.“I thought it would be like neglecting my duty as president if I had also incited hostile nationalism and anti-Japan sentiments to use them for domestic politics while leaving behind the current, grave international political situation,” Yoon said.He said the need to boost ties with Japan has grown because of North Korea’s advancing nuclear program, the intensifying U.S.-China strategic rivalry and global supply chain challenges.South Korea and Japan have deep economic and cultural ties and are both key U.S. allies that together host about 80,000 U.S. troops. But their relations have often fluctuated mainly due to issues stemming from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.At the center of the recent impasse was the 2018 South Korean court rulings that ordered two Japanese companies to compensate some of their former Korean employees for forced labor during Japanese rule. Japan refused to accept the rulings, saying all compensation issues had already been settled when the two countries normalized ties in 1965.The history disputes spilled over to other issues, with the two countries downgrading each other’s trade status. Japan also tightened controls on exports to South Korea, while Seoul threatened to terminate a military intelligence-sharing pact with Tokyo.After months of negotiations with Japan, Yoon’s government earlier this month announced it would use local funds to compensate the forced laborer victims involved in the 2018 lawsuits without requiring contributions from the Japanese companies.Last week, Yoon traveled to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, during which they agreed to resume regular visits and launch high-level economic security talks.Ahead of the summit, the South Korean government said Japan had agreed to lift export restrictions on materials needed for key South Korean export items like semiconductors and smartphones, and that South Korea would also withdraw its complaint to the World Trade Organization once the curbs are removed. They said the two countries would continue talks on restoring each other’s trade status as well.The conservative Yoon's push has triggered protests from some of the forced labor victims and liberal opposition politicians, who have demanded direct compensation from the Japanese companies and a direct apology from Tokyo over the forced labor. A public survey suggested about 60% of Koreans opposed Yoon's measures to resolve the forced labor issue.In his Cabinet Council remarks, Yoon said he will order his trade minister to begin taking legal steps necessary to restore Japan on a “whitelist” of nations receiving preferential fast-track trade status.He said both South Korea and Japan must remove obstacles that hinder the improvement of bilateral ties. “If South Korea preemptively eliminates obstacles, Japan will surely reciprocate,” he said.Yoon said his government will also strive to help heal the pains of the forced labor victims and their relatives. But he said there are still those in South Korea who attempt to increase their political gains by “shouting exclusive nationalism and anti-Japan (slogans).”The main liberal opposition Democratic Party responded that Yoon's condemnation of his critics cannot justify his Japan diplomacy that it said hurt South Korea's national pride and interests.

Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins each had two assists, and Jack Campbell had 28 saves.With the clock winding down in the extra period, Nurse got a long pass from Yamamoto along the right side, skated in on James Reimer on a breakaway and beat him through the five-hole for his eighth of the season.“Obviously, our group, we’ve got to be better in here for a full 60-minute effort,” Nurse said. “But we were resilient. There are nights that you are not going to feel it, but you have to find a way to win and we did that tonight.”The Oilers, third in the Pacific Division, pulled four points behind Vegas and Los Angeles atop the division.The game featured four goals that were erased — three for San Jose — after video reviews.“It was a crazy game,” Bjugstad said. “A lot of disallowed goals, a few in our favor. We definitely need to clean some things up and our urgency early wasn’t there, so I think that was the main problem. ... I think our coaching staff and our team would prefer not to have a game like that, but we proved we could rally back and battle through some adversity there.”Erik Karlsson scored twice, Alexander Barabanov had a goal and an assist, and Steven Lorentz also scored for the Sharks, who lost their seventh straight (0-4-3) and fell to 2-11-4 in their last 17 games. Reimer had a season-high 46 saves.“We’ve seen that movie before,” San Jose coach David Quinn said. “They’re one of the best teams in the league who have an awful lot of fire power and I thought we competed. ... Our goalie played great and I thought we did a lot of good things tonight. It just wasn’t enough.”Ekholm tied it 4-4 with 3:47 left in the third with his second of the night and eighth of the season as he got a pass from McDavid, skated into the left circle and fired a shot past Reimer. It was Ekholm's first multigoal game since he had two against Columbus on Feb. 27, 2021. McDavid, who has an NHL-best 58 goals, extended his league lead with 78 assists and 136 points.Karlsson put the Sharks ahead 4-3 with a one-timer from between the circles for his second of the night and 22nd of the season with 5:37 left in the second.Barabanov got San Jose on the scoreboard first with a slap shot from the left circle at 5:48 of the first. It was his 15th.Bjugstad tied it 1:20 later as he scored from the left doorstep off a setup from Warren Foegele. It was his 16th.Yamamoto put the Oilers ahead 2-1 as knocked in a loose puck from the inside edge of the right circle for his 10th just 30 seconds into the second.Lorentz tied it eight minutes later on a breakaway as he batted the batted the puck out of the air after Campbell had stopped the initial shot. It was his eighth.Karlsson gave the Sharks a 3-2 lead less than two minutes later as he skated in on Campbell and went backhand-forehand-backhand to get the goalie out of position before putting it in.Ekholm tied it with 8:12 left in the second as he put a backhander past Reimer on the glove side.LOST GOALSHertl appeared to give San Jose a 1-0 lead 1:14 in but was overturned for an offside. Zach Hyman gave the Oilers a 2-1 lead midway through the first, but it was disallowed for goalie interference. The Sharks looked to have tied it 2-2 six minutes into the second on a goal by Andreas Johnsson, but once again itl was called back for goalie interference. Noah Gregor's goal on an odd-man rush four minutes into the third that would have given San Jose a 5-3 lead was wiped out for offside.“Obviously all the challenges were correct, that’s why the system is in place,” Karlsson said. “That’s the way it is sometimes, we got more taken away than they did. But it was all good calls and that’s why we implemented the rules they have so they have a chance to look at it. ... It’s just unfortunate we couldn’t capitalize on at least one of those.”UP NEXTSharks: At Vancouver on Thursday night in the second of a three-game trip.Oilers: Host Arizona on Wednesday night in the second of a three-game homestand.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841931,Venezuela oil czar in surprise resignation amid graft probes,"CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — The man responsible for running Venezuela's oil industry — the one that pays for virtually everything in the troubled country, from subsidized food to ridiculously cheap gas — has quit amid investigations into alleged corruption among officials in various parts of the government.Tareck El Aissami's announcement Monday was shocking on multiple counts. He was seen as a loyal ruling party member and considered a key figure in the government's efforts to evade punishing international economic sanctions.And he led the state oil company PDVSA in a Venezuelan business sector widely considered to be corrupt — in a country where embezzelment, bribery, money laundering and other wrongdoing are a lifestyle.“Obviously, they are giving it the patina of an anti-corruption probe,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.“Rule of law is not being advanced here,"" Berg added. ""This is really a chance for the regime to sideline someone that it felt for some reason was a danger to it in the moment and to continue perpetuating acts of corruption once particular individuals have been forced out of the political scene.”Hours after El Aissami revealed his resignation on Twitter, President Nicolás Maduro called his government's fight against corruption “bitter” and “painful.” He said he accepted the resignation “to facilitate all the investigations that should result in the establishment of the truth, the punishment of the culprits, and justice in all these cases.”Venezuela’s National Anti-Corruption Police last week announced an investigation into unidentified public officials in the oil industry, the justice system and some local governments. Attorney General Tarek William Saab in a radio interview Monday said that at least a half dozen officials, including people affiliated with PDVSA, had been arrested, and he expected more to be detained.Among those arrested is Joselit Ramirez, a cryptocurrency regulator who was indicted in the U.S. along with El Aissami on money laundering charges in 2020.Corruption has long been rampant in Venezuela, which sits atop the world’s largest petroleum reserves. But officials are rarely held accountable — a major irritant to citizens, the majority of whom live on $1.90 a day, the international benchmark of extreme poverty.“I assure you, even more so at this moment, when the country calls not only for justice but also for the strengthening of the institutions, we will apply the full weight of the law against these individuals,” Saab said.Oil is Venezuela’s most important industry. A windfall of hundreds of billions in oil dollars thanks to record-high global prices allowed the late President Hugo Chávez to launch numerous initiatives, including state-run food markets, new public housing, free health clinics and education programs.But a subsequent drop in prices and government mismanagement, first under Chávez’s government and then Maduro’s, ended the lavish spending. And so began a complex crisis that has pushed millions into poverty and driven more than 7 million Venezuela to migrate.PDVSA’s mismanagement, and more recently economic sanctions imposed by the U.S., caused a steady production decline, going from the 3.5 million barrels a day when Chávez rose to power in 1999 to roughly 700,000 barrels a day last year.David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has conducted extensive research on Venezuela, said the moves by Maduro's government are more than just an effort to clean its image.“Arresting important figures and accepting the resignation of one of the most powerful ministers in a case that involves $3 billion does not improve your image,” he said. “It is probably because the missing money actually has an important impact on a government with serious budgetary problems.”The Biden administration recently loosened some sanctions, even allowing oil giant Chevron for the first time in more than three years to resume production. Maduro’s government has been negotiating with its U.S.-backed political opponents primarily to get the sanctions lifted.U.S. congressional researchers saw El Aissami as an impediment to Maduro’s goals.“Should Al Aissami remain in that position, it could complicate efforts to lift oil sanctions,” a November report from the Congressional Research Center said.The U.S. government designated El Aissami, a powerful Maduro ally, as a narcotics kingpin in 2017 in connection with activities in his previous positions as interior minister and a state governor. The Treasury Department alleged that “he oversaw or partially owned narcotics shipments of over 1,000 kilograms from Venezuela on multiple occasions, including those with the final destinations of Mexico and the United States.”Under the government of Chávez, El Aissami headed the Ministry of Internal Affairs. He was appointed minister of oil in April 2020.“El Aissami was a key player in the Maduro government’s sanctions evasion strategy. We’re talking about someone who knows where all the bodies are buried, so it will be key to watch where he ends up,” said Geoff Ramsey, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council focused on Colombia and Venezuela. “If El Aissami ends up being implicated himself, it could have serious implications for the entire power structure.”In September, Maduro's government renewed wrongdoing accusations against another former oil minister, Rafael Ramírez, alleging he was involved in a multibillion-dollar embezzlement operation during the early 2010s that took advantage of a dual currency exchange system. Ramírez, who oversaw the OPEC nation’s oil industry for a decade, denied the accusations.In 2016, Venezuela’s then opposition-led National Assembly said $11 billion went missing at PDVSA in the 2004-2014 period when Ramirez was in charge of the company. In 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department accused a bank in Andorra of laundering some $2 billion stolen from PDVSA.",2023/03/22,,World

New Life and  Professor Patrick Wing-leung LEUNG, Director of Graduate Studies in Clinical Psychology of The Chinese University of Hong Kong have conducted subsequent studies on the ""Comprehensive Well-Being Scale"" (Sham, Yeung, Mak & Powell, 2021), which validated the CWBS can be applied to the general public. Professor LEUNG mentioned, ""The CWBS was found to correlate not only issues of distress such as anxiety, depression, psychological distress, physical symptoms and alienation, but also other important indices of well-being and items relating to strengths and values such as resilience, meanings of life, optimism, compassionate love, social connectedness, universalism, and self-transcendence.""   A total of 1,020 valid questionnaires were collected in the community for the study on CWBS in January 2023. According to the Population Census, a stratified sampling method based on sex, age, and education level was conducted to ensure the representativeness of the community sample. The [330] Well-Being Index can be obtained after individuals fill out the questionnaire. The calculated total score is classified into one of the 3 categories: A total score of 65 or below indicates one's level of well-being to be below average. A total score of 66-78 indicates an average level of well-being. A total score of 79 or above indicates one's level of well-being to be above average.  Research findings revealed 25% of samples attained a CWBS score of 65 or below. These individuals may need to seek professional assistance for further assessment and advice.  ""[330] Well-Being Index"" assessment website has already been launched (https://wellbeingindex.dayday330.hk). The general public are welcome to take the questionnaire as a preliminary self-assessment of one's overall well-being. NLPRA will provide suitable recommendations on how to take good care of one's 330 wellness and maintain a positive attitude to face various challenges in life.   At the closing session,  Mr. Chris SUN Yuk-han, JP, Secretary for Labour and Welfare delivered a speech on ""Future of Mental Health Services"" in Hong Kong. Mr. SUN expressed that mental health services are facing 4 challenges in the future: the aging population, the needs of caregivers, higher education levels, and post-COVID recovery. ""In the past 3 years, due to fighting the pandemic and social distancing measures, the mental distress of a considerable number of citizens may have increased significantly. Having a long period of online classes and a lack of social interaction, some youngsters may become hidden youths, or have extra emotional needs. In the future, we must keep pace with the times and do our best to provide rehabilitation services and appropriate support for people with mental health needs, and help them integrate into society. As President Xi Jinping mentioned in his speech at the 20th National Congress, we hope that the majority of disabled people should live and work in peace and contentment, with no worries about food and clothing, and live a happy and beautiful life.""

Another important topic for Stark-Watzinger’s visit was the teaching of Mandarin to young Germans, Wu said.The Taiwanese minister said that during a visit to Germany in November, he had invited Stark-Watzinger to travel to Taiwan, but had never expected she would actually succeed in making the trip within four months. The rapid planning of the visit showed that Taiwan was enjoying a positive reputation in Europe for its democracy, freedom, human rights, and high-tech industries, according to Wu.He added that technological research and development in Germany and Taiwan complemented each other, with the Asian country functioning as a valuable partner for the European Union member nation.The last time a member of the German federal cabinet visited Taiwan was in 1997, with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt traveling to Taipei.",2023/03/21,1097,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841975,"Wisconsin Supreme Court candidates clash over abortion, maps","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The liberal candidate for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court didn't back down from her support for abortion rights or her belief that the state's Republican-drawn legislative maps are unfair during a debate Tuesday in which her GOP-backed opponent accused her of being “bought and paid for” by Democrats.Janet Protasiewicz called her conservative opponent, Dan Kelly, “a true threat to our democracy” because he consulted with Republicans about their plan to seat fake electors to support Donald Trump after he lost Wisconsin in 2020.Whoever wins the April 4 election for a seat vacated by the retirement of a conservative justice will determine majority control of the court for at least the next two years, including leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Control of the court, which came within a vote of overturning Trump's 2020 defeat in the state, could be crucial, with abortion access, legislative redistricting, voting rights and other key issues at stake. The millions already spent have made it the most expensive state Supreme Court race in U.S. history.Kelly repeatedly accused the Democratic-backed Protasiewicz of lying about his role in the fake elector plan, his abortion stance and other issues, telling her, “You’re willing to say anything to get what you want.”Protasiewicz has focused her candidacy on her support for abortion rights, stopping just short of saying how she would rule on a lawsuit challenging the state's abortion ban first passed in 1849 — a year after statehood. She reiterated Tuesday that she hadn't made up her mind on how she would rule, but she said Kelly had.“My personal opinion is that should be a woman’s right: to make a reproductive health decision. Period,"" she said. “If my opponent is elected, I can tell you with 100% certainty that (the) 1849 abortion ban will stay on the books.""Kelly defended his support from the state's three largest anti-abortion groups and said he made no pledge to them to uphold the ban, as Protasiewicz has alleged.“This seems to be a pattern for you Janet, just tell a lie,"" Kelly said. “You don’t know what I’m thinking about that abortion ban. You have no idea. ... I had no conversations with those organizations about how I would rule on any issue, including the abortion issue.”Kelly, who previously did work for Wisconsin Right to Life, has not said how he would rule on the challenge to the abortion ban should it reach the court. But he did write in a blog post years ago that everyone knows that abortion “takes the life of an unborn child.”On redistricting, Protasiewicz was asked how she could fairly hear the case given that the Democratic Party has given her campaign $2.5 million. She said she would recuse herself from any case brought by the party, but challenges to the Republican-drawn maps are expected to come from others.“The map issue is really kind of easy, actually,"" Protasiewicz said. ""I don’t think anybody thinks those maps are fair. Anybody.”Protasiewicz said she agreed with the liberal dissenting justices in a case that challenged the Republican-drawn maps.“There you have it,"" Kelly said in response. ""She just told you how she would resolve the case.”Protasiewicz accused Kelly of being unfair with his campaign ads accusing her of handing down soft sentences in numerous criminal cases she has handled as a Milwaukee County circuit court judge.“I have spent my entire career protecting this community,” she said.Kelly, a former state Supreme Court justice, has long ties to the Republican Party, having previously worked for Republicans. Kelly was endorsed by Trump in 2020. This year, he has the backing of Scott Presler, a Virginia native who planned several “stop the steal” rallies and was on the U.S. Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021. He was in Wisconsin in March helping to raise money and support for Kelly through personal appearances on conservative talk radio.Protasiewicz's endorsements include Hillary Clinton, Planned Parenthood and EMILY’s List, which works nationwide to elect Democratic abortion rights supporters.The debate at the Wisconsin Bar Association, co-sponsored by WISC-TV and WisPolitics.com, came on the same day that early, in-person voting began. Early voting runs through April 2.Elizabeth Doe, 73, was the first person to cast a ballot in Wisconsin's liberal capital, Madison, doing so shortly after 9 a.m. at a community center. She said she voted for Protasiewicz because of her concerns over “reproductive rights.”“You can't take that right away,” she said.The contest has already broken national spending records for a Supreme Court race, with the two sides having spent at least $22 million to date. WisPolitics.com estimated that more than $30 million had been spent on the race as of last week, which would be roughly double the $15.2 million spent on a 2004 Illinois Supreme Court race that had held the mark as the most expensive.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841976,Kempe leads Kings into 1st place with 8-2 win over Flames,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Drew Doughty and Viktor Arvidsson scored in Los Angeles' four-goal first period, Adrian Kempe had two goals and an assist, and the Kings cruised into a first-place tie in the Pacific Division with an 8-2 victory over the Calgary Flames on Monday night.Carl Grundstrom had two goals and Gabriel Vilardi and Mikey Anderson also scored for the Kings, who pulled even with Vegas atop the division by extending their points streak to 10 games (8-0-2) with their second eight-goal outburst of the season. The Kings have earned a point in every game in March, putting themselves in contention for just the second division title for a franchise with two Stanley Cup championships.“They played a hell of a game,” Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said of his team. “I thought our puck pressure and our tenacity was at its best, both when we had the puck and when we didn’t. It allowed us to create turnovers and take advantage of them.”Pheonix Copley made 15 saves for Los Angeles, while captain Anze Kopitar, Quinton Byfield and Rasmus Kupari had two assists apiece.“We got the lead early and then we didn’t look back from there,” Byfield said. “We came out, played our game right at the start. We took the lead and just kept playing the right way. The goals just kept coming for us tonight.”Tyler Toffoli scored against his former team for the Flames, who couldn’t catch up after allowing four goals in a first period for the first time since November 2017. Coach Darryl Sutter’s teams hadn’t allowed four goals in a first period since October 2014, when he was still behind the Kings’ bench.“The game plan, you’re down 4-nothing, pretty much got to flush it and start again, right?"" Sutter said. ""No other way around it. Scored the power play goal to start the second, but 5-on-5, I think they dominated us.”Jacob Markstrom stopped 20 shots and gave up six goals in the first two periods of his 10th consecutive start before Dan Vladar mopped up in the third for the Flames. Markstrom also allowed six goals in Calgary's overtime loss to Dallas two days earlier to begin the team’s worst two-game defensive stretch of the season.Calgary defenseman Rasmus Andersson called it “a brutal game.”“Our D-zone was not good enough,” Andersson added. ""We were not good enough with the puck. We didn’t get through the neutral zone. We didn’t have any, really, forecheck. It felt like they broke the puck out. And, I mean, I was terrible tonight, and I've got to be better. Everyone’s got to step up tomorrow, but I have to play a lot better.”Noah Hanifin also scored for the Flames, who have lost four of six to hurt their playoff hopes.The Kings were prolific offensively even with top scorer Kevin Fiala missing his fifth straight game with a lower-body injury.Grundstrom put Los Angeles ahead early when he skated around Markstrom and scored a goal in his third consecutive game. Doughty then scored his third goal in four games on a long shot through traffic, and Vilardi scored 57 seconds later.Arvidsson added a power-play goal off a cross-ice pass from Kempe to secure his fifth career 20-goal season, including both of his years with Los Angeles.Toffoli drove home his 29th goal from the slot on a power play 34 seconds into the second. The goal was Toffoli's third in seven career games against the Kings, who drafted him in 2010 and won a Stanley Cup with him in 2014 before trading him in 2020.But Kempe scored two goals in 4 1/2 minutes, giving him 34 this season. Anderson scored his first career power-play goal in the third.Milan Lucic was a healthy scratch for the second straight game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841977,Apaches tell court copper mine would harm sacred sites,"PHOENIX (AP) — A Native American group that's trying to stop an effort to build one of the largest copper mines in the United States told a full federal appeals court panel Tuesday that the project would prevent Apaches from exercising their religion by destroying land they consider sacred.U.S. federal government plans for a land swap that will allow Resolution Copper to build the mine will destroy the land in eastern Arizona known as Oak Flat, “barring the Apaches from ever accessing it again and ending their core religious practices forever,” said attorney Luke Goodrich, arguing for the group Apache Stronghold.“We asked the court today to recognize the obvious — that when the government destroys a sacred site, religious liberty law has something to say about it,” Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at the nonprofit legal institution Becket Law, said in a prepared statement distributed after the hearing in Pasadena, California. ""A win for Apache Stronghold will be a win for people of all faiths.”The Apache group is seeking to halt the land swap while the case plays out in court. The panel of 11 judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to issue a decision in the next few months.Apache Stronghold sued the U.S. government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to protect the place tribal members call Chi’chil Bildagoteel, an area dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion.An environmental impact survey for the project has been pulled back while the U.S. Department of Agriculture has consulted for months with Native American tribes and others about their concerns.But U.S. government attorney Joan Pepin told the judge Tuesday that the Forest Service expected the environmental analysis could be republished as early as this spring, setting in motion the land swap, which would have to be completed within 60 days.Pepin argued that the act of Congress that approved the exchange giving the Oak Flat to Resolution Copper land supersedes the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prevents government agencies from placing a “substantial burden” on the practice of religion.The land transfer was a last-minute provision included in a must-pass defense bill in 2014. The swap would give the mining company 3.75 square miles (9.71 square kilometers) of national forest land in exchange for eight parcels it owns in other parts of Arizona.Resolution Copper, a joint venture of global mining firms Rio Tinto and BHP, has said it continues to address concerns raised about the project, but noted there is significant local support for the mine. Rio Tinto has headquarters in Australia and the U.K, while BHP is based in Australia.It says the project has the potential to supply enough copper to meet up to one-quarter of U.S. demand, adding up to $1 billion a year to Arizona’s economy and creating thousands of local jobs.A smaller 9th Circuit panel previously ruled 2-1 that the federal government could give the Oak Flat land to the mining company for the project. The court later agreed to let the larger panel hear the case.Apache Stronghold members traveled from Arizona for the hearing, stopping at cities along the way to draw attention to the case. They gathered Monday at a community arts center in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Boyle Heights.“Oak Flat is where my people have come to connect with our Creator for millennia, and we have the right to continue that sacred tradition,"" Wendsler Nosie Sr. of Apache Stronghold said in a statement released after the hearing. “Today we stood up in court for that right, determined to stop those who think that our place of worship can be treated differently simply because it lacks four walls and a steeple.”The Poor People’s Campaign, environmental groups and the National Congress of American Indians are among many groups backing Apache Stronghold’s fight.The Notre Dame Law School Religious Liberty Clinic filed a “friend of the court” brief and Stephanie Barclay, director of Notre Dame’s Religious Liberty Initiative, participated in oral arguments.The Religious Liberty Clinic at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, also submitted a brief.St. Thomas law professor Thomas Berg called it the most important Native American religious liberty case in 15 years.“It could change the legal test used throughout the Ninth Circuit, which likely has far more sacred sites on federal land than any other part of the country,"" Berg said in a written statement.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841978,Gwyneth Paltrow's lawyer calls Utah ski collision story ‘BS’,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Gwyneth Paltrow's lawyer called the story of a retired optometrist who is suing her over a 2016 ski collision “utter B.S.” on Tuesday during the trial's opening day in Utah, where the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer appeared in court looking somber.Paltrow and Terry Sanderson, the man suing her, sat across from each other in a Park City courtroom as their attorneys gave opening statements that provided strikingly different accounts of the crash. Both described their clients as victims and blamed the other for the collision at Deer Valley, one of the country’s most upscale ski resorts.The two showed little emotion as attorneys questioned their credibility and version of events on the first day of the trial, which is expected to last eight days. Sanderson's attorneys said that they plan to call Paltrow to the stand to testify on Friday, but they could do so earlier in the week depending on the other witnesses' availability.Paltrow — wearing a cream-colored knit sweater, tweed harem pants and aviator-style reading glasses — shielded her face from photographers using a blue “GP”-initialed notebook as she entered and exited the courtroom. Sanderson wore a gray suit and left halfway before witnesses began testifying.Sanderson claims that Paltrow was cruising down the slopes so recklessly that they violently collided, leaving him on the ground as she and her entourage continued their descent down the skiers-only mountain known for its groomed runs, après-ski champagne yurts and posh clientele.“All skiers know that when they’re skiing down the mountain, it’s their responsibility to yield the right of way to skiers below them,” Sanderson’s attorney, Lawrence Buhler, told jurors, who — unlike those selected for most trials — walked into the courtroom smiling, likely because of their proximity to a major celebrity.Buhler highlighted his client's military service record and tried to appeal to the jury's sympathies — describing the broken ribs and brain trauma Sanderson sustained during and after the crash. Attempting to draw a contrast, Buhler described Paltrow as a wealthy, experienced skier who adopted a “So what?” attitude about the collision.“She hires multiple ski instructors for her children, which allows them to skip the lines. Private instructors cost thousands of dollars per day,” he said.Park City is a resort town in the Rocky Mountains that hosts the Sundance Film Festival, which draws a throng of celebrities each year.Paltrow and Sanderson both agree that they collided while on a beginner's run seven years ago, yet both accuse the other of being at fault and skiing up behind them.Sanderson is suing Paltrow for $300,000 — claiming that the accident in Park City was a result of negligence, and left him with physical injuries and emotional distress. After the collision, Sanderson's attorneys said their client went to urgent care and to the emergency room.On ski slopes, Utah law gives the skier who is downhill the right of way, so a central question in the case is who was farther down when the collision transpired. Both Paltrow and Sanderson claim that they were farther downhill when the other rammed into them.Both sides are presenting their clients as conservative skiers who were stunned when a skier above them crashed into them.Paltrow's attorneys told jurors Tuesday that Sanderson was the one who crashed into her — a collision in which she sustained what in court filings they called a “full body blow.” Attorney Steve Owens noted that members of Paltrow’s group checked on Sanderson, who assured them he was fine — an interaction Sanderson doesn't deny but said in court filings that he can't remember.Paltrow's attorney cautioned jurors not to let sympathy for Sanderson's medical ailments skew their judgements. He questioned the 76-year-old's credibility, noting his age and documented, pre-collision brain injuries. He said that the Utah man had confirmed he was fine after the crash. Owens also said that Sanderson posted a “very happy, smiling picture” of himself online, being tobogganed down post-crash.“His memories of the case get better over the years. That's all I'm gonna say. That's not how memory works,” Owens said.Two witnesses testified on Tuesday: Craig Ramon, a friend and ski companion of Sanderson's, and Karlene Davidson, a woman who was dating him in February 2016 during the crash.Ramon, who said he was skiing roughly 35 feet (11 meters) away at the time of the crash, testified on Tuesday afternoon. An outdoorsman who skis more than 150 days annually, Ramon said he heard a loud scream and saw Sanderson's ski tips fly up, causing him to fall face-down “spread-eagle” upon the collision. He testified that Paltrow hit Sanderson, bouncing off his back and sliding to his right.Paltrow’s ski instructor, a Deer Valley employee, approached moments later and said, “Your buddy just took out Gwyneth Paltrow,"" Ramon testified.Paltrow's attorney's attempted to paint Ramon as a close friend of Sanderson by showing pictures of him calmly smiling with other friends after the crash and brought up — but did not probe into — an email chain with Sanderson's family that suggested the collision was captured with a GoPro camera. The footage has not been seen or included as part of the trial's evidence.Davidson, Sanderson's ex-girlfriend, said that in addition to his injuries, she noticed his demeanor changed after the crash. He grew more distant and she said “had no joy left in his life,” which led to the demise of their relationship. Sanderson's attorneys attributed the changes to the crash. Paltrow's attorneys noted that the man had started dating another woman quickly after their break-up.After his initial lawsuit seeking $3.1 million was dismissed, Sanderson amended the complaint and he is now seeking $300,000. Paltrow — the Oscar-winning actor known for her roles in “Shakespeare in Love"" and Marvel's “Iron Man” movies — filed a counterclaim, seeking attorney fees and $1 in damages.Paltrow has alleged that Sanderson is overstating his injuries and trying to exploit her celebrity and wealth. In addition to her acting career, she is also the founder and CEO of high-end wellness company Goop.“He demanded Ms. Paltrow pay him millions. If she did not pay, she would face negative publicity resulting from his allegations,” her attorneys wrote in a 2019 court filing.The trial is expected to include testimony from numerous medical professionals and Paltrow's children, Moses and Apple.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841979,Japan's PM offers Ukraine support as China's Xi backs Russia,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit Tuesday to Kyiv, engaging in dueling diplomacy with Asian rival President Xi Jinping of China, who met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin to promote Beijing's peace proposal for Ukraine that Western nations have all but dismissed as a non-starter.The two visits, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) apart, highlighted how countries are lining up behind Moscow or Kyiv during the nearly 13-month-old war. Kishida, who will chair the Group of Seven summit in May, became the group's last member to visit Ukraine and meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after paying tribute to those killed in Bucha, a town that became a symbol of Russian atrocities against civilians.Xi and Putin announced no major progress toward implementing the Chinese peace deal, although the Russian leader said it could be a basis for ending the fighting when the West is ready. He added that Kyiv’s Western allies have shown no interest in that.U.S. officials have said any peace plan coming from the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable because a cease-fire would only ratify Moscow’s territorial conquests and give Russia time to plan for a renewed offensive.“It looks like the West indeed intends to fight Russia until the last Ukrainian,” Putin said, adding the latest threat is a British plan to give Ukraine tank rounds containing depleted uranium.“If that happens, Russia will respond accordingly, given that the collective West is starting to use weapons with a nuclear component,” he said, without elaborating. Putin has occasionally warned that Russia would use all available means, including possibly nuclear weapons, to defend itself, but also has sometimes backed off such threats.Putin's comment referred to remarks Monday by U.K junior Defense Minister Annabel Goldie, who wrote: “Alongside our granting of a squadron of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, we will be providing ammunition, including armor-piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium. Such rounds are highly effective in defeating modern tanks and armored vehicles.”Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the plan shows that the British “have lost the bearings,” and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said “it marked another step, and there aren’t so many of them left.""But weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commander of Britain’s Royal Tank Regiment, said it was “reckless” of Putin “to try and suggest Britain is sending nuclear material” to Ukraine. He said depleted uranium is a common component of tank rounds, possibly even used by Russia.“Putin insinuating that they are some sort of nuclear weapon is bonkers,"" he told The Associated Press. ""Depleted uranium is completely inert. There is no way that you could create a nuclear reaction or a nuclear explosion with depleted uranium.”Beijing insists it is a neutral broker in Ukraine, and Xi said after his talks with Putin: “We adhere to a principled and objective position on the Ukrainian crisis based on the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.” The Chinese plan seeks to “actively encourage peace and the resumption of talks,” he said.In a joint statement, Russia and China emphasized the need to “respect legitimate security concerns of all countries” to settle the conflict, echoing Moscow’s argument that it sent in troops to prevent the U.S. and its NATO allies from turning the country into an anti-Russian bulwark.“Russia welcomes China’s readiness to play a positive role in the political and diplomatic settlement of the Ukrainian crisis” and the “constructive ideas” contained in Beijing’s peace plan, the statement said. It added: “The parties underline that a responsible dialogue offers the best path for a lasting settlement ... and the international community should support constructive efforts in this regard.”After meeting Kishida, Zelenskyy told reporters his team had sent his own peace formula to China but hasn’t heard back, adding that there were “some signals, but nothing concrete about the possibility of a dialogue.”Kishida called Russia’s invasion a “disgrace that undermines the foundations of the international legal order” and pledged to “continue to support Ukraine until peace is back on the beautiful Ukrainian lands.”Hours before Xi and Putin dined at a state dinner in glittering Kremlin opulence, Kishida laid flowers at a church in Bucha for the town's victims.“Upon this visit to Bucha, I feel a strong resentment against cruelty,” he said. “I would like to represent the people in Japan, and express my deepest condolences to those who lost their loved ones, were injured as a result of this cruel act.”U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel noted the “two very different European-Pacific partnerships” that unfolded Tuesday.“Kishida stands with freedom, and Xi stands with a war criminal,” Emanuel tweeted, referring to Friday's decision by the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin, saying it wanted to put him on trial for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.Kyiv's allies pledged more support. Washington is accelerating its delivery of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, sending a refurbished older version that can be ready faster, the Pentagon announced. The aim is to get the 70-ton behemoths to the war zone by fall.The Russia-China front against the West was a prominent theme of Xi’s visit. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused NATO of seeking to become the world’s dominant military force. “That is why we are expanding our cooperation with China, including in the security sphere,” he said.Putin is keen to show he has a heavyweight ally and market for Russian energy products under Western sanctions. He and Xi signed agreements on economic cooperation, noting Russian-Chinese trade rose by 30% last year to $185 billion and is expected to top $200 billion this year.Russia stands “ready to meet the Chinese economy’s growing demand for energy resources” by boosting deliveries of oil and gas, he said, while listing other areas of cooperation, including aircraft and shipbuilding industries and other high-tech sectors.Whether China will provide military support is a key question. Western officials “have seen some signs” Putin also wants lethal weapons from Beijing, though there is no evidence it has granted his request, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels.Further contacts are planned. Xi said he invited Putin to China this year to discuss a regional initiative that seeks to extend Beijing's influence through economic cooperation.Moscow and Beijing have both weathered international condemnation of their human rights records. The Chinese government is accused of atrocities against Uighur Muslims in its far western Xinjiang region. The allegations include genocide, forced sterilization and the mass detention of nearly 1 million Uighurs. Beijing has denied the allegations. Russia has been accused of war crimes in Ukraine, charges it denies.Kishida rode a train from Poland to Kyiv just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and a week after a breakthrough summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yoel.Both China and Japan have enjoyed recent diplomatic successes that emboldened their foreign policy.Japan, which has engaged in territorial disputes over islands with both China and Russia, is particularly concerned about the Beijing-Moscow relationship. Both nations have conducted joint military exercises near Japan’s coasts.Beijing’s diplomatic foray follows its recent success in brokering a deal between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival, Saudi Arabia, to restore relations after years of tensions. The move displayed China's influence in a region where Washington has long been the major foreign player.Kishida became Japan’s first postwar leader to enter a war zone.Due to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has been limited to nonlethal equipment and humanitarian supplies. It has contributed more than $7 billion to Ukraine and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians, despite its strict immigration policy.Tokyo joined the U.S. and European nations in sanctioning Russia over the invasion. By contrast, China has refused to condemn Moscow’s aggression and criticized Western sanctions against Moscow, while accusing NATO and Washington of provoking Putin’s military action.Japan fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said of Kishida’s trip: “We hope Japan could do more things to deescalate the situation instead of the opposite.”___Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Lolita C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841980,"Garbage: In Paris streets, heaps of it become protest symbol","PARIS (AP) — Garbage. Heaps, mounds and piles of it are growing daily — and in some places standing higher than a human being.A strike by Paris garbage collectors, which begins its 16th day on Tuesday, is taking a toll on the renowned aesthetics of the French capital, a veritable blight on the City of Light.“I prefer Chanel to the stink,” joked Vincent Salazar, a 62-year-old artistic consultant who lives in a tony Left Bank neighborhood. A pile of garbage sits at the corner of his building overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens.“I’ve seen rats,” he said.But like many nonchalant and strike-hardened Parisians, Salazar doesn’t mind.“I’m fortunate to live here, but I’m 200% behind these guys,” Salazar said. “They're smelling it all day long,” he said, though “it” wasn't the word he used. ""They should get early retirement.”He is among the majority of French who, polls show, oppose President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to raise the retirement age by two years, from 62 to 64 for most and from 57 to 59 for garbage collectors.Macron rammed the showcase legislation of his second term through Parliament last week — without a vote, thanks to a special constitutional article. On Monday, the government won two no-confidence motions put forth by angry lawmakers. The bill is now considered adopted.But garbage got wrapped up in the politics. And neither unions organizing protests nor some citizens are prepared to back down.Posters showing a digitally altered images of Macron atop a garbage heap — or collecting garbage himself — have made the rounds on social networks.The Socialist mayor of Paris, who supports the strikers, found herself in a bind. City Hall refused orders to get the trucks out, saying it’s not their job. Police Chief Laurent Nunez then ordered garages unblocked and ordered 674 sanitation personnel and 206 garbage trucks back to work to provide a minimal service, police tweeted Tuesday.Sure enough, a green Paris garbage truck was seen collecting a long, high pile of rubbish Tuesday outside a school on a Left Bank street — although the truck was full long before all the refuse could be cleaned up. With incinerators blocked, the garbage was being taken to a storage site outside Paris.City Hall said that as of Monday, 9,300 tons of rubbish remained on the streets.Workers in numerous sectors, from transportation to energy, have been holding intermittent strikes since January. But it is the garbage in the French capital that has made garbage collectors, long taken for granted, visible — and their anger obvious.The city's vibrant outdoor culture is feeling the effects. Some of Paris' fabled narrow streets are more choked than usual, forcing people on foot to pass through garbage heaps single file. The scent of rancid, rotting garbage increasingly wafts through the air as spring arrives and the weather grows milder. Seats at some sidewalk cafes located near heaps of rubbish are empty.A server for the past 26 years at Le Bistro du Dome specializing in fish, adjacent to the famed restaurant Le Dome, said some 50% of diners had disappeared in the past 10 days. Other restaurants are suffering the same fate, said Guillaume, who would identify himself only by his first name.“It doesn't bother me because it's for a good cause,” said Franck Jacquot, 51, standing outside a small bar he runs. Nearby, heaps of garbage loomed. “If we're obliged to go this route — well, we're here,"" he said.However, garbage bags and bins have served as fuel for troublemakers.Two spontaneous protests last week at the huge Place de la Concorde, facing the National Assembly, degenerated when police started evacuating thousands with tear gas and water cannons. Some of those forced out began setting fires to garbage piles along their path through high-end Paris.That scenario was repeated Monday night when hundreds of young people demonstrated near the gold-domed Invalides monument, site of Napoleon’s tomb. As night fell, small, mobile groups of troublemakers combed the city, burning trash bags, lamp posts and other objects. Nunez, the police chief, speaking on TV news station BFM, said 234 people were detained.More is ahead: Unions are planning nationwide marches and strikes for Thursday to pressure the government to withdraw the retirement measure.“Garbage is a good way to protest. It has a big impact,” said Tony Gibierge, 36, who is opening a restaurant in several months on a street in southern Paris — a street currently heaped with garbage.He was among those who have peacefully demonstrated through Paris, and other cities, with song and dance in recent weeks. “Now we have to send out the fire, stop dancing,” he said. The message: Nothing is over, and much of the garbage isn't going anywhere quite yet.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841981,US: No reason for China to react to Taiwan leader stopover,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is putting out the word that planned stopovers in the United States by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in the coming weeks fall in line with recent precedent and should not be used as a pretext by China to step up aggressive activity in the Taiwan Strait.Taiwan’s office of the president confirmed on Tuesday that Tsai is tentatively scheduled to transit through New York on March 30 before heading to Guatemala and Belize. She’s expected to stop in Los Angeles on April 5 on her way back to Taiwan. The office did not provide details of her itinerary while in the U.S.Ahead of Taiwan's announcement, senior U.S. officials in Washington and Beijing have underscored to their Chinese counterparts in recent weeks that transit visits through the United States during broader international travel by the Taiwanese president have been routine over the years, according to a senior administration official. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.In such unofficial visits in recent years, Tsai has met with members of Congress and the Taiwanese diaspora and has been welcomed by the chairperson of the American Institute in Taiwan, the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the planned stopovers—administration officials stress they are not official visits—are “business as usual” and consistent with longstanding U.S. policy.“There’s no reason for China to overreact,"" Kirby said about the expected unofficial visit. ""Heck, there’s no reason for China to react.”Tsai transited through the United States six times between 2016 and 2019 before slowing international travel with the coronavirus pandemic. In reaction to those visits, China rhetorically lashed out against the U.S. and Taiwan.State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said “the unofficial nature of our relations with Taiwan remains unchanged.”The Biden administration is trying to avoid a replay of the heavy-handed response by China that came after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year.Following Pelosi's August visit, Beijing launched missiles over Taiwan, deployed warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and carried out military exercises near the island. Beijing also suspended climate talks with the U.S. and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he would meet with Tsai when she is in the U.S. and has not ruled out the possibility of traveling to Taiwan in a show of support.Beijing sees official American contact with Taiwan as encouragement to make the island’s decades-old de facto independence permanent, a step U.S. leaders say they don’t support. Pelosi, D-Calif., was the highest-ranking elected American official to visit the island since Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997. Under the “one China” policy, the U.S. recognizes Beijing as the government of China and doesn’t have diplomatic relations with Taiwan but has maintained that Taipei is an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.U.S. officials are increasingly worried about China’s long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with the mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which has governed U.S. relations with the island, does not require the U.S. to step in militarily if China invades but makes it American policy to ensure Taiwan has the resources to defend itself and to prevent any unilateral change of status by Beijing.The difficult U.S.-China relationship has only become more complicated since Pelosi's visit.Last month, President Joe Biden ordered a Chinese spy balloon shot out of the sky after it traversed the continental United States. And the Biden administration in recent weeks has said that U.S. intelligence findings show that China is weighing sending arms to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, but it does not have evidence that suggests Beijing has decided to follow through on supplying Moscow.The Biden administration postponed a planned visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Antony Blinken following the balloon controversy but has signaled it would like to get such a visit back on track.The White House on Monday also said officials are in talks with China about possible visits by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo focused on economic matters. Biden has also said he expects to soon hold a call with China's Xi Jinping.Kirby said “keeping those lines of communication open” is still valuable.Presidents Vladimir Putin and Xi met in Moscow on Tuesday for a second day of talks, the first face-to-face meeting between the allies since before Russia launched its Ukraine invasion more than a year ago.The Taiwanese government earlier this month said that Tsai planned stops in New York and Southern California during an upcoming broader international trip.___AP journalists Johnson Lai in Taipei and Josh Boak and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed reporting.___This story has been corrected to show China lashed out against the U.S., not against China.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841982,"Ignoring experts, China's sudden zero-COVID exit cost lives","BEIJING (AP) — When China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases. Hospitals turned away ambulances, crematoriums burned bodies around the clock, and relatives hauled dead loved ones to warehouses for lack of storage space.Chinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive."" But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party held off on repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press has found.Instead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted detailed proposals to prepare for a gradual exit to the State Council, China’s cabinet.But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Zero-COVID had become a point of national pride, and tightening controls on speech under Xi had made scientists reluctant to speak out against the party line.By the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people, even as omicron evaded increasingly harsh controls.Unrest began to simmer, with demonstrations, factory riots, and shuttered businesses. The pressure mounted until the authorities suddenly yielded, allowing the virus to sweep the country with no warning — and with deadly consequence.Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps more, may have died in China’s wave of COVID — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a significantly lower death rate than in the United States and Europe. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to modeling by the University of Hong Kong and scientist estimates. Some scientists think even more lives could have been saved.“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”___PLANS DERAILEDToward the end of 2021, many public health experts and leaders began thinking about how to exit from the zero-COVID policy. The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.That winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.It concluded it was time for China to begin preparations for a possible reopening. It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.But then things began going awry.A chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong alarmed Beijing. Then in March, the virus began spreading in Shanghai, China’s cosmopolitan finance hub.Initially, Shanghai took a light approach with targeted lockdowns sealing individual buildings — a pioneering strategy led by doctor Zhang Wenhong, who had been openly calling on the government to prepare to reopen. But soon, officials in neighboring provinces complained they were seeing cases from Shanghai and asked the central leadership to lock the city down, according to three people familiar with the matter.China CDC contact tracing reports obtained by the AP show that a nearby province was detecting dozens of COVID-19 cases by early March, all from Shanghai. Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.At the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar,"" traveled there to oversee a total lockdown.“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.Shanghai was ill-prepared. Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID,"" an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. “Persistence is victory,” said Xi.___KEEPING SILENCEAfter Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit. None were willing to openly challenge a policy supported by Xi. Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.In early April, China’s State Council leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.The State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.Gao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, Gao was quoted as saying “omicron is not that dangerous,"" that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”Weeks later, Gao appeared at a private event on COVID exit strategies around the world at the German Embassy in Beijing and urged more vaccinations in China, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.There were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.In private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with pre-recorded remarks from Xi that listed defeating COVID as the top priority. But under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, Li was powerless, analysts say.Public health experts split into camps. Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.Liang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.Health authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”Authorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”The Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.Risking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay quiet until the congress was over.“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”___INCREASING PRESSUREOfficials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.Tourists were locked into hotels, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home. In Inner Mongolia, a state-run ammunition factory forced workers to live in its compound 24 hours a day for weeks on end away from their families, according to Moses Xu, a retired worker.In brutal lockdowns for over three months in China’s far west, residents in Xinjiang starved, while thousands in Tibet marched on the streets, defying orders in a rare protest. Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control.Yet omicron kept spreading. As the congress approached, authorities began hiding cases and resorting to secret lockdowns and quarantines.Authorities locked down Zhengzhou, a provincial capital home to over 10 million people, with no public announcement, even though they were reporting only a handful of cases. They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.Local governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.___PUSHING FOR CHANGEWith the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up.In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s CDC, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID controls, saying it had “no scientific basis."" He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan. He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.Along with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”In early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, according to a state media account, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.___THE EXITThe government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.In Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, officials canceled mass testing and opened the city, only to reinstate harsh measures days later. Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.Individual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.In late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.References to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.Days after the protests, Sun, the COVID czar, held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.On Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.The next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”Soon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.In just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive obtained by a former state media journalist and posted online.“Make a big propaganda push,” it ordered. “Counter the false claims leveled by the United States and the West that we were 'forced to open' and ‘hadn’t prepared.'”___AP reporter Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.___This story was first published on March 22, 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4841983,"Ohtani ready to pitch vs Trout, USA in relief at WBC final","MIAMI (AP) — That matchup between Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani in the World Baseball Classic may not happen.Japan rallied in the ninth inning to beat Mexico and advance to Tuesday night’s championship game against the United States, but Shota Imanaga will start on the mound for the Samurai Warriors.If Trout is to bat against his Los Angeles Angels teammate, it would only be if Ohtani makes a rare relief appearance.Japan manager Hideki Kuriyama said he likely will use the same starting lineup as he did in the semifinal Monday night against Mexico, when Ohtani batted third as the designated hitter and doubled to start the ninth-inning comeback.Asked before the game what chance Ohtani had of pitching Tuesday, Kuriyama replied through a translator: “I won’t say it’s a zero.”While Ohtani has never relieved since joining the Angels for the 2018 season, he came out of the bullpen twice for the Pacific League's Nippon-Ham Fighters in 2013 and once in 2016.“I'll definitely be prepared to pitch wherever, but before that I am going to have to hit, so make sure I put some runs on the board before I get to pitch,” Ohtani said through a translator.Ohtani last took the mound on March 16 in a 9-3 quarterfinal victory over Italy in Tokyo, starting and pitching shutout ball into the fifth inning. He allowed two runs and four hits with five strikeouts and a walk, throwing 71 pitches.Trout, a three-time AL MVP, has been a Los Angeles Angels teammate of Ohtani's since 2018 and like most everyone has watched Ohtani become a two-way star without precedent — Babe Ruth didn’t put up big offensive totals until his pitching days were largely behind.Ahead of the WBC, Trout pondered what it would be like to hit against Ohtani, the 2021 AL MVP.“I get a front-row seat every time he pitches when he’s with us, so it’s pretty nasty,” Trout said. “And every person I talk to that faces him says they don’t want to be in the box. So it’s going to be interesting. I’m looking forward to it. He’s one of my good friends, so it’s going to be fun.”Merrill Kelly starts for the U.S., which will be the visiting team. The Americans had a day off following their 14-2 semifinal rout of Cuba.Ohtani is hitting .450 with one home run, four doubles, nine walks and eight RBIs during the WBC. He is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 8 2/3 innings on the mound.Trout is hitting .318 with one homer, seven RBIs, five walks and nine strikeouts in 22 at-bats.“Obviously, Trout versus Ohtani, I think that’s special,” Japan center fielder Lars Nootbaar said. “I think it’s good that Japan versus the U.S. is going to be in the finals. And personally, I’ve got some friends and got some teammates over there, too, so it makes it even more special and more exciting.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

I think we’re all still in shock. Life is,"" the visibly shaken Fishburne said, pausing briefly before continuing, ""hard sometimes.”Many of those who worked on the film wore blue ribbons to honor Reddick, who was a prolific character actor with prominent roles in “The Wire,” “Oz” and the “John Wick"" film franchise.“Just to be in his light and to get a chance to work with him, I’ll cherish for the rest of my life,” Reeves said. “He had such a passion for his work and his craft. He was gracious. He had a dignity to him and a presence.”Reddick, 60, died Friday in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Mia Hansen said. No further details were provided.Tributes have poured in for the actor, whose roles made him a beloved and recognizable star of television and films. He played Charon, the multi-skilled Continental Hotel concierge who is fond of Wick, an assassin played by Reeves. The latest installment arrives in theaters Friday.“He’s the goodness of this film. He was kind of, in many ways, the heart of the film because his character loved John Wick,” Fishburne said.“You know, it’s always hard when you lose someone that you love dearly ... but you’re also incredibly grateful for the time you had together. We were fortunate enough to work with Lance since the very beginning of the ‘John Wick’ franchise. I mean it’s been almost 10 years,” director Chad Stahelski said. “I really wish he could be with us tonight, but, you know, life. But we’re very fortunate to have known him. And he’s a great man, a great artist, a great human, a dear friend.”Shamier Anderson, a newcomer to “Wick” franchise, recalled how Reddick took time to say a kind word on set.“I grew up watching Lance Reddick. It is a bittersweet moment because he was definitely one of my heroes growing up as an actor, as a Black actor,"" Anderson said. ""And even though we didn’t share screen time together in this film, we shared some time off camera and he was salt of the Earth when he first met me.“He said, ‘Shamier, you’re incredible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842029,Asian shares advance on back of Wall Street rally,"BANGKOK (AP) — Asian shares advanced Wednesday after a Wall Street rally led by the banks most beaten down by the industry’s crisis.Oil prices fell back and U.S. futures were little changed.Investors are awaiting an interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to temper its efforts to tame inflation given the recent turmoil that has wracked the banking sector. Some of Wall Street’s fear washed out after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government could offer the banking industry more assistance if needed.Most economists expect the Fed to announce a relatively modest quarter-point hike in its benchmark rate, its ninth hike since March of last year.Markets around the world have pinballed sharply this month on worries the banking system may be cracking under the pressure of the fastest set of hikes to interest rates in decades. This week’s rally now runs into a huge test with the Fed decision.In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 surged 2.1% to 27,501.24, catching up on gains after the market was closed on Tuesday for a holiday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advanced 1.9% to 19,629.21 and the Shanghai Composite index added 0.3% to 3,263.85.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 jumped 0.9% to 7,016.40. The Kospi in South Korea climbed 1% to 2,412.94.Tuesday on Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 1.3% to lock in its first back-to-back gain since Silicon Valley Bank’s rapid failure began two weeks ago. It closed at 4,002.87.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% to 32,560.60, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.6% to 11,860.11.Yellen told a bankers’ group more government assistance “could be warranted” if risks arise that could bring down the system. That could mean making sure customers at a weakened bank get all their money, even those with more than the $250,000 limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.“Janet Yellen coming out and saying should other deposits need to be protected, they’re willing and able to do that, I think that’s a very strong statement,” said Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth. “And so markets have been able to calm down.”Earlier this month, the U.S. government said it would make all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank whole. They were the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history.Those banks had struggled as depositors rushed to pull their money out en masse. Such runs can topple a bank, and investors have since been hunting for the next one that could fall. Much focus has been on First Republic Bank, which in some ways is similar to Silicon Valley Bank. Its stock had lost 90% for the month through Monday but jumped 29.5% Tuesday.Other smaller and mid-sized banks also rallied, including a 9.1% climb for Comerica and a 9.3% jump for KeyCorp.Hopes for the banking industry began to turn over the weekend after regulators pushed together two huge Swiss banks. Shares of both banks rose Tuesday in Switzerland, including a 12.1% jump for acquirer UBS. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, rose 7.3% after tumbling a day earlier.Central banks have jacked up rates at a blistering pace in hopes of getting high inflation under control. Higher rates slow the economy, raising risks of a recession and also hurting prices for stocks and other investments.Earlier this month, much of Wall Street was bracing for the Fed to reaccelerate its hikes and raise by 0.50 percentage points on Wednesday after reports on the job market, retail sales and inflation came in hotter than expected. Now, traders are beginning to bet that the Fed might even cut interest rates later this year.In other trading Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 35 cents to $69.32 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It jumped $1.85 to $69.67 on Tuesday.Brent crude, the pricing basis for international oils, declined 34 cents to $74.98 per barrel.The dollar rose to 132.48 Japanese yen from 132.47 yen. The euro was nearly unchanged at $1.0770.___AP Business Writers Stan Choe and Alex Veiga contributed.___",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842030,"Ignoring experts, China's sudden zero-COVID exit cost lives","BEIJING (AP) — When China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases, with hospitals turning away ambulances and crematoriums burning bodies around the clock.Chinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive."" But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party held off on repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press found.Instead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that may have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former China Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”Experts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps more, may have died in China’s wave of COVID-19 — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a significantly lower death rate than in the United States and Europe. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to modeling by the University of Hong Kong. Some scientists estimate even more lives could have been saved.“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”For two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.In late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted a detailed reopening strategy to the State Council, China’s cabinet. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.But discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit, as they were wary of openly challenging a policy supported by Xi.By the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people.“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”At the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.With the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up. In an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, China’s CDC chief epidemiologist, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID-19 controls, saying it had “no scientific basis."" He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”At the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.Wu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.Another who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID outbreak Wuhan. He wrote to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong.In early November, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. On Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.The next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.The government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.With conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.In late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.Riot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.References to zero-COVID vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.Days after the protests, Sun held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. The final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.Many in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.On Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.The next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”___AP reporter Kanis Leung in Hong Kong contributed to this report.",2023/03/25,,World

                                                                Blood Oxygen Sensor Market
Market Overview:
The blood oxygen sensor, also known as pulse oximetry, is a device that measures oxygen saturation or blood oxygen levels. This noninvasive, painless test can detect changes in oxygen levels from the heart to other parts of the body including the legs and arms. The pulse oximetry device is small and clip-like. It attaches to parts such as the finger, toes, or earlobe. Two beams of light are passed through the device, each with a different wavelength. This is then detected by a photodetector. The device measures the wavelength-dependent absorbance, which allows it to determine the absorbance due only to the pulsed arterial blood. It excludes venous blood, skin and bone, muscles, fat, and skin. A blood oxygen sensor is used often in critical care settings such as hospitals and emergency rooms. The blood oxygen sensor is used to monitor patients suffering from conditions such as heart attack, lung cancer, and anemia.










The primary driver for growth in the target market is the rising prevalence of conditions such as sleep apnea and cardiac arrhythmia (COPD), and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). The target market is expected to grow due to technological advances that will improve the accuracy and efficiency of these devices. They also have greater user-friendliness. The target market is growing because of increasing surgeries and the emphasis on patient safety under anesthesia. For long-term monitoring in hospitals or emergency rooms, handheld devices are more popular. Because of their ease of use, easy availability over the counter, and many other benefits, fingertip oximeters are in high demand.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842043,All About Thai Food & Thai Restaurants in Pune Delivering Food Online,"Thai cuisine is delectable and has gained popularity all over the world because of its intense tastes. If you’ve never had Thai food, get ready to be wowed by the complex flavours and rich spices that make it so special. The utilization of contrasting flavours in Thai cuisine is what sets it apart from other cuisines. Thai cuisine frequently combines spiciness with sweetness and mild citrus notes, such as lime and mango. Any dish benefits from the depth that the distinctive peanut sauce brings because it is both sweet and savoury. Thai cuisine differs from other Asian cuisines in that each meal feels completely unique due to the layers of flavour. Now you can also have Thai food in Pune if you order food online via Swiggy.History and origin of Thai cuisineMany centuries ago, when southern Chinese regions were being colonized by Thailand, the first group to bring food with them was the Thai people. Although many other influences have impacted Thai cuisine throughout the years, historically, Szechwan was a significant influence on the cuisine. In the distant past, southern Muslim nations impacted the cuisine of Thailand’s south, while Buddhist monks added an Indian flavour. After coming into contact with Portuguese missionaries and Dutch commerce, European cuisine began to have a much later influence on Thai cuisine. Even some Japanese influences can be seen throughout this period. The five tastes of sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy are combined in a distinctive way to make Thai food today, and you can also have a part of this taste if you can order food online, namely Thai food.Different kinds of Thai food dishes you must try if you order food online in PunePad ThaiChinese immigrants brought noodle dishes to Thailand, with Pad Thai possibly being the most well-known of them. This iconic dish is a great place to begin if you’ve never tried Thai food because it’s not extremely spicy. Like many dishes, Pad Thai is regionally different but always contains the same basic ingredients: seafood, flat rice noodles, dried shrimp, tamarind, bean sprouts, fish sauce, shallots, and egg. These ingredients are stir-fried in a hot wok before being served on plates with roasted peanuts, fresh herbs, and chillies (optional). The well-balanced flavour contrast and signature sweet, sour, and salty Thai flavour combination are perfectly exemplified in Pad Thai.Khao SoiWhatever time of day or night in Thailand, noodle soups are a common street food dish. Khao Soi (or Soy), a speciality of Northern Thailand and a favourite in Chiang Mai, is one of the most adored variants. This Burmese-inspired soup is famous for its mildly spicy and aromatic curry broth, which is made with a rich coconut milk base, soft egg noodles, and either beef, chicken, or tofu. Deep-fried crispy egg noodles, pickled vegetables, and sliced shallots are added on top. All of these flavours can be found in one mouthful of Khao Soi: it’s wonderful, cosy, somewhat spicy, sweet, and creamy, and you can also have the delicacy at home if you decide to order food online.Khao PadLocals love this traditional Thai fried rice meal, which is frequently served anytime but is especially delicious for lunch. In addition to eggs, onions, garlic, fish sauce, fresh herbs, tomatoes, or other vegetables, khao pad can be cooked with chicken, pork, beef, shellfish, or tofu. Cucumber slices, lime wedges, and other toppings are served with this mixture of ingredients after they have been thoroughly stir-fried with fragrant Jasmine rice. For picky eaters or those seeking a spice break, this very straightforward dish can be ordered, giving you control over the level of heat and other seasonings. Khao Pad Sapparod, a version with pineapple and prawns, is a delicious substitute.Som TamSom Tam, arguably one of Thailand’s most well-known salad dishes, is said to have its origins in Laos but has since evolved into a delicious north-eastern speciality and one of Thailand’s most cherished foods, which you can also have by deciding to order food online in Pune. Som Tam is a salad that takes on many different forms. The traditional recipe, however, usually calls for red chillies, shredded green papaya, lime juice, fish sauce, tamarind pulp, and palm sugar. Runner beans, carrots, and cherry tomatoes are added to the mixture of these items. For their nutty and crunchy textures, dried shrimp and roasted peanuts are typically included. They are all ground up in a pestle and mortar, giving them a particular flavour that is sweet, savoury, spicy, salty, and sour. Regional versions can include fermented crab or papaya in place of mangoes to provide an entirely new flavour depth.Gaeng DaengOne of the most popular curry varieties in Thailand is red curry. They are often milder than green curries but spicier than yellow curries. Crushed red chillies in the curry paste, a mixture of garlic, shallots, blue ginger, and lemongrass, combined with coconut milk, and vegetables including tomatoes, eggplant, and mushrooms as chicken breast slices, give this dish its unique red hue. The curry is finished with thinly sliced kaffir leaves and sweet basil, creating a perfectly balanced mixture of creamy and spicy broth that will tingle your taste buds.Restaurants in Pune that can deliver Thai food in case you order food onlineThai HouseIf you love Thai food, head to Thai House, a charming restaurant in Khadki. Thai artefacts cover the walls, giving the space a pleasant atmosphere. Do make a Tom Yum Soup order when you decide to order from here.GongBring your crew to Baner’s Gong for delicious Thai food, or order food online.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842051,Taiwan vice president takes 11% lead over most likely KMT election rival,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Vice President and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德) has taken a strong lead in the race for the next presidential election, according to an opinion poll released Tuesday (March 21).Lai scored 36.2%, or 11% more than his most likely rival, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) of the Kuomintang (KMT), a Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) survey found. Hou would receive 24.8%, with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) Chairman Ko Wen-je (柯文哲) finishing at 19% if Lai, Hou, and Ko were the only three candidates running in the Jan. 13, 2024 elections, Storm Media reported.While Lai was the only contender registering for the DPP nomination, the KMT has still not made its choice. Foxconn Technology founder Terry Gou (郭台銘), who has been mulling rejoining the main opposition party, and KMT Chairman Eric Chu (朱立倫) have also been regarded as potential candidates.TPOF Chairman Ying-lung You (游盈隆) said the new results could indicate a turning point in the race, with Lai surging by 8.5% compared to a February poll, and Hou losing 7.6%. Since the TPOF launched the monthly poll last December, both Lai and Hou had their highs and lows, but the vice president looked like he was on an upward trajectory, while the New Taipei City mayor was losing ground. Only Ko’s support level was stable, though he remained in third place, You said.The question remains whether the race is set, with Lai maintaining a lead and Hou remaining behind, which amounts to a key change from the KMT’s victory in last November’s local elections.Focus Survey Research conducted the opinion poll on behalf of the TPOF from March 13-14, producing 1,073 valid responses with a margin of error of 2.99%.",2023/03/21,907,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842189,Swedish investigator says S. Korea key to her adoption probe,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A Swedish legal expert investigating the country’s international adoption practices said Tuesday she’s trying to determine whether Swedish authorities were aware of falsified child origins as they approved the adoptions of thousands of South Korean children.Anna Singer spoke to The Associated Press during a weeklong trip to South Korea, where she plans to meet with officials from the government and a Seoul-based agency that handled adoptions to Sweden to gather details on how South Korea procured and documented children for foreign adoptions.Many South Korean adoptees accuse their agencies of fabricating documents to expedite adoptions by foreigners, such as falsely registering them as abandoned orphans when they had relatives who could be easily identified, which also makes their origins difficult to trace.Most South Korean adoptees were sent overseas during the 1970s and ’80s, when Seoul was ruled by a succession of military governments that saw adoptions as a way to deepen ties with the democratic West while reducing the number of mouths to feed.“Our primary focus is the Swedish organizations and the Swedish actors — what did they do and what did they know? But in order to get a full understanding, we also need to know how (adoptions were) organized in the countries of origin,” said Singer, a law professor at Uppsala University who was appointed by the Swedish government to lead the investigation in 2021.She said such findings would be key in determining whether Sweden had effective safeguards or monitoring measures to ensure South Korean adoptees weren't wrongfully displaced from their biological parents.Singer's investigation is aimed at identifying irregularities in the way Swedish government agencies, municipalities and adoption organizations handled international adoptions that came from around 80 countries, including whether they were aware that child origins were being fabricated in sending nations.A number of European countries have begun investigating how they’ve conducted international adoptions, in the face of growing concerns that children were being wrongfully removed from their biological families.While the investigations have been triggered by more recent adoptions from South America and other parts of Asia, another focus has been the thousands of children adopted from South Korea during the country’s 1970-80s adoption boom, which created the world’s largest diaspora of adoptees.Hundreds of Korean adoptees from Europe, the United States and Australia are demanding South Korea’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigate the circumstances surrounding their adoptions, which they say were based on documents that falsified or obscured their origins.The commission has accepted dozens among the nearly 400 applications filed in 2022 and is expected to take more cases in the following months, opening what’s likely to be most meaningful inquiry into South Korea's foreign adoptions yet.South Korea sent around 200,000 children to the West for adoptions in the past six decades, with more than half of them placed in the U.S. Along with France and Denmark, Sweden was a major European destination of South Korean children, adopting nearly 10,000 of them since the 1960s.Former adoption workers and experts say most Western adoption agencies likely knew that their South Korean partners were manipulating paperwork to send more children faster. The awareness may have been more obvious with European agencies, which, unlike U.S. agencies that mostly sought babies, also accepted older children and apparently understood that many of them had parents who were married but going through financial problems or divorce, although they’d be described as orphans in documents.The government of former military strongman Park Chung-hee temporarily halted South Korean adoptions to Sweden, Denmark, and Norway in the 1970s, after rival North Korea's embassies in those countries accused Seoul of selling away its babies. However, South Korea quickly resumed adoptions in response to what diplomatic documents seen by AP describe as those government’s “strong requests” and repeated “pressing.” When asked whether international adoptions over the past decades developed into a process of finding children for Western families, rather than finding families for children, Singer said: “Yeah, probably.” Sweden’s investigation follows similar inquiries by Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands.France, which has also launched an investigation into its adoptions, recently withdrew an accreditation for Rayon de Soleil de l’Enfant Etranger. The Paris-based adoption agency has been placing children from several countries, including South Korea, through a decadeslong partnership with the Seoul-based Holt Children’s Services. The French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs told AP that the decision, which RDSEE vows to challenge, was based on unspecified accusations about its practices that made it impossible for the agency to fulfill its mission. The ministry didn’t specify whether the complaints included those raised by Korean adoptees. An investigation is also planned in Norway, and lawmakers during a February visit to South Korea met with officials from the truth commission in Seoul to discuss potential sharing of investigation records.Singer said she has no immediate plans to directly investigate the cases of the 21 Swedish adoptees who submitted applications to the South Korean truth commission, but was actively communicating with Korean adoptee groups in Sweden while trying to establish details about systemic problems surrounding South Korean adoptions.Singer’s team has so far interviewed more than 40 adoptees since starting the investigation in February 2022, including those from South Korea, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia, who she says have expressed similar complaints about a lack of access to records.“They’re not there, they were burnt, they were (soaked), they disappeared,” Singer said. “I mean, there’s thousands of different explanations on why they can’t access original files.”",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842190,"At Ukraine's front, police try to evacuate holdout families","AVDIIVKA, Ukraine (AP) — Pale and grimy from living in a dank, dark basement for nearly a year, the teenager and his weeping mother emerged to the sound of pounding artillery and headed to a waiting armored police van that would whisk them to safety.Russian forces were not far from their battered front-line town of Avdiivka in eastern Ukraine, where shells fall daily, ripping through buildings, smashing cars and leaving craters.Dark, curly hair peeping out from beneath his hoodie, 15-year-old Oleksii Mazurin was one of the last youths still living there. After his evacuation Friday, another 13 remained, said police chief Roman Protsyk.Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, about 25,000 people lived in Avdiivka. Despite the shelling, about 2,000 civilians remain, Protsyk said.For months, authorities have been urging civilians in areas near the fighting to evacuate to safer parts of the country. But while many have heeded the call, others — including families with children — have steadfastly refused.So it has fallen to police to try to persuade people to leave. A special unit known as the White Angels risk their lives to head into front-line villages and towns, knocking on doors and pleading with the few remaining residents to evacuate.In early March, the government issued an order for the compulsory evacuation of families with children from combat areas. Under the order, children must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. But it currently applies only to Bakhmut, the hard-hit eastern city where fighting has raged for months.“The compulsory evacuation order is unfortunately only in force in Bakhmut. In Avdiivka, this law is not adopted,” said White Angels policeman Gennadiy Yudin. “We’re driving around to all the families. We are warning them, we are informing them about the evacuation.”In Bakhmut itself, the situation is so dangerous that civilian evacuations are exceptionally risky.“I already think that for Bakhmut, it’s too late,” Protsyk said. “Here in our region, ... if such a decision would be made now, it would be safe.”But without a compulsory evacuation order, the hands of the police are tied. All they can do is use their powers of persuasion.For Oleksii’s mother, 37-year-old, Svitlana Mazurina, the decision to finally leave was tough.“It’s hard when you’ve lived in this town from birth,” she said. “Now I’m leaving I don’t know to where, where no one needs me. I don’t know where or what to start with.”Mazurina had been living in the building’s basement with her partner and Oleksii for nearly a year, fearing the bombs less than leaving for an unknown destination and an uncertain future. Her partner still won’t leave, saying he fears being drafted into the army.“I agreed only because I feel sorry for the child,” Mazurina said. “I want him to live well.”And living well is no longer possible in Avdiivka. Living at all is a game of chance.Moments before the evacuation of the mother and son and just a few streets away, another apartment building was hit by an airstrike. The entire corner of the apartment block was gone, reduced to smoldering rubble as flames and black smoke billowed from the gaping hole the bomb left in the 15-story structure.As Yudin and a fellow White Angels policeman surveilled the damage, the wail of incoming artillery pierced the air. They dived to the ground as the detonation reverberated through the shattered landscape of bombed-out buildings and splintered trees. As the sound died down, they picked themselves up and headed to Mazurina’s apartment building.But not all attempts to evacuate civilians are successful. Protsyk, the police chief, described families hiding their children from authorities, or accusing police of trying to kidnap them.In the nearby village of Netailove, so close to the front line that the sound of shooting sounded across the fields on the village outskirts, the police tried — and failed — to persuade a teenager’s family that it was time to go.“Drop everything, I cannot imagine it,” said Natalya, wiping tears from her eyes. “I just want to die. I can’t live without a home.”Her son, 14-year-old Maksim, said he wanted to stay, as did his father, Andreii. Natalya was in favor of evacuation but wouldn’t leave them. The family did not give their surname.Again and again, the police tried to convince them: “What if a shell destroys your house? What if you are injured?”Natalya replied: “It is better to die fast.”A policeman countered, “But the child will live and live. A child’s life is important.”The argument was to no avail. Maksim stood outside his home, his hoodie pulled over his head to ward off the morning cold.He didn’t flinch at the sound of exploding artillery. No one did — the shelling has become the regular backdrop of their lives.___Vasilisa Stepanenko in Avdiivka contributed.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/21,,World

From March 3-5, the men were advised by doctors to take a test for the disease after reporting symptoms such as fever, nasal congestion, headache, fatigue, oral ulcers, diarrhea, rash, swollen lymph nodes, blisters, and pustules. They were confirmed positive between March 14 and 15.The CDC pointed out that the four cases are currently undergoing treatment in hospital isolation wards. A total of 14 medium- and high-risk contacts have been listed after an epidemiological investigation was conducted.They have undergone health education and self-health monitoring for 21 days. Another 52 low-risk contacts have been given general health education to monitor their symptoms.According to the CDC, Taiwan has listed Mpox as a category 2 communicable disease since June 23, 2022. As of Tuesday, a total of 16 cases, including 10 local cases and six imported cases have been confirmed.The cases range in age from their 20s to their 50s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842232,Taiwan shuts down Honduras foreign minister's false claims regarding diplomatic switch,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday (March 21) refuted Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina’s claim that his country had already notified Taiwan about officially terminating diplomatic relations.
Reina gave an interview to the Honduran newspaper El Mundo on March 17, commenting on Tegucigalpa’s potential switch of recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Honduras has not submitted any official documents to Taiwan, MOFA said in a statement. Taiwan Ambassador to Honduras Vivia Chang (張俊菲) has not received any notification concerning the severance of diplomatic ties, despite paying attention to interactions between China and the Central American country.
MOFA also addressed Reina’s remark that Taiwan has exported more shrimp from Ecuador, which recognizes China, than Honduras. The prices quoted by Honduran exporters were higher than the market price, and Taiwan has assisted Honduras in expanding its shrimp market, it said.










In response to Honduras’ plan to export its white shrimp to China, the ministry reminded the country that it would face greater competitive pressure under the international market mechanism.
MOFA emphasized that since President Xiomara Castro took office in January 2022, Taiwan has actively continued to discuss bilateral cooperation with Honduras based on the priorities of the Honduran government. The ministry also said it has expressed to Honduras several times that Taiwan is willing to assist in construction and development projects within its capability.
Additionally, MOFA said it has repeatedly reminded Honduras to be wary of China's false promises. “Our communication efforts with Honduras have never stopped,” it said.
Taiwan is still trying its best to maintain its friendship with Honduras but it will never compete with China for money, the ministry added.
Reina told El Mundo that he is still waiting for a response from Chinese Ambassador to Costa Rica Tang Heng (湯恆) before commencing talks to open diplomatic ties with China.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday (March 21) refuted Honduras Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina’s claim that his country had already notified Taiwan about officially terminating diplomatic relations.Reina gave an interview to the Honduran newspaper El Mundo on March 17, commenting on Tegucigalpa’s potential switch of recognition from Taipei to Beijing.Honduras has not submitted any official documents to Taiwan, MOFA said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842248,Gold market shows screaming buy signals at the start of 2023,"Increased demand for jewellery in mainland China and Malaysia will cause gold to soar above $2,000 in 2023.
KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 21 March 2023 - 2022 was a tough year for gold, but in the last three months of 2022 the situation changed radically: net short position in gold was on the low side; banks began to buy gold into foreign exchange reserves; the U.S. economy began to signal a slowdown in inflation, which in turn contributed to a softening of the Fed's rhetoric. As a result, gold gained bullish momentum and added 13% by the end of the year.            For now, the gold market looks like a picture of a perfect storm in front of us—with a strong bullish rally and a moderate bearish correction. But to be more confident, gold investors need to dive into the specifics and study the fundamentals, such as supply and demand dynamics, significant political and economic factors.   The OctaFX experts examined supply and demand data, as well as the weight of other factors that have an impact on the gold price.   Central bank purchases are the main driver   At the end of 2022, demand for gold jumped 18% to 4,741 tonnes. The key driver of this growth was enormous purchases by central banks. In 2022, central bank demand was 1,136 tonnes (152% y/y), which is a record (see pic).             Pic. Net central bank demand in tonnes.   The reason for the increased demand on the part of the central banks is in the geopolitics and significantly correlates with the events in Eastern Europe. During the conflict, information about the freezing of U.S. Treasuries purchased by Russia appeared in the information field. This fact is a precedent showing that the traditional system of foreign exchange reserves does not work. It is therefore quite logical that the central banks of the world have revised the risks: they reduced the share of U.S. Treasuries and dollar cash in favour of physical gold.   Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at OctaFX, believes that 'due to continued geopolitical tensions and a virtually non-operational foreign exchange reserve system, central bank purchases will remain high throughout 2023 at 1,000–1,200 tonnes'.   Investment demand—potential driver to boost the gold price higher   Growth in demand from the central banks is confirmed by increased investment demand, which rose to 1,107 tonnes in 2022 (+10% YoY) mainly due to higher interest in physical gold. At the same time, withdrawals from gold funds continued in 2022, but were more moderate relative to 2021.            Pic. Gold ETF yearly flows (in tonnes).   There has been no clear participation of global gold ETFs over the past two years. But now the situation is changing. Comparing monthly flows between US and Europe ETFs, it appears that the outflow of gold from European ETFs masked the incipient positive flows into US ETFs. Futures dynamics have a statistically significant impact on ETF flows with a time lag of two months. Based on this statement, the 13% gold value increase in December 2022—January 2023 is not yet embedded in the current flows and will have a positive impact on investment demand over the next 1–3 months.   'Considering the positive dynamics of the gold price, the growing demand from North American ETFs (50% of world holdings) and the absence of an inflation shock as well as softer monetary policy, total ETF demand will stop being negative and approach its median value for the last 12 years, reaching 124 tonnes by the end of 2023 (vs -110 tonnes in 2022),' the OctaFX expert Gero Azrul commented.   Jewellery consumption in China has a significant impact   Jewellery consumption, the largest component of demand, dropped 3% to 2,086 tonnes in 2022. The decline was due to a lack of appetite mainly from the jewellery markets of China and zero-COVID policy—demand in China dropped 15% to 598 tonnes (vs. 699 tonnes in 2021). Chinese demand for gold jewellery accounts for one-third of global demand.             Pic. Jewellery demand in selected countries (2022).   Currently, a key blocker of industrial cycle recovery problems related to COVID lockdowns has disappeared—in early 2023, the Chinese government announced the abolition of zero-COVID policy.   The additional factor in favour of APAC demand growth is the growing demand in local markets. Thus, jewellery demand in Malaysia grew by 24%, in Singapore by 30%, and in Vietnam by 51%. In fact, business cycles in the APAC are moving into an early cycle in which gold mining companies (materials sector) are growing moderately over a 1–2 year interval.   In this regard, Kar Yong Ang expects the economic recovery of mainland China and PRC in particular to boost demand in 2023 by 17% year-on-year (up to 700 tonnes).   Gold supply is stable over years   Overall, gold supply shows a fairly stable picture. Even supply-chains and geopolitical disruptions of 2020–2022 had no statistically significant impact. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 13 years is 2.1%. The gold supply increased by 2% in 2022 to 4,755 tonnes, coming very close to the 2018 peak.   Opportunity cost and uncertainty are the key tailwinds for gold in 2023   Apart from the information above, investors need to consider four groups of additional fundamental factors: economic expansion; risk and uncertainty; opportunity cost; momentum / impulse.   From a macro perspective, a good portion of last performance can be attributed to the opportunity cost (weaker US dollar, followed by a drop in the US 10-year Treasury yield).   Conclusion:          According to the OctaFX expert calculations, total physical gold demand in 2023      will increase by 6.3% to over 5,000 tonnes (vs. 4,740 tonnes in 2022).         Gold price has an upside trend due to the      opportunity cost factor—amid the continued weakening of the dollar and a moderate decline in the US 10-year Treasury yield.         Extremely strong support for gold quotes in 2023 will be due to the      risk and uncertainty factor, which will manifest itself in increased demand for physical gold from central banks.         All these drivers allows forecasting the gold price over $2,000/oz by the end of 2023, which corresponds to a potential increase of      +8.3% at the time of writing.     Hashtag: #OctaFX

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842249,TERRAOIL SWISS AG: Terraoil Announces New Corporate Structure,"Shareholders Will Be Invited to Participate in Restructuring of Terraoil 
STEINHAUSEN, SWITZERLAND - EQS Newswire - 21 March 2023 - Terraoil Swiss AG (""Terraoil"" or ""Company""), an energy company with a strong focus on the Mediterranean is pleased to announce that the Company has completed the initial steps for the restructuring of the Company. The restructuring will provide all shareholders the opportunity to hold a pro-rata share of the new parent company (""Topco"") which shares are intended to be listed on an international stock exchange. It is expected that Terraoil will ultimately become a 100% owned subsidiary of Topco.   The restructuring will give all registered shareholders the opportunity to exchange their existing shares of Terraoil for shares of Topco on a one for one basis. The transaction is expected to be effected by way of capital increases of Topco by contributions in kind. Topco has been incorporated in Liechtenstein based on the analysis of the Company which showed that for many international investors it is more attractive to invest into a Liechtenstein rather than a Swiss company. All registered shareholders will receive further written communication directly from the Company with instructions on how to exchange their shares for Topco shares.   Topco has engaged a top tier investment bank as its financial advisor with respect to a pre-initial public offering financing. It is envisaged that this investment bank will also support Topco in a potential international stock listing. Shareholders will receive further information if and when available and appropriate.   Chief Executive Officer, Peter Krempin commented:   ""We have reached a major milestone in the development of the group. Our shareholders will now have the opportunity to participate in the restructuring of the Company. Our partnership with a renowned investment bank is expected to provide the expertise to raise the required financing to advance the group's projects and ultimately achieve the listing of our integrated energy company on an international stock exchange.""   If you are an    Terraoil shareholder and would like    additional information, contact    Peter Krempin either via email investors@terraoil.swiss or by telephone at +41 71 544 01 20.

Several other websites and media also reported the cancellation of the screenings.The movie's distributor in Hong Kong, VII Pillars Entertainment, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A ticket-booking link on its Facebook page brought up a message saying ticketing was temporarily unavailable.Chinese censors have in the past targeted the film’s main character, originally conceptualised by English author A.A. Milne, due to memes that compare the bumbling bear to President Xi Jinping.The comparisons began in 2013 when Xi visited the United States and met his then counterpart Barack Obama and some online commentators seized on their likeness to Pooh and Tigger.Some people have used the image of Pooh to signal dissent.Hong Kong's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A new censorship law in the former British colony came into effect in 2021. Some films have been prevented from being shown in the Chinese special administrative region.The city's censorship law bars films that ""endorse, support, glorify, encourage and incite activities that might endanger national security"".Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 after the city was rocked by anti-government protests. The law sets out punishment for anything deemed subversion, secession, colluding with foreign forces and terrorism.Two films were dropped from Hong Kong's international film festival last year after failing to get approval from authorities.The cancellation comes as Hong Kong hosts the Art Basel contemporary art fair with authorities keen to promote the city as a vibrant cultural hub.",2023/03/21,319,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842268,IMF to assess Sri Lankan governance as part of $3B bailout,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it is assessing Sri Lanka’s governance in the first case of an Asian country facing scrutiny for corruption as part of a bailout program.The IMF executive board approved a nearly $3 billion bailout plan for the bankrupt nation Monday and about $333 million was to be disbursed immediately to alleviate the country's humanitarian crisis. The approval also will open up financial support from other institutions.Sri Lanka suspended repayment of its debt last year as it ran short of foreign currency needed to pay for imports of fuel and other essentials. Shortages led to street protests that forced out Sri Lanka’s president. The economic situation has improved under current President Ranil Wickremesinghe, but his plans to privatize state companies have raised objections.The senior mission chief for the IMF in Sri Lanka said the development lender would assess corruption and governance vulnerabilities in Sri Lanka and provide recommendations.“Sri Lanka will be the first country in Asia to undergo a governance diagnostic exercise by the IMF. We look forward to further engagement and collaboration with stakeholders and civil society organizations on this critical reform area,” Peter Breuer told reporters.Sri Lankans took to the streets since last year demanding accountability for alleged corruption and demanding recovery of assets allegedly stolen by members of a former ruling family. Graft has been a main factor behind the country's economic meltdown, critics of the government say.Sri Lanka’s “institutions and governance frameworks require deep reforms,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a statement.The IMF's approval means Sri Lanka will no longer be considered a bankrupt nation and the country can resume its normal dealings, Wickremesinghe said in a brief recorded statement on Tuesday. It also will unlock financing of up to $7 billion from it and other international financial institutions.“As our foreign currency improves, we will gradually lift import restrictions. In the first cycle we will bring in essential goods, medicines and goods needed for the tourism industry,” Wickremesinghe said, adding that he expects to present the agreement with the IMF to Parliament after making a detailed statement Wednesday.Earlier this month, the last hurdle for the approval was cleared when China joined Sri Lanka's other creditors in providing assurances for debt restructuring.Sri Lanka has raised income taxes and removed electricity and fuel subsidies, fulfilling prerequisites of the IMF program but also burdening the public. Authorities must now discuss with Sri Lanka's creditors how to restructure its debt.The IMF mission chief, Breuer, said the “impact of the reforms on the poor and vulnerable needs to be mitigated.”“Tax reforms under the program are designed to be progressive, that is, ensuring greater contributions from high-income earners. Efforts to increase tax revenues should be pursued in a growth-friendly manner while protecting the poor and most vulnerable,” he said.Sri Lanka's foreign reserves ran short as tourism and export revenues dried up during the COVID-19 pandemic and it faced heavy debt payments for megaprojects funded by Chinese and other international lenders that did not generate enough income. It also used its currency reserves to try to stabilize the Sri Lankan rupee.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Beijing saw the agreement with the IMF as “good news.”“We are willing to continue to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka cope with the current difficulties, ease the debt burden and achieve sustainable development,"" said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin.But he also urged other creditors to join in restructuring Sri Lanka’s debt and sharing responsibility fairly.China owns about 10% of Sri Lanka’ s total foreign debt.Since Wickremesinghe took over from ousted ex-President Gotobaya Rajapaksa shortages have eased and hours-long daily power cuts have ended. The central bank says its reserves have improved and the black market no longer controls the foreign currency trade.However, trade unions oppose Wickremesinghe's plans to privatize state companies as part of his reform agenda and public resentment may flare if he fails to take action against the Rajapaksa family, who people believe were responsible for the economic crisis.Wickremesinghe's critics accuse him of shielding the Rajapaksas, who still control a majority of lawmakers in Parliament, in return for their support for his presidency.__Associated Press writer Joe McDonald contributed to this report from Beijing.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842269,Women's Sweet 16 features new format and historic field,"The Sweet 16 features a new format and a bit of history when it begins later this week.The NCAA changed its setup for the women's tournament this season, trimming the traditional four regional sites to two. Seattle and Greenville — a city of 71,000 in South Carolina about halfway between Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina — will each host eight teams before sending the winners on to Dallas for the Final Four.It is also just the second time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1994 that two of the No. 1 seeds didn't reach the regional semifinals after Mississippi and Miami knocked out Stanford and Indiana, respectively. It also happened in 1998.The other top seeds — South Carolina and Virginia Tech — advanced. The Gamecocks, led by star Aliyah Boston, are four wins from completing their own historic journey and back-to-back national championships. They are seeking just the 10th undefeated season ever in women's basketball, and the next steps for coach Dawn Staley's team are just a 90-minute trip from campus.There are a lot of teams that have ended long Sweet 16 droughts, like the Hokies, Hurricanes, Colorado and Villanova. UConn, on the other hand, will be playing in its 29th consecutive regional semifinal.Despite the parity that took place during the regular season and the exit of those two No. 1 seeds, it is the second time in the past six years that no double-digit seed reached the round of 16. It's also the first time since the Big 12 was formed in 1996 that no teams from the conference reached the second weekend.There’s plenty of star power across the field with Angel Reese, Maddy Siegrist, Caitlin Clark and Elizabeth Kitley joining Boston in the regional semifinals.GREENVILLE 1The Gamecocks are the heavy favorite to come out of this region and, for that matter, to win another title. The regional semifinal opponent is No. 4 seed UCLA. The Bruins gave the Gamecocks a competitive game back in November, leading at halftime by four before losing by nine.No. 2 seed Maryland will play No. 3 seed Notre Dame in the other semifinal. The Terrapins, led by Diamond Miller, used a strong second half to get by Arizona in the second round. The Fighting Irish overcame season-ending injuries to Olivia Miles and Dara Mabrey to get to the Sweet 16. Notre Dame got a strong effort from post Lauren Ebo, who set a school NCAA tourney record with 18 rebounds in a win over Mississippi State.GREENVILLE 2With Indiana losing, the bracket is more open, with Villanova and Siegrist playing the Hurricanes in one of the semifinals. Siegrist, who leads the nation in scoring, has the Wildcats back in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2003. Miami's drought was even longer, not making it this far since 1992.The other semifinal in the region pits two of the most talented forwards in the country against each other: LSU's Angel Reese and Utah's Alissa Pili. Reese helped the Tigers reach the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014. The “Bayou Barbie” had 25 points, an eye-popping 24 rebounds and six blocks in the third-seeded Tigers' rout of Michigan. Second-seeded Utah is back in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2006 after edging Princeton in the second round.SEATTLE 3Second-seeded UConn, which has dealt with injuries all season, will face third-seeded Ohio State in one semifinal. The Buckeyes needed a shot in the final few seconds by Jacy Sheldon to advance this far for the fourth straight season.Top seed Virginia Tech is the newcomer here, making its first appearance in the Sweet 16 since 1999 after two impressive home wins in the first two rounds. Kitley and Co. head across the country for a rematch against Tennessee. The two teams played Dec. 4 and the Hokies came away with a three-point win. The Lady Vols were missing Rickea Jackson for that game and it was the final one that Tamari Key played in before being sidelined for the season with blood clots.Tennessee has run through the first two rounds, becoming just the fourth team to win each of its first two games by 45 points or more. UConn did it the other three times, according to ESPN.SEATTLE 4Ole Miss crashed the party with its upset of Stanford and is back in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2007. Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin's defensive-minded squad will face a Louisville team that routed Texas on the Longhorns' home court. Cardinals star Hailey Van Lith grew up in Central Washington, a few hours from Seattle.The other matchup will feature Clark and her logo-range shooting for Iowa against Colorado. Iowa edged Georgia in the second round, erasing the memory of last season's round of 32 defeat to Creighton. The Hawkeyes will face a Colorado team in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2003.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World

USA is 5-1 with a plus-24 run differential in this tournament -- though Japan is 6-0 with a plus-37.""We're in spring-training mode, but we're also playing for our country,"" USA pitcher Adam Wainwright said. ""We're not playing for money. We're playing because we love this game, and we love this country.""I'm proud to be out here.""Wainwright, who won a World Series title in 2006, said he has been impressed with the WBC crowds.""That is the wildest environment I've ever pitched in,"" Wainwright said after USA beat Cuba 14-2 in a semifinal game on Sunday. ""Fans were going crazy.""It's been like that every round. It seems like every fan is on their feet cheering. You can barely hear yourself talk in the dugout. You can barely hear yourself think on the mound. You have to really focus.""Team USA's batting order is clearly focused, especially shortstop Trea Turner, who has hit three homers in the past two games, driving in eight runs.Turner's two homers on Sunday made him just the second American to hit multiple dingers in a WBC game. Ken Griffey Jr. first accomplished the feat in 2006. Griffey is USA's current hitting coach.""I just want to win,"" said Turner, who is the first WBC player ever to have four-plus RBI in consecutive games. ""That stuff (records) is for my family. I know they're proud of me. I just like playing baseball and coming out on top.""There is one concern for USA, however. The Americans could be without star third baseman Nolan Arenado, who was hit by a pitch on Sunday. X-rays on his right hand were negative.As for Tuesday's pitching matchup, while neither starter has been officially names, the United States has Merrill Kelly lined up to start, while Japan would likely go with Yu Darvish or lefty Shota Imanaga. Kelly and Darvish are both righties.Kelly, 34, has never pitched a major league postseason game. His career numbers are 36-35 with a 3.96 ERA.Darvish, 36, is 95-75 with a 3.50 ERA. He does have plenty of playoff experience in the majors, playing in 11 games (all starts). Last season he was 2-1 with a 2.88 ERA in four playoff games.Imanaga, 29, has pitched in Japan's top league for seven seasons, posting a 57-46 record with a 3.24 ERA in 143 career games (24 starts).Japan advanced in the other semifinal by beating Mexico 6-5 on Monday as Munetaka Murakami slugged two-run, walk-off double in the ninth inning of a wild game that saw Japan score six runs in the final three innings and come from behind twice.Mexico led 5-4 entering the ninth before Japan rallied, starting with a leadoff double by Angels two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani.On Tuesday, Ohtani could be an option out of the bullpen.""I will be prepared to pitch,"" Ohtani said after Monday's game. ""But, before that, I will make sure I put some runs on the board.""Japan has probably the deepest pitching staff in the WBC, including Ryoji Kuribayashi, who has 68 saves in two seasons in Japan's top professional league, the Nippon League. Japan also has Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who has a 1.95 career ERA over 733 in the Nippon League.USA on Tuesday will face a tradition-rich baseball program. Japan, the only team to win consecutive World Baseball Classic titles -- prevailing in 2006 and 2009 -- has made it to at least the semifinals in every WBC.--Walter Villa, Field Level Media",2023/03/21,273,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842291,Asia shares bounce gingerly as bank fears linger,"SINGAPORE, March 21 (Reuters) - Asian stocks scraped off lows on Tuesday, with the rescue of Credit Suisse stemming selling in bank shares, though the mood was fragile and the stress in the financial system had traders unsure how Federal Reserve policymakers will respond this week.
The Fed begins a two-day meeting later in the day and after a wild few sessions U.S. interest rate futures pricing implies that a peak in rates is either imminent or already reached, with newfound stability concerns to push inflation-fighting aside.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.4%. Australian shares (.AXJO) rose 0.9% to leave behind a four-month trough, while in Hong Kong HSBC and Standard Chartered stocks each rose more than 1.5% to steady themselves after a clobbering on Monday.
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday, which left Treasuries untraded in Asia and lightened currency trade. S&P 500 futures were flat and European futures rose 0.5%.
The tense calm follows a Swiss government-backed buyout of Credit Suisse by UBS that seems, for now, to have cauterised concerns over European financial stability.
But the wipeout of some Credit Suisse bondholders has already sent a shockwave through bank debt, while the speed with which trouble spread from regional U.S. banks to humble a big systemic bank in Europe has markets rattled.
""While the last global financial crisis played out over 18 months, today's crisis is only 10 days old and has already led to the collapse of some U.S. regional banks and the arranged marriage of UBS and Credit Suisse at 0.06x book (value),"" said bank analyst Jonathan Mott at Barrenjoey in Sydney.
""While global regulators are acting with pace, this appears to be a game of 'whack-a-mole.'""
San Francisco lender First Republic (FRC.N) is emerging as the next pressure point. Its share price halved on Monday on worries that $30 billion in deposits placed last week by bigger banks would not be enough to shore up its stability.
U.S officials are looking at ways to temporarily expand Federal Deposit Insurance Corp coverage to all deposits, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.
ADDITIONAL TEARS
The dust is also yet to settle on the writedown of Credit Suisse's ""additional tier 1"" debt to zero.
It set off frantic selling of similar debt because holders were surprised that the long-standing practice of paying creditors before shareholders was not fully followed.
That somewhat abated after regulators in Europe and Britain stepped in to reassure investors that it would not set a precedent, and prices stabilised in Asia on Tuesday.
""Over the last 24 hours as more details have come out, some people are realising that maybe the initial reaction was not the right one,"" said Thomas Jacquot, head of research at fixed income broker FIIG in Sydney. ""You can't take this as a precedent - it's an exception. It's (only) a precedent in Switzerland.""
The broader path for rates, meanwhile, is set to become clearer later in the week when the Fed and Bank of England set policy levels.
Fed funds futures imply about a 1-in-4 chance the Fed pauses on Wednesday, according to CME's FedWatch tool, while markets are divided evenly on the prospect of a hike in Britain.
""The banking sector's near-death experience over the last two weeks is likely to make Fed officials more measured in their stance on the pace of hikes,"" said Standard Chartered's head of G10 FX research, Steve Englander.
In foreign exchange the U.S. dollar steadied after slipping overnight. It last bought 131.30 yen and held at $1.0711 per euro.
In commodity markets, demand jitters have Brent crude futures pinned below $80 a barrel; they were last at $73.15.

S&P 500 futures were flat and European futures rose 0.5%.The tense calm follows a Swiss government-backed buyout of Credit Suisse by UBS that seems, for now, to have cauterised concerns over European financial stability.But the wipeout of some Credit Suisse bondholders has already sent a shockwave through bank debt, while the speed with which trouble spread from regional U.S. banks to humble a big systemic bank in Europe has markets rattled.""While the last global financial crisis played out over 18 months, today's crisis is only 10 days old and has already led to the collapse of some U.S. regional banks and the arranged marriage of UBS and Credit Suisse at 0.06x book (value),"" said bank analyst Jonathan Mott at Barrenjoey in Sydney.""While global regulators are acting with pace, this appears to be a game of 'whack-a-mole.'""San Francisco lender First Republic (FRC.N) is emerging as the next pressure point. Its share price halved on Monday on worries that $30 billion in deposits placed last week by bigger banks would not be enough to shore up its stability.U.S officials are looking at ways to temporarily expand Federal Deposit Insurance Corp coverage to all deposits, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.The dust is also yet to settle on the writedown of Credit Suisse's ""additional tier 1"" debt to zero.It set off frantic selling of similar debt because holders were surprised that the long-standing practice of paying creditors before shareholders was not fully followed.That somewhat abated after regulators in Europe and Britain stepped in to reassure investors that it would not set a precedent, and prices stabilised in Asia on Tuesday.""Over the last 24 hours as more details have come out, some people are realising that maybe the initial reaction was not the right one,"" said Thomas Jacquot, head of research at fixed income broker FIIG in Sydney. ""You can't take this as a precedent - it's an exception. It's (only) a precedent in Switzerland.""The broader path for rates, meanwhile, is set to become clearer later in the week when the Fed and Bank of England set policy levels.Fed funds futures imply about a 1-in-4 chance the Fed pauses on Wednesday, according to CME's FedWatch tool, while markets are divided evenly on the prospect of a hike in Britain.""The banking sector's near-death experience over the last two weeks is likely to make Fed officials more measured in their stance on the pace of hikes,"" said Standard Chartered's head of G10 FX research, Steve Englander.In foreign exchange the U.S. dollar steadied after slipping overnight. It last bought 131.30 yen and held at $1.0711 per euro.In commodity markets, demand jitters have Brent crude futures pinned below $80 a barrel; they were last at $73.15. Gold hit a one-year high of $2,009 an ounce on Monday, before easing to $1,980 on Tuesday.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842308,US stands with Taiwan: Former US national security adviser,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The United States will stand with Taiwan, Trump Administration National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien told President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) on Tuesday (March 21).Tsai decorated the former U.S. government official with the Order of Brilliant Star with Special Grand Cordon at the Presidential Office for his efforts to deepen bilateral relations, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported.O’Brien described the relationship as strong and long-lasting, having started at the end of the Second World War. U.S. national security circles valued relations with Taiwan while doing their utmost to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, he said.According to O’Brien, he could guarantee that the U.S. would stand by Taiwan. He emphasized that both former President Donald Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden had stated many times that Washington would help defend Taiwan.O’Brien also described the Asian country as a model of democracy, rule of law, and freedom, though authoritarian states did not like such countries. The U.S. would be extremely unhappy if an authoritarian regime attacked Taiwan, and he prayed it would not happen, according to the RTI report.In the run-up to his Taiwan trip, O’Brien became the center of a controversy, when a website misinterpreted comments of his as saying the U.S. military would destroy Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) fabs rather than let them fall into Chinese hands in the case of an invasion.",2023/03/21,1988,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842381,African nations consider swapping debt for climate funding,"MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — African countries saddled with debt and ravaged by losses and damages from weather events like cyclones, drought and extreme temperatures have agreed to consider swapping debt to invest in climate action in a meeting of finance ministers in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.The “debt-for-climate swap” option is an economic tool that allows a country’s debt to be reduced in exchange for commitments on green investments. It was among several alternative green financing models discussed at the ongoing United Nations conference for finance and economic ministers that supporters say would boost funds to adapt to climate harms, protect nature and finance local communities.It comes as many African nations are battling with the effects of costly climate change-fueled events like the ongoing drought in eastern Africa that has killed thousands and decimated livelihoods reliant on rain-fed agriculture and the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Freddy in the south that's left hundreds dead and thousands of others displaced.Egyptian finance minister Mohamed Maait said that his country is one of many that is now having to add heavy climate costs to budgets stretched thin by external debt — which takes up to 17% of countries' spending in some cases — and other basic needs.“What am asking every day and every hour is where do I get the money to protect our people from climate extremes,” Maait said, adding that borrowing was often the only option for some nations.Yet “many countries simply cannot access international financial markets because of rising interest rates,” Hanan Morsy, the chief economist of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa told the roundtable Monday evening. Morsy added that private sector investments in climate finance are lower in Africa than in any other part of the world.Ministers also discussed bonds that would help increase private financial flows as well as “blended finance” models that would combine development funds and private capital as potential solutions for climate funding.Interest in green finance has been growing, along with criticism that current mechanisms don't work for countries ravaged by climate extremes but have contributed little to the planet-warming emissions in the atmosphere.In 2022 the International Monetary Fund established a $50 billion climate loan pot to help low and middle-income nations access affordable and longer-term financing to respond to shocks associated with climate change. Rwanda became the first African nation to receive a loan of $319 million.But another $50 billion pot pledged by the World Bank is only sending around 5% of its funds to the ten most climate vulnerable countries, according to a recent study by the Center for Global Development. Four of the ten nations identified — Mali, Niger, Sudan and Liberia — were in Africa.The ministers' roundtable coincided with the Green Climate Fund board meeting, a group within the U.N. climate agency that financially supports nations to adapt to or curb climate change. On Monday the fund approved $580 million in new climate finance for developing nations.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842382,Israel repeals 2005 act on West Bank settlement pullout,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli lawmakers on Tuesday repealed a 2005 act that saw four Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank dismantled at the same time as Israeli forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip. The development could pave the way for an official return to the abandoned West Bank areas in another setback to Palestinian hopes for statehood.It was the latest move by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government, which is dominated by settler leaders and allies, to promote settlement expansion in the territory, inflaming tensions with the Palestinians and the international community.The move drew a sharp rebuke from Israel's closest ally, the United States. Most of the international community considers settlements illegal and opposes construction on occupied territories claimed by the Palestinians for a future independent state. The State Department said it was “extremely troubled” and urged Israel to refrain from allowing settlers to return to the outposts.“Coming at a time of heightened tensions, the legislative changes announced today are provocative and counterproductive to efforts to restore some measures of calm,” said State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel.Angry condemnation also poured in on Tuesday from the U.S. and several other countries over the of latest in a string of incendiary comments about the Palestinians by Israel’s ultranationalist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich. Earlier this week, Smotrich claimed there is “no such thing” as Palestinians, sparking widespread outrage.Israel evacuated the four settlements and unilaterally pulled out of Gaza under the 2005 legislation. The prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, argued that Israel would not be able to keep the settlements under a future agreement with the Palestinians.Since then, Israeli citizens have been officially banned from returning to those locations, though the Israeli military has allowed activists to visit and pray there — a ban that has now been revoked.Netanyahu’s government has put settlement expansion at the top of its agenda and has already advanced thousands of new settlement housing units and retroactively authorized nine wildcat outposts in the West Bank.This week, Israel pledged to put a temporary freeze on further settlement approvals, including authorization of outposts, as part of a series of measures meant to ease tensions ahead of the sensitive period that includes the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish festival of Passover.Still, ultranationalist members of Netanyahu’s coalition pushed for a repeal of the ban on the northern West Bank settlements. The legislation passed in an overnight vote 31-18 in the 120-seat Knesset. The remaining lawmakers did not vote.Itamar Ben-Gvir, an ultranationalist West Bank settler now serving as minister in charge of police, said Tuesday that the repeal of the ban corrects “a historic injustice” and pledged to continue boosting settlements.The Palestinians seek the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an independent state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Mideast war. Since then, more than 700,000 Israelis have moved into dozens of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem — which most of the world considers an obstacle to peace.The vote came as Netanyahu’s government is pushing ahead with a separate plan to overhaul the country’s judicial system that has roiled Israeli politics. Netanyahu’s allies claim the courts have too much power in the legislative process and that the Supreme Court is biased against settlers. Critics say the overhaul would upend the country’s delicate system of checks and balances and push Israel toward authoritarianism. They also say Netanyahu could find an escape route from his corruption trial through the overhaul.The political crisis has divided the country and extended to the military, Israel's most trusted institution, where many reservists have pledged not to show up for duty under what they see as impending regime change. On Tuesday, protest leaders escalated their calls for troops to refuse to serve in the military reserve on which Israel’s army relies.“It’s a very hard day for us today, and our voices are shaking because we want to take our battle against the government one step forward,” said Lt. Col. Ron Sharf, a volunteer reservist. “Our government wants unlimited power.”The threat of losing military personnel, particularly as tensions surge in the occupied West Bank, has sparked concern and condemnation. Netanyahu on Tuesday visited a military recruitment center in central Israel and appeared to warn new conscripts against joining the protests.“We have no country without soldiers who are willing, recruited for service,"" he said.As the government faces mass protests over the judicial overhaul, documents leaked Tuesday show top finance ministry officials expressing concern that efforts to curb the Supreme Court’s independence could damage Israel's economy, making the country less attractive to foreign investors and driving down its credit ratings.Smotrich responded defiantly to the reports, seeking to assure the public that the judicial overhaul would not endanger the country's prosperity.“I am convinced that the reform will offer great opportunities for the Israeli economy,” he said. “Citizens, be calm, you are in good and professional hands.”Tuesday's repeal comes against the backdrop of the worst Israeli-Palestinian fighting in recent years and as concerns grow of intensified violence during Ramadan, which will begin on Thursday.Israeli forces have carried out almost nightly arrest raids across the occupied West Bank over the past year. The incursions began after a string of deadly attacks in Israel last spring and have provoked a fierce response from Palestinians.So far this year, 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, and Palestinian attackers have killed 15 Israelis, according to a tally by The Associated Press.Israel says most of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and people not involved in the confrontations have also been killed. All but one of the Israelis killed were civilians.On Tuesday, the U.S., France, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined mounting criticism of Smotrich’s remarks earlier this week denying the existence of the Palestinian people.“There is no such thing as a Palestinian nation. There is no Palestinian history. There is no Palestinian language,” Smotrich said in a speech in Paris. French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne-Claire Legendre lambasted his remarks as “infuriating and irresponsible.”The State Department described his comments as “deeply concerning and dangerous.”“The U.S. remains committed to two states for two people, both of whom had deep ancient roots in the land,” Patel said.Saudi Arabia denounced what it called Smotrich’s “offensive and racist statements,” which it said ""contribute to spreading hate speech and violence and undermine efforts for dialogue and international peace.”The kingdom does not have formal diplomatic ties with Israel.The UAE, which established full diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 as part of the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, stressed ""the need to confront hate speech and violence.”___Associated Press writers Isabel DeBre and Isaac Scharf in Jerusalem, Matt Lee in Washington and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842383,"Biden creates national monuments in Nevada, Texas mountains","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden said Tuesday he is establishing national monuments on more than half a million acres in Nevada and Texas and creating a marine sanctuary in U.S. waters near the Pacific Remote Islands southwest of Hawaii. The conservation measures are “protecting the heart and soul of our national pride,'' Biden said.Speaking at a White House summit on conservation action, Biden said the new monuments are among the “natural treasures” that ""define our identity as a nation. They’re a birthright we have to pass down to generation after generation.''Biden designated Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in southern Nevada that Native Americans consider sacred, as a national monument, along with the Castner Range in El Paso, Texas. He also moved to create a national marine sanctuary in U.S. waters around the Pacific Remote Islands.Conservation and tribal groups praised Biden's actions, but Nevada's new Republican governor slammed the monument designation as “federal confiscation” of Nevada land and “a historic mistake that will cost Nevadans for generations to come.”Gov. Joe Lombardo, who unseated the state’s Democratic governor in November, said the White House did not consult with his administration before moving to block clean-energy projects and other development in his state. “This kind of ‘Washington Knows Best’ policy might win plaudits from unaccountable special interests, but it’s going to cost our state jobs and economic opportunity,” Lombardo said in a statement.“Our national wonders are literally the envy of the world,″ Biden said in a speech at the Interior Department. “They’ve always been and always will be central to our heritage as a people and essential to our identity as a nation.″The Nevada site spans more than 500,000 acres (200,000 hectares) and includes Spirit Mountain, a peak northwest of Laughlin called Avi Kwa Ame (ah-VEE’ kwa-meh) by the Fort Mojave Tribe and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The rugged landscape near the Arizona and California state lines is home to bighorn sheep, desert tortoises and a large concentration of Joshua trees, some of which are more than 900 years old.In Texas, the Castner Range designation will protect cultural, scientific and historic objects, honor U.S. veterans and tribal nations, and expand access to outdoor recreation on public lands, Biden said. Located on Fort Bliss, Castner Range served as a training and testing site for the U.S. Army during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Army ceased training at the site and closed Castner Range in 1966.Together, the two new national monuments protect nearly 514,000 acres (208,000 hectares) of public lands. The Avi Kwa Ame landscape is sacred to 12 tribes and is home to rare wildlife and plants, while Castner Range is the ancestral homeland of the Comanche and Apache people, and its cultural ecology is considered sacred to several Indigenous communities.“To the native people who point to Avi Kwa Ame as their spiritual birthplace, and every Nevadan who knows the value of our cherished public lands: Today is for you,″ tweeted Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, who sponsored a bill to protect the rugged region near the Mojave National Preserve from development, including solar farms and a proposed wind farm.“Spirit Mountain will now be protected for future generations,″ Titus said.Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Avi Kwa Ame “holds deep spiritual, sacred and historic significance to the Native people who have lived on these lands for generations,″ adding that she was grateful to Biden “for taking this important step in recognition of the decades of advocacy from tribes and the scientific community.''In the Pacific, Biden directed the Commerce Department to initiate a marine sanctuary designation to protect 777,000 square miles around the Pacific Remote Islands. If completed, the new sanctuary would help ensure the U.S. reaches Biden's goal to conserve at least 30% of ocean waters under U.S. jurisdiction by 2030, the White House said.The area to be protected is ""larger than Alaska and Colorado put together,'' Biden said.Biden's actions come as he faces sharp criticism from environmental groups and youth activists over his approval of the huge Willow oil drilling project in Alaska.Biden has made fighting global warming a central part of his agenda and has pledged to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. But the decision on Willow has alienated supporters, particularly young activists skeptical about political compromise at the same time Biden is planning to announce his reelection campaign.Climate activists gathered outside the Interior Department on Tuesday to condemn what they call Biden’s “climate hypocrisy"" and demand the administration change course on Willow. Protesters hung a large yellow banner that said, “Stop the Willow oil project” and chanted “no more drilling, no more drilling, no more drilling on federal land.”In Texas, the Castner Range monument “will preserve fragile lands already surrounded on three sides by development,'' help ensure access to clean water and protect rare and endangered species, said Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar.Fort Mojave Tribe Chairman Timothy Williams, who attended the conservation summit, said tribes throughout the Southwest consider Avi Kwa Ame to be sacred land. Biden's creation of a new monument demonstrated his ""commitment to respect tribal nations and our nation-to-nation relationship.''Under the leadership of Biden and Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet member, “We have a seat at the table and we have seen an unprecedented era and opportunity for our tribal communities,'' Williams said.The Honor Avi Kwa Ame coalition, which includes tribes, local residents, state lawmakers and conservation groups, said its members were “overjoyed” at the new monument.Biden designated his first national monument, in Colorado, last year. In 2021, he restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah after they were significantly narrowed by President Donald Trump, a Republican.Biden announced other steps Tuesday to conserve, restore and expand access to public lands and waters, promote tribal conservation and reduce wildfire risk. The proposals seek to modernize management of America’s public lands, better harness the ocean to help fight climate change and better conserve wildlife corridors, the White House said.___Associated Press writers Darlene Superville in Washington and Ken Ritter and Rio Yamat in Las Vegas contributed to this story.",2023/03/22,,World

""But for me, their growth, a young man like James Wiseman, a young man like Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren, those guys’ growth is our record. We don’t talk about wins, we talk about having small victories, whether it’s rebounding, transition defense, those little things that probably the everyday fan wouldn’t pay attention to. But for us, that’s growth, because for us, the pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow.”Pistons fans can be forgiven for thinking they were a bit closer to the end of that rainbow before this season. They'd added Ivey and Duren, two of the top 13 picks in last year's draft, and Cunningham was coming off a strong rookie season. Detroit had also acquired Bojan Bogdanovic from Utah in a trade.Casey said at the time the Pistons were young, but the most talented they'd been since he took over in 2018.But Cunningham didn't play after Nov. 9 and eventually had season-ending surgery on his shin. The Pistons acquired Wiseman, the second overall pick in 2020, from Golden State. He had 22 points and 13 rebounds against Miami on Sunday, but that was yet another defeat.The Hornets (23-50) also feel strongly about their future, but this season has been nothing short of a disaster for coach Steve Clifford in his return to Charlotte.Ball, taken one pick after Wiseman in 2020, was an All-Star last season but has been limited to 36 games in 2022-23 due to three left ankle sprains and a fracture in his right ankle. Ball is currently in a walking boot and on crutches and is done for the season.He said Monday he expects to be ready for training camp in September.Charlotte went 43-39 last season. But even before their injury problems, the Hornets' 2022-23 campaign seemed doomed. Restricted free agent Miles Bridges, the team’s leading scorer last season, was arrested on domestic abuse charges and never re-signed. He pleaded no contest.Clifford does feel good about the young talent on the roster, including the development of rookie Mark Williams and Nick Richards, the team’s two young 7-foot centers. He’s also high on forward JT Thor and guard Bryce McGowens.“I think Nick Richards has emerged and he can be in the rotation for a good team, and Mark Williams is every bit the defender, or maybe even more, that people thought he could be, and much better offensively,” Clifford said.Unlike the Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs, the two teams bringing up the rear in the West, the Pistons and Hornets haven't had success in the particularly recent past. Detroit hasn't won a playoff game since 2008. Charlotte made the play-in round last year, but that was the Hornets' lone winning season of the past seven.The injuries to Cunningham and Ball have made this season another dreary one for the Pistons and Hornets, but the presence of those two players mean improvement could certainly come quickly if they're back to full health. And now Detroit and Charlotte can look forward to more high draft picks.“It's a rebuilding year,” Casey said. “But in the future, these last two years is really going to pay off for the franchise and for these players.""___AP Sports Writer Steve Reed contributed to this report.___Follow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842387,"UN: Months after Pakistan floods, millions lack safe water","ISLAMABAD (AP) — The United Nations children’s agency on Tuesday warned that after last summer's devastating floods, 10 million people in Pakistan, including children, still live in flood-affected areas without access to safe drinking water.The statement from UNICEF underscored the dire situation in impoverished Pakistan, a country with a population of 220 million that months later is still struggling with the consequences of the flooding, as well as a spiraling economic crisis. The floods, which experts attribute in part to climate change, killed 1,739 people, including 647 children and 353 women.So far, less than half of UNICEF’s funding appeal for Pakistan — 45% of $173.5 million — has been met. According to the agency, before the floods struck last June, water from only 36% of Pakistan's water system was considered safe for human consumption.The floods damaged most of the water pipelines systems in affected areas, forcing more than 5.4 million people, including 2.5 million children, to rely solely on contaminated water from ponds and wells, UNICEF said.“Safe drinking water is not a privilege, it is a basic human right,” said Abdullah Fadil, the UNICEF representative in Pakistan. “Yet, every day, millions of girls and boys in Pakistan are fighting a losing battle against preventable waterborne diseases and the consequential malnutrition.""""We need the continued support of our donors to provide safe water, build toilets and deliver vital sanitation services to these children and families who need them the most,” Fadil added.Amid the crisis, Pakistan faces uncertainty about a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Analysts say the revival of the $6 billion IMF bailout, which was signed in 2019, would help Pakistan. If the global lender released a key installment of the package, it would encourage other international financial institutions to help the country, they say.At a U.N-backed conference in Geneva in January, dozens of countries and international institutions pledged more than $9 billion to help Pakistan recover and rebuild from the floods. But most of the pledges were in form of project loans, and the projects are still in the planning stages.Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif's government is also facing a surge in militant attacks and political instability as his predecessor, Imran Khan, is campaigning for early elections. Sharif has rejected the demands by Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April.Sharif seeks political and economic stability to ensure speedy reconstruction in the flood-hit areas, where the weakest and the children are paying the price.“In flood-affected areas, more than 1.5 million boys and girls are already severely malnourished, and the numbers will only rise in the absence of safe water and proper sanitation,” UNICEF said.The floods caused more than $30 billion in damages as large swaths of the country remained under water for months, forcing millions to live in tents or make-shift homes near stagnant waters that led to the spread of disease.Sharif's government is also trying to provide food and cash assistance to flood survivors as the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan starts this week, adding more financial burdens to the poorest of the population.The UNICEF warning came ahead of World Water Day, which will be observed on Wednesday as part of global efforts to highlight the importance of freshwater and advocate for sustainable management of the vital resource.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842388,"After injury, Creighton's Nembhard fueling March Madness run","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Ryan Nembhard was injured and watched from the bench during Creighton's two-game stay in last year's NCAA Tournament.The point guard is front and center for the sixth-seeded Bluejays this year, having just played the game of his life to lead them into the Sweet 16.“It’s a feeling you can’t describe,” Nembhard said of the turnabout.Nembhard scored a career-high 30 points in an 85-76 win over third-seeded Baylor on Sunday night. The victory sends Creighton to Louisville, Kentucky, to play No. 15 seed Princeton in a South Region semifinal Friday. Win that game, and the Bluejays would be in the Elite Eight for the first time.“I was obviously out last year and it was tough for me to watch, but I’m super excited to get back out with my guys this year,” he said. “Our goal this year was to get back to a game like this, and we’re super happy we could pull out the win.”Nembhard was the 2022 Big East freshman of the year but went out with two weeks left in the regular season when he broke his right wrist trying to steal a pass against St. John's.The Bluejays went 4-4 without Nembhard and earned a No. 9 NCAA seed after losing to Villanova in the Big East Tournament championship game. With Trey Alexander running the point in place of Nembhard, the Bluejays beat San Diego State in overtime before exiting with a 79-72 loss to eventual national champion Kansas.Nembhard, the brother of Indiana Pacers rookie Andrew Nembhard, came back fully healthy this season and has started all 35 games. The player nicknamed “R2” — to avoid confusion with Ryan Kalkbrenner — was third in the Big East in assist-turnover ratio (2.4-to-1) and free-throw shooting (87.8%).In a lineup with five double-digit scorers, he went into the NCAA Tournament as the team's fourth option behind Kalkbrenner, Alexander and Baylor Scheierman.“To have a point guard like R2, he gets our offense going,” Alexander said. “I feel like he’s at the heart of the flow of the offense, and I feel like him as a player kind of gets us going as a team. Anytime you look down the court, you see him just speeding past anybody or you see him finding the open guy or talking you through the offense. He's just a winner.”Nembhard turned into a scorer with Kalkbrenner and Scheierman combining for only four points in the second half. Nembhard had 19 of his 30 points after halftime. On four occasions, Baylor pulled within 10 points and Nembhard either hit 3-pointers or scored from the free-throw line to restore a double-digit lead. He made three 3-pointers in a row during a stretch in which he shot 5 of 6 overall.“Everybody knew that he was going to have a big night sooner or later,” Alexander said, “but at the end of the day, he just wants to win.”Nembhard moved to Florida to attend Montverde Academy for high school, and by his senior year he was rated the No. 62 national recruit by ESPN. Montverde was 69-4 in Nembhard's three years, and he chose Creighton over Florida and Stanford.Creighton coach Greg McDermott said he and assistant Alan Huss first saw Nembhard at an event in Las Vegas while they were there to scout another player.“I said, 'Who's that little guy from Canada?'” McDermott said.McDermott and Huss expected Nembhard to go to Florida, where Andrew Nembhard started his career. Once Andrew transferred to Gonzaga, Creighton knew it had a chance to land Ryan.“He’s never going to get too high when things are going well, and he’s never going to get too low if he’s struggling,” McDermott said. “To me that’s one of the characteristics that has to be with a great point guard, and he has it.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842389,Alabama's Quinerly seeking sweet ending in March Madness,"Jahvon Quinerly’s knee injury that helped doom Alabama’s NCAA Tournament chances a year ago is hardly the start of his college basketball saga.It’s probably not even the low point.The Crimson Tide point guard, who has re-emerged as one of the top players on one of the nation’s best teams, is winding down a career that veered off course at times but has a shot at ending in storybook fashion as March Madness heads to the regional semifinals.“We could go all the way back to when I committed to Arizona and the FBI scandal,” Quinerly said after his 22-point performance against Maryland. “I always think of it but I don’t like to bring it up to the media because I feel like I’m just bringing up old news. It’s just really surreal because I really have been through a lot.”Not many athletes make it to this point after their career starts off with an “FBI scandal.”Quinerly has helped the top-seeded Tide (31-5) reach the Sweet 16 for the second time in his career, setting up a meeting Friday night with No. 5 seed San Diego State (29-6) in Louisville, Kentucky.This comes after struggling much of the season to regain his old form after tearing his left ACL before even getting a chance to break much of a sweat in the Tide’s second-round loss to Notre Dame a year ago. That injury, which forced Quinerly to postpone plans to turn pro, came one year to the day before his big game against Maryland.Quinerly is the only Alabama player still around who played in an 88-78 overtime loss to UCLA in the Sweet 16 two years ago after earning Southeastern Conference Tournament MVP honors. Coach Nate Oats said he can’t help but wonder if last year’s team would have made it that far again with a healthy Quinerly, adding that he has “taken ownership of this team.”“He’s playing his best basketball by far right now,” Oats said. “He doesn’t want to let his teammates down. He wants to take this team as far as we could go.”Quinerly's college career was eventful well before that knee injury.It started with Arizona, where the five-star recruit was planning to join three cousins before he was the subject of allegations about recruiting payouts as part of a federal investigation.Then-Arizona assistant Emanuel “Book” Richardson, who had helped recruit him out of New Jersey, later pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bribery. A wiretap recording said he gave $15,000 of a $20,000 bribe to Quinerly’s mother, Caren. Richardson’s attorney later said the coach kept the money. In the meantime, Quinerly and his family lived under a cloud of suspicion.Quinerly headed to Villanova, which had offered him a scholarship as a ninth-grader. After playing less than 10 minutes a game as a freshman, he opted to join Oats at Alabama, still known for being a powerhouse in football, not basketball.“When I transferred to ’Bama, people laughed at me,” Quinerly said. “I promise you people laughed at me. They didn’t think I would win the way that we have won. It’s just a really good feeling proving people wrong. I feel like that motivated me to go even harder, and it’s definitely special getting back to the Sweet 16 after everything that I’ve been through. I’m really looking to take it the whole way with this special group.”At Alabama, he had to sit out a season after the NCAA denied a request for a waiver because of what he had been through with Arizona. When he did play, he emerged as one of the Tide’s better players in the 2020-21 season, averaging nearly 15 points and ending it with 15 consecutive double-digit scoring efforts. Quinerly put up similar numbers last season before he was injured.Quinerly has started the past five games, all Tide wins, after coming off the bench all season. For the most part, he struggled to return to form until late February. Things turned around against Arkansas and Auburn, when he combined for 40 points and 13 assists.“I knew it would come back. I just didn’t know when,” Quinerly said. “I didn’t know if it would take 14 months, 16 months. To see it come back like month 9, month 10, it’s an amazing feeling.”It took multiple rehab sessions and workouts. It also took plenty of time working on his mind, too, ultimately leading to the point where he was able to stop fixating on his knee.“I have a therapist I talk to about my injury and just mental health,” Quinerly said. “That’s a real thing. Just talking to the right people. It took some time to get to the point where I felt like I could go out there and do the things I used to do.”His own team and family aren’t alone in being happy about that. Maryland coach Kevin Willard, then at Seton Hall, had been watching Quinerly since the point guard’s ninth-grade year.“I’ve watched him every second of the way,” Willard recalled. “To see him turn into the player he’s turning into and to see what he went through early in his college career and now seeing him blossoming and having confidence — he has the swagger he had in high school back.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/21,,World

He scored three goals in a 6-0 win against Burnley, raising his total to a club-record 42 this season.The Norwegian federation said it had initially hoped Haaland would recover quickly, but that the pain got worse after he joined up with the national team.With City facing a packed schedule as it chases three trophies in the final part of the season, Norway coach Ståle Solbakken bristled at the suggestion that Haaland was prioritizing his club over his country.“If you had seen him in my hotel room at midnight last night you’d know that (he wanted to play),” Solbakken told a news conference in Marbella. “He is deeply frustrated and he's done everything he can.”Man City next plays Liverpool in the Premier League on April 1. The English title holder also hosts Bayern Munich on April 11 in the first leg of the Champions League quarterfinals.Norway begins its Euro 2024 qualifying group program against Spain on Saturday and travels to face Georgia three days later. Group A also includes Scotland and Cyprus.Haaland has scored 21 goals in 23 games for Norway but has yet to play at a major tournament.The top two teams in Group A will advance to Euro 2024 in Germany. Norway could also have a qualifying route through the playoffs next year based on its Nations League standing.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842403,New Research Reveals That Employees with All Levels of Digital Skills Boost Hong Kong’s Annual GDP by US $47.5 billion,"73% say digital skills will be very important or extremely important to their business over the next five years, but 72% of organizations are facing hiring issues   AWS has trained over 100,000 individuals in Hong Kong with cloud skills since 2014   HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 21 March 2023 - Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company, today released new research that shows that employees with basic through to advanced digital skill levels in Hong Kong increases the city's annual gross domestic product (GDP) by US $47.5 billion. Employees who use advanced digital skills – including cloud architecture or software development – contribute an estimated US $5.4 billion to Hong Kong's GDP. This is attributed to the 58% higher salaries that these employees earn compared to those with a similar education who do not use digital skills at work.   The ""AWS Hong Kong Digital Skills Study: The Economic Benefits of a Tech-Savvy Workforce,"" commissioned by AWS and conducted by Gallup, examined how building a technology-enabled workforce has significant benefits for employees, organizations, and economies. More than 300 employers were surveyed in Hong Kong from a variety of public and private sector organizations and industries. The study classifies basic digital skills as the ability to use email, word processors, other office productivity software, and social media. Intermediate digital skills include drag-and-drop website design, troubleshooting applications, and data analysis. Advanced digital skills include cloud architecture or maintenance, software or application development, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning.   The study found that advanced digital employees in Hong Kong are benefitting from more than just a boost in their income. The average employees with advanced digital skills earn 58% more than similar employees who do not use digital skills which translates into individual gains of USD $19,699. 50% employees in Hong Kong who use advanced digital skills express higher job satisfaction, compared to 26% with intermediate skills and 36% with basic digital skills.   Similarly, employers that rely heavily on advanced digitally-skilled employees, digital technology, and cloud technology reap higher business growth and innovation. The study found that 65% of digitally advanced organizations in Hong Kong introduced new, innovative products in the last two years, compared to 51% of their less digital counterparts. 57% of Hong Kong organizations that run most of their business on the cloud report steady annual revenue growth of 10% or more, compared to 30% of those that use the cloud for some of its business. The study also shows that companies in Hong Kong running most of their business on the cloud boast innovation rates 35 percentage points higher than companies that use the cloud for some of its business or do not use it at all (84% vs. 49%).   With many organizations now preparing for the challenges of a digital future, the Gallup study looked at 10 emerging technologies including AI, edge and quantum computing, blockchain, and cryptocurrency. 58% of employers in Hong Kong say at least one of these technologies is likely to become a standard part of their future business operations, with 5G and Artificial Intelligence ranking the highest at 36% and 28%.   ""People in Hong Kong are increasingly going digital, from the way they work to the way they live. This research shows that digital skills provide immense economic value to Hong Kong at the individual, organizational, and macroeconomic level,"" said Gallup Principal Economist, Dr. Jonathan Rothwell. ""As more organizations move their IT to the cloud over the next decade and new technologies emerge, digitization is going to fuel a vast number of new jobs. The opportunity for Hong Kong to be competitive in the digital economy depends on having a robust and highly skilled workforce to support current and future innovations.""   With the digital transformation of businesses and government agencies accelerating around the world, demand for digital workers will remain strong in the coming years. 77% of Hong Kong employers surveyed reported they were seeking to fill openings that require digital skills, but 72% said it is challenging to find the talent they need. A possible barrier is that 31% of Hong Kong organizations prefer a bachelor's degree, even for entry-level IT staff. However, many are starting to recognize that accepting industry certifications can ease their hiring challenges. 69% of employers say that digital certifications or training courses are acceptable substitutes for a bachelor's degree.   ""AWS is committed to supporting digital talent cultivation and organizations' digital transformation in Hong Kong, as we believe that a strong pipeline of digital talent will bring immense economic benefits and is essential for Hong Kong to remain competitive in the global economy. We have trained over 100,000 people with cloud skills in Hong Kong. As we see more and more organizations and corporations working with AWS to upskill and reskill their employees to bridge the digital skills gap, we will continue to expand our digital skills training programs for workers and employers in the region,"" said Robert Wang, Managing Director, Hong Kong and Taiwan, AWS.   To help employees develop their digital skills, PCCW Global, a leading international communications service provider, has worked with AWS to help its employees develop digital skills with AWS Skills Guild and Digital Innovation (DI) Program. The company has leveraged AWS Skills Guild to create an enablement program called Cityverse, which has trained hundreds of employees, and will also facilitate colleagues seeking AWS certification in 2023. AWS Skills Guild is a comprehensive skills enablement program that helps organizations accelerate cloud outcomes by creating excitement, increasing employee engagement, and nurturing a culture of learning. PCCW Global also leveraged the AWS Digital Innovation (DI) Program to learn about Amazon's customer-centric approach to innovation and working backwards mechanisms which accelerate companies' journeys to adopting the cloud and creating customer-centric products for their customers.   ""At PCCW Global, we are committed to drive innovation and upskill digital talent. Through our relationship with AWS, we have been able to comprehensively enhance our impactful skills enablement program. We are confident that a mindset aimed at innovation and transformation will help us remain competitive,"" Marc Halbfinger, CEO, PCCW Global said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842411,The end of Taiwan's swashbuckling era,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — Today Taiwan is pleasant, orderly, and largely crime-free. It is relatively uncorrupt, the police are helpful and friendly, and social concerns like building pet parks are a big thing.It wasn't always like that. Taiwan used to have a very 'wild west' feel. In the 1980s, as long as you didn’t talk politics, you could basically do anything you wanted short of serious violence or theft, as laws were generally not enforced or were only enforced to elicit a bribe.The 1980s and 1990s were an era dominated by men with a very macho, swashbuckling attitude to life. The economy was booming, and many had gotten rich almost overnight.Farmers who grew up poor but lived not far from Taipei were suddenly millionaires, selling their land for development. Others built small factories, often very polluting ones, and made their fortune that way.Police, politicians, and officials got wealthy off of corruption. Gangsters were seemingly everywhere.Almost any man who could afford it would drink Hennessy XO cognac, pounding back the expensive drink meant to be savored shot after shot. If you couldn't afford the XO, one was at least expected to get a bottle of VSOP.The men all smoked, drank, and ate betel nuts. They’d drink heavily over lunch, and again in the evenings before visiting sex workers, of whom there were many at the time and very open in their operations.Crime was common. It wasn’t uncommon to see gangsters coming into shops to collect their protection money or groups of them beating someone up, sometimes even in broad daylight.The police primarily used law enforcement against the gangs only when they were getting out of hand or if the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government ordered it. In general, it wasn’t a good idea to jail the people who were paying so handsomely in bribes. It was bad for business.Young gangsters would race through traffic in packs at breakneck speeds on Honda racing-style motorcycles and dressed in conspicuously colorful and tasteless clothing. Curiously, for a while, jackets with “sissy boy” in English emblazoned on the back were popular, suggesting they weren’t big language learners.Older gangsters rode around in black cars with tinted windows. It was known that tinted windowed vehicles were to be avoided.In the evenings, they would congregate in cabarets featuring comedy acts and strippers, hostess bars, or the newly invented KTVs, always with prostitutes, of course.Gang shootouts and wars were frequent. Similarly, political assassinations were pretty common, as corruption was big business, and local elections (which were allowed, unlike national elections) were often in effect turf wars between patronage factions.It was also an era of dramatic crime stories, but none was more famous and emblematic of the times than the 1997 story of Chen Chin-hsing (陳進興). Kidnappings were common at the time, even of children of not particularly rich families, but in that paranoid time, curiously, the 16-year-old daughter of famed entertainer Pai Bing-bing (白冰冰) was kidnapped on her way to school.The kidnapping gang sent a piece of the daughter’s finger and a ransom note to Pai. While still trying to collect their ransom, police caught up with the gang and launched a raid, but three members of the gang managed to escape.After the daughter’s body was found, it was determined she had been raped, tortured, and finally murdered. A seven-month nationwide manhunt riveted the nation, with the press following every twist and turn, shootouts with the police, and of course, lots of rumors.After various shootouts around the country, two of the three gang members eventually shot themselves rather than get caught, but Chen kept evading the police. At one point, Chen forced a plastic surgeon to disguise him, then killed him, his wife, and a nurse.As the manhunt wore on, Chen continued to be one step ahead. However, something happened that seems unimaginable today. Though to most people he was clearly a monster, he became something of a hero to others. Women wanted to sleep with him, and many did, in spite of him being a wanted criminal.Lurid tales and rumors abounded about his exploits. One story said he had ball bearings implanted into his penis to enhance pleasure, indicative of the kind of stories about him at the time.Chen finally decided to make a dramatic last stand. He decided to take a “hello” hostage, which was his way of referring to a white foreigner. He broke into the home of South African military attaché McGill Alexander and his family, holding them hostage. While firing at police, Alexander and his daughter were wounded by Chen.Curiously, Chen's lawyer, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politician Frank Hsieh (謝長廷), decided to take it upon himself to help negotiate. The policeman in charge was Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜). Hsieh would later go on to become premier and Hou is now mayor of New Taipei City and may represent the KMT in the upcoming presidential election.In the end, the hostages were released and Chen was arrested. He was executed in 1999.So what happened to this wild, swashbuckling culture? Why have these things receded into the background or are increasingly relegated to places like Miaoli?There are several reasons. One of the biggest was the rise of democracy in the 1990s.The out-of-control crime situation was a big campaign issue at the time, and politicians responded. Crackdowns on both corrupt police and gangsters became common, making it much harder for them to operate so openly and excessively as before.While the environment was getting tougher, the economy was also slowing and money was harder to come by. However, right next door was China, which was booming economically, extremely corrupt, and had an operating environment that the gangsters and those freewheeling entrepreneurs who’d built factories on their farmland were familiar with.Both groups started moving to China in the hundreds of thousands. Those people still exist, but the vast majority are in China or in third countries running fraud rings targeting the Chinese, which is frequently in the news, especially when they get deported to China.Removing these macho, swashbuckling men from Taiwan meant they were no longer so influential. The younger people, older people, and women left behind became bigger forces in society and brought their sensibilities with them.These cultural changes, higher incomes, strict policing, and a demographic collapse meant that, for young people today, becoming a gangster isn’t as attractive as it once was. Today’s culture emphasizes politeness and kindness and has a far gentler tone.Thankfully.Courtney Donovan Smith (石東文) is a regular contributing columnist for Taiwan News, the central Taiwan correspondent for ICRT FM100 Radio News, co-publisher of Compass Magazine, co-founder of Taiwan Report (report.tw) and former chair of the Taichung American Chamber of Commerce.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842437,US report lists 'significant human rights' abuses in India,"WASHINGTON, March 20 (Reuters) - The annual U.S. report on human rights practices released on Monday listed ""significant human rights issues"" and abuses in India, including reported targeting of religious minorities, dissidents and journalists, the U.S. State Department said.The findings come nearly a year after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. was monitoring what he described as a rise in human rights abuses in India by some government, police and prison officials, in a rare direct rebuke by Washington of the Asian nation's rights record.U.S. criticism of India is rare due to close economic ties between the countries and India's increasing importance for Washington to counter China in the region.Significant human rights issues in India have included credible reports of the government or its agents conducting extrajudicial killings; torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by police and prison officials; political prisoners or detainees; and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of journalists, the U.S. report added.Advocacy groups have raised concerns over what they see as a deteriorating human rights situation in India in recent years under the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Human Rights Watch has said the Indian government's policies and actions target Muslims while critics of Modi say his Hindu nationalist ruling party has fostered religious polarization since coming to power in 2014.Critics point to a 2019 citizenship law that the United Nations human rights office described as ""fundamentally discriminatory"" by excluding Muslim migrants from neighboring countries; anti-conversion legislation that challenged the constitutionally protected right to freedom of belief; and revoking Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status in 2019.The government dismisses the accusations by saying its policies are aimed at the development of all communities.In 2022, authorities also demolished what they described as illegal shops and properties, many of them owned by Muslims, in parts of India. Critics say the demolition drive was an attempt to intimidate India's 200 million Muslims. The government defended the demolitions, saying they were enforcing the law.""Human rights activists reported the government was allegedly targeting vocal critics from the Muslim community and using the bulldozers to destroy their homes and livelihoods"" without due process, the U.S. report released on Monday added.Since Modi took office in 2014, India has slid from 140th in World Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking by non-profit Reporters Without Borders, to 150th place last year, its lowest ever. India has also topped the list for the highest number of internet shutdowns in the world for five years in a row, including in 2022, internet advocacy watchdog Access Now says.""Civil society organizations expressed concern that the central government sometimes used UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) to detain human rights activists and journalists,"" the U.S. report said.",2023/03/21,147,World

He has an overall contract with the club until 2027 and is expected to take on a coaching role whenever he finally decides to quit as a player.“Makoto is the only professional player who can decide for himself whether to extend his contract,” Frankfurt sporting director Markus Krösche said. “With his attitude, discipline and football ability, he is not only a complete role model in our team but remains an asset to our game.”Hasebe has made 16 appearances across all competitions for Frankfurt this season — 12 of those as a starter.In total he has played 368 Bundesliga games for the club since joining from Nuremberg in 2013. He previously played for Wolfsburg and J-League club Urawa Red Diamonds.“I want to be a role model for our young players and I want to lead by example,” Hasebe said. “Frankfurt has become my home and Eintracht is my club.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842439,French protests drag on after Macron's pension plan push,"PARIS (AP) — French garbage collectors, refinery workers and others were striking again on Tuesday against President Emmanuel Macron's decision to force the divisive bill raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 through without a vote in parliament.Macron's move infuriated many in the country.Paris police said Tuesday that 234 people were arrested overnight in the capital mostly for setting fire to garbage in the streets.Mostly small, scattered protests were held in cities around France, some degenerating into violence late Monday. In Paris, small groups took to the streets to set fire to piles of trash that have formed because of a strike by garbage collectors in the capital that is in its 16th day.Paris police prefect Laurent Nunez said the violence was caused by groups of up to 300 people quickly moving through the capital.Nunez news broadcaster BFM TV that he ordered an internal investigation after an officer was filmed punching a man who was walking backwards, making him fall to the ground. The video has been widely shared on French social media.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne expressed the government's “solidarity” towards 400 police officers who have been injured in recent days, including 42 overnight.Macron has planned a series of political meetings on Tuesday with the prime minister, parliamentary leaders and lawmakers from his centrist alliance, one day after the government survived to two no-confidence motions.The 45-year-old French president, who made the pension plan a centerpiece of his second term, will speak Wednesday on national television — the first time since he made the decision last week to use a government’s special constitutional power to force the bill through parliament. He's expected to back his government.Speaking at the lower chamber of parliament Tuesday, Borne vowed to continue to work “in the coming months to seek the best responses to the concerns of the French"" including through ""compromises and work with lawmakers.”But leftist lawmaker Mathilde Panot warned Borne that ""you will yield.""“There are not many options left to Emmanuel Macron,” Panot added, demanding that the pension bill be withdrawn or new legislative elections be called.The bill still faces a review by the Constitutional Council before it can be formally signed into law.Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne is going to refer the issue to the body to accelerate the process, her office said. Some opposition lawmakers from the far right also have filed a request, and leftists are expected to do the same.The Constitutional Council can reject articles within the measure if they aren't in line with the constitution. Opponents argue that the text as a whole should be rejected.Paris police authorities said in a statement Tuesday that they ordered garbage employees to work in order to ensure a “minimum service."" It said that 674 staff have been covered by the orders, allowing 206 garbage trucks to operate since last week.Meanwhile, oil shipments in the country were partially disrupted amid strikes at several refineries in western and southern France.The Energy Transition Ministry said Tuesday that it would require some employees who are “indispensable to the functioning” of the Fos-sur-Mer oil depot, in southern France, to return to work. The move led some protesters to head to the site to support strikers.Some tensions have erupted between protesters trying to block access to the site, some throwing stones, and police using tear gas to move them away.The Fos-sur-Mer depot supplies fuel for gas stations in the southeast of France, which currently are the most affected by shortages. French government spokesperson Olivier Veran warned that more orders may follow in the coming days for other sites.Unions have called for new nationwide protests on Thursday to demand the government simply withdraw the retirement bill.",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842441,"Yellen says bank situation stabilizing, different from 2008","WASHINGTON (AP) — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen projected calm on Tuesday after recent regional bank collapses but told a gathering of bankers that additional rescue arrangements “could be warranted” if any new failures at smaller institutions jeopardize financial stability.Yellen, who made her remarks at the American Bankers Association, said that overall “the situation is stabilizing.""""And the U.S. banking system remains sound,” Yellen said, drawing clear differences between recent events and the 2008 financial meltdown, which triggered trillions of dollars of financial losses globally.“This is different from 2008,” she said. “2008 was a solvency crisis, rather what we're seeing now is contagious bank runs.""Yellen's remarks come after a series of troubling bank developments this month.Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, failed on March 10 after depositors rushed to withdraw money amid anxiety over the bank’s health. It was the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. Regulators convened over the following weekend and announced that New York-based Signature Bank also had failed. They said that all depositors at both banks, including those holding uninsured funds, those exceeding $250,000, would be protected by federal deposit insurance.And last week a third bank, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, was fortified by $30 billion in funds raised by 11 of the biggest U.S. banks in an attempt to prevent it from collapsing.The government is now determined to restore public confidence in the banking system and to prevent any more turmoil. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations into the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and President Joe Biden has called on Congress to strengthen rules on regional banks and to impose tougher penalties on executives of failed banks.Yellen said the government’s intervention was necessary to “protect the broader banking system"" and more rescue efforts could be necessary, noting that the government is still closely monitoring the banking sector.“Similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion,” she said.When Yellen was asked by the association’s president, Rob Nichols, what policies need to be adjusted in light of recent events, she said, “I don’t want to speculate at this point on what those adjustments might be. What I’m focused on is stabilizing our system.”Yellen faced the Senate Finance Committee last week and offered upbeat reassurances to rattled bank depositors and investors that the U.S. banking system “remains sound” and Americans “can feel confident” about the safety of their deposits.She will appear in front of congressional panels twice more this week, in the Senate and the House, and will inevitably face more questions about the nature of the bank failures and the government's effort to quell them.“Let me be clear: The government’s recent actions have demonstrated our resolute commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings and the banking system remain safe,” she said.While details are still being released on the banks' failures, Democratic lawmakers and some economists say a 2018 rollback of portions of a far-reaching 2010 law intended to prevent a future financial crisis were a primary cause of the institutional failures.Ahead of Yellen's speech, at a panel discussing the state of the banking system, Scott Anderson, president of Zions Bank, said he doesn't think the 2018 rollback is related to the bank failures.“Congress needs to be careful,"" Anderson said. “They need to look at what happened. They need to have a thorough debate and a thorough discussion. But they shouldn’t jump to any immediate conclusions. I don’t think these failures show that there’s any problem within the banking regulations that we have now.”___Follow the AP's coverage of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at https://apnews.com/hub/janet-yellen.",2023/03/22,,World

They allege that such apps could be used to spy on American users.Pinduoduo is a popular e-commerce app in China which often offers discounts if users team up to buy multiples of an item. Google warned users Tuesday to uninstall any Pinduoduo app not downloaded from its own Play Store. Downloads of Android and even iOS apps can often be found on websites that allow people to download apps without going through official app stores.“Google Play Protect enforcement has been set to block installation attempts of these identified malicious apps,” Google said in its statement. “Users that have malicious versions of the app downloaded to their devices are warned and prompted to uninstall the app.”It was unclear if there are similar security concerns around the Pinduoduo app for Apple users, and Pinduoduo was still available to download from Apple’s iOS store Tuesday.In a statement, Pinduoduo said that Google had not shared more details with the company beyond informing it that the current version of its app was “not compliant with Google's policy.”“We strongly reject the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious just from a generic and non-conclusive response from Google,” Pinduoduo said in the statement.Hong Kong-traded shares in the company tumbled 14.2% on Tuesday.",2023/03/22,391,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842488,PSV bans soccer hooligan for 40 years for attacking player,"EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) — A soccer hooligan serving two months in prison for running onto the field at PSV Eindhoven's stadium and attacking a player during a Europa League match has also been handed a 40-year ban by the Dutch club.The 20-year-old man will not be allowed inside the Philips Stadium during the length of the ban, PSV said in a statement late Monday.Prosecutors previously said the man had two previous convictions for soccer-related offenses and was under the influence of alcohol when he ran onto the field late in the match between PSV and Sevilla on Feb. 23 and punched Sevilla goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.Dmitrovic was not injured and wrestled the hooligan to the ground before stewards marched him off the field.The Dutch soccer federation had imposed a stadium ban on the hooligan but he managed to get in using a ticket bought by a friend.The man has since been given him what PSV called a two-year “area ban” around the stadium.He was fired from his job after the incident and kicked out of his team's supporters’ club.PSV general manager Marcel Brands said the incident has prompted the club to discuss how better to enforce stadium bans.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842489,Sevilla fires Sampaoli after team's poor Spanish league run,"MADRID (AP) — Jorge Sampaoli's second stint as Sevilla coach is over.Sevilla fired the Argentine coach on Tuesday, two days after a 2-0 loss at relegation-threatened Getafe in the Spanish league. Former Eibar and Alaves coach José Luis Mendilibar was hired as Sampaoli's replacement.“Following the defeat at Getafe, which leaves the side just above the relegation zone, the club has decided to part ways with the Argentine coach ahead of the international break,” Sevilla said in a statement. “The image shown by the team in these last matches has led the club to make this decision, in hopes that it can recover in the last 12 rounds of the Spanish league.”Sampaoli coached Sevilla from 2016-17 before leaving to join Argentina's national team ahead of the 2018 World Cup. He impressed during his initial stint with Sevilla to gain his chance with the national team, but Argentina mostly struggled under Sampaoli, who was fired after the team's round-of-16 elimination against France in Russia.Sampaoli said he departs with his head high, carrying the city and the Sevilla colors in his heart.“When they asked me to return, it felt like a good opportunity to close out a first stint that somehow had been left unfinished,” Sampaoli said on Instagram. “Sevilla is the first team in which I returned for a second try, and I can assure that, despite the different circumstances, my love for this shield won’t be affected and will remain enormous.”Sampaoli leaves with Sevilla in 14th place in the Spanish league, two points from the relegation zone. The traditional club from southern Spain has won one of its last five league games, with three losses and a draw. It has seven wins, seven draws and 12 losses in the competition.Sevilla was eliminated by Osasuna in the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey, and will face Manchester United in the last eight in the Europa League next month.The 63-year-old Sampaoli was in charge of Sevilla in a total of 31 matches since taking over from Julen Lopetegui last year, with 13 wins, six draws and 12 losses.Sevilla was last relegated to the second division in 2000, returning the following season and staying in the top flight since then.Sampaoli previously also coached Chile’s national team and most recently French club Marseille and Brazilian teams Santos and Atletico Mineiro.Mendilibar, who signed a contract until the end of the season, coached Alaves in 12 matches last season. He spent a large part of his coaching career with Eibar, first from 2004-05 and then from 2015-21. He also had long stints with Valladolid and Osasuna, as well as a brief spell with Athletic Bilbao.Mendilibar was set to take charge of the team's training session on Tuesday. Sevilla's next match is at Cadiz on April 1, after the international break.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842490,"Ukraine, Russia trade claims after blast rocks Crimean town","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian and Ukrainian officials gave conflicting accounts Tuesday of what appeared to be a brazen attack on Russian cruise missiles transported by train in the occupied Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula.A Ukrainian military spokesperson indicated that Kyiv was behind the explosion late Monday that reportedly destroyed multiple Kalibr cruise missiles near the town of Dzhankoi in northern Crimea, while stopping short of directly claiming responsibility.Natalia Humeniuk, the spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern operational command, described the strike as a signal to Russia that it should leave the Black Sea peninsula it illegally took from Ukraine in 2014.Speaking on Ukrainian TV, Humeniuk pointed out Dzhankoi’s importance as a railway junction and said that “right now, the way ahead (for Russian forces in Crimea) is clear — they need to make their way out by rail.”A vague statement by Ukraine’s military intelligence agency on Monday said multiple missiles carried by rail and destined for submarine launch had been destroyed, without saying outright that Ukraine was responsible or what weapon had been used. However, the agency implied that Kyiv was behind the blast, saying it furthers “the process of Russia’s demilitarization, and prepares the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea for de-occupation.”Moscow-installed authorities in Crimea on Tuesday provided a different version, saying that Ukrainian drones attacked civilian facilities in Dzhankoi.Sergei Aksenov, the Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea, said the attack left one civilian wounded, but caused “no serious damage.”Aksenov’s adviser, Oleg Kryuchkov, rejected Ukraine’s claims and said Ukrainian drones had targeted residential areas rather than the railway. Igor Ivin, head of the local administration in Dzhankoi, said the attack damaged power lines, a private house, a store and a college building.Unconfirmed social media reports late Monday claimed that Russia’s anti-aircraft defenses shot down multiple drones over Crimea. None of the statements could be independently verified.Throughout the war, reports have surfaced of attacks on Russian military bases and other infrastructure in Crimea, with Ukraine rarely explicitly claiming responsibility but greeting the incidents with jubilation.In August, powerful explosions rocked a Russian air base in western Crimea, with Ukraine later saying nine warplanes were destroyed. Satellite photos showed at least seven fighter planes had been blown up and others probably damaged. Ukrainian officials initially steered clear of taking credit, while mocking Russia’s explanation that a careless smoker might have caused ammunition at the Saki base to catch fire and blow up. Unusually, Ukraine’s top military officer weeks later claimed that he had ordered the strikes.Russian-appointed authorities have also previously reported repeated Ukrainian drone attacks on Crimea, most of which targeted the port of Sevastopol that hosts a major Russian naval base.These incidents in Crimea, as well as reported drone attacks on Russian territory far from the war’s front lines, have exposed major weaknesses in Moscow’s defenses and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reportedly believed the invasion of Ukraine would be quick and easy.In other developments:— Ukraine's human rights chief said that Kyiv has brought back 15 more Ukrainian children deported by Russian forces from the country's south and northeast, where Moscow held large swaths of territory earlier in the war.Dmytro Lubinets spoke just days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of bearing personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian government, over 16,000 minors were forcibly taken to Russia and Russian-occupied areas, with some put up for adoption by Russian families and just 308 repatriated so far.— Civilians were killed and wounded after Russia pounded an eastern Ukrainian town with missiles, damaging more than a dozen buildings, Ukraine’s national broadcaster Suspilne reported. A spokeswoman for the regional prosecutor’s office, Anastasia Medvedeva, told Suspilne that a couple died after an anti-aircraft missile slammed into their house in Chasiv Yar, just over 10 kilometers (six miles) west of the embattled city of Bakhmut, while another resident had been hospitalized. Earlier on Tuesday, top Ukraine presidential aide Andriy Yermak posted photos on Telegram of what he said was the aftermath of the attack, showing major damage to an apartment building.— Russian warplanes flying over the Black Sea fired missiles, most of which were intercepted, at the port city of Odesa, the regional government reported. It said debris caused building damage and injuries on the ground but didn't provide details.— Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday chaired a meeting of top defense and security officials, focusing on coordinating arms and ammunition supplies for the Ukrainian army as well as information security, Zelenskyy’s press office said. The meeting came a day after European Union countries endorsed a fast-track procedure aimed at providing Kyiv with sorely needed artillery shells to repel Russia’s invasion forces, and on the same day the Pentagon announced it would speed up its delivery of Abrams tanks by opting to send a refurbished model that can be ready faster.— Ukraine’s presidential office reported that at least three civilians were killed and 10 others were wounded by Russian shelling in the previous 24 hours. It said that Russia fired on the southern city of Kherson and its suburbs more than 60 times over that period, killing one person and injuring seven others across the Kherson province.Fierce battles continued in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is straining to encircle the city of Bakhmut in the face of dogged Ukrainian defense. Local Gov. Petro Kyrylenko said on Ukrainian television that Russian shelling there over the previous day killed one civilian and wounded another. Kyrylenko added that a further civilian died and two more suffered wounds in Avdiivka.Ukrainian authorities have reported on civilian deaths in Bakhmut on a near-daily basis since Moscow's grinding push to take the city began months ago. Of Bakhmut's prewar population of around 70,000, only several thousand remain as much of the once-proud mining hub has been pounded to rubble.Ukraine's ground forces chief said Bakhmut's Ukrainian defenders continue to thwart Russian attempts to push on to the city center.“The defense of Bakhmut continues,” Col.

No other party has said it would support the motion by Vox’s 52 lawmakers against the Socialist-led government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez.In a move that has been widely panned by other political parties and Spanish media, Vox leader Santiago Abascal has broken with custom and isn't presenting himself as an alternative prime minister. Instead, in an attempt to lure votes from centrist and leftist legislators, Vox convinced a former communist party leader and university professor to lead the no-confidence measure as an independent candidate.Ramón Tamames, 89, who was a lawmaker in the 1970s and 1980s, has pledged that if the vote were to succeed, his only act as prime minister would be to immediately call for a national election to coincide with a local election already scheduled for May 28.Tamames has said that he doesn't agree with many of Vox’s positions, which include its negation of climate change, unfounded charges that migrants are linked to more violent crimes, and its attacks on feminism. But he does share the party’s concerns regarding Catalan and Basque separatism and its patriotic defense of the flag and monarchy.Vox announced its intention to bring the no-confidence motion after Sánchez’s government reformed laws on sedition and embezzlement to relieve the legal pressure on Catalan separatists last December.“Señor Abascal, the candidate that you have presented is simply a decoy for you to hide behind and for you to hide your despicable political agenda,” Sánchez said to the organizer of the vote.“Should I apologize?"" Abascal asked, with irony, in his defense. ""Our intention was not to degrade the historic legacy of this legislature. We cannot degrade it more than you already have.”The traditional conservatives of the Popular Party, who lead the parliamentary opposition to the government, have said that they will abstain. Popular Party leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo has criticized the vote as only handing a parliamentary victory to Sánchez, and as unnecessary with a general election due in December.Sánchez's coalition with the leftist United We Can party, which governs in a minority supported by smaller regionalist parties, and even separatists in the Catalonia and the Basque regions, is trying to recover from a a recent split over what to do with their own sexual consent law that has inadvertently led to reduced prison terms for hundreds of convicted felons. The partners are hoping to restore their reputation as executors of progressive, and effective, laws before Spain takes on the European Council presidency in July.Political observers say that Vox is trying to gain traction before a busy election season. Vox aims to become key to conservative governments in town halls in May before the big prize at the end of the year when it hopes to enter a coalition with the Popular Party in the national government.“The majority of no-confidence votes in Spanish politics are destined to lose from the start, but they are also known as a chance for the party that presents them to be in the spotlight,” Montserrat Nebrera, analyst and former lawmaker of the Popular Party in Catalonia, told The Associated Press.This is the second time that Vox has brought a no-confidence vote against the current government. Its first attempt to oust Sánchez in October 2020 for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and replace him with Abascal flopped.Tamames, a respected economist, was a leading member of Spain’s Communist Party who spent time behind bars as a political prisoner before the restoration of democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. He then began his journey across the political spectrum and joined a conservative precursor to the Popular Party.Tamames has now completed his political metamorphosis by aligning himself with Vox, an upstart party that became parliament’s third-largest force in the 2019 election. He has described his radical shift as an evolution, saying that he is “not a fossil.”“My presence here is one of my last tributes to this beautiful country,” he told the chamber.Tamames deployed his erudition in his speeches. He showed sharp wit when chiding Sánchez for what he considered his long-winded rebuttals, but seemed to have failed to sway any votes his way.While Sánchez saved his hardest language for Vox’s Abascal and the Popular Party, the leaders of smaller parties took aim at Tamames, calling the motion “ridiculous” and a “circus,” especially since Tamames' beliefs only occasionally aligned with Vox's.“We, some 300-plus legislators, are extras in a campaign spot that señor Abascal has given to señor Sánchez,” said Ana Oramas of the Canary Islands Coalition. “This is not serious… The biggest scare we could give Vox is if we all agreed to make Tamames prime minister.”",2023/03/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842510,'Naive leftists' or rational peace seekers? Taiwan scholars release anti-war statement,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of Taiwanese anti-war scholars have called for Taiwan to maintain “equidistant relationships” between China and the U.S. while issuing a list of four demands including redirecting Taiwan’s military budget to climate change mitigation and social welfare.The Taiwan Anti-war Statement Working Group held a press conference on Monday (March 20) to present a list of 37 Taiwanese scholars' demands calling for “peace, anti-armament, independence, and climate action,” per CNA. The press conference was chaired by retired National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Professor Daiwei Fu (傅大為), who said that China’s constant threats to Taiwan mostly originate from U.S. provocations.The group called for an end to the Ukraine war, an end to U.S. militarism and economic sanctions, prevention of war between China and the U.S., and directing spending to social welfare and climate mitigation instead of military buildup.Academia Sinica researcher Lu Chien-yi (盧倩儀) said that U.S. militarism has led to the country's massive social welfare deficiencies, crumbling infrastructure, and decline in life expectancy. “Taiwanese politicians continue to imitate the U.S. in reducing social welfare and climate budgets, why are we still foolishly singing their praises?” Lu asked.Lu said that the U.S. insistence on maintaining global hegemony has sacrificed many countries, and warned that Taiwan may be next. She said that China was not the only threat Taiwan faced and that military threats should be considered rationally.Lu also questioned the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, pointing out that the life expectancy of an average U.S. citizen is less than China’s due to the prioritization of military spending gutting social welfare programs, per Watchout. “The United States doesn't even care about the lives of Americans, will it really care about Taiwanese people?"" she asked.Retired NCCU College of Communications Professor Kuo Li-hsin (郭力昕) said he hoped the call would initiate a more thoughtful discussion in Taiwanese society around military threats. ""In a society that prides itself on democracy and freedom of speech, we hope there can be more deep thought and dialogue,"" he said.The group’s statement was met with harsh criticism from Assistant Professor at Soochow University’s Department of Political Science Fang-Yu Chen (陳方隅), who described them as ""naive leftists,"" per Watchout. Chen (who recently co-authored a study probing the declining number of people identifying as “Taiwanese” said that the group’s “anti-American imperialism” standpoint meant their views would highly overlap with those supporters of China-Taiwan unification, even if the group itself did not support this.Chen said he agrees with the idea of “anti-war,” but said that the initiative to achieve this should be taken by China. He said that U.S. policy is to maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which is in line with Taiwan’s aim of “maintaining independence and self-reliance.”Jo-shui Chen (陳弱水), former Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at National Taiwan University and Tang and Song Dynasty scholar, said that talking about “anti-war” is the same as talking about surrender. Chen said that China’s military spending is more than 11 times that of Taiwan’s, and “if Taiwan leaves the United States and its democratic allies in order to pursue ‘equivalence,’ it will be in a desperate situation.”Fu said that a version of the statement had been leaked on the internet before it was announced officially, and that it was already blacklisted before there was a chance for a fair discussion. The critics “have already stolen a lot of ground,"" he said.The group’s controversial “anti-war” statement comes as calls to demilitarize the island territories of Matsu and Kinmen grow, a move Chen told Taiwan News would change little. “In my opinion, Kinmen and Matsu have already demilitarized because we have very few military personnel there,” he said.Chen said that it makes no difference if Taiwan has 100 troops stationed on Matsu or none, saying “we cannot defend for even one day,” and that demilitarizing would be purely symbolic. “The question is whether we want to send this signal, because it is a very big signal,"" he said.",2023/03/21,2067,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842532,Pakistan court grants Imran Khan bail in terrorism cases,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — A Pakistani court on Tuesday granted former Prime Minister Imran Khan a weeklong bail in two new cases in which he faces terrorism charges, officials said. The ruling gave the embattled ousted premier and now popular opposition leader another brief reprieve from arrest.Since his ouster in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April, the 70-year-old former cricket player turned Islamist politician has become embroiled in a series of legal cases against him, including on terrorism charges and graft while in office.Khan's standoff with the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, has turned increasingly violent in recent days.In the latest terrorism cases, Khan is accused of inciting people to violence when he traveled to Islamabad last Saturday to face indictment in a graft case. His followers clashed with police outside the court and Khan never appeared before the judge.The graft case was later postponed till later in March. A separate terrorism case against Khan pertains to a rally last year when he verbally threatened a female judge.Khan denies all charges against him, saying he is being victimized by Sharif's government. After Tuesday's ruling by a court in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province, a close Khan associate repeated those claims.Fawad Chaudhry, a senior leader in Khan's opposition Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf party, said the terrorism charges were “politically motivated.”Since the latest violence on Saturday, police have arrested hundreds of Khan's supporters for attacking police in Islamabad and also in Lahore, where his followers clashed for two days with officers earlier last week when police first attempted to arrest Khan.Also, after he was wounded last November in a shooting attack while leading a rally when a gunman sprayed his vehicle and entourage with bullets, Khan has also insisted there are plots to assassinate him.

The complaints came over the past 11 months and occurred mostly on vehicles with low miles.An increase in steering effort can cause an overreaction or inability to avoid a road hazard, the agency said in documents posted Tuesday on its website.NHTSA has no reports of crashes or injuries from the problem.The agency will determine how many vehicles are affected and how severe the problem is. A recall is possible.Honda said that it will cooperate with the investigation, which is in its early stages and may not lead to a recall. The company also is doing an internal review.The company says most of the Civics should be under warranty, and that if any owner feels something is not right, they should contact their dealer.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842534,TikTok updates rules; CEO on charm offensive for US hearing,"LONDON (AP) — TikTok went on a counteroffensive Tuesday amid increasing Western pressure over cybersecurity and misinformation concerns, rolling out updated rules and standards for content as its CEO warned against a possible U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned video sharing app.CEO Shou Zi Chew is scheduled to appear Thursday before U.S. congressional lawmakers, who will grill him about the company’s privacy and data-security practices and relationship with the Chinese government.Chew said in a TikTok video that the hearing “comes at a pivotal moment” for the company, after lawmakers introduced measures that would expand the Biden administration’s authority to enact a U.S. ban on the app, which the CEO said more than 150 million Americans use.“Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok. Now this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you,” said Chew, who was dressed casually in jeans and blue hoodie, with the dome of the U.S. Capitol in Washington in the background.“I’ll be testifying before Congress this week to share all that we’re are doing to protect Americans using the app,” he said.TikTok app has come under fire in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific, where a growing number of governments have banned TikTok from devices used for official business over worries it poses risks to cybersecurity and data privacy or could be used to push pro-Beijing narratives and misinformation.So far, there is no evidence to suggest this has happened or that TikTok has turned over user data to the Chinese government, as some of its critics have argued it would do.Norway and the Netherlands on Tuesday warned apps like TikTok should not be installed on phones issued to government employees, both citing security or intelligence agencies.There’s a “high risk” if TikTok or Telegram are installed on devices that have access to “internal digital infrastructure or services,” Norway’s justice ministry said, without providing further details.TikTok also rolled out updated rules and standards for content and users in a reorganized set of community guidelines that include eight principles to guide content moderation decisions.“These principles are based on our commitment to uphold human rights and aligned with international legal frameworks,” said Julie de Bailliencourt, TikTok’s global head of product policy.She said TikTok strives to be fair, protect human dignity and balance freedom of expression with preventing harm.The guidelines, which take effect April 21, were repackaged from TikTok's existing rules with extra details and explanations.Among the more significant changes are additional details about its restrictions on deepfakes, also known as synthetic media created by artificial intelligence technology. TikTok more clearly spells out its policy, saying all deepfakes or manipulated content that show realistic scenes must be labeled to indicate they're fake or altered in some way.TikTok had previously banned deepfakes that mislead viewers about real-world events and cause harm. Its updated guidelines say deepfakes of private figures and young people are also not allowed.Deepfakes of public figures are OK in certain contexts, such as for artistic or educational content, but not for political or commercial endorsements._____AP writer Jan M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842535,Swedish court OKs activists to sue state over climate policy,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — A court in Sweden on Tuesday allowed a group of environmental activists, including Greta Thunberg, to file a lawsuit against the Swedish state for what they say is insufficient action on the climate.The youth-led initiative Aurora, which is behind the lawsuit, said on its website that “the Swedish state does not treat the climate crisis as a crisis.”Last year, more than 600 people under the age of 26 signed a document as the basis for the lawsuit, saying the country has violated its citizens' human rights with its climate policies. On Nov. 25, hundreds of activists, among them Thunberg holding a sign reading “now we sue the state,” marched through the Swedish capital to the courthouse to file the lawsuit.“We in Aurora hold the state responsible for the lack of climate work. Through a court process, we must ensure that the state respects human rights,” the group said on its site.The action comes as scientists warn that chances are slipping away to limit future warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.The Nacka District Court said the Swedish government has been given three months to submit its response.The court said that it could not currently provide any forecast as to when hearings may take place or when the case will be decided.Climate campaigners have launched numerous lawsuits against governments and companies in recent years, with mixed success.In one of the most high-profile cases, Germany’s top court ruled in 2021 that the government had to adjust its climate targets to avoid unduly burdening the young. The German government reacted by bringing forward its target for ‘net zero’ emissions by five years to 2045 and setting more ambitious near-and-medium term steps to achieve that goal.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842536,Reborn Ringling Bros. circus to leap on tour — minus animals,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus has been reimagined and reborn without animals as a high-octane family event with highwire tricks, soaring trapeze artists and bicycles leaping on trampolines.Feld Entertainment, which owns the “Greatest Show on Earth,” revealed to The Associated Press what audiences can expect during the show's upcoming 2023 North American tour kicking off this fall.The 75 performers from 18 countries will include performers on a triangular high wire 25 feet off the ground, crisscrossing flying trapeze artists, a spinning double wheel powered by acrobats and BMX trail bikes, unicycle riders and skateboarders doing flips and tricks.The tour kicks off in Bossier City, Louisiana, from Sept 29-Oct. 1 and then goes to Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Maryland, Michigan, Indiana and ends the year in Oklahoma. It restarts in 2024 in Florida, home to Feld Entertainment.The show is a complete rethink of a modern circus. Feld Entertainment has been working on everything from how to integrate clowns, the branding and the merchandise over the past four years.“We knew we were going to come back. We didn’t know exactly how,” says Kenneth Feld, chair and chief executive officer of Feld Entertainment. “It took us a long time to really delve in and take a look at Ringling in different ways. It became a re-imagination, a rethinking of how we were going to do it.”The circus took down its tents after years of declining ticket sales as customers became conflicted about the treatment of circus animals. Costly court battles led to the end of elephant acts in 2016. People for Ethical Treatment of Animals have praised the “animal-free revamp.”The rebirth extends the circus’ long run that dates back to a time before automobiles, airplanes or movies, when Ulysses S. Grant was president and minstrel shows were popular entertainment.“There is no substitute for live entertainment. You cannot get an emotional response from people looking at a two-dimensional screen as you can when they are experiencing 'The Greatest Show on Earth’ or any kind of live entertainment,” says Feld.The new production design includes moveable staircases and two main stages. Audiences will have a 360-degree view with live camera feeds and virtual reality, and lighting and sound design that tracks the performer.“The technology in the show is about enhancing experience, not just technology,” said Juliette Feld Grossman, chief operating officer of Feld Entertainment. “We have so much activity and action so we want to make sure that we never miss the biggest moments in the show.”Grossman said that when she and her team were rethinking what the circus could be, they landed on the concept of fun and a sense of play being critical. She promises to “give the audience something that they haven’t seen or that they didn’t even know to anticipate.”The Feld family, which bought the circus in 1967, has branched out, buying and creating other large-scale touring shows, such as Disney on Ice, Marvel Live and Monster Jam. Feld said that there is something about the circus that people hold dear.“Why there is a circus and a form of circus literally every place on the planet is that people emotionally are basically the same,” he said.“When you’re on a high wire and you’re doing a backward somersault on the wire or you’re doing something really extraordinary, I don’t care where you are. You appreciate that. You understand the danger of it, the thrill of it.”___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842537,Man United bidders set to make latest takeover offers,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — After a series of high level meetings last week, a second round of bids to buy Manchester United are due Wednesday.Representatives of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani toured Old Trafford and the club's training ground last Thursday, meeting with United executives. Jim Ratcliffe held talks with the Premier League club on Friday and was pictured being greeted by chief executive Richard Arnold. American investment firm Elliott Management has also held meetings with a view to providing capital for takeover bids or other finance options.Indicative offers were submitted to American merchant bank Raine last month, with Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe confirming their intention to buy out the Glazer family, the current owners of United.The next stage of the process included a closer look at United's business and meetings with key executives before making renewed bids.Sheikh Jassim is chairman of Qatar Islamic Bank and the son of a former Qatari prime minister. He is aiming to take 100% ownership of United and is intent on investing in the club's stadium and training facilities. He sent real estate advisors as part of his delegation last week.Ratcliffe is the billionaire owner of petrochemicals giant INEOS and is bidding for majority ownership after launching a failed attempt to buy Chelsea last year.United is expected to become the most expensive sports team in history, with the price estimated to reach up to $6 billion.Last year, Raine handled the sale of Chelsea to Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital for about $3 billion. The Denver Broncos were sold to Walmart heir Rob Walton and his daughter and son-in-law for a record $4.65 billion last year.United's prospective new owners could also have to spend about $1 billion to redevelop the stadium.Sheikh Jassim and Ratcliffe remain the only bidders to publicly declare their interest in the 20-time English league champions. There is still a possibility that the Glazers could opt against a full sale of the club as they explore “strategic alternatives.”Second bids for United are due to be placed by 9 p.m. Wednesday.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842538,Russia's reliance on China rises amid Ukraine sanctions,"BEIJING (AP) — Like a salesman buttering up his best customer, President Vladimir Putin gushed about China's economic success as he welcomed Chinese leader Xi Jinping to the Kremlin.“We even feel a bit envious,” Putin said Monday as Xi grinned.That was more than idle flattery. China isn't just Moscow's diplomatic partner in opposing what they see as U.S. domination of global affairs. Its thriving economy is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas exports, pumping billions of dollars into Putin's treasury and helping the Kremlin resist Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.Putin welcomes the lifeline, but that reliance is accelerating Russia’s slide into the junior role in an uneasy relationship with Xi’s government. Beijing has ambitions that diverge from Moscow's and sometimes conflict.“Russia may worry about increasing reliance upon China, but it has no other good options,” said Li Xin, director of the Institute of European and Asian Studies at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.The current Beijing-Moscow partnership dates to the 1990s, when they set aside border disputes and other strains that led to the 1961 Sino-Soviet split and forged a post-Cold War diplomatic front to push back against Washington.For both sides, the importance of that relationship increased as Washington imposed sanctions on Russia and restricted Chinese access to U.S. technology on security grounds. Xi accused the United States this month of trying to block China's economic development.“There’s a feeling that the U.S. and American allies are out to contain the two countries,” said Li Mingjiang, an international relations expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University.Despite “strategic mistrust” stemming from conflicts dating back to the 19th century, they share a “common political interest"" of ""resisting American challenges,” Li said.Before last year's invasion, Xi and Putin declared they had a “no limits friendship.” But Beijing already has shown there are limits. It says they aren't allies and has avoided openly giving Russia military help in Ukraine, a step President Joe Biden and other Western leaders warn would trigger unspecified consequences for China.Beijing once called the Soviet government “Big Brother,” but Moscow’s lead in political influence eroded as China’s economy raced ahead following market-style reform in the 1980s.Russia had oil riches, but the post-Soviet economy failed to create competitive companies. Meanwhile, China launched auto, tech and other industries that are expanding into global markets.In the mid-’90s, Russia's economy was half the size of China's but its smaller population had four times the output per person.By 2020, China’s lead had multiplied. Its economy was 10 times the size of Russia's and edged ahead in output per person, $10,525 to Russia's $10,115, according to the International Monetary Fund. Russia’s $1.7 trillion economy was about three-quarters the size of that of Texas.Russia also is losing its lead in arms technology, its biggest non-oil export.China paid billions of dollars in the early 2000s for fighter jets and other weapons. But in another sign of the limits to cooperation, Russia suspended sales after 2004 due to complaints Beijing was copying its missile and other technology. Sales didn't resume until 2014.China's imports from Russia, mostly oil and gas, rose 49% last year to $76.4 billion, according to customs data. The Global Times newspaper reported Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as China's biggest foreign oil supplier in January and February.China can buy Russian energy without triggering Western sanctions that prohibit or limit imports into the United States, Europe or Japan.Beijing values relations with Moscow so highly that it has avoided using that economic power as leverage, said Li Mingjiang.""We've seen Chinese caution not to do anything or say anything that may make the Russians upset or suspicious,” he said.Moscow is uneasy that its dominant role among former Soviet republics in Central Asia might be undermined by Xi’s multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative to expand trade by building ports, railways and other infrastructure.Putin’s government shares worries with Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi that China is using Belt and Road to expand its strategic influence at their expense.Beijing tried to mollify Putin’s government by agreeing Moscow would be in charge of security affairs in Central Asia while China would focus on trade.To sweeten the deal, Beijing invested $1 billion to keep an oil project in Siberia alive after it lost access to Western financing due to sanctions imposed over Moscow's 2014 seizure of Crimea from Ukraine.Beijing wants to keep Putin’s government as a viable diplomatic partner but has avoided doing anything that might trigger sanctions against Chinese banks or other companies or shut them out of Western export markets.The potential losses for China's exporters if it crosses Western governments are immense.The United States bought 15% of Chinese exports last year, even after tariff hikes in a feud with Beijing over technology and security. The 27-nation European Union bought almost 13%.And Russia? It accounted for 1.3%. Less than Thailand.“To China, the importance of Russia is lower than the West in technology and economic cooperation,” said Li Xin. “But politically, the importance of Russia to China is on the rise, because of the geopolitical and military suppression of China from the United States.”___Associated Press researchers Yu Bing and Chen Wanqing contributed to this report.___This story corrects the name of university to Technological.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842539,Millennial Money: Is being a landlord worth it?,"Real estate has been a popular investment for a very long time — for those who can afford it. But in recent years, trends such as house flipping, “house hacking” (living in one room of a property while renting out the others) and short-term vacation rentals have made real estate investment much more accessible, especially for millennials seeking a second income stream in an uncertain economy.Though the potential profit is tempting, being a landlord may not be for everyone. Rental properties involve significant upfront costs, time commitment, legal liabilities and ethical dilemmas that can put a dent in your dividends. So before you take out a loan to buy an investment property in an “up-and-coming neighborhood,” here are three things to consider.KNOW WHAT YOU CAN COMMIT TOThere are many ways to oversee rental real estate, from being fully hands-on to hiring someone else to manage a property you’ve never seen in person. When weighing your options, assess the time and money you can commit to a potential rental and the market you want to enter.If you have more time than money, you might prefer a fixer-upper you can bring up to market value with low-cost do-it-yourself projects. If you have the cash but not the time, it may be better to purchase a place that’s ready to rent and even hire a property manager to handle the day-to-day upkeep. But with rising mortgage interest rates — up to almost 7% as of this writing — and property prices increasing every year nationwide, investing in real estate may be out of reach for many. MAKE SURE YOU CAN WEATHER A FINANCIAL STORMMost investments come with some risk, but real estate has its own unique hurdles. Upfront and ongoing repairs, vacancies and tenants who don’t pay rent can tank your profits and even affect your ability to pay the property’s mortgage.Before you get in over your head, ensure you have enough money to get through a downswing. Having a cash reserve or credit line can save you if your property is vacant for a few months or if your tenant has an emergency situation and can’t pay rent.“If you need full occupancy and full rent to break even, with no flexibility, then your mortgage isn’t sustainable,” says Nancy Neiman, who rents out an in-law suite attached to her garage to help pay her mortgage after refinancing the property in Claremont, California.Many real estate investors, with large portfolios funded by loans, put themselves and their tenants in difficult situations because of this lack of flexibility. If you’re relying on future profits to provide the cash for your loan payments, your property may be at risk.“Circumstances happen that are out of your control,” Neiman, a politics professor, says. “You need to build in a cushion to your business plan before you start so those obstacles don’t make you vulnerable.”UNDERSTAND THE TENANT PERSPECTIVERental properties are a unique type of investment; you’re interacting with real people. The more you treat them with respect and understanding, the more likely you are to get a reliable return on your investment.“Look at your tenants as partners,” says Alonzo Johnson, who led a rent strike in 2020 against real estate company Emerald Equity Group as the tenant association president for one of the company’s properties in East Harlem, New York, where Johnson says he still lives. “This is a symbiotic relationship; you provide the housing and maintain a quality of livability, and we pay for that service,” he says.Investors with large, loan-funded real estate portfolios have historically taken advantage of legal loopholes in housing regulations, exacerbating the affordable housing crisis in major cities. But with growing tenants’ rights protections such as the New York state’s Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (which tightened rules on evictions and rent increases, among other things), keeping rent prices reasonable isn’t just ethical — it’s often legally required.Even if you plan to operate on a smaller scale, knowing ahead of time what you’d need to charge in rent in order to turn a profit can help ensure that you’re not pricing out locals or negatively affecting housing access in your community.“Being an ethical landlord means being flexible enough with people’s life circumstances that you are OK with some degree of rent forgiveness if you have to be,” Neiman says. “If you’re unmoveable, you won’t be able to absorb emergency costs and will find yourself either being unethical or going under.”______________________________This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842540,"Japan, China push opposing visions in top-level visits","BANGKOK (AP) — Asia’s stake in Europe’s war was made crystal clear Tuesday when the leaders of the region's two richest countries sat in the capitals of Russia and Ukraine in strong shows of support for the opposing sides.With the world's eyes on Chinese President Xi Jinping's first talks in Moscow since the invasion of Ukraine, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida paid a surprise visit to Kyiv on the other side of the front lines.The visits came as tension has been growing between the two regional rivals and top economic powers. China is seeking to expand its influence, and Japan has responded by increasing its defense spending and deepening ties with the United States and its allies.While Xi's trip is meant to send a message to the West that its efforts to isolate Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine have fallen short, the contemporaneous visit to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by Kishida, whose country holds the Group of Seven presidency of leading industrial nations, strongly underlines the global nature of the opposition to the war.“It's a very pointed statement,” said Euan Graham, a Singapore-based expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.“It shows that there is more Asian skin in the game than many people may have thought. ... As Xi is holding hands with Putin, Kishida is clutching the hand of the president — it's a very powerful contrast and one that demonstrates that Ukraine isn't just a European or Atlantic concern.”Kishida's decision to visit Kyiv just as Xi was in Moscow was clearly no coincidence, and likely meant to lessen any impact the Chinese leader had hoped to make, said Heigo Sato, a Takushoku University professor and expert on defense and security issues.“The most important thing is to continue support for Ukraine, and it was necessary to demonstrate G-7 solidarity, with Europe, Japan and the United States working together to provide support,” he said.Kishida has been among the most outspoken leaders in Asia against the invasion of Ukraine, and Japan has put in place strict sanctions against Russia and provided Ukraine with non-lethal military aid, humanitarian supplies and financial support.Because of constitutional constraints proscribing Japan from providing Ukraine lethal weapons, Sato said Kishida’s trip was “a minimum requirement” for the chair of the G-7.In a speech in January at Johns Hopkins University, Kishida stressed that he saw the conflict as having direct implications on the world order, and pledged to use the G-7 presidency to do what he could to strengthen the response of “like-minded countries.”“Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has marked the complete end of the post-Cold War world,” he said. “It has come to light that globalization and interdependence alone cannot serve as a guarantor for peace and development across the globe.”Later, in what seemed to be a reference to Beijing's designs toward Taiwan, a self-ruled island that China claims as its territory, Kishida said that “China has some visions and claims on the international order that diverge from ours and that we can never accept.”Kishida's visit to Moscow came just hours after he met with Narendra Modi in New Delhi, where he invited the Indian prime minister to attend the G-7 summit in May. Kishida also announced actions for a new Indo-Pacific initiative meant to counter China's growing influence.Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan, said in a Twitter post that for countries in the region, the visits highlight “two very different European-Pacific partnerships.”“Prime Minister Kishida stands with freedom and Xi stands with a war criminal,” he wrote. “Which Pacific leader is the right partner for a brighter future?”China's Foreign Ministry, meantime, accused Kishida of escalating tensions in Europe.“The international community should uphold the position of promoting peace talks and creating situations for the political resolution of the Ukraine crisis,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters in Beijing. “We hope Japan could do more things to de-escalate the situation instead of the opposite.”Wang stressed that China has been “calling for a political solution to the Ukrainian crisis, opposing the Cold War mentality, and opposing unilateral sanctions.”China and Russia have described Xi's three-day trip as an opportunity to deepen their “no-limits friendship,” and in a readout after the first day of talks, China said Xi had “stressed that there is a profound historical logic for China-Russia relationship to reach where it is today.”China has thus far not provided military supplies to Russia, but has criticized Western sanctions and accused NATO and the United States of provoking the Russian invasion.The sanctions have had the effect of increasing Russia's reliance on trade with China and moving the countries closer together.The Moscow summit has the effect of underscoring and reinforcing the status of “Russia as a junior partner with China — economically, militarily and diplomatically,” said Robert Murrett, a retired U.S. vice admiral and professor at Syracuse University.“Russia has an increasing dependence on China because of Moscow’s growing domestic and international challenges, and at the same time, China can derive selected advantages from the relationship while continuing to develop a range of other bilateral initiatives on the world stage,” he said in an analyst note.The symbolism of Xi's visit to Moscow is enormous, Graham said.“It's basically an endorsement of Putin's invasion and Putin will read it as such,” he said. “And it's a signal that Russia has China's support, at least diplomatically, and probably considerably more than that under the table.”Japan has been historically at odds with both China and Russia, including over Russian-held islands that the former Soviet Union seized from Japan at the end of World War II, which has prevented the two countries from signing a peace treaty formally ending their war hostilities.Because of its sanctions against Russia, Tokyo has faced reprisals from Moscow, which announced the suspension of talks on a peace treaty that included negotiations over the disputed islands.Japan, noting growing threats from China and North Korea, has been expanding military cooperation beyond its main ally, the United States, and has developed partnerships with Australia, Britain, and other nations in Europe and Southeast Asia.Kishida’s government last year adopted a new national security strategy under which Japan is deploying long-range cruise missiles to strengthen its strike-back capability, a major break from the country’s postwar self-defense-only principle.While former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe invested time in pursuing a relationship with Putin that didn't really lead to any significant gain, Kishida has shown a greater willingness to be critical, Graham said.But Kishida's trip to Kyiv will not likely worsen ties between Tokyo and Moscow, he said, adding that it would certainly please Washington.“Russia doesn't want to put all its eggs in the China basket either, so the idea that Russia is going to suddenly escalate Japan either economically or militarily, they would be very foolish to do so,” he said.“I think that's probably a calculation that the Japanese have run, that they're willing to bear that risk.”______Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842541,Boris Johnson says 'partygate' untruths were honest mistake,"LONDON (AP) — Former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged Tuesday that he misled Parliament about rule-breaking government parties during the coronavirus pandemic — but insisted he never intentionally lied.Johnson said it never occurred to him that the gatherings — which variously included cake, wine, cheese and a “secret Santa"" festive gift exchange — broke the restrictions his own government had imposed on the country.Britain’s boisterous former leader is set to be grilled by lawmakers on Wednesday over whether he lied when he denied there had been parties in his Downing Street offices in violation of COVID-19 lockdown rules that barred socializing. If found to have lied deliberately, he could be suspended or even lose his seat in Parliament.In a dossier of written evidence to the House of Commons Committee of Privileges, Johnson acknowledged that “my statements to Parliament that the Rules and Guidance had been followed at all times did not turn out to be correct.”But he said his statements “were made in good faith and on the basis of what I honestly knew and believed at the time. I did not intentionally or recklessly mislead the House.”The committee will quiz Johnson in person on Wednesday afternoon about “partygate,” the scandal over a string of gatherings in government offices in 2020 and 2021. Police eventually issued 126 fines over the late-night soirees, boozy parties and “wine time Fridays,” including one to Johnson, and the scandal helped hasten the end of his three years in office.Revelations about the gatherings sparked anger among Britons who had followed rules imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, unable to visit friends and family or even say goodbye to dying relatives in hospitals.Becky Kummer, spokesperson for the group COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said Johnson’s claim to have acted in good faith was “sickening.”“He isn’t fit for public office,” Kummer said.When reports of the parties first emerged in late 2021, Johnson initially said that no rules had been broken. He later apologized and said there had been “misjudgments.”But in the 52-page dossier he said he “honestly believed” the five events he attended, including a sendoff for a staffer and his own surprise birthday party, were “lawful work gatherings.””No cake was eaten, and no one even sang ‘Happy Birthday,’"" he said of the June 19, 2020, celebration, for which he received a police fine. “The primary topic of conversation was the response to COVID-19.”Johnson said suggestions that people in government considered themselves to be ""in a guidance-free bubble where the requirements we imposed on the rest of the country did not apply” could not be further from the truth.“Drinking wine or exchanging gifts at work and whilst working did not, in my view, turn an otherwise lawful workplace gathering into an unlawful one,"" he said.Johnson said he was assured by “trusted advisers” that no rules had been broken — assurances that turned out to be wrong. He said he was later “genuinely shocked” by the rule-breaking uncovered by police and by senior civil servant Sue Gray, who led an investigation into partygate.Johnson and his supporters have also questioned the impartiality of Gray because she has now accepted a job as chief of staff to the leader of the opposition Labour Party.If the committee finds Johnson in contempt, it could recommend punishments ranging from an oral apology to suspension or even expulsion from Parliament, or it could recommend no sanction at all. Any punishment would have to be approved by the House of Commons.Johnson was forced to resign in July after a slew of scandals over money and ethics finally proved too much for Conservative colleagues, dozens of whom quit the government.For Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Wednesday's televised hearing will be an unwelcome reminder of the turmoil that engulfed the Conservative government under Johnson — just as the party’s poll ratings are starting to edge upward.Sunak took office in October, replacing Liz Truss, who stepped down within weeks of becoming prime minister after her tax-cutting budget plans caused turmoil on financial markets.Johnson, once considered a secret weapon with voters, is now a liability, said Robert Hayward, a polling expert and Conservative member of the House of Lords.“He is a serious negative for most people,"" Hayward said. ""Boris’s polling is far worse than is the case for Rishi (Sunak).”",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842542,Macron welcomes back to France journalist freed in Mali,"PARIS (AP) — A French journalist who was held hostage by Islamic extremists for nearly two years in Mali was welcomed home by French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday, one day after his release.Olivier Dubois was kidnapped in April 2021 in northern Mali, a region wracked by jihadi violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.Leaving the plane at the Villacoublay military airport, southwest of Paris, with a big smile on his face, Dubois was applauded by the group of people waiting for his arrival. He was greeted with great joy by his sister and father, and then he hugged Macron.Speaking to French media, Dubois said he listened to French radio to keep himself sane in captivity and read the Quran “to understand” his captors. Dubois told RFI radio Tuesday that although he was not “hit or humiliated,” it was a grueling experience.“You are chained, you are a prisoner, you are considered a disbeliever, an infidel,"" he said. ""It was living outside all the time — whether there’s a sandstorm, the sun, the cold or the rain ... It’s washing and defecating outside. It’s living outside all the time.”The conditions of Dubois’ release, including whether it involved a ransom, have not been disclosed.Reporters Without Borders, also known by its French acronym RSF, thanked French authorities on Monday for “having implemented the necessary means to obtain his release,” without elaborating.Dubois’ release took place on the same day that an American aid worker was freed in Mali.Jihadi groups have been abducting hostages for ransom as a way to fund their operations and expand their presence. At least 25 foreigners and untold numbers of locals have been kidnapped in the Sahel — the vast, semi-arid expanse below the Sahara Desert — since 2015, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842543,"Thailand sets May 14 election, populist party tops polls","BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s general election will take place on May 14, the country’s election regulator said Tuesday, one day after the dissolution of Parliament initiated by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who is seeking a fresh term.The Election Commission said registration of candidates would begin April 3.The election will pit the popular opposition Pheu Thai party, backed by billionaire populist Thaksin Shinawatra, against parties representing the conservative establishment and closely linked to the military, which has staged two coups in the last two decades.Other parties are likely to win enough seats to be wooed to join a coalition government.Prayuth dissolved Parliament just ahead of the end of the four-year term of the House of Representatives. Early dissolution allows candidates for the lower house to switch party affiliations just 30 days before the election, instead of the usual 90 days.Parties led and backed by Thaksin have won the most seats in every election since 2001, but been fiercely opposed by the conservatives, who have undermined several governments headed by Thaksin and his allies by utilizing legal rulings by the judiciary and military coups in 2006 and 2014.Pheu Thai’s top candidate for the prime minister’s post is his 36-year-old daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, whom polls show to be the most popular choice by a large margin.Prayuth, who turned 69 on Tuesday, first assumed the top job after staging the 2014 coup as army commander, ousting Yingluck’s elected government.He did not run in the 2019 election but was selected prime minister by Parliament after receiving the support of the army-linked Palang Pracharath party.More than 52 million people are eligible to vote across 400 constituencies. Four hundred seats will be determined by first-past-the-post races in each constituency. A separate party preference ballot will seat the other 100 members of the House of Representatives from national party lists.The prime minister is selected by a vote in a combined session of the newly elected lower house and the 250-seat Senate, a conservative body whose members are appointed.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842544,Paul Newman's camp for sick kids rises from the ashes,"ASHFORD, Conn. (AP) — Amarey Brookshire was devastated when she heard about the fire at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children — her camp.The February 2021 blaze destroyed much of the retreat in the woods of eastern Connecticut, which was founded by the late actor Paul Newman in 1988 to give children with devastating medical conditions a place to, as he said, “raise a little hell.”The blaze burned the center of the camp, which had been made to look like an Old West town and housed the woodworking shop, the arts and crafts area, the camp store, and an educational kitchen. Fire investigators determined it was not arson but could not pinpoint a cause.Amarey, now 13, said she was in the hospital when her mom told her the news.“She told me that it was the arts and crafts and the wood shop area, so I was really sad because I love doing wood shop and like the arts and crafts,” she said. “I was really sad.”Amarey, who has sickle cell disease, thought about friends she made at camp who were going through similar health struggles. She thought of the joy she felt catching her first fish, zip lining, swimming in a heated pool without worrying that cold water would trigger a health crisis, and the feeling of accomplishment after completing a box in the wood shop.“We thought of how amazing that area of camp was, because when you walk in, you immediately feel life,” said Amarey's mother, Amarilis Frajul. “Like when you're in the wood shop area and you see all the marks on the tables, the holes from people before us. You go into arts and crafts, you see the paint, the glitter, the smell, and you know that it’s been used, you know, so many lives have been there. And to know that there have been so many memories created, and it was gone like that. That was hard.""But the camp wasn't closed. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and last summer, tents housed the creative center.And money came pouring in, from 4,500 donors. The Travelers insurance company and the Travelers Championship golf tournament gave a combined gift of $1 million. The Newman's Own Foundation donated an additional $1 million. And on Tuesday, the new $4.5 million, 11,000-square-foot (1,022-square-meter) creative complex opens. It's a single building, made to look like several structures, with twice the space and an open-floor design. The wheelchair entrances are no longer separate, so nobody feels excluded.And there are new amenities such as a quiet sensory room, a room with a fireplace for parents and caregivers to meet and talk, and a large deck for outdoor events. The facility now has geothermal heating and cooling, a large emergency storm shelter, and huge cisterns, so that if another fire breaks out, first responders won't have to pump water from the camp's pond.“What was a traumatic, horrible event was quickly turned around because of the kindness of strangers, and loyalty of longtime friends,” camp CEO Jimmy Canton said. “So, you know, they took this tragedy and turned it into a blessing.”A centerpiece of the new facility will be a large mosaic, made up of more than 4,000 pieces and located between the arts and crafts and woodworking area, that reads “Camp is Magic.”The piece was donated and installed by artist Mia Schon, who works in Boston and Tel Aviv, Israel. It contains a lot of “Easter eggs” for campers to find, such as a rendering of Weepee, a legendary fish said to live in the camp's pond.Schon learned how to do mosaics while working in 2006 as a camp counselor at Hole in the Wall, so for her it was a full-circle moment.“I learned about creating things from nothing,” she said. “And just make believe and playing. And then on a personal level, I think I learned how to be myself ... that everyone would accept me for who I was.”Frajul is making plans to send her daughter back to camp for a third time this summer.And Canton said that thanks to the rebuild, the creative complex will be used year-round for meetings and programming surrounding the camp's mission.“After 33 years of watching the resilience of our kids and their families, when something like this happened, there was no option but to rise, right?"" Canton said. “Their resilience teaches us how to be resilient, teaches this camp to be resilient. I mean, that’s why this place is so sacred.”",2023/03/22,,World

Market Overview:

The halal nutraceuticals market is expected to reach USD 131253.23 million by 2033, with Asia-Pacific being the largest market.

                                                    Female Sterilization Procedures Market
Market Overview:
The permanent method of sterilizing a female is used to prevent conceiving in women. It is also known as birth control. This is the most widely used family planning method. This outpatient procedure can be performed in a hospital, clinic, or doctor’s office. It is rare for complications to occur after procedures. These include infection, bowel or bladder injury, bowel damage, and problems related to anesthesia. To find the best option for birth control, extensive research was done. The key criteria to determine the best family planning method are high efficacy, accessibility, and cultural acceptance. It is also important that the procedure be easy to learn, fast, and can be done in an outpatient setting.










You can segment the Female Sterilization Procedures Market based on type and geography. Geographically, the market can be divided into four regions: North America, Europe Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific, and the Rest of the World. The procedure can be classified into surgical or non-surgical sterilization. Non-surgical methods involve blocking the fallopian tube with tiny spring-like coils. These tiny devices can cause scar tissue to form and block the fallopian tubes during non-surgical insertion. After a few months, X-rays confirm that the tubes are blocked. There are several options available, including hysteroscopic (no incision) and high-risk methods such as hysterectomy, laparotomy, mini-laparotomy, and hysteroscopic methods.
The hysteroscope is inserted through the vaginal and cervix into the uterus and allows for direct visualization of the tubal and endometrial cavities. The majority of criteria can be fulfilled by hysteroscopic sterilization. The availability of minimally invasive birth prevention methods, such as intra-uterine contraceptives, transcervical sterilization, and implantation of intrauterine devices, has led to a decline in the demand for hysteroscopic sterilization. Laparotomy, which is less common than the more commonly used laparoscopy or mini-laparotomy, is still a very popular procedure. The scope of laparoscopy has been extended by technological advancements in optics, video technology, and illumination. This procedure is also quick and easy to perform, with a lower risk of infection, which results in better patient care.

                                      Spices and Herbs Extracts Market
Market Overview:
The leaves, stems, and flowers of herbs are used to make herbal extracts. Spice extracts are pungent and aromatic ingredients made from fruits, seeds, roots, bark, vegetables, and other sources. This involves extracting a portion of the raw material using solvents like water or ethanol. Extracts may be available in powder or tincture forms. The extracts of spices and herbs are used in food, beverages, and medicines, as well as for flavoring, coloring, and preservation of food products.










The growth of the Spice and herbs extracts market is largely driven by increasing demand for convenience foods and the increasing availability and popularity of international cuisines across various countries. It is also growing due to increasing awareness of their medicinal properties and their use in innovative recipes.
Due to increasing globalization and increased tourism, the demand for ethnic foods has been on the rise. This is driving up the demand for spices and herbal extracts from various regions. The trend is expected to continue over the forecast period.
Global market growth is impeded by inefficient processing techniques and a lack of necessary infrastructure. The global market will be challenged by the availability of substitutes and adulteration in spices and herbal extracts as well as unfavorable climate conditions in certain regions. Major players in the global market will be able to capitalize on the rising demand for flavored foods products.
Due to rising preferences for convenience food and the growing popularity of street-food culture, North America is the market with the highest revenue share. Europe follows.
Due to the favorable climatic conditions for growing spices and herbs, the high consumption of locals, and the presence of major suppliers from countries like India, China, and others, the Asia Pacific market is expected to experience the greatest revenue growth over the forecast period.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842608,US speeds up Abrams tank delivery to Ukraine war zone,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is speeding up its delivery of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, opting to send a refurbished older model that can be ready faster, with the aim of getting the 70-ton battle powerhouses to the war zone by the fall, the Pentagon said Tuesday.The original plan was to send Ukraine 31 of the newer M1A2 Abrams, which could have taken a year or two to build and ship. But officials said the decision was made to send the older M1A1 version, which can be taken from Army stocks. Officials said the M1A1 also will be easier for Ukrainian forces to learn to use and maintain as they fight the invading Russian forces.“This is about getting this important combat capability into the hands of the Ukrainians sooner rather than later,” said Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary.The Biden administration announced in January that it would send the tanks to Ukraine — after insisting for months that they were too complicated and too hard to maintain and repair. The decision was part of a broader political maneuver that opened the door for Germany to announce it would send its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and allow Poland and other allies to do the same.Speaking at a Pentagon press conference, Ryder said the tanks will be refurbished and refitted to make them combat ready for Ukraine. He declined to say where that work will be done.It's unclear how soon the U.S. would begin training Ukrainian forces on how to use, maintain and repair the tanks. The intention would be to have the training of the troops coincide with the refurbishment of the tanks, so that both would be ready for battle at the same time later this year, said U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly provided. The Pentagon will also have to ensure that Ukrainian forces have an adequate supply chain for all the parts needed to keep the tanks running.The Russian and Ukrainian forces have been largely in a stalemate, trading small slices of land over the winter. The fiercest battles have been in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russia is struggling to encircle the city of Bakhmut in the face of dogged Ukrainian defense. But both sides are expected to launch more intensive offensives in the spring.Asked about the timing of the tanks' arrival, Ryder said the Abrams are part of the medium- and longer-term military support the U.S. is providing to Ukraine. He said that as Ukrainian forces take or retake territory, they will also need to sustain those gains and deter Russia from regaining any footholds.During a visit to a tank plant in Lima, Ohio, in February, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth met with officials there at length to determine the best options for getting the tanks to Ukraine.“Part of it is figuring out — among the different options — what’s the best one that can allow us to get the Ukrainians tanks in as timely a fashion as we can,” without disrupting foreign military sales, Wormuth said at the time.Officials at the plant, which is owned by the Army and operated by Reston, Virginia-based General Dynamics, said production totals can vary, based on contract demands. And while they are currently building 15-20 armored vehicles per month, including tanks, they can easily boost that to 33 a month and could add another shift of workers and build even more if needed.Development of tanks for Ukraine would have to be squeezed in between the current contracts for foreign sales, which include 250 of the newest versions for Poland and about 75 for Australia. During Wormuth’s tour of the plant, workers were preparing to build an updated version of the vehicle for Poland.Ukrainian leaders have persistently pressed for the Abrams, which first deployed to war in 1991 and has thick armor, a 120 mm main gun, armor-piercing capabilities and advanced targeting systems. It runs on thick tracked wheels and has a 1,500-horsepower turbine engine with a top speed of about 42 miles per hour (68 kilometers per hour).___Follow the AP's coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842609,Cyprus court: Briton freely confessed to wife's killing,"PAPHOS, Cyprus (AP) — A Cyprus criminal court on Tuesday rejected a defense argument that a British man’s confession to killing his ailing wife was unlawfully obtained, because he was in no frame of mind to speak to police without a lawyer present.David Hunter, 75, made the statements to law enforcement officials and medical staff on five separate occasions following his arrest “undoubtedly of his own free will"" without pressure or coercion, the three-judge panel said in a unanimous ruling.The court said it couldn't accept testimony from a defense expert that Hunter suffered from “disassociation” following his wife Janice’s December 2021 killing at the couple’s retirement home in the coastal resort town of Paphos and wasn’t fully cognizant of what he was saying.The court said that at the time of his arrest, he recalled to law enforcement officials and to his brother in the U.K. in detail how he smothered his wife, because he wanted to end her suffering and how he had subsequently consumed a mixture of pills to end his own life.Those pills included medication for his 74-year-old wife who had myelodysplastic syndrome, a type of blood cancer.The judges said they had “no doubt” that Hunter understood and was aware of what he told law enforcement officials who informed him of his rights.The ruling means Hunter remains on trial for premeditated murder after a plea deal on a lesser charge of manslaughter collapsed in December last year.Defense lawyers have called Janice Hunter’s death a matter of euthanasia or assisted suicide, and argued for a sentence that doesn't include prison time. They said Cyprus’ attorney general rebuffed what had been agreed were the facts of the case that would have sealed the plea agreement.Michael Polak, a spokesperson for Justice Abroad, a group that defends Britons facing legal troubles in foreign countries, said defense lawyers would appeal to Cyprus' Supreme Court to throw out Hunter's confession because he didn't “unequivocally waive"" his rights to having a lawyer present when he was being questioned after his arrest.“We were slightly surprised by the decision today on the grounds we submitted that the confession evidence should have been excluded,"" Polak said after the trial's adjournment Tuesday.“Now, within the judgment of the court, we had a quick look through it, and they’ve said that in their findings there was no unequivocal waiver of the right to a lawyer ... So there’s a very specific point of law, and we’re going to appeal this to the Supreme Court.”State Prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou had said it was Hunter's defense team that backed out of the plea deal. He said the prosecution won't accept Hunter’s claim that his wife asked him to end her life unless he provides proof — either a written note or explicitly having communicated her wishes to the couple’s daughter.The state prosecutor said that Cypriot authorities don’t want to set a precedent for any husband to kill his wife and claim after the fact that the killing was done with the wife’s consent.The couple’s daughter, Lesley Cawthorne, was quoted in British media as saying that her mother had clearly conveyed her wish to die to Hunter.Hadjikyrou had said defense attorneys turned down an earlier deal for Hunter to plead guilty to manslaughter. But Polak said Hunter's defense lawyers remain “open” to any “suggestions” from the prosecution.“It's obviously a very sad case. It's obvious David loved his wife a lot and cared for her a lot, they've been together for so long, so we'd say yes, we're always open to any suggestions, but at the moment we're going to be fighting for his rights,” said Polak.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842610,Virginia teacher shot by 6-year-old: 'I thought I had died',"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — A Virginia teacher who was shot and wounded by her 6-year-old student said it has changed her life and she has vivid memories and nightmares about that day.“I just will never forget the look on his face that he gave me while he pointed the gun directly at me,” first-grade teacher Abby Zwerner said during an exclusive interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie about the student. “It's changed me. It's changed my life.”She said she's still in shock and can't make sense of it, in a portion of the interview that aired Tuesday morning on “Today.""“I'm not sure when the shock will ever go away because of just how surreal it was and the vivid memories I have of that day. I think about it daily. Sometimes I have nightmares,” she said.Speaking publicly for the first time since the Jan. 6 shooting, Zwerner said in a portion of the interview that aired Monday on “NBC Nightly News"" that she's had a challenging recovery. She's had four surgeries and has some days when she “can't get up out of bed."" Other days she can go about her day.“For going through what I've gone through, I try to stay positive. You know, try to have a positive outlook on what's happened and where my future's heading,” Zwerner said.Zwerner was hospitalized for nearly two weeks after being shot in the chest and left hand as she taught her class at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, Virginia. The shooting rattled the military shipbuilding community and sent shock waves around the country, with many wondering how a child so young could get access to a gun and shoot his teacher.In the moments after she was shot, Zwerner said the other first-graders in her class were screaming.She was terrified. But her concern centered on the children — “I just wanted to get my babies out of there.""“I think they knew as well that they had to get out of there,"" Zwerner said. ""But they were extremely frightened and screaming.”What happened next is still kind of a blur. Zwerner got the kids out of the classroom.She knew she needed help. The fire alarm had gone off, heightening her awareness that she'd been shot.She had trouble breathing. Her vision failed.“I went to the office and I just passed out,” Zwerner said. “I thought I had died.”Zwerner didn't know it at the time, but her lung had collapsed. Doctors said the bullet could have killed her. She likely survived because she had put up her hands.“The initial gunshot went through my left hand and ruptured the middle bone as well as the index finger and the thumb,” she said. “The gunshot then went into my chest up here, where it actually still remains. So I have the scar up here. And I still have some bullet fragments up here.”At the hospital, Zwerner called her mother “Mommy” for the first time in a long time. She lives with her twin sister, who's taken care of her since she returned home, from cooking meals to taking her to doctors appointments.She said the support from the outside world has been “overwhelming” and difficult to comprehend.“We have tons of handmade cards, hand-written cards with people’s stories,” Zwerner said.Zwerner believes she survived for a reason. If she could talk to her first-graders, she'd tell each one she loves them.“I’m very grateful that they’re all alive,” she said. “And they’re safe, and they’re healthy. And I just miss them dearly.”Zwerner told Guthrie the bullet wounds have scarred over. But she said they're still a reminder that, “Hey, this happened to you. This is what your body's been through.”Zwerner intends to sue the district, according to a legal notice filed by her attorney.Michelle Price, a spokeswoman for Newport News Public Schools, said in a statement that officials could not comment on Zwerner's NBC interview, ""but we appreciate her sharing her story.”“As a school community, we continue to recover and support one another after the terrible event of January 6 at Richneck Elementary School,” the statement said. “We have also been working in partnership with our community to address safety and security throughout the division ... (T)he safety and wellbeing of our students and staff is our most important priority.”Earlier this month, top Newport News prosecutor Howard Gwynn said his office will not criminally charge the boy because he wouldn’t understand the legal system and what a charge means. Gwynn has yet to decide if any adults will be charged.The boy had fired his mother's gun, which police said was legally purchased. An attorney for the boy’s family has said that the firearm was secured on a closet shelf and had a lock on it.During Tuesday's interview, Guthrie asked Zwerner what justice would mean for her.“That's a tough question to answer,” the teacher said.____For more coverage of the shooting: https://apnews.com/hub/newport-news",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842611,Drought in Spain's northeast empties reservoirs,"VILANOVA DE SAU, Spain (AP) — The medieval church of Sant Romà disappeared from view in the 1960s, when the town of Vilanova de Sau, an hour north of Barcelona, was flooded to create a reservoir.In the past three decades, its spectral belltower has broken the surface several times, serving as a punctual reminder of Spain’s fragile water resources.But today the church’s tower, its nave and the building’s foundations are all exposed. The bare, steep ridges of the Sau reservoir show how far its levels have receded, and the cracked earth around the remaining pool of water is trodden by tourists attracted by the ghost village’s reappearance.Drought in Spain’s northeast reached “exceptional” levels last month, menacing access to drinking water for 6 million people in the Barcelona metropolitan area.The Sau reservoir’s water levels now stand at 9% of total capacity, according to Catalan Water Agency data, so officials have taken the decision to remove its fish to stop them from asphyxiating. But the race against time to save them may already be lost, with many dead fish already floating on the surface.The remaining water in the basin is being diverted to another, fuller reservoir nearby to stop its quality deteriorating to the point of becoming undrinkable.Spain has officially entered a period of long-term drought, the country’s Aemet weather agency said last week, owing to high temperatures and low rainfall over the past three years.But in Catalonia, the situation is critical, as average reservoir levels hover around 27% of their capacity. There are restrictions on agricultural and industrial water use, and it is forbidden to use drinking water for washing cars or filling swimming pools.Meanwhile, Spain as a whole has warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2 Fahrenheit) since the 1960s, a phenomenon that is noticeable all year round but especially in summer — when average temperatures have risen by 1.6 degrees.",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842613,Cavinder twins reach March Madness Sweet 16 after transfer,"CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) — Women’s basketball practice at Miami had been over for 30 minutes. Most of the coaches were gone. Almost all the players were gone. The scoreboard had long been turned off.The Cavinder twins were still working.Haley and Hanna Cavinder made their way around the 3-point arc, one shooting, then the other, over and over with a couple male practice players rebounding. The guys didn’t have to do much, since most every shot went through the net with a soft swish.“What nobody knows about the twins,” Miami coach Katie Meier said, “is that they’re gym rats.”Sweet 16 bound gym rats, that is, after ninth-seeded Miami upset No. 1 seed Indiana in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Monday. The Hurricanes face No. 4 seed Villanova on Friday.The twins are major influencers with 4.4 million followers on TikTok alone, two of the bigger stars of the NIL era in college athletics, a pair of 22-year-olds who didn’t set out to get famous through short videos. They’re as serious about basketball as they are just about anything else, though that isn’t always noticed by those in the comment section.“I’m not going to sit here and say that it hasn’t frustrated me. It has,” said Haley Cavinder, the older twin by two minutes. “I feel like coming in, you have to prove that. But that comes with it. I think people will paint you how they want to paint you. And if I’m known as an influencer and being successful, then that’s fine with me.”Haley Cavinder leads the Hurricanes in scoring, averaging 12.6 points per game. Hanna Cavinder plays off the bench, averaging 4.0 points and is fourth on the team in 3-pointers made.They came to Miami after playing three seasons at Fresno State, making the decision to transfer last spring with the goal of making the NCAA Tournament. When the NIL era started on July 1, 2021, and NCAA rules began allowing athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness, the Cavinders were among the first stars: Boost Mobile signed them immediately, touting the deal with a giant advertisement in New York’s Times Square, and many other deals followed.Put bluntly, they were millionaires before coming to Miami. Success had already found them, and would have kept finding them no matter where they played. And they freely acknowledge that Miami had obvious advantages when they were transferring: phenomenal weather, family ties to the area and they immediately loved the campus.“I’m not going to sit here and lie. Haley and I were perfectly fine at Fresno with NIL,” Hanna Cavinder said. “Perfectly fine. I didn’t transfer for NIL. We didn’t need to. I’m just going to put that out there and I’m trying to say that in the most humble way possible. Does the marketplace in Miami help? Yes. I’m not going to sit here and deny that either. I’m not stupid. But at the end of the day, I came here for basketball, came here to play on Saturday and be in March Madness. That was our goal. That’s why we trained so hard in the gym.""The year at Miami has not always been easy.Their recruitment was instantly scrutinized and led to Meier missing the first three games of this season through a university-imposed suspension that was handed down in anticipation of NCAA sanctions. Last month, Miami was placed one year of probation after the school and the NCAA agreed that coaches arranged impermissible contact between a booster and the Cavinders.The twins did nothing wrong. Their eligibility was not jeopardized. But they were in the headlines anyway.“I was in archaeology class and got a nice notification (on Twitter),” Haley Cavinder said. “I try not to react based off of emotion. We both knew we never did anything wrong. In that instance, when that happened, I was like, ‘Here we go.’”Added Hanna Cavinder: “If you really know what happened and you actually read different articles and understand the basketball world, nothing was done that was wrong. It’s right there in front of you. But it’s the people that don’t really understand and just see the story and it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re in trouble.’”After the NCAA ruling, the Cavinders responded — fittingly — on TikTok with a 15-second statement that asked “dear NCAA, scared that female athletes have value?”It got 2.2 million views and more than 100,000 likes. That’s an average day for the twins: Their TikToks alone have been liked more than 130 million times.“The thing is, NIL, it’s a controversial topic to begin with,” Haley Cavinder said. “It’s new. A lot of people don’t understand it. A lot of older people don’t understand it. So with that, there’s already opinions. Hanna and I are trailblazers of it and that’s what comes with it.”Their rise to fame started during the pandemic, out of boredom. Their TikTok videos, mostly dancing, went viral. They became stars, the timing was right with NIL about to happen, and they've reaped the benefits.What makes Meier and teammates appreciate them is the work. They might have photo shoots or interviews or other responsibilities outside of class, but basketball never gets cheated. Haley has the better stats on the court; “nobody will outwork her,” Hanna said. And Hanna has the better mindset when it comes to taking advantage of the 24 hours in a day; “it’s like she’s my manager. My twinager,” Haley said.They have been inseparable. That may soon end in the basketball sense. Haley Cavinder will play at Miami next season and take advantage of an extra year of eligibility; Hanna Cavinder isn’t sure if she will continue playing.“There’s nobody closer to me than Haley in the world,” Hanna Cavinder said. ""I love basketball. I ride or die basketball. I’ve given basketball so much of my life. And sometimes I’m like, I just want to breathe. I have to go back and weigh out my pros and cons.”No matter what happens with basketball, the TikToks will continue. Their work together will continue. Their shared entrepreneurship will continue.“I’m going to do what’s best for me,” Haley Cavinder said, “and I want what’s best for her.”And with that, they were off. The Sweet 16 awaits. The Cavinder twins have more work to do.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842614,Europe's top teams get ready to start Euro 2024 qualifying,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Three months after the World Cup ended, qualifying for the next European Championship starts this week with several of the biggest teams looking to rebound.France came within a penalty shootout of winning back-to-back World Cup titles, losing to Argentina in the final, but Spain, Germany and Italy all went through humbling experiences either before or during last year's tournament in Qatar.Spain has not won a major tournament since Euro 2012. While it reached the semifinals at Euro 2020, elimination in the round of 16 at the World Cup was a setback for a promising new generation of players.Germany's decline since winning the World Cup in 2014 continued after being knocked out in the group stage last year — for the second straight World Cup.And defending European champion Italy didn't even qualify for the tournament in Qatar.Elsewhere, Belgium went into the tournament as the second-ranked FIFA team but couldn't make it out of the group stage; Portugal's young team reached the quarterfinals but was eliminated by Morocco in what was likely Cristiano Ronaldo's last World Cup; and Euro 2020 finalist England endured its earliest elimination under coach Gareth Southgate after losing to France in the quarterfinals.ONE LAST CHANCE?Southgate said he needed time to consider his future after losing to France, but quickly decided to stay. With his contract up in December 2024, it's possible that next year's European tournament could be his last as England coach.Despite the early exit in Qatar, there were encouraging performances for England, including the manner in which the team dominated large spells even in the loss to France.Expect Jude Bellingham to emerge as the central figure. Marcus Rashford is injured for upcoming games against Italy and Ukraine, but is having the best season of his career.SHINING STARSBarcelona is back at the top of the Spanish league and Real Madrid is still the team to beat in the Champions League. But the national team's troubles go on.It has been a humbling period for a country that won back-to-back European Championships in 2008 and 2012, with the 2010 World Cup title in between.The loss to Morocco in the round of 16 in in Qatar came despite widespread hope that Barcelona midfield pair Gavi and Pedri could lead a new era of success.Spain's hopes of getting off to a winning start against Norway on Saturday in coach Luis de la Fuente's first match have been aided by Erling Haaland's withdrawal from his national squad because of injury.ITALY'S COMEBACKOne moment, Italy coach Roberto Mancini is leading his nation to the European Championship title. The next, he's enduring the humiliation of failing to qualify for the World Cup.He has a chance to start redeeming himself on Thursday against England, the team Italy defeated on penalties in the Euro 2020 final at Wembley Stadium.After failing to qualify for the last two World Cups, it's hard to know what to expect from Italy. But based on recent years, it's unlikely to be boring.MARTINEZ IS BACKAfter leading Belgium's golden generation, Roberto Martinez now gets to take over an exciting Portugal squad.While Ronaldo is in the twilight of his career at the age of 38 and playing his club soccer in Saudi Arabia, Martinez has a host of stars to pick from, including Bernardo Silva, Bruno Fernandes, Joao Felix and Diogo Jota.He didn't win a major trophy with Belgium, but he could have the tools to lead Portugal to success, starting with matches against Liechtenstein and Luxembourg.BACK TO BASICSGermany coach Hansi Flick suggested the national team needed a rethink after early elimination from the World Cup.“For years we are talking about new goalkeepers and wingbacks, but Germany was always able to defend well. We need the basics,” Flick said in Qatar.With Germany hosting next year's European Championship, it will have to prepare for the tournament without competitive action. But that also gives Flick the chance to experiment.He has picked five new players for the friendlies against Peru and Belgium.MBAPPE'S MISSIONNot even a hat trick from Kylian Mbappe could stop Lionel Messi from winning the one major trophy that had eluded the Argentina great. But even in defeat in the World Cup final, Mbappe proved he is the next soccer great.The Paris Saint-Germain striker could make up for the disappointment of losing in Qatar by leading his team to the European title in Germany.France will face the Netherlands and Ireland.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842615,"Ibrahimovic back with Sweden, not thinking about Euro 2024","STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) — Retirement didn’t enter the thoughts of Zlatan Ibrahimovic while he was sidelined for eight months with a swollen left knee following surgery.But his condition certainly had the Swedish soccer great worried.“I didn’t come into a situation where I said, ‘Stop,’” Ibrahimovic said Tuesday. “I was more (thinking) it was hopeless. Whatever I did, I didn’t get positive feedback. I tried everything.”Indeed, the AC Milan striker’s main priority quickly became simply getting back to normal health, rather than to a level required to maintain his trophy-laden soccer career.That Ibrahimovic is back and in a position, at the age of 41, to play for his country in a European Championship qualifier is testament to his self-belief and resilience.On Saturday, he became the oldest scorer in Serie A history and now he’s hoping to be picked for Sweden's match against Belgium on Friday for his first national team appearance in nearly a year.“I’m not there (at Milan) or here for charity,” Ibrahimovic said at a news conference at Sweden’s training base. “I’m here to play my game, to provide, and bring results through my performances.“So hopefully I can continue to do that, and at the same time feel healthy.”Given Ibrahimovic’s recent period of inactivity — the game against Udinese over the weekend marked his first start since January of last year, having had his knee operation in May — he is not prepared to discuss how long he has left in his playing career.He certainly isn’t thinking about Euro 2024 in Germany.“I take it day by day,” Ibrahimovic said. “If I feel good and I’m selected by the coach, I will help him, the team and the country to do my best.“I think at my age, you do not think future. You think present. Even if I am the past, present and the future.”Sweden also plays Azerbaijan in qualifying during the international break and Ibrahimovic, the country’s all-time leading scorer and possibly its greatest ever player, is unlikely to start for the team. He sees himself nowadays more as a mentor to the younger players in the squad.“I said yesterday, ‘I’m sure you’re wondering what I’m doing here. I’m sure you think I’m stupid,’” Ibrahimovic said about his arrival in the Sweden camp. “But I said wait until you get close to the end, then you will understand all the things I do. There’s some kind of panic that you want it to continue.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842616,Questions over top Polish politician's absence from campaign,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The absence of Poland’s top politician, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, from early electoral campaigning has raised questions about the health of the 73-year-old leader of the ruling party.Kaczynski, who was touring Poland last fall and meeting with potential voters, has not returned to campaigning after December knee surgery.He was expected back on tour in early February, but now some party members are saying it will be mid-April. Poland is to hold a general election in the fall.The Onet.pl portal Tuesday cited Kaczynski aides as saying he developed sepsis after the surgery which undercut his energy.Kaczynski is Poland’s policy maker and most powerful politician, despite holding no government office. He is the founder and leader of the right-wing Law and Justice party that has ruled since 2015, with small coalition partners.His twin brother, President Lech Kaczynski, was killed in a plane crash in Russia in 2010.",2023/03/21,,World

Thrilled to be here,” said the 18-time Grand Slam singles champion and member of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. “So happy to be working. How many people can say that?”The 66-year-old Navratilova said her sense of taste disappeared during the treatment for cancer and she lost 15 pounds. She did not appear on television during the Australian Open in January or the BNP Paribas Open this month.“It puts you face-to-face with your mortality, No. 1, because at the beginning, I wasn’t sure if it was treatable, so that was hard,” she said, wiping away tears. “But once I got into the program, it was a little easier emotionally, but more difficult physically. ... But I’m still standing.”In an interview with TalkTV's Piers Morgan shown later Tuesday, Navratilova said she has been told by doctors that, “as far as they know, I’m cancer-free,” and she should be “good to go” after some additional radiation treatment.“I definitely won’t be missing any of my checkups. I will be very, very diligent about it. But the prognosis is excellent,” Navratilova said. ""But you never know. Just, like, you never know.”She also told Morgan that when she was diagnosed, “I was in a total panic for three days, thinking I may not see next Christmas"" and came up with a bucket list of things she wanted to do.She noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck while attending the season-ending WTA Finals in Fort Worth, Texas, in November, and a biopsy showed early stage throat cancer. While Navratilova was undergoing tests on her throat, she said, the unrelated, early stage breast cancer was discovered.Navratilova was diagnosed with a noninvasive form of breast cancer in 2010 and had a lumpectomy.She won 59 Grand Slam titles overall, including 31 in women’s doubles and 10 in mixed doubles. The last was a mixed doubles championship with Bob Bryan at the 2006 U.S. Open, a month shy of her 50th birthday.Navratilova originally retired in 1994, after a record 167 singles titles and 331 weeks at No. 1 in the WTA rankings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842618,London police chief 'humbled' by withering report on force,"LONDON (AP) — London’s police force has lost the confidence of the people it serves because it is riven with institutional racism, misogyny and homophobia and doesn’t do enough to weed out bad officers, according to a withering report commissioned after a young woman was raped and killed by a serving officer.The Metropolitan Police Service, which has more than 34,000 officers and is Britain’s biggest police force, must “change itself” or face being broken up after failing to address these longstanding problems for more than two decades, investigators said in the report published Tuesday.“It is not our job as the public to keep ourselves safe from the police. It is the police’s job to keep us safe as the public,’’ said Louise Casey, an expert on victims’ rights and social welfare who led the inquiry. “Far too many Londoners have now lost faith in policing to do that.”Deep-seated bias, poor management and budget cuts mean that crimes against women and girls are poorly investigated, ethnic minority communities are over-policed and trust in the police is plummeting among LGBTQ people, the report found. These issues have been allowed to fester because whistle-blowers are ostracized, outside criticism is ignored and too many bad officers have been allowed to remain on the job, even after they’ve been charged with domestic abuse or harassing their colleagues.While the findings echo the critique of big city police departments in the U.S. and other countries following the Black Lives Matter movement, they are especially damaging in Britain, where law enforcement is based on the concept of “policing by consent.” This means most officers don’t carry guns and they rely on the public to accept their presence in the community in return for the assurance that police will keep them safe.The need to reverse the situation is so urgent that the Met’s top leadership welcomed the report and said it would be a catalyst for change.Mark Rowley, who heads the department, said one couldn’t read the report and not be “upset, embarrassed and humbled.” Rowley was named commissioner six months ago after his predecessor was forced to resign after Mayor Sadiq Khan said he had lost confidence in her ability to lead the department.“I absolutely accept the diagnosis that Louise Casey comes up with. We have racists, misogynists and homophobes in the organization,″ Rowley told Sky News. “And it’s not just about individuals. We have systemic failings, management failings and cultural failings.”The Casey review was commissioned after a serving officer raped and killed Sarah Everard, a young marketing executive, as she walked home from a friend’s house in March 2021. But the department was recently hit with another scandal after another officer pled guilty to 48 rapes and dozens of other serious crimes committed over a 17-year period.While Casey makes clear that the majority of officers do their jobs with integrity, she said good officers have been let down by the department’s defensive attitude. That has meant that the failings of corrupt officers are too often blamed on “bad apples,” missing the opportunity for the type of systemic change needed to reform the department, she said.The Met must implement recruitment, training and disciplinary policies that attract good officers interested in serving their communities and weed out “predators and bullies” who want to use their power to cause harm, Casey said.“In the absence of vigilance towards those who intend to abuse the office of constable, predatory and unacceptable behavior has been allowed to flourish,” she said in the report. “There are too many places for people to hide.”Casey also highlighted central government austerity that has cut real term funding for the Met by 18% over the past decade. The department lost a fifth of its civilian staff and closed 126 police stations during the same period, effectively doing away with the concept of community policing, she said.Underlying all of the problems is the way the force is managed, not its size, the inquiry found.Casey likened the force’s efforts to reform to “climbing Everest in their flip-flops,’′ she told the BBC. “We need to get them climbing Everest in their boots.”Everard’s murder two years ago prompted a national outcry as women shared their experiences of being threatened or attacked on the streets of London.When hundreds gathered at Clapham Common in south London to draw attention to the violence women face every day, police broke up the rally, saying it was a violation of COVID-19 lockdown rules. Video posted on social media showed male officers grabbing hold of several women and pulling them away in handcuffs to screams and shouts from onlookers.But the Everard case was just one in a series of recent scandals that have hit the Met in recent years.In December 2021, two officers were jailed for taking and sharing photos of the bodies of two Black women after they were dispatched to guard the scene where the women had been slain.The Met was also accused of homophobia over its failure to stop serial killer Stephen Port, who murdered four young men over a 15-month period in 2014 and 2015.Detectives didn’t initially link the victims, all gay men in their 20s whose bodies were found near Port’s home in east London. They only began investigating the deaths as potential homicides after the family of the final victim pressed for action.Casey’s review found that the department hasn’t treated violence against women and girls as seriously as other forms of violence.The 363-page report also painted an alarming picture of how crimes against women and children are investigated due to a shortage of funding and a lack of specialized officers trained to handle these cases.Officers investigating these crimes are forced to store rape samples in “over-stuffed, dilapidated or broken fridges and freezers,” because they don’t have access to fast-track forensic services, investigators found.A lunchbox in one of these refrigerators contaminated the evidence. Another appliance broke down last summer, meaning the evidence was damaged and couldn’t be used in court.But the problems extend beyond the treatment of women and girls.Twenty-four years after another inquiry found that institutional racism was a key factor the Met’s failure to investigate the killing of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, Casey highlighted the fact that the department is still disproportionately white and male.About 17% of London police officers are Black, Asian or mixed race, compared with about 10% a decade ago, according to the latest department statistics. Women account for almost 31% of police officers, up from almost 25% in 2013.Some 46% of London’s population is non-white, according to the 2021 census.The report also found widespread bullying in the department, with one in five staff members that have protected characteristics — such as race, sexuality or disability — being victims.Officers who gave evidence to the inquiry told of a Sikh officer whose beard was cut off because his colleagues thought it was funny and a Muslim officer who found bacon stuffed into his boots inside his locker.“To deliver the police service London needs, the Met also needs to ensure it can recruit and retain the most talented officers and staff from all backgrounds,” the report said. “People are unlikely to join the Met if they think they will face discrimination at work.”",2023/03/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842646,Google's artificially intelligent 'Bard' set for next stage,"Google announced Tuesday it's allowing more people to interact with “ Bard,” the artificially intelligent chatbot the company is building to counter Microsoft's early lead in a pivotal battleground of technology.In Bard's next stage, Google is opening a waitlist to use an AI tool that's similar to the ChatGPT technology Microsoft began deploying in its Bing search engine to much fanfare last month. And last week, Microsoft embedded more AI-powered technology in its word processing, spreadsheet and slide presentation programs with a new feature called Copilot.Until now, Bard had only been available to a small group of “trusted testers” hand-picked by Google. The Mountain View, California, company, which is owned by Alphabet Inc., isn't saying how many people will be given access to Bard in the next step of the technology's development. Initial applicants will be limited to the U.S. and the U.K. before Google offers Bard in more countries.Google is treading carefully with the rollout of its AI tools, in part because it has more to lose if the technology spits out inaccurate information or takes its users down dark corridors. That's because Google's dominant search engine has become a de facto gateway to the internet for billions of people, raising the risk of a massive backlash that could tarnish its image and undercut its ad-driven business if the technology behaves badly.Despite the technology's pitfalls, Bard still offers “incredible benefits” such as “jumpstarting human productivity, creativity and curiosity,” Google said in a blog post that two of its vice presidents — Sissie Hsiao and Eli Collins — wrote with assistance from Bard.As a precautionary measure, Google is limiting the amount of interaction that can occur between Bard and its users — a tactic Microsoft has imposed with ChatGPT after media coverage detailed instances when the technology likened an Associated Press reporter to Hitler and tried to persuade a New York Times reporter to divorce his wife.Google also is providing access to Bard through a separate site from its search engine, which serves as the foundation for the digital ads that generate most of its profits. In a tacit acknowledgement that Bard may be prone to straying into manufacturing falsehoods, which are being called “hallucinations” in technology circles, Google is providing a query box connected to its search engine to make it easier for users to check on the accuracy of the information being displayed by the AI.Bard made an embarrassing blunder shortly after Google unveiled the tool by prominently displaying a wrong answer about a scientific milestone during a presentation that was supposed to show how smart the technology could be. The gaffe contributed to a nearly 8% drop in Alphabet's stock in a single day, wiping out about $100 billion in shareholder wealth and underscoring how closely investors are watching how Google handles the transition to AI.",2023/03/22,1910,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842647,MacKenzie Scott sets new 'open call' to donate $250 million,"MacKenzie Scott is launching a $250 million “open call” for community-focused nonprofits that the billionaire philanthropist can fund.Through her organization Yield Giving, Scott plans to make unrestricted $1 million donations to 250 nonprofits selected in the process, which she calls a “new pathway to support for organizations making positive change in their communities.” To apply, the nonprofits must have annual operating budgets larger than $1 million, but less than $5 million for at least two of the past five years.“Teams on the front lines of challenges have insights no one else can offer,” Scott said in a statement. “So there are three big headlines here in my heart: Community changemakers can nominate themselves. Community changemakers get feedback from their peers. Community changemakers have a powerful role in funding decisions.”The open call marks the first time nonprofits can reach out to Scott for potential funding. Until now, Scott and her team secretly contacted organizations they were interested in funding first, then offered them unrestricted donations after receiving information about the group’s work and financials.Since 2019, when she pledged to donate the majority of her wealth, Scott has given more than $14 billion in unrestricted funds to 1,600 nonprofit organizations. According to Forbes, Scott is currently worth more than $26 billion.Scott said in a statement that she is excited to partner with nonprofit Lever for Change, which will manage the open call process to find community-focused organizations advancing people of modest means and groups who have met with discrimination and other systemic obstacles.“This open call is designed to empower and strengthen communities across the United States that are often overlooked,” said Cecilia Conrad, CEO of Lever for Change, an affiliate of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. “We are looking for organizations that are making a meaningful difference in people’s lives. The awards will recognize teams that demonstrate the potential to make progress toward reducing disparities in health, education, economic outcomes, and other critical issues.”Organizations need to register to apply before May 5 and complete their applications by June 12. The applications will be reviewed by peers, who will select up to 1,000 finalists in the fall. Those finalists will then be evaluated by a publicly named panel selected for their related experience. The 250 winners will be announced in early 2024.Scott does not discuss the reasons behind her philanthropy, beyond essays on her website. However, some experts have said the open call process is a continuation of her desire to change philanthropy.Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, said when Scott originally announced her open call plans in December that her approach says, “We as donors can yield to those talented people in nonprofits working closest to communities who know best what is needed and how to do it.” _____Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842648,US home sales surged in February as mortgage rates dipped,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes surged in February to the fastest pace in six months as homebuyers seized on a modest drop in mortgage rates. The nation’s median price also edged lower, its first annual drop since 2012.Existing home sales jumped 14.5% last month from January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.58 million, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. That’s the strongest sales pace since September and it's higher than the 4.2 million economists were expecting, according to FactSet.The surge in sales — the biggest on records going back to 1999 — ended a 12-month slide that knocked the nation's housing market into its deepest slump in nearly a decade and left sales in January at the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.Still, sales sank 22.6% last month from February last year, a sign many would-be homebuyers remain priced out of the market following years of price increases and sharply higher mortgage rates than a year ago.The average long-term rate on a 30-year mortgage reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall. Rates eased in December and January, and slipped to just above 6% in early February.“Conscious of changing mortgage rates, homebuyers are taking advantage of any rate declines,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist. “Moreover, we’re seeing stronger sales gains in areas where home prices are decreasing and the local economies are adding jobs.”The national median home price slipped 0.2% from February last year to $363,000, marking the first annual decline in 13 years, the NAR said.Yun has forecast that U.S. home prices will fall 2% this year, but acknowledged they could just as easily end up falling or rising 5%, depending on what happens with mortgage rates.“Home sales I think have already bottomed out; little unclear on the prices,” he said.The slight dip in prices is a good sign for buyers as the spring homebuying season ramps up, though affordability remains a formidable hurdle after years of soaring home values. The median U.S. home price is still up roughly 45% since February 2019, according to FactSet.First-time buyers accounted for 27% of the homes sold in last month, down from 31% in January.“Anything under 30% is not good news,” Yun said.Elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of a dollars a month in costs for homebuyers, on top of already high home prices, have kept many would-be buyers on the sidelines.The average rate on a 30-year home loan slipped to 6.60% last week, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year ago, the rate averaged 4.16%.Stronger-than-expected reports on the economy this year have fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve may have to keep pushing up its key borrowing rate to tame inflation as soon as Wednesday, when the central bank is due to wrap up its latest policy meeting.Investor expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can influence mortgage rates. Many economists expect at least three more increases before the end of the year, though some have dialed those expectations back due to the recently developing banking crisis.While there are more homes on the market than last year, the supply remains near historic lows, which is helping prop up home prices. The inventory of homes for sale was unchanged from January but rose 15.3% from February last year. Some 980,000 homes were on the market by the end of the month. That amounts to a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 5- to 6-month supply.One plus for homebuyers: Properties are staying on the market nearly twice as long as a year ago. On average, homes sold in 34 days of hitting the market in February. That’s up from 33 days in January and 18 days in February last year. Still, 57% of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month, the NAR said.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842649,Dutch gov't staff discouraged from apps such as TikTok,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The Netherlands is moving to stop central government employees having apps including popular video sharing service TikTok installed on their work phones, amid concerns over data security.Countries including the United States and Britain, as well as the European Union 's executive branch, have banned the use of TikTok on government staff phones over fears that its Chinese owner, ByteDance, could share user data with the authoritarian government in Beijing.“For civil servants employed by the national government, it is immediately discouraged to have apps from countries with an offensive cyber program against the Netherlands and/or Dutch interests installed and used on their mobile work devices,"" the government said in a statement Tuesday that did not identify TikTok by name. The new policy came after lawmakers asked whether it was possible to ban central government staff from using the app on work devices.The advice follows an assessment by national intelligence agency AIVD that warned that apps from such countries — which include China, Russia, North Korea and Iran — “carry a heightened risk of espionage.”A law China implemented in 2017 requires companies to give the government any personal data relevant to the country’s national security. There’s no evidence that TikTok has turned over such data, but fears abound due to the vast amount of user data it collects.Alexandra van Huffelen, the Dutch minister for digitalization, said in a statement that the new policy “goes beyond discouraging one application. We opt for a structural solution that central government officials can trust in their work in a digital world.”The government said it is planning to move quickly to set up all mobile devices given to central government staff “in such a way that only pre-permitted apps, software and/or functionalities can be installed and used.”The decision comes two weeks after the Dutch government angered Beijing by announcing that it is planning on imposing additional restrictions on the export of machines that make advanced processor chips, joining a U.S. push that aims at limiting China’s access to materials used to make such chips.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842650,Putin hosts Xi in the Kremlin with imperial palace pageantry,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia and China showcased their “no-limits friendship” on Tuesday during a pomp-laden Kremlin ceremony intended to further cement ties amid the fighting in Ukraine.After hosting Chinese leader Xi Jinping over a seven-course private dinner for 4½ hours the previous night, Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted him in the old imperial palace for talks involving top officials from both countries.Xi walked slowly up the opulent red-carpeted staircase of the Grand Kremlin Palace as guards in 19th century-style parade uniforms snapped to attention.Putin was waiting to greet the Chinese leader in St. George's hall where walls are covered by white-marble plaques with gold engravings of the names of military units and soldiers awarded the order of St. George, a top military award established by Catherine the Great.In a tightly choreographed ceremony filled with imperial grandeur, the two leaders entered the huge chandeliered room from opposite sides and shook hands in the middle to the sound of the Russian and Chinese national anthems.They walked past a lineup of Russian and Chinese officials to sit down for talks. Putin and Xi both wore black suits and dark red ties.The pageantry reflected the importance of Xi's three-day visit to Russia that gave a strong political boost to Putin just days after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian leader on charges of alleged involvement in abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.Moscow, which doesn’t recognize the court’s jurisdiction, dismissed the move as “legally null and void,” but the arrest warrant further ramped up the pressure on the Russian leader as the fighting in Ukraine has dragged into a second year.After the talks, Putin and Xi issued joint declarations pledging to further bolster their “strategic cooperation,” develop cooperation in energy, high-tech industries and other spheres and expand the use of their currencies in mutual trade to reduce dependence on the West.They said they would develop military cooperation and conduct more joint sea and air patrols, but there was no mention of any prospective Chinese weapons supplies to Russia that the U.S. and other Western allies feared.Putin and Xi made long statements after the talks to a selected audience of officials and reporters from their pools. They didn't take questions.Putin hailed China's proposals for a political settlement and a cease-fire in Ukraine, saying that it could serve as a basis for a peaceful settlement “once the West and Kyiv are ready for it.” The U.S. has criticized Beijing's plan as a move intended to allow Russia to shore up its gains.Putin and Xi wrapped up the day with a state dinner in the 15th-century Palace of Facets that served as a banquet hall for the czars. They again exchanged pledges of expanding the countries' “comprehensive partnership” at a table next to a frescoed wall before the audience of top officials.Putin cited a long quote from China's classical Book of Changes about friendship capable of overcoming any obstacles that the interpreter failed to fully grasp. He raised a glass with a toast wishing good health to Xi and prosperity for the two countries and their peoples, ending it with ‘Ganbei,’ the Chinese equivalent of ‘cheers.’ Xi responded in kind.After hosting Xi in the Kremlin for six hours, Putin accompanied him down the grand staircase.“We are now witnessing the changes that haven't been seen for more than a century, and we are pushing them together,” Xi told Putin through an interpreter as they stood in the Kremlin's doorway. “Take care, dear friend!”They shook hands, and Putin stood on the pavement for a moment, waving his hand as Xi’s limo drove away.Before the Kremlin talks, Xi met with Russian Prime Minister Milkhail Mishustin. Unlike them, Russian and Chinese officials who attended the talks wore medical masks — a reminder of the COVID-19 pandemic that halted mutual visits.Xi briefly referred to it, telling Mishustin he was happy to be back in Moscow after a long break because of the pandemic. He said that he invited Putin over Monday's dinner to visit China later this year to attend a top-level meeting of China's Belt and Road regional initiative.Kremlin foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said Putin could make the trip but didn't give the date.Xi stayed at a brand-new Chinese-owned Soluxe Hotel set in a lavish riverside park in northern Moscow that features trees and plants from all over China. He used a Chinese-made Hongqi limousine for driving around Moscow.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842651,Russia targets Nobel Peace Prize rights group with raids,"TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Russian authorities on Tuesday raided the homes and offices of multiple human rights advocates and historians with the prominent rights group Memorial that won the Nobel Peace Prize last year.The wave of searches, after which police took Memorial activists in for questioning, is part of a steady and sweeping crackdown that the Kremlin has unleashed against dissent in recent years. It has intensified after Moscow invaded Ukraine more than a year ago.The group says the raids and the interrogations are connected to a criminal case that Russia's Investigative Committee launched against the activists earlier this month.The investigation was opened on the charges of rehabilitating Nazism, punishable by up to five years in prison.Memorial runs a database of victims of political repressions, and among the names are three people who were convicted in Soviet times over collaboration with Nazi Germany. The group said that authorities are using those names on the list in their case against Memorial.Oleg Orlov, the group's co-chair whose apartment was among those searched, called the allegations “idiotic"" in comments to reporters on Tuesday, before being hauled into a police precinct by a masked police officer in a bulletproof vest.Later on Tuesday Memorial reported that the authorities launched a separate criminal case against Orlov on charges of repeatedly discrediting the Russian army. It is a criminal offense under a new law that was adopted after Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 and is regularly used against Kremlin critics. Orlov faces up to three years in prison, if convicted.Memorial, one of the oldest and the most renowned Russian rights organizations, was awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize along with imprisoned Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski and the Ukrainian organization Center for Civil Liberties.Memorial was founded in the Soviet Union in 1987 to ensure the victims of communist repression would be remembered. It has continued to compile information on human rights abuses and track the fate of political prisoners in Russia while facing a relentless crackdown from the Kremlin in recent years.The group had been declared a “foreign agent,” a designation that brings additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations, and over the years was ordered to pay massive fines for alleged violations of the ”foreign agent"" law. Russia's Supreme Court ordered it shut down in December 2021, a move that sparked outcry in Russia and abroad.Tuesday's raids come after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the police to “harshly suppress any attempts of the adversaries and their agents on the territory of our country to rock our society.”The action against Memorial elicited outrage among Russian opposition figures. Dmitry Gudkov, a Russian opposition politician in exile, called it “an act of intimidation.”“You give them the Nobel Prize, we give them a criminal case,"" Gudkov wrote on Facebook.""Terror. The very terror, the memory of the victims of which is preserved by Memorial,” Gudkov said.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842652,Video shows Irvo Otieno pinned to floor before his death,"DINWIDDIE, Va. (AP) — A large group of sheriff's deputies and employees of a Virginia mental hospital pinned patient Irvo Otieno to the floor earlier this month until he was motionless and limp, then began unsuccessful resuscitation efforts, newly obtained surveillance video shows.The footage obtained Tuesday, which has no audio, shows various members of the group attempting to restrain a handcuffed and shackled Otieno for about 20 minutes after he's led into a room at Central State Hospital, where he was going to be admitted March 6. For most of that duration, the 28-year-old Black man is on the floor being held down by a fluctuating group that at one point appeared to reach 10 people.Seven deputies and three hospital workers have been charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death. Otenio's family said he was brutally mistreated, both at the state hospital and while in law enforcement custody in the preceding days. Attorneys for many of the defendants have said they will vigorously fight the charges.Relatives of Otieno were shown video from the hospital last week by a prosecutor, Dinwiddie Commonwealth's Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill, who said that she planned to publicly release it Tuesday.Attorneys for at least two of the defendants sought to block the video's release, arguing that it could hinder a fair trial. The Associated Press obtained it and other footage Tuesday through a link included in a public court filing made by Baskervill.According to timestamps in the footage, which was first reported by The Washington Post, an SUV carrying Otieno arrived at the hospital just before 4 p.m. By 4:19 p.m., a different camera shows him being forcibly led into a room with tables and chairs. He is quickly hauled toward a seat before eventually slumping to the floor, initially in a seated position then lying flat.As time passes, an increasing number of workers hold him down as he appears to start to move on the floor. Otieno’s shirtless body is obscured at times by those restraining him or standing in front of the camera.“He certainly did not deserve to be smothered to death, which is what happened,” Baskervill said in court Tuesday. The workers were holding him down “from his braids down to his toes,” she said.By the 4:39 p.m. timestamp, someone is taking Otieno's pulse and he appears unresponsive. Soon after, as Otieno's body lies still, someone appears to administer two injections. By 4:42 p.m., CPR appears to be underway. Life-saving efforts seem to go on for nearly an hour. At 5:48 p.m., Otieno's body is draped with a white sheet.Final autopsy findings have not yet been released, though Baskervill has said multiple times that Otieno died of asphyxiation. Defense attorneys have raised the possibility that the injections contributed to his death, though Baskervill disputed that Tuesday, saying he was already dead when the shots were administered.Baskervill's filing also included a link to audio from Dinwiddie County 911 calls. In one, a caller from the hospital requests an EMS team, saying Otieno, who had been “very aggressive,” stopped breathing during attempts to restrain him. Subsequent calls reflected impatience by hospital callers about the length of time that had passed without an EMS crew's arrival.On Tuesday, a grand jury in Dinwiddie County signed off on second-degree murder charges for all 10 defendants.“Those 10 monsters, those 10 criminals, I was happy to hear that they were indicted. And that is just the beginning step,” Otieno's mother, Caroline Ouko, said at a news conference Tuesday evening, vowing to fight for justice for her son.In court, a judge also granted bond for two of the deputies and one hospital employee after hearing arguments from Baskervill and their defense attorneys.Caleb Kershner, an attorney for Deputy Randy Boyer, said Otieno had been “somewhat combative” at the jail and hospital and that there was “significant need” to restrain him. Kershner said Boyer did not realize Otieno was in any danger as he was being restrained because Boyer was working near his legs.Jeff Everhart, an attorney for Deputy Brandon Rodgers, said his client had been trying to help by moving Otieno to his side. But Baskervill said the video shows Otieno was moved on his side only when someone from the hospital came in and gave that direction.The Associated Press sought comment about the video from defense attorneys for all the other defendants who have obtained counsel.Rhonda Quagliana, an attorney for one of the hospital employees, Sadarius Williams, said in an emailed statement that her client was innocent. She said he had only minimal physical contact with Otieno and did not apply lethal force during the incident.Douglas Ramseur, who represents another hospital employee, Wavie Jones, asked the judge Tuesday to implement a gag order in the case, arguing that the release of the video and subsequent media attention had damaged the defendants' ability to get a fair trial. The judge, who granted bond for Jones, declined to grant the order.Other defense attorneys did not respond to emails or phone calls.Last week, Otieno's family spoke at a news conference after seeing the footage, which they called heartbreaking and disturbing. They have equated his treatment to torture, and they and their attorneys reiterated a call at Tuesday night's news conference for the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the case.Mark Krudys, a family attorney, pushed back against what he said were “excuses” from defense attorneys about what happened at the hospital, including the assertion raised in court that Otieno had been combative.“He was just trying to breathe,” Krudys said. “That’s all he was trying to do.”The family is also being represented by Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights attorney who also represented the family of George Floyd.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842653,Protests in Lebanon as pound hits new low against dollar,"BEIRUT (AP) — Protesters closed down major roads in parts of Lebanon on Tuesday after the Lebanese pound briefly hit a new low amid a historic economic crisis that seemingly has no end in sight.The Lebanese pound lost more than 15% of its value on Tuesday alone, tanking to more than 140,000 pounds to the dollar. A week ago, the dollar was worth 100,000 pounds.The small nation is in the grips of the worst economic and financial crisis in its modern history rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by a political class that has ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.The political class has been resisting the implementation of reforms as demanded by the international community. Since the economic meltdown began in October 2019, three-quarters of Lebanon’s population of over 6 million, including a million Syrian refugees, now live in poverty and inflation is soaring.The official exchange rate is set by the central bank at 15,000 pounds for the U.S. dollar but the black market rate is now used for nearly all transactions.Later on Tuesday, the central bank said it will be selling the U.S. dollar for 90,000 pounds and called on banks to end their strike and take part in the sale. After the statement was issued, the pound regained some of its value selling for 110,000 pounds to the dollar.The Association of Banks in Lebanon announced Tuesday night that all lenders in the country will suspend the strike and resume work Wednesday.Last month, Lebanese commercial banks went on an open-ended strike after angry protesters smashed windows and set tires on fire outside two of the country’s biggest banks, both in Beirut.Many gas stations, which have been changing their fuel prices several times a day, closed Tuesday amid calls to price oil products in U.S. dollars. Some pharmacies also closed because of the constantly changing exchange rate.Around noon, angry protesters briefly closed roads in different parts of the country, including the main north-south highway, as well as others in Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.The crash of the pound comes days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk.“The situation is very bad especially with the rise of the dollar. You cannot buy anything here,"" said Beirut resident Essam Rayes about the rising prices of food products.The latest crash comes against the backdrop of an ongoing deadlock over the election of a new president, a post that has been vacant since the end of October. Lebanon is being run by a caretaker government.The striking banks reopened their doors in late February following caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati’s request to do so for people to retrieve their salaries. Last Tuesday, the banks shuttered their doors again and slammed Lebanon’s judiciary for not “correcting flaws” in recent lawsuits against them.Lebanon has also stalled on implementing broad reforms agreed to with the International Monetary Fund to enable access to $3 billion in a bailout package and unlock funds in development aid to make the economy viable again.",2023/03/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842654,Column: Memories abound from 20-plus years of Match Play,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The end of the World Golf Championships was a matter of time, especially with the arrival next year of smaller fields and enormous prize money for the elite players.What stings is losing the Match Play.The tournament began in 1999 at La Costa in California. If that seems like a long time ago, consider that Tiger Woods had only one major when he beat six-time major champion Nick Faldo in the opening round. “I'm not going to feel sorry for him. He's had his chances to win tournaments,” Woods said. He was 23 and already ruthless.The final version takes place this week at Austin Country Club. It has moved to five other courses and the format has switched from single elimination to group play. What hasn't changed are memories that have left a mark on the most fickle event in golf.___Gene Sarazen was 97 and watching from his home in Florida when Jeff Maggert won the inaugural event in 38 holes. It reminded Sarazen of his 1923 PGA Championship win over Walter Hagen.""I went 38 holes with Hagen, just like Jeff Maggert went 38 holes with ... what was the name of the player he beat?” he asked.The Squire could remember details from a match 76 years earlier, but he couldn't remember the previous day's runner-up. That was Andrew Magee. And it was the first indication the Match Play rarely went according to plan.The seeds of the first four champions sounded like a lottery drawing: 24, 19, 55, 62.___Stephen Ames had his clubs shipped to Tucson, Arizona, for an opposite-field event in 2006, but then he got into the Match Play when Thomas Bjorn withdrew. He was on the range at La Costa with a set of backup clubs when two reporters approached and asked him about having to play Woods, the No. 1 seed, in the opening round.“Anything can happen, especially where he’s hitting the ball,"" Ames said with a smile. He quickly pointed at the reporters to make clear he was joking, yet sensing this was not going to be received very well.Ames was on the receiving end two days later. Woods beat him, 9 and 8.___Match Play moved to Dove Mountain in the high desert of Arizona the following year. Ames, the No. 39 seed in 2007, played Robert Karlsson in the first round. He beat the Swede so badly that Ames didn't realize the match was over when he chipped in for birdie on the 11th.One year after losing in 10 holes, Ames won 8 and 7. Funny game.Most telling was the phone call to his wife. She was surprised to hear from him so soon and wanted to know if he was able to catch a flight home that night.“I won't be coming home tonight,” he told her.___Match Play went Down Under in 2001 to Metropolitan Golf Club in Melbourne, a course Stuart Appleby referred to as “Augusta without the makeup.” The trouble was the timing.It started Jan. 3 and with single elimination, not everyone was keen to fly 20-plus hours for the possibility of one match. The 64-man field had to go to No. 104 in the world ranking to fill the field.The biggest star was Ernie Els, and he didn't show up until the sun began to set on the eve of the first round. Wearing shorts and beach sandals, Els popped open a Heineken and drove a few holes in a cart. The next morning, he played 16 holes, a practice round ahead of the first match (that's allowed in match play). Maybe the Big Easy knew something. He beat Greg Kraft in 16 holes, and eventually made it all the way to the semifinals.Of the 34 Americans in the field, only a dozen survived the first round. The others faced a long trip home.___The bracket in the single elimination era, and the time of the year, made Match Play feel like March Madness with one big exception. This level of golf, over 18 holes, there's really no such thing as an upset. That's not to suggest players aren't upset.Pat Perez comes to mind, a player whose emotions can run hot. He made his debut in 2008 and lost in the first round to Phil Mickelson. Scott Crockett, an esteemed media official for the European Tour, offered to get a quick word from Perez on his experience.He returned a very short time later and recorded only three words from Perez.“And I can't use two of them,” he said.___Woods holds the record for most titles (3) and most matches won (36). The best winning percentage belongs to Geoff Ogilvy, who was 20-5 in seven appearances.It didn't start out that easily. Ogilvy won in his debut at La Costa in 2006, but not before having to watch 10 times as an opponent had a putt to win the match. “No one made one, which is pretty fortunate,” he said.___Rory McIlroy was hopeful of a quick knockout in his quarterfinal match at Harding Park in 2015 against Paul Casey. Why the rush? He had arrangements for a quick flight to Las Vegas to watch the Manny Pacquiao-Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight at the MGM.Instead, darkness kept them from finishing.The fight was shown in the press center, and only when reporters looked up from their laptops did they realize McIlroy was sitting there with them.He finished off Casey the next morning, beat Jim Furyk in the semifinals and then won his only Match Play by taking down Gary Woodland.___Woods has left his prints all over the Match Play. He will not be around for the finale, denying this format what would have been the most curious sight of all.Woods has lost in the first, second and third rounds. He has lost in the quarterfinals. He lost in the championship match to Darren Clarke in 2000. But he never lost in the semifinals, meaning he never had to play a consolation match.One can only imagine the size of the gallery watching him in the consolation match instead of the final match, much less how television would have handled it.___For all the amazing shots in Match Play, the best came from the guy who didn't win.Victor Dubuisson of France was in extra holes with Jason Day at Dove Mountain in 2014 when he somehow slashed his golf ball out of a cactus and a desert bush — not just once, but twice — to stay in the match before losing on the 23rd hole.He went 2-0-1 in the Ryder Cup later that year. He now is No. 433 in the world. But he will always be linked with the Match Play, even when it is no longer around.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842655,Tom Hanks named Harvard's 2023 commencement speaker,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) — Two-time Academy Award winning actor Tom Hanks was named the principal speaker at Harvard's commencement on May 25, the Ivy League university announced Tuesday.Hanks, 66, has appeared in almost 100 films. Nominated for an Oscar six times, he won best actor for “Philadelphia” in 1993 and “Forrest Gump” the following year.Harvard President Lawrence Bacow called Hanks “a true master of his craft.”“In addition to his brilliance as an actor, Tom has demonstrated both an innate empathy and a deep understanding of the human condition,” Bacow said in a statement. “He has contributed to our national culture and expanded our ability to appreciate stories and histories that have been previously unexamined.”Recent Harvard commencement speakers included former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, late civil rights activist and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.A comedic actor early in his career, Hanks transitioned seamlessly to dramatic roles, from his breakout performance in 1988's comedy “Big” to “Saving Private Ryan,” “Apollo 13,” and “Captain Phillips.” He voiced the character Woody in the “Toy Story” animated films and voiced several characters in 2004's “The Polar Express” animated film.He produced several projects exploring U.S. history including “Band of Brothers,” “The Pacific,” and “John Adams.”He's also known for his philanthropic work and advocacy, raising support for the national World War II Memorial in Washington and serving as campaign chair for Hidden Heroes, increasing awareness around issues faced by caregivers who work with veterans.Following his performance in “Philadelphia” as a lawyer with AIDS, Hanks became an advocate for AIDS awareness and supporter of The Foundation for AIDS Research and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.His other accolades include the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award and the American Film Institute’s Lifetime Achievement Award, and a Kennedy Center Honor in 2014. President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.",2023/03/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4842656,Kenya police say 1 killed in opposition-led protests,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyan police said Tuesday that one person died, 31 officers were injured and more than 200 protesters were arrested in anti-government protests led by opposition leader Raila Odinga the previous day.Odinga announced that the protests will be held twice a week — Mondays and Thursdays — starting next week.The opposition led thousands of Kenyans in protests on Monday calling for President William Ruto’s resignation and decrying the rising cost of living. A university student was killed in western Kenya after police used live bullets because they had run out of rubber bullets, according to a police report.The police inspector general, Japhet Koome, said Tuesday that 238 people were arrested in protests in the western city of Kisumu, which is an Odinga stronghold, and the capital, Nairobi.Monday’s protests turned violent as police used tear gas, water cannons and in some incidents fired live ammunition to disperse protesters, who responded by pelting them with stones.Odinga said that his car was shot at by the police and his party spokesperson shared a photo of a shattered windshield online.A civil society group condemned the police for the use of force, intimidation and arbitrary arrests.The Independent Medico-Legal Unit said that four protesters died and 50 others were injured.Kenya has in the past seen a series of violent protests that have ended in the loss of lives.The government is insisting that Monday’s protests were illegal since permission was denied to hold them. But the opposition says the constitution provides a right to peaceful protests and police are only notified in order to provide security.Kenya’s deputy president, Rigathi Gachagua, said the country lost about 2 billion Kenya shillings ($15 million) because of Monday’s protests. Gachagua urged Odinga to call off the demonstrations and think about the losses to the economy.Odinga has remained adamant and says protests will continue until the cost of living goes down.",2023/03/21,,World
