https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798699,Lawyer: Principal unaware boy had gun before teacher shot,"The former principal of the Virginia elementary school where a 6-year-old shot his teacher was not aware of reports that the student had a gun before the shooting occurred, her lawyer said Thursday.

            Briana Foster Newton was principal at Richneck Elementary in Newport News last month when first-grade teacher Abby Zwerner was shot and wounded in her classroom. 

            “It continues to be reported that unidentified school administrators were aware that the 6-year-old student had a gun at school on January 6 and simply failed to act,” attorney Pamela Branch said during a news conference in Richmond, Virginia. 











            “Mrs. Newton has been assumed to have been one of those administrators,"" Branch said. ""However, this is far from the truth. The fact of the matter is that those who were aware that the student may have had a gun on the premises that day did not report this to Mrs. Newton at all.” 

            Branch provided the first public statement from Newton since the shooting occurred and sought to clarify Newton's role in an incident that has drawn mounting criticism of the school's administrators.

            Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew has repeatedly characterized the shooting as “intentional.” He said there was no warning and no struggle before the child pointed the gun at Zwerner and fired one round, striking her in the hand and chest inside her classroom. 

            Zwerner, 25, hustled her students out of the classroom before being rushed to the hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks. 

            Diane Toscano, Zwerner’s lawyer, said last month that concerned staff at Richneck warned administrators three times that the boy had a gun and was threatening other students, but that no one called police, removed the boy from class or locked down the school before the shooting occurred.

            Toscano said she has notified the school board that Zwerner intends to sue the school district.

            Then-Superintendent George Parker III took the brunt of criticism from outraged parents and teachers. Before the school board fired him last month, Parker said at least one administrator at Richneck received a tip that the boy may have taken a weapon to school. Parker said the boy’s backpack was searched but that no weapon was found.

            Newton is no longer listed as the principal on the school’s website. Michelle Price, a spokesperson for the school district, said last month that Newton is still employed by the district, but she did not say what position Newton now holds.

            Assistant Principal Ebony Parker has resigned from the school division, Price said.

            Karen Lynch, who has worked as a principal in Newport News for 17 years, is now listed as the school’s administrator. In a letter to Richneck families this week, Lynch said she was working “on special assignment” at Richneck.

            The boy’s family has also retained an attorney. Police have said the 9 mm handgun used in the shooting was legally purchased by the boy’s mother. The family has said the gun had been “secured.” Their attorney, James Ellenson, told The Associated Press in January that his understanding was that the gun was in the woman’s closet on a shelf well over 6 feet (1.8 meters) high and had a trigger lock that required a key.

            The family also said the boy has an “acute disability” and was under a care plan “that included his mother or father attending school with him and accompanying him to class every day.” The week of the shooting was the first when a parent was not in class with him, the family said.

            Richneck resumed class on Monday, a full three weeks after the shooting occurred.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798700,US releases Guantanamo prisoner once tortured at CIA sites,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military officials said Thursday they have freed and sent to Central America a onetime al-Qaida money courier who had completed his sentence, ending an imprisonment that included torture at clandestine CIA sites and 16 years at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.

            Majid Khan, a Pakistani citizen who grew up outside Baltimore, arrived in Belize on Thursday under a Biden administration agreement with that government. 

            This was the first time since the Obama administration that U.S. officials have been able to reach agreement with a stable third-party country willing to take Guantanamo prisoners whom the U.S. no longer considers a threat. Khan's lawyers said he should have been freed last February under a pretrial agreement.











            Khan, who is in his early 40s, said in a statement through his legal team that he deeply regretted his years of working with al-Qaida in his early 20s. That included ferrying $50,000 from Pakistan to fund a deadly 2003 hotel bombing in Indonesia and taking part in plotting several attacks that were never carried out.

            “I promise all of you, especially the people of Belize that I will be a productive, law-abiding member of society,” the statement said. “I will not let you down.”

            Before arriving at the military prison on the U.S. base in Cuba in 2006, Khan spent some three years at so-called CIA black sites overseas. The CIA used the clandestine locations in what the United States called its “war on terror"" after al-Qaida's 2001 attacks against America on Sept. 11, 2001. The U.S. counterterror effort succeeded over the years in capturing or killing key al-Qaida figures. It also swept up, imprisoned and abused some others on little or no real evidence. Many of the detainees were never legally charged. 

            Khan’s treatment was detailed in a Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2014 that accused the CIA of abusing al-Qaida prisoners far beyond its legal boundaries and of giving the public false accounts of useful interrogations at the sites.

            His treatment included being suspended from a ceiling beam for long periods, doused with ice water to deprive him of sleep for days, and subjected to beatings, water torture, sexual assault and starvation, Khan told a military courtroom as it considered his sentence in a military-run war crimes trial.

            
                Khan pled guilty before a U.S. military commission in 2012. He was sentenced in 2021 to 26 years, though a pretrial agreement required a Pentagon legal official to cut that term to no more than 11 years because of his cooperation with U.S. authorities. 

            “This is a historic victory for human rights and the rule of law, but one that took far too long to reach,” Katya Jestin, one of Khan's lawyers, said in a statement.

            
                The Defense Department thanked Belize and others working to find resettlement outside the United States for Guantanamo prisoners deemed not a threat. The Pentagon also said the U.S. remains intent on eventually closing Guantanamo.

            Wells Dixon, an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights who has represented Khan since his arrival at Guantanamo in 2006, said he hoped Belize's agreement and preparations for providing a home for Khan would serve as a model for more third-country transfers.

            “They are approaching Mr. Khan as a free man who is in need of humanitarian assistance,” Dixon said from Belize. ""That's the right way to do it, 100%.""

            Guantanamo at its peak in 2003 held about 600 people whom the U.S. considered terrorists. Supporters of using the detention facility for such figures contend it prevented attacks. Guantanamo's many critics say the system subverted human rights and constitutional rights and undermined the United States' influence and moral standing.

            Thirty-four detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay, including 20 eligible for transfer if stable third-party countries can be found to take them, the Pentagon said. Many are from Yemen, a country considered too plagued with war and extremist groups and too devoid of services for freed Yemeni detainees to be sent there. 

            A 2016 report by the Office of the Director for National Intelligence looking at recidivism rates by former Guantanamo detainees said six out of 115 detainees released between 2009 and 2015 were confirmed to have either returned to extremist violence or been in contact with violent extremists.WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military officials said Thursday they have freed and sent to Central America a onetime al-Qaida money courier who had completed his sentence, ending an imprisonment that included torture at clandestine CIA sites and 16 years at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.Majid Khan, a Pakistani citizen who grew up outside Baltimore, arrived in Belize on Thursday under a Biden administration agreement with that government.This was the first time since the Obama administration that U.S. officials have been able to reach agreement with a stable third-party country willing to take Guantanamo prisoners whom the U.S. no longer considers a threat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798701,Tom Brady's plate remains full after retirement announcement,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Tom Brady’s future figures to be busy.

            The seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback’s retirement announcement ended speculation about if and where Brady might want to play next season, opening the door for numerous off-the-field endeavors that could occupy his time.

            It was announced last May that whenever Brady stepped away from his playing career, he would join Fox Sports as the network’s lead NFL analyst in a 10-year, $375 million contract.











            The 45-year-old future Hall of Famer, who said Wednesday that he’s retiring for good, already has numerous commercial endorsements and an extensive business portfolio that includes the TB12 health and fitness company he co-founded with close friend and long-time trainer Alex Guerrero.

            A look at some of the things that should keep Brady busy:

            TV TOM

            While there’s been no official word on when Brady might begin working for FOX Sports, the network will broadcast next weekend’s Super Bowl from Glendale, Arizona, and it’s not inconceivable that at least a cameo appearance by Brady might be in the works.

            Brady holds numerous Super Bowl records, including title game appearances (10), wins (seven) and MVP awards (five).

            TOM THE BUSINESSMAN

            TB12, which has facilities in Tampa, Boston and Foxboro, Massachusetts, is just part of the business empire Brady began assembling while he was playing the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

            Among the other ventures he’s launched are his own BRADY clothing brand, 199 Productions, created three years ago to develop documentaries, feature films and television shows; and Autograph, an NFT company.

            CELEBRITY TOM

            Brady announced his retirement one day after attending the premiere of “80 for Brady” — which comes out Friday — in Los Angeles. The movie tells the story of four lifelong friends, played by Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Rita Moreno and Sally Field, who go to the Super Bowl to see Brady play.

            The odds are pretty good that Brady might appear on a talk show or two to talk about the film, which he makes a cameo appearance.

            He was asked at the premiere whether he felt a connection working with women — the four stars range in age from 76 to 91 — who don’t want to retire.

            “They’re working hard and they love it. So good for them,” Brady told The Associated Press. “You know, it’s just that’s what life is about. You got to, you know, wake up every day with a purpose. And when you find something you love to do, you know, it’s hard to stop.""

            Brady had that with football. Now fans are waiting to see what's next.

            TOM THE FAMILY MAN

            When Brady briefly retired last winter — only to announce 40 days later that he’d return for a 23rd NFL season that wound up not going nearly as well as he envisioned — the father of three spoke of his desire to spend more time with family.

            In the months after his 13-year marriage to model Gisele Bündchen ended in October, Brady has reiterated how important his kids and being a father are to him.

            He has a son and daughter who live with Bündchen in South Florida, where Brady also has a home. He also has an older son with actress Bridget Moynahan who lives in New York.

            TB12 FOUNDATION DUTIES

            Brady’s charitable foundation is one of his passions, and has been for some time.

            The foundation has a scholarship program that, according to the TB12 website, has provided thousands of treatment sessions to assist athletes of all ages and backgrounds “who would not ordinarily be able to access or afford high-quality post-injury rehabilitation and/or performance enhancement training.”

            He could become even more engaged with those efforts.

            Whatever Brady chooses to do one thing is certain: He has no shortage of career options after hanging up his cleats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798702,Judges hear appeal from victim's family in Adnan Syed case,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — The protracted legal odyssey of Adnan Syed, whose murder case rose to prominence through the hit podcast “Serial,” marked its latest development Thursday when a Maryland appeals court considered whether the victim’s family experienced improper treatment when a Baltimore court overturned Syed’s conviction last year, allowing his release after more than two decades behind bars. 

            The Appellate Court of Maryland will issue a ruling on the matter within 90 days.

            Surviving relatives of Hae Min Lee, Syed’s ex-girlfriend and high school classmate who was strangled to death and found buried in a makeshift grave in 1999, contend their rights were violated because they didn’t receive enough notice about the court hearing that won Syed his freedom. They requested a redo of the September hearing — which would likely require reinstating Syed’s conviction — to allow Lee’s brother a meaningful opportunity to participate. 











            The answer to their request could have significant implications, both for Syed’s future and, more broadly, for the role of crime victims in the Maryland court system. 

            “We’re not on a campaign to have Adnan Syed put back in jail,” attorney David Sanford, who represents the Lee family, said on the courthouse steps following the hearing. “This is about respecting victims and their representatives.” 

            Sanford said the lower court should have to hold a more substantive hearing and better communicate its reasoning for overturning Syed’s conviction “so that the world can know the basis for releasing Adnan Syed.""

            But granting crime victims and their attorneys the power to actively participate in such evidentiary hearings would vastly expand their influence, said Syed’s attorney, Erica Suter. 

            “Giving Appellant what he wants will not just result in the re-imprisonment of Mr. Syed for a crime he did not commit, it will wreak havoc on our criminal justice system,” she wrote in recent court papers.

            But Lee’s family spent decades believing justice had been served, only to be treated as an afterthought when prosecutors decided their case was actually flawed from the beginning, according to their attorneys. 

            Lawyers for the Lee family said that a closed-door meeting between a Baltimore judge and local prosecutors in advance of the vacatur hearing amounted to a violation of open meetings standards. 

            Syed was unshackled inside the courtroom and descended the courthouse steps in downtown Baltimore, surrounded by loved ones and cheering supporters. 

            He was freed from prison after prosecutors said a monthslong review of the case found alternative suspects and unreliable evidence used at trial. Prosecutors had 30 days after his release to decide whether to retry him, but they ultimately dropped the charges, saying additional DNA testing had excluded him as a suspect. 

            Attorneys for Syed argue the Lee family’s appeal became moot after prosecutors dropped the charges. During oral arguments Thursday, a three-judge panel focused much of their questioning on that argument.

            “There is no underlying conviction. There is no case,” Judge Stuart Berger said, asking the Lee family’s attorneys to better explain why the appeal shouldn’t be declared moot. 

            “It makes all the difference in the world if the case is moot,” he said later on. If the court dismisses the appeal on those grounds, it could still issue a ruling clarifying how victims should be treated in future cases.

            The judges also raised questions about why the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office chose to drop charges against Syed eight days before their 30-day deadline — when an appeal from the Lee family was pending. 

            The family’s attorneys said the September hearing was too rushed, scheduled on Friday for the following Monday. Lee’s brother, Young Lee, wanted to participate in person, but he addressed the court over Zoom instead, unable to make travel plans from the West Coast on such short notice. That was after the judge denied his attorney’s request to postpone the hearing for a week so he could travel to Baltimore.

            Maryland law says prosecutors must give victims “reasonable” notice about such hearings.

            The judges expressed skepticism about whether it was reasonable for Young Lee to be given notice one business day before the hearing — and whether the hearing should have been postponed at his request. 

            “I feel betrayed,” he said via Zoom during the proceeding in September. “This is not a podcast for me. This is real life.”

            He attended the Thursday oral arguments in person but didn’t participate or provide comment to reporters. 

            Syed also was present, along with his parents and younger brother. After the hearing, they exited the courthouse together, with Syed pushing his father’s wheelchair slowly through the front entrance. In a brief statement to reporters, he described how the case has impacted his family.

            “It’s really hard for us,” he said. “We definitely understand that Hae’s family has suffered so much and they continue to suffer. It’s just that we suffer, too.”ANNAPOLIS, Md.

There is no case,” Judge Stuart Berger said, asking the Lee family’s attorneys to better explain why the appeal shouldn’t be declared moot.“It makes all the difference in the world if the case is moot,” he said later on. If the court dismisses the appeal on those grounds, it could still issue a ruling clarifying how victims should be treated in future cases.The judges also raised questions about why the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office chose to drop charges against Syed eight days before their 30-day deadline — when an appeal from the Lee family was pending.The family’s attorneys said the September hearing was too rushed, scheduled on Friday for the following Monday. Lee’s brother, Young Lee, wanted to participate in person, but he addressed the court over Zoom instead, unable to make travel plans from the West Coast on such short notice. That was after the judge denied his attorney’s request to postpone the hearing for a week so he could travel to Baltimore.Maryland law says prosecutors must give victims “reasonable” notice about such hearings.The judges expressed skepticism about whether it was reasonable for Young Lee to be given notice one business day before the hearing — and whether the hearing should have been postponed at his request.“I feel betrayed,” he said via Zoom during the proceeding in September. “This is not a podcast for me. This is real life.”He attended the Thursday oral arguments in person but didn’t participate or provide comment to reporters.Syed also was present, along with his parents and younger brother. After the hearing, they exited the courthouse together, with Syed pushing his father’s wheelchair slowly through the front entrance. In a brief statement to reporters, he described how the case has impacted his family.“It’s really hard for us,” he said. “We definitely understand that Hae’s family has suffered so much and they continue to suffer. It’s just that we suffer, too.”",2023/02/03,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798703,Report: FBI investigating Santos fundraiser for sick dog,"NEW YORK (AP) — Federal authorities are investigating a military veteran's claim that U.S. Rep. George Santos raised $3,000 for life-saving surgery for his pet dog several years ago, then never turned over the money for the animal's care, according to a published report.

            U.S. Navy veteran Richard Osthoff told Politico on Wednesday that two FBI agents contacted him after he went public last month with his story about his experiences with Santos in 2016. 

            Osthoff told the news site he gave the agents text messages he exchanged with Santos, who at the time was going by the name Anthony Devolder.











            “I’m glad to get the ball rolling with the bigwigs,” Osthoff said. “I was worried that what happened to me was too long ago to be prosecuted.”

            The local news site Patch reported last month that Osthoff, now 47, was living in a roadside tent in Howell, New Jersey, in May 2016 when his pit bull mix, Sapphire, developed a life-threatening stomach tumor.

            A veterinary technician connected Osthoff to Santos' pet charity, Friends of Pets United, Osthoff said. Authorities have said the group was not a registered charity.

            According to Osthoff, Santos set up a GoFundMe account and raised $3,000 for Sapphire's surgery but never turned it over. Sapphire died in 2017.

            Santos, a Republican, has declined to answer questions about the matter and also refused to do so at the U.S. Capitol on Thursday.

            In a tweet on Jan. 19, however, he wrote that “the reports that I would let a dog die is (sic) shocking & insane.”

            “My work in animal advocacy was the labor of love & hard work. Over the past 24hr I have received pictures of dogs I helped rescue throughout the years along with supportive messages,” he wrote.

            A message seeking comment was left with Santos’ attorney, Joseph Murray.

            Santos is already facing investigations over multiple lies he told about his life story, work history and family background.

            The congressman announced on Tuesday that he is temporarily stepping down from two congressional committees, saying in a prepared statement that he wanted to focus on serving his constituents “without distraction.”

            Another veteran who worked with Osthoff in his fruitless quest to save Sappire's life told The Associated Press he could hardly believe Santos would renege on his promise to help.

            “I said, ‘Rich, why don’t you just relax; nobody wants to take money away from a disabled veteran and his sick dog. I’m sure this is a mistake,’” said Michael Boll, a retired Union Township, New Jersey, police officer and founder of a group called the New Jersey Veterans Network.

            Boll said he talked to Santos on the phone, telling him, “You don’t have any right to this money. Either give it all back to the people who donated it, or give it to a veterinarian Rich will choose in his area so he’d have a credit to take the dog there for treatment.

            “Anthony wanted nothing to do with that and refused to take any further calls from me,” Boll said.

            A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn said he could not comment on whether the office is investigating the fundraising drive for Osthoff's dog.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798717,Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes gets back to work for Super Bowl,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes strolled through Arrowhead Stadium without any issues with his injured right ankle on Thursday, and the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback expects to practice fully in the next 10 days leading up to the Super Bowl.

            Mahomes sprained the ankle during the divisional round against Jacksonville, and he was clearly hobbled in last Sunday night's AFC championship win over Cincinnati. But despite taking a couple of hard shots during that game, and his mad dash in the closing seconds to set up the winning field goal, Mahomes came out of it feeling just fine.

            “It was a physical game. My whole body was a little sore. But I don't think I had any step backward, a reaggravation of the ankle,"" Mahomes said. “A little pain playing with it but other than that, I feel like I'm in a good spot.”











            The Chiefs sustained a number of other injuries during their 23-20 win over the Bengals, though. They lost three wide receivers — Mecole Hardman reinjured his pelvis, JuJu Smith-Schuster had swelling in his knee and Kadarius Toney sprained his ankle — while cornerback L'Jarius Sneed was in the concussion protocol and Willie Gay Jr. hurt his shoulder.

            Gay was the only one that returned to practice on an unseasonably mild February day in Kansas City.

            Coach Andy Reid did say that Toney did the morning walk-through and “he's close and doing well,” while Smith-Schuster “is in a good place. The main thing is we let that calm down. We're very optimistic right now.""

            The news wasn't as positive for Hardman, who first hurt his abdominal area in November. The Chiefs later began to classify it as a pelvis injury as Hardman neared his return from injured reserve, but he wasn't able to make it back onto the field until the AFC title game. He was hurt while getting wrapped up after a catch and did not return.

            “Very courageous effort,” Reid said, “and my heart goes out to the kid. He is hurting today.”

            While the Chiefs remained thin at wide receiver, they did have Justin Watson back on the practice field. He was ruled out before kickoff against Cincinnati with an illness, forcing Marcus Kemp to come up from the practice squad.

            The Chiefs also are hopeful that Sneed will clear the concussion protocol in the two weeks between games. 

            In a defense featuring three rookie cornerbacks and a rookie safety, Sneed is often tasked with covering the opposition's best wide receiver. It would have been Ja'Marr Chase against the Bengals, but Sneed was hurt on the game's fourth play and did not return; it will likely be A.J. Brown or DeVonta Smith if he can play against the Eagles in the Super Bowl.

            Reid also said there's a possibility Clyde Edwards-Helaire, their 2020 first-round pick, will be activated for the big game. Edwards-Helaire had already ceded the No. 1 running back job to rookie Isiah Pacheco before a high ankle sprain landed him on injured reserve in late November, but his versatility could be helpful against a tough Eagles defense.

            “He'll practice. We'll see where he's at,” Reid said. “We're just taking it day by day, seeking out how he's feeling, not only during practice but after practice. He'll work today.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798718,Crowds decry gender-affirming treatment ban in West Virginia,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Crowds at the West Virginia state Capitol pleaded with lawmakers Thursday to show as much compassion for saving the lives of transgender children as they showed for unborn fetuses when they voted to ban abortion just months ago. 

            Over and over, dozens of doctors, parents and LGBTQ people told the Republican supermajority during a hearing that a decision to ban gender-affirming care for youth would put children's lives at risk. West Virginia is among 26 states considering bans to restrict gender-affirming care for minors or young adults, with the most recent action being in South Dakota and in Utah, where the Republican governor just signed that state's bill into law. A judge is reviewing whether to strike down Arkansas' law after temporarily blocking it last year. 

            Transgender and gender nonconforming children attempt suicide at a disproportionately high rate, and West Virginia has the largest per capita population of transgender youth in the nation.











            “You all like to use rhetoric about not killing children as a justification for passing legislation, as you did this summer. You will kill children if you pass this,” said the Rev. Jenny Williams, a United Methodist pastor in Preston County. “If you oppose the killing of children like you say you do, I would hope that you apply your principals consistently.” 

            Multiple people told lawmakers they would have blood on their hands if they advance the bill to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors, which has moved out of two House committees and is now up for consideration before the full House of Delegates. West Virginia has a Republican governor and one of the largest Republican majorities in any state legislature in the country, and the legislation has a high chance of becoming law. 

            Some of the handful of lawmakers in attendance watched attentively, others looked at their phones or laptops or averted their eyes. People were given one minute to talk before they were cut off and told to sit down. Almost 80 people spoke against the bill. Two spoke in support. 

            Paula Lepp, who said she is a Christian parent of a Christian transgender child, told lawmakers she believes the bill is contrary to the teachings of Jesus to care for the most marginalized.

            “The bottom line is this: I would rather have a live daughter than a dead son, and this bill puts that at risk,” she said. 

            Republicans in other states who have moved to limit access to the treatments for minors have often characterized the treatments as medically unproven and potentially dangerous in the long term, as another political battle against liberal ideologies. They also say teenagers shouldn’t undergo irreversible surgeries.

            Braden Roten, one of the two people who spoke in support of the bill, urged lawmakers to look past the crowds of people who showed up to speak against it and think about what conservatives would want. 

            “Despite the crowd opposing this bill, this is a red state and there’s a big push in the conservative movement for this bill,” he said, as people watching from the chamber galleries and floor booed. “If you don’t vote on this bill we will vote you out.” 

            At least 88 bills seeking to restrict gender affirming care for minors or young adults have been introduced across 26 states. West Virginia’s measure prohibits gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for youth.

            Many doctors, mental health specialists and medical groups have argued that treatments for young transgender people are safe and beneficial, though rigorous long-term research is lacking. Federal health officials have described the gender-affirming care as crucial to the health and wellbeing of transgender children and adolescents.

            Charleston pediatric physician Dr. Allison Holstein spoke Thursday on behalf of West Virginia chapter the American Academy of Pediatrics. She said the bill interferes with doctors ability to provide the best medical care to their patients. 

            “The bill is dangerous, it’s an intrusion on the physician-patient relationship,” she said. “The attempt to insert politics into medical practice are troubling and very concerning.” 

            Staff from the Women’s Health Center of West Virginia — formerly West Virginia's only abortion provider, before the procedure was practically outlawed — also spoke against the bill. The clinic, which offers services predominately to low-income people on Medicaid, began offering gender-affirming hormone therapy when abortion was banned.

            Executive Director Katie Quiñonez read a statement on behalf of a transgender man who said prior to coming out as transgender, he attempted suicide four times. The first time he was 12.

            “If you're so pro-life, why are you trying to kill trans kids?"" Quinonez said. 

            Women's Health Center Communications Director Kaylen Barker, who is a member of the LGBTQ community, said she's tired of having to come to the Capitol to justify her existence and the experiences of people she loves. 

             “Leave us alone,"" Barker cried. ""Find something useful to do with your time, like fix the damn roads.”CHARLESTON, W.Va.

            It isn't clear yet what the investigators are looking for by taking custody of notes from his time as vice president and his decades in the Senate that were found in his Delaware homes in Rehoboth Beach and Wilmington. 

            Biden's attorneys did not say whether the notes were considered to be classified, only that they were removed. But over his 36 years in the Senate and eight as vice president, Biden had a front-row seat to a lot of highly sensitive moments in U.S. history, including the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the 2011 death of Osama bin Laden and unfolding political turmoil in Ukraine. 











            The special counsel is working to determine how classified information from Biden’s time as senator and vice president came to wind up in his home and former office — and whether any mishandling involved criminal intent or was unintentional. But they'll also have to determine whether the notes they took are considered personal and therefore belong to Biden, and would then likely be returned to him. 

            Some of the documents held by Trump also had handwritten notes, according to the FBI. In seeking permission to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in August, an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit that some of the documents returned to the National Archives last January contained what appeared to be Trump's handwriting. The affidavit does not say whether agents believed those notes to discuss classified material. 

            Under the Presidential Records Act, records of a presidential administration generally belong with the National Archives, especially classified items. There are some exceptions, including when records are determined to be purely personal. 

            But even a handwritten note can be considered classified if someone is recording observations related to a classified document or briefing. Such notes can be deemed classified even if not marked as such. 

            Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior director of the White House situation room and chief of staff to retired CIA Director Michael Hayden, said that when he took notes during secret or top-secret meetings, he would mark each page by specific levels of classification.

            “It’s pretty clear in those meetings when they’re hearing classified information,” he said. When Pfeiffer left the CIA, he submitted his notebooks to the agency archives.

            Longtime aides say they believe Biden has been keeping personal diaries for decades, though the only public glimpse of them so far has come in Biden’s book “Promise Me, Dad,” which chronicled the then-vice president’s heartache and grief over his son Beau’s fatal cancer diagnosis.

            In the book, Biden quotes passages written in his diary about Beau’s condition and death that were written on Air Force Two, in the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, and at his Wilmington home, as well as one jotted down as he weighed whether to run for president in 2016. In the book, Biden describes taking the notes as he navigated being a supportive parent for an ailing family member and largely maintaining his official schedule of meetings and calls.

            He details how he had a secure phone installed at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston so he could work while he was there with his son as Beau underwent treatment. But he also wrote about his debate over whether he'd run for office in 2016: 

            “'A lot happening,' I wrote in my diary when I finally got some downtime in Wilmington the next weekend. 'Need to be careful it doesn't get away from me. I need to slow down, ramp down my schedule.'” 

            It’s unknown whether handwritten notes may have been turned over to the Department of Justice by former Vice President Mike Pence or whether any of former President Donald Trump’s writings from his time in office was found during the FBI’s search of his Florida estate last year. 

            It was also unclear whether recent former presidents and vice presidents would make any of their personal notes written during their time in office available for review to determine whether they contained any potential federal records or information that should be classified.

            Attorney General Merrick Garland and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines have declined to discuss their investigations or brief members of Congress. 

            The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee sent a third letter Thursday urging Garland and Haines to allow the panel to view the papers in secret and be briefed on their potential risk to national security. 

            Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Marco Rubio of Florida wrote that without access to the documents, “we cannot effectively oversee the efforts of the Intelligence Community to address potential risks to national security arising from the mishandling of this classified information.”

            There’s a precedent in keeping personal records personal: Access to Ronald Reagan’s personal diaries was sought after he left office by his former national security adviser John Poindexter as he faced trial for his role in the Iran-Contra affair. A federal judge accepted Reagan’s invocation of executive privilege to shield the diaries from disclosure. 

            Reagan frequently wrote about the substance of his official meetings — including details on classified sessions — and impressions of world leaders, often commingled with mundane details about his life like his dinner companions and personal calls. But it wasn’t until after Reagan’s death and with the consent of his widow, Nancy Reagan, that they were published.

            There have been multiple cases in recent years of high-level officials mishandling notes about classified operations. Former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted for his handling of eight notebooks of classified and unclassified notes he collected during his time leading U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan. According to a plea agreement, Petraeus kept the notebooks in his private possession and allowed his biographer, with whom he was having an affair, to review them.

            He pleaded guilty in 2015 to one count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material and received probation.

            Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was found by the FBI to have discussed classified material in emails kept on her private server. Some of those emails had classified information at the time they were sent, while others were subsequently classified during the FBI’s investigation of her use of the server.

            Then-FBI Director James Comey recommended against charging Clinton in 2016 because he said there was not clear evidence Clinton or her subordinates intended to violate laws about classified information.

            Biden's lawyers were closing up his office at the Penn Biden Center think tank last November when they came across classified documents in a locked closet. The records were turned over to the Justice Department. But after Biden's lawyers searched his Wilmington home and found additional classified items, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to investigate. Biden has said he was surprised the documents were there, and has cooperated with investigators, including voluntarily consenting to the FBI searches. 

            When FBI agents searched Biden’s Wilmington home last month, they “also took for further review personally handwritten notes from the vice-presidential years,” according to his lawyer, Bob Bauer. When the FBI searched Biden's Rehoboth Beach home on Wednesday, they took “some materials and handwritten notes that appear to relate to his time as Vice President” but found no other classified documents, according to Bauer.

            The White House has refused to comment on what was in Biden’s notes, other than to say some of the writing pertained to his time as vice president.

            “I think that they want to make sure that the Justice Department has access to the information that they need to sift through materials as a part of this ongoing investigation,” White House spokesman Ian Sams said Wednesday. “And so I’m not going to characterize too much of the underlying contents.”WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is a man who writes down his thoughts.

            Officers were called to the Poplar-White Station Public Library around 12:30 p.m. Thursday, where they encountered a man who had been the subject of a trespassing call in the same neighborhood about thirty minutes earlier, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Keli McAlister said. 

            The man had started a confrontation with another person inside the library, and when officers attempted to talk with him, he pulled out a weapon and shot one of them, McAlister said. The other officer drew his weapon, shooting and killing the man. 











            McAlister did not identify the officers, but the man killed was identified as Torence Jackson Jr., 28, of Indianapolis. All three were Black men.

            The officer was taken to a hospital “in extremely critical condition,” McAlister said.

            There were employees and patrons inside the library at the time of the shooting, but no one else was injured, McAlister said.

            The small library, on a busy street surrounded by high-rise office buildings, restaurants and stores, was blocked by yellow crime scene tape, with two fire engines and an ambulance parked nearby. Memphis police officers and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents were talking outside.

            The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is working on the case at the request of the Shelby County prosecutor. The bureau often investigates shootings around the state when officers are involved.

            Police use of force is being scrutinized nationally after five Memphis police officers were charged with murder in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols.MEMPHIS, Tenn.

            “Is your girlfriend awake?” the dispatcher asked.

            “I’m not sure,” the caller said.











            Audio from the 911 recordings released Thursday provides a sense of the confusion and chaos that unfolded Jan. 21 at the Star Ballroom Dance Studio on a night that had been full of celebration for the Lunar New Year.

            Police said Huu Can Tran, 72, a onetime fixture at the ballroom who told people he was a dance instructor, killed 11 people and wounded nine with a submachine gun-style semiautomatic handgun. Of the six women and five men killed, one woman was in her 50s and the rest were in their 60s and 70s. 

            Tran fled from the shooting in a white van and about 20 minutes later entered a dance hall in nearby Alhambra, where a quick-thinking employee lunged for the weapon and disarmed him after a short struggle. Tran killed himself the next morning as police surrounded his van. 

            In the course of just over three minutes, Monterey Park police dispatchers fielded three 911 calls. One came from a man who had run from the club after seeing the gunman open fire near the dance hall entrance. He initially mistook the gunshots for firecrackers.

            That man, who said he saw the gunman reloading the weapon as people ran for safety, urged a dispatcher to “send police here right away.”

            “He might start shooting again,” the man said in a panicked voice.

            The dispatcher asked several times if anyone was hurt. The man said he didn't know.

            “It happened too fast,” he said. ""Everybody ran away.""

            The man who phoned from the car reported that he and his girlfriend left the party early and someone tried to break a car window as they were leaving. He then said the window had been shot out and his girlfriend was unconscious. 

            He did not identify the woman, but Mymy Nhan, 65, was identified as the only person shot in the parking lot. 

            A fire dispatcher pressed for details, asking if the wounded woman could speak. 

            “My, can you talk to me?” the caller pleaded. “No, she cannot talk.”

            The dispatcher then asked if she was breathing. 

            “Oh, no,” the man said. “Maybe she die. I’m not sure.”

            He then reported she was bleeding from the head. The dispatcher assured him police and paramedics were on their way.

            Five minutes into the call, a police dispatcher, who had remained on the line after connecting the caller with the fire department, asked what kind of car the man was in and told him to wave down officers for help.

            “Come here, please. Help!"" the man could be heard yelling. “Right here! Right here! Right here!”

            The police dispatcher then notified his peer in the fire department there are ""several gunshot victims inside.”

            “Inside the same car?” the fire dispatcher asked.

            The police dispatcher clarified that he meant the business — the dance hall.

            After this exchange, some seven minutes into the call, the man could still be heard calling for help. 

            The police dispatcher told him to keep waving. Eventually, he said, “They're here. they're here.”

            Nhan, an immigrant from Vietnam who was a regular at the club and loved to dance, was one of the first victims named after the massacre.

            Three weeks earlier, she had lost her mother, whom she had cared for, her niece, Fonda Quan, told The Associated Press. She had gone to the club to celebrate with friends and was ready to “start the year fresh.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798726,US to send Ukraine longer-range bombs in latest turnaround,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After months of agonizing, the U.S has agreed to send longer-range bombs to Ukraine as it prepares to launch a spring offensive to retake territory Russia captured last year, U.S. officials said Thursday, confirming that the new weapons will have roughly double the range of any other offensive weapon provided by America.

            The U.S. will provide ground-launched small diameter bombs as part of a $2.17 billion aid package it is expected to announce Friday, several U.S. officials said. The package also for the first time includes equipment to connect all the different air defense systems Western allies have rushed to the battlefield and integrate them into Ukraine's own air defenses, to help it better defend against Russia's missile attacks. 

            For months, U.S. officials have hesitated to send longer-range systems to Ukraine out of concern that they would be used to target inside Russia, escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. deeper in. The longer-range bombs are the latest advanced system, such as Abrams tanks and the Patriot missile defense system, that the U.S. has eventually agreed to provide Ukraine after initially saying no. U.S. officials, though, have continued to reject Ukraine’s requests for fighter jets.











            Ukrainian leaders have urgently pressed for longer-range munitions, and on Thursday officials said the U.S. will send an undisclosed number of the ground-launched, small diameter bombs, which have a range of about 95 miles (150 kilometers). The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the aid package not yet made public.

            To date, the longest-range missile provided by the U.S. is about 50 miles (80 kilometers). The funding in the aid package is for longer-term purchases, so it wasn't clear Thursday how long it will take to get the bomb to the battlefield in Ukraine.

            Ukraine's defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Thursday the country is prepared to offer guarantees to its Western partners that their weapons won’t be used to strike inside Russian territory, adding that Kyiv needs weapons with a range of up to 300 kilometers ( about 185 miles) to expel the Russian forces.

            “If we could strike at a distance of up to 300 kilometers, the Russian army wouldn’t be able to mount a defense and will have to withdraw,” Reznikov said at a meeting with EU officials. “Ukraine is ready to provide any guarantees that your weapons will not be involved in attacks on the Russian territory. We have enough targets in the occupied areas of Ukraine, and we’re prepared to coordinate on (these) targets with our partners.""

            The U.S. aid package includes $425 million in ammunition and support equipment that will be pulled from existing Pentagon stockpiles and $1.75 billion in new funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to purchase new weapons from industry.

            The assistance initiative, which will pay for the longer-range bombs and the air defense system integration, also funds two HAWK air defense systems, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, and counter-drone systems.

            Since Russia's invasion last February, Western allies have pledged a myriad of air defense systems to Ukraine to bolster its own Soviet-made S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems, and the latest aid package aims to provide the capability to integrate them all, which could improve Ukraine's ability to protect itself against incoming Russian attacks.

            The U.S. has pledged medium- to long-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and truck-launched short-range Avenger air defense systems; the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. are sending Patriot missile defense systems; Germany is sending medium-range IRIS-T air defense systems; and Spain is sending Aspide anti-aircraft air defense systems. 

            The addition of longer-range bombs to the latest aid package was first reported by Reuters. 

            Ukraine is still seeking F-16 fighter jets, which U.S. President Joe Biden has opposed sending since the beginning of the war. Asked Monday if his administration was considering sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, Biden responded, “No.” 

            On Tuesday, the Ukrainian defense minister was asked if Biden’s ’’no” to F-16s was the final word.

            “All types of help first passed through the ‘no’ stage,” Reznikov said. “Which only means ‘no’ at today’s given moment. The second stage is, ‘Let’s talk and study technical possibilities.’ The third stage is, ‘Let’s get your personnel trained.’ And the fourth stage is the transfer (of equipment).”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798731,S. Carolina bill shielding death penalty drugmakers advances,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Republicans' quest to resume executions in South Carolina overcame another hurdle Thursday. 

            The state Senate Corrections and Penology Committee approved a bill that would shield the identities of the companies that dispense the drug cocktail used to execute people on death row. The full Senate must now take up the latest effort in the state's search for a method of capital punishment.

            South Carolina has gone nearly 12 years without an execution. Recent sessions have seen futile attempts to begin executing the state's death row prisoners — who now total 35 condemned people, including one man whose sentence dates back to 1983, according to a Feb. 2 South Carolina Department of Corrections list.











            South Carolina's last batch of lethal injection drugs have not been replenished since the supply expired in 2013. In lieu of that method, Gov. Henry McMaster in 2021 signed a law giving condemned prisoners the choice between death by a newly created firing squad or the electric chair.

            But that law has been placed on hold amid a challenge from death row prisoners who have argued both methods are unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishments.

            The availability of lethal injection drugs has loomed large in that case. The state Supreme Court recently compelled a judge to collect more information on the state Department of Corrections' attempts to obtain them. The justices said state lawyers failed to answer how or when officials had sought the drugs during oral arguments last month.

            Republican leaders have said drugmakers fearing public pressure from opposing activists are unwilling to sell to the state because South Carolina lacks a statute concealing their identities. 

            Fourteen states have carried out nearly 90 lethal injection executions in the past five years, including Texas, Alabama and Florida. Many have shield laws. Some do not.

            States across the country have adopted such secrecy laws over the past decade. Similar measures have been passed in Virginia, Georgia, Ohio, Missouri and Arkansas.

            The debate in South Carolina adds to the near constant scrutiny over the death penalty around the country. A Tennessee report issued late last year found the state had failed to property test lethal injection drugs before their usage.

            As part of its vote Thursday, the Senate Corrections and Penology Committee stripped the proposal of language that Sen. Greg Hembree of Horry said has still given pharmaceutical companies' cold feet in other states with similar laws.

            The original draft allowed courts to compel identifying information upon “good cause.” By removing that clause, Hembree's amendment seeks to protect that information from disclosure during any legal processes.

            “The effort is to provide that very, very strong defense or shield for those persons on the execution team or providing those substances needed for lethal injection,"" he said.

            Democratic and Republican senators raised concerns that such sweeping protections would prevent courts from acquiring key details in critical situations like botched executions. Hembree said the shield could still be pierced in such “exceptional circumstances.""

            Those concerns were shared by Joshua Malkin, a lobbyist for the ACLU of South Carolina. Malkin said the amendment's passage was a loss for accountability.

            “This isn’t even about the death penalty. This is about government transparency,"" Malkin said. ""Even folks that the state has determined are condemned to die deserve some standard of decency.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798732,1st phase of Mexican solar project to be operating in April,"PUERTO PEÑASCO, Mexico (AP) — Mexico was pushed to accelerate its turn toward renewable energy after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year drove a sharp increase in global energy costs, Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said late Thursday.

            Ebrard made the comments after taking dozens of foreign diplomats to see a massive new solar energy project near the U.S. border.

            “Mexico is making a really great effort because it didn't consider (the shift to renewable energy and electric vehicles) would be so fast,” Ebrard said. The decisions made by the United States and Mexico in the past year to invest heavily in those areas “didn't appear so near before the war.""











            “We too have to change the focus,"" he said. “It has to go faster.”

            In April, Mexico plans to power up the first phase of a huge solar energy project near a beach town popular with tourists making the short drive from the United States.

            Once completed, the full $1.6 billion project will have a generating capacity of 1,000 megawatts — enough to power some 500,000 homes. It will be the largest solar project built by Mexico’s state-owned electric company.

            In Puerto Peñasco, near the top of the Gulf of California and border with Arizona, rows of solar panels that tilt with the passing sun run off to the horizon hovering above the sand. The project will eventually cover 5,000 acres in the transition where the desert flattens between the rugged brown mountains and blue sea.

            The Federal Electric Commission plans to have the first 120 megawatts of the project operational by April 29, Juan Antonio Fernández, the commission’s strategic planning director, said Thursday.

            Sonora Gov. Alfonso Durazo, who once served as a Cabinet minister alongside Ebrard before running for state office, made the case that Sonora should be the center of Mexico’s electric vehicle production. In addition to the solar energy coming online — in total 5 gigawatts of solar capacity are planned for the state — Sonora has the country’s largest known deposits of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles.

            Ebrard said the plan represented a “new model of development.”

            “We're not going to be able to do that in all of the states at the same time,” he said. “But we have to demonstrate that that idea can be real and is not wishful thinking.”

            The turn toward renewable energy is at odds with other priorities of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

            The president has invested heavily in propping up the long-struggling state-owned oil company. He is building a big new oil refinery. And he has pushed legislation that gives advantages to the state-owned electric company over private energy production, which in many cases was cleaner.

            Ebrard is one of several people seeking the presidential nomination of López Obrador’s Morena party for the 2024 national elections.PUERTO PEÑASCO, Mexico (AP) — Mexico was pushed to accelerate its turn toward renewable energy after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year drove a sharp increase in global energy costs, Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said late Thursday.Ebrard made the comments after taking dozens of foreign diplomats to see a massive new solar energy project near the U.S. border.“Mexico is making a really great effort because it didn't consider (the shift to renewable energy and electric vehicles) would be so fast,” Ebrard said. The decisions made by the United States and Mexico in the past year to invest heavily in those areas “didn't appear so near before the war.""“We too have to change the focus,"" he said. “It has to go faster.”In April, Mexico plans to power up the first phase of a huge solar energy project near a beach town popular with tourists making the short drive from the United States.Once completed, the full $1.6 billion project will have a generating capacity of 1,000 megawatts — enough to power some 500,000 homes. It will be the largest solar project built by Mexico’s state-owned electric company.In Puerto Peñasco, near the top of the Gulf of California and border with Arizona, rows of solar panels that tilt with the passing sun run off to the horizon hovering above the sand. The project will eventually cover 5,000 acres in the transition where the desert flattens between the rugged brown mountains and blue sea.The Federal Electric Commission plans to have the first 120 megawatts of the project operational by April 29, Juan Antonio Fernández, the commission’s strategic planning director, said Thursday.Sonora Gov. Alfonso Durazo, who once served as a Cabinet minister alongside Ebrard before running for state office, made the case that Sonora should be the center of Mexico’s electric vehicle production. In addition to the solar energy coming online — in total 5 gigawatts of solar capacity are planned for the state — Sonora has the country’s largest known deposits of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles.Ebrard said the plan represented a “new model of development.”“We're not going to be able to do that in all of the states at the same time,” he said. “But we have to demonstrate that that idea can be real and is not wishful thinking.”The turn toward renewable energy is at odds with other priorities of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.The president has invested heavily in propping up the long-struggling state-owned oil company. He is building a big new oil refinery. And he has pushed legislation that gives advantages to the state-owned electric company over private energy production, which in many cases was cleaner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798734,How the US is boosting military alliances to counter China,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is expanding it military presence in Asia, in a string of moves aimed at countering Beijing and reassuring Indo-Pacific allies that America will stand with them against threats from China and North Korea.

            The U.S. actions stretch from Japan to the Solomon Islands. And they involve more and increasingly advanced military exercises in the region and additional troop rotations in key areas facing the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. In some cases, they also could provide logistical support in the event of any conflict with China, specifically in defense of the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.

            The announcements in recent weeks have triggered angry responses from both China and North Korea. And they come as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to go to China next week in what will be the first visit by a Cabinet-level official in the Biden administration.











            PHILIPPINES

            Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on his seventh trip to Asia during his two years in office, announced an agreement with the Philippines on Thursday that gives the U.S. access to four more military camps in the Southeast Asian country.

            He called it a “big deal” even though it doesn't establish a permanent U.S. military presence, which is prohibited under the Philippine Constitution. What it does do, however, is give U.S. troops — rotating in and out of the Philippines — a bird's eye view of two critical spots: the Taiwan Strait and disputed regions of the South China Sea.

            There are about 500 U.S. troops in the Philippines on any given day, but thousands rotate in and out over the course of a year for military exercises, humanitarian aid, training and other missions, according to officials. The Philippines allows American forces to stay in barracks within designated Philippine camps. The U.S. already had access to five Philippine military bases. 

            Standing with his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez Jr., during a press conference in Manila, Austin said the efforts to strengthen the alliance ""are especially important as the People’s Republic of China continues to advance its illegitimate claims in the West Philippine Sea.”

            In response, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswomen Mao Ning accused the U.S. of pursuing “its selfish agenda” with the new arrangement, calling it ""an act that escalates tensions in the region and endangers regional peace and stability.”

            SOUTH KOREA

            In Seoul on Tuesday, Austin announced that the U.S. would increase its deployment of advanced military assets to the Korean Peninsula, including fighter jets and aircraft carriers to boost joint training and planning.

            He and South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-Sup agreed to expand their combined military exercises, including more live-fire demonstrations. And they discussed preparations for a simulated exercise in February aimed at sharpening their response if North Korea used nuclear weapons.

            North Korea test-fired dozens of missiles in 2022, including potentially nuclear-capable ones designed to strike targets in South Korea and the U.S. mainland. 

            The U.S. resumed large-scale military drills last year, including an aerial exercise involving U.S. strategic bombers in November, in a stepped-up effort to deter Pyongyang. The allies had scaled back exercises in recent years to create room for diplomacy with North Korea during the Trump administration and because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            North Korea, in response, said it’s prepared to counter U.S. military moves with the “most overwhelming nuclear force.” It said the expansion of military exercises is pushing tensions to an “extreme red line.”

            JAPAN

            Last month, the U.S. and Japan agreed to adjust the American troop presence on the island of Okinawa in part to enhance anti-ship capabilities that would be needed in the event of a Chinese incursion into Taiwan or other hostile acts in the South or East China sea.

            They also added a formal mention of outer space in the longstanding U.S.-Japan security treaty, making clear that “attacks to, from and within space” could trigger the mutual defense provisions of the treaty. And Japan announced it would begin constructing a pair of runways on the small southern island of Mageshima where joint exercises, amphibious operations and missile interception could begin in about four years.

            The island would be a hub for troop deployments and munition supplies in case of a conflict like a Taiwan emergency. 

            The changes in the U.S. deployment on Okinawa will transform the 12th Marine Regiment into a smaller, more rapidly mobile unit — the 12th Marine Littoral Regiment, which will be better equipped to fight an adversary and defend the U.S. and its allies in the region.

            SOLOMON ISLANDS

            On the diplomatic front, the U.S. opened an embassy in the Solomon Islands this week, in a direct effort to counter China's growing influence there. There had been an embassy in the Solomons for several years, but it was closed in 1993 as part of a global reduction in diplomatic posts. Over time, however, the U.S. became concerned about possible weakening ties with the country.

            The Solomon Islands switched allegiance from the self-ruled island of Taiwan to Beijing in 2019. And last year, the Solomons signed a security pact with China, raising fears of a military buildup by Beijing in the region.

            Reopening an embassy there, the U.S. State Department said, was a priority to counter China’s growing influence in the region. The embassy in the capital, Honiara, is starting small, with a chargé d’affaires, a couple of State Department staff and a handful of local employees.WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is expanding it military presence in Asia, in a string of moves aimed at countering Beijing and reassuring Indo-Pacific allies that America will stand with them against threats from China and North Korea.The U.S. actions stretch from Japan to the Solomon Islands.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798735,"Grandmother indicted after boy, 9, fatally shoots teen girl","BALTIMORE (AP) — A Baltimore grandmother faces criminal charges for failing to secure the gun that her 9-year-old grandson was carrying when he fatally shot a teenage girl last summer, officials announced Thursday, saying the indictment should serve as a warning about the importance of safe firearm storage.

            Nykayla Strawder, 15, was hanging out on the front porch of her family’s west Baltimore rowhouse with other kids when the gun discharged. Police said it was accidental. 

            Under Maryland law, the 9-year-old can’t face criminal charges because of his age. But the August shooting prompted outrage from the victim’s family and calls for adults to be held accountable for allowing children access to deadly weapons. 











            Baltimore police previously said the gun was registered to a female relative of the boy who worked as a private security guard. 

            A grand jury indictment now accuses his grandmother, April Gaskins, of reckless endangerment and two counts of failure to secure a firearm with an unsupervised minor present, the Baltimore State’s Attorney’s Office confirmed Thursday. Court records show the indictment was filed in November, but Gaskins, 54, was arrested this week. 

            Gaskins has no attorney listed in court records. Messages left at numbers listed under her name were not immediately returned Thursday. 

            “While I cannot discuss the details of an open and pending case, it is evident that the grand jury’s decision exemplifies how gun violence is of the utmost importance in our city,” said State’s Attorney Ivan Bates, who took office last month. “It further underscores the seriousness of responsible gun ownership and proper gun storage.”

            Baltimore recently recorded over 300 annual homicides for the eighth consecutive year despite several ongoing anti-violence initiatives. 

            Loved ones and activists demanded “Justice for Kayla” after her death came to symbolize the myriad broken systems that have contributed to Baltimore’s high homicide rate. Family and friends remembered the high school sophomore as a vibrant personality with a bright future. 

            “How do you not notice your gun was missing? There is no excuse — knowing there’s a child in the home and not keeping your gun hidden,” her father, Dontay Jones, told The Baltimore Sun last year. “Our daughter is never coming back. We’ll be looking down at our daughter in a casket. I’ll never see her smile again.”

            Maryland law says an adult cannot leave a loaded firearm “where the person knew or should have known that an unsupervised child would gain access” to the weapon — a misdemeanor offense whose maximum penalty is a $1,000 fine. Reckless endangerment is also a misdemeanor that carries up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.

            “This indictment sends a strong message that we will hold accountable those who do not practice responsible gun ownership and secure their firearms,” Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said in a statement Thursday.

            Under a bill state lawmakers passed last year, children under 10 cannot be charged with a crime. Extensive research shows young children are unable to fully understand the consequences of their actions and the workings of the criminal justice system. 

            News of the indictment comes in the aftermath of a January shooting at a Virginia elementary school, where a first-grader brought his mother’s handgun to class and shot his teacher. Virginia law prohibits leaving a loaded gun where it is accessible to a child under 14, but no charges have been filed against the boy’s mother.BALTIMORE (AP) — A Baltimore grandmother faces criminal charges for failing to secure the gun that her 9-year-old grandson was carrying when he fatally shot a teenage girl last summer, officials announced Thursday, saying the indictment should serve as a warning about the importance of safe firearm storage.Nykayla Strawder, 15, was hanging out on the front porch of her family’s west Baltimore rowhouse with other kids when the gun discharged.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798736,Extremist Israeli group halts fund-raising effort in US,"LAKEWOOD, N.J. (AP) — An Israeli group that assists Jewish prisoners convicted in some of the country’s most notorious hate crimes has halted its fund-raising efforts through a U.S.-based Jewish charity following an investigation by The Associated Press and the Israeli nonprofit news organization Shomrim.

            The fund-raising through the Lakewood, New Jersey-based World of Tzedaka had allowed American donors to make tax-exempt contributions to the hard-line Israeli group, and suggested that Israel’s far right was making new inroads into the U.S. 

            World of Tzedaka confirmed that it was no longer working with Shlom Asiraich, while a fund-raising link on the Israeli group’s website that connected donors to the American nonprofit has stopped working.











            “We don’t do any business with them anymore, so we don’t have anything else to do with them,” said Yaakov Cohen, who identified himself as a manager for World of Tzedaka.

            Shlom Asiraich, or “The Well-Being of Your Prisoners,” has been raising money in Israel since at least 2018. The group was officially registered as a nonprofit in 2020 by a group consisting mostly of Israelis from hard-line settlements in the West Bank. 

            According to its promotional materials, the group has provided assistance to Yigal Amir, who assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995; Amiram Ben-Uliel, who was convicted in the 2015 murder of a Palestinian baby and his parents in an arson attack; and Yosef Haim Ben David, who was convicted of abducting and killing a 16-year-old Palestinian boy in Jerusalem in 2014. The group also assists an extremist ultra-Orthodox man who fatally stabbed a 16-year-old Israeli girl at Jerusalem’s gay pride parade in 2015.

            A spokesman for Shlom Asiraich slammed down the phone twice when he was called by The Associated Press for comment on Thursday.

            It's not clear when the U.S. fundraising efforts on behalf of Shlom Asiraich began. Being a relatively new organization, the group's official filing to Israel’s nonprofit registry provides little data and does not indicate how much money it has raised. But in its promotional flyers, recently broadcast by Israeli Channel 13 news, the organization indicated it has raised 150,000 shekels, or about $43,000. 

            It's also not clear how much of that money was raised in the U.S. by World of Tzedaka, a group that assists Jewish families in distress, according to its website. Lakewood, New Jersey, is home to a sizeable Orthodox Jewish community.

            Cohen, the World of Tzedaka representative, said his group had raised just $200 for Shlom Asiraich before the connection was halted, though that figure could not be verified.

            “It didn’t really get off the ground that much. Then we started hearing some questionable information about them. Then rabbis advised to stop doing business with them, so we did,” he said. 

            Just when the break happened isn’t clear. Cohen said it happened “a few months” ago after “a few people locally” brought the connection to their attention.

            But he couldn’t specify when, and a link on the Shlom Asiraich website that connects to the World of Tzedaka donation page was still working when the AP-Shomrim investigation was published on Jan. 24. Another link directly on World of Tzedaka’s website has also disappeared.

            “We removed them from our website, and we asked them to remove our name from their website and whatever they had and we completely separated from them,” Cohen said. 

            Israeli universities, hospitals and charities often have fund-raising operations in the U.S., but activities like those of extremist groups like Shlom Asiraich are rare.

            It is not known whether Shlom Asiraich or World of Tzedaka broke any U.S. laws. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s rules for fund-raising by nonprofit organizations are vague – saying the groups cannot exert political influence or benefit private interests.

            The IRS declined to comment on the case. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the reports about Shlom Asiraich, but referred questions to the Justice Department.

            “We condemn extremist violence in all its forms,” the State Department said.

            The Justice Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

            Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new far-right government took office in late December, giving ultranationalists and extremist lawmakers unprecedented power. There is no direct link between Shlom Asiraich and the government, though its registration with Israeli authorities was handled by a top aide to Israel’s ultranationalist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir.

Another link directly on World of Tzedaka’s website has also disappeared.“We removed them from our website, and we asked them to remove our name from their website and whatever they had and we completely separated from them,” Cohen said.Israeli universities, hospitals and charities often have fund-raising operations in the U.S., but activities like those of extremist groups like Shlom Asiraich are rare.It is not known whether Shlom Asiraich or World of Tzedaka broke any U.S. laws. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s rules for fund-raising by nonprofit organizations are vague – saying the groups cannot exert political influence or benefit private interests.The IRS declined to comment on the case. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the reports about Shlom Asiraich, but referred questions to the Justice Department.“We condemn extremist violence in all its forms,” the State Department said.The Justice Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new far-right government took office in late December, giving ultranationalists and extremist lawmakers unprecedented power. There is no direct link between Shlom Asiraich and the government, though its registration with Israeli authorities was handled by a top aide to Israel’s ultranationalist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir.___This article was published in partnership with Shomrim, The Center for Media and Democracy in Israel.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798737,US reunites nearly 700 kids taken from parents under Trump,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Biden administration task force designed to reunite children separated from their families during President Trump's presidency has reconnected nearly 700 children with their families, officials said Thursday.

            President Joe Biden issued an executive order on his first day in office to reunite families that were split up under the Trump administration’s widely condemned practice of forcibly separating parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border to discourage illegal immigration. Thursday marked the two-year anniversary of the task force.

            According to figures released by the Department of Homeland Security, 3,881 children were separated from their families from 2017 to 2021. About 74% of those have been reunited with their families: 2,176 before the task force was created and 689 afterward.











            But that still leaves nearly 1,000 children. Of those, 148 are in the reunification process. The department pledged to continue the work until all separated families that can be found have the opportunity to reunite with their children.

            The Trump administration separated thousands of migrant parents from their children as it moved to criminally prosecute people for illegally crossing the southwestern border. Minors, who could not be held in criminal custody with their parents, were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. They were then typically sent to live with a sponsor, often a relative or someone else with a connection to the family.

            Hundreds of families have sued the federal government. 

            
                Families can register for reunification services through a website and can get help with steps such as applying for humanitarian parole that would allow them to come to the U.S., as well as for behavioral health services to help them. 

            During a meeting Thursday with reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas discussed efforts to address “the wounds” the separations had caused. 

            He describing meeting the mother of a teenager who had been separated from her mom when she was 13 and then reunited with her when she was 16. But Mayorkas said, the woman relayed how her teenage daughter “still could not understand how her mother would let her be separated. She didn’t understand the force behind the separation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798738,"Starbucks misses sales, revenue estimates as China falters","Starbucks reported lower-than-expected sales in its fiscal first quarter, with COVID store shutdowns in China overshadowing stronger results elsewhere.

            Global same-store sales — or sales at stores open at least a year — were up 5% in the October-December period, but that was partly due to higher prices. Store transactions were down 2%. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast a 6.7% increase in same-store sales.

            During a conference call with investors, Starbucks' interim CEO Howard Schultz said China's decision to end its zero-COVID policy in December caused a spike in infections that closed nearly 30% of Starbucks' 6,000 stores at its peak. Same-store sales plunged 29%.











            But Schultz said Starbucks remains optimistic about China, its second-largest market outside the U.S. As of this week, all of Starbucks’ stores in China are open without restrictions for the first time since March 2020. Schultz said the company remains on track to have 9,000 stores in China by the end of 2025.

            In the U.S., same-store sales were up 10% as customers spent more per order. And Starbucks noted that its Holiday Red Cup day in November was its highest single sales day of all time despite strikes at more than 100 U.S. stores by employees who are pressing to unionize. But overall U.S. transactions rose just 1%, and Starbucks said transactions per store remain below pre-COVID levels.

            Schultz said the quarter was softer for overall retail, which impacted customer traffic. U.S. retail sales slowed more than expected during the holiday season as higher borrowing costs and higher inflation made shoppers pull back.

            But he said consumers didn't seem to be shying away from the store due to price increases. Starbucks raised its prices around 6% in 2022, but said those increases will moderate this year as U.S. inflationary pressures recede.

            “We don’t see ourselves in a situation where we need to discount heavily and we don’t see a situation where our customers are trading down,"" Schultz said.

            Chief Financial Officer Rachel Ruggeri said an ongoing revamp designed to improve U.S. store efficiency could help boost U.S. traffic. The company plans to invest $450 million this year in store improvements, including new warming ovens and workstations that make it simpler to assemble drinks. Employees have been struggling with rising demand for customizable cold drinks in store kitchens designed for simpler hot drinks.

            The store revamp is also an attempt to boost employee morale as Starbucks tries to head off a growing unionization movement. At least 274 of Starbucks’ 9,000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize since 2021.

            Starbucks' revenue rose 8% to a record $8.7 billion, but that also fell short of analysts’ expectation of $8.79 billion. Earnings of 74 cents per share were also lower than the 77 cents analysts had forecast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798739,"Alphabet posts lower Q4 profit amid ad squeeze, competition","Google's parent company Alphabet on Thursday posted lower profit and a small revenue increase for last year's fourth quarter, as a decline in online ad spending and competition from rivals weigh on the search giant. 

            While overall revenue grew, advertising revenue fell by nearly 4% and revenue at YouTube declined 8% year-over-year. That appeared to spook investors, who sent the company's stock lower in after-hours trading.

            The company based in Mountain View, California, said it earned $13.62 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the October-December quarter. That's down 34% from $20.64 billion, or $1.53 per share, in the same period a year earlier. 











            Revenue inched 1% higher to $76.05 billion from $75.33 billion. 

            Analysts expected Alphabet to post earnings of $1.18 per share on revenue of $76.2 billion for period, according to FactSet Research.

            Alphabet, like Facebook parent Meta, Amazon and other tech companies, is navigating a rough economic patch that's especially hurting the online advertising market. 

            Last month, Alphabet announced it was cutting 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its workforce. It was the company’s biggest-yet round of layoffs and adds to tens of thousands of other job losses recently announced by Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other tech companies that are tightening their belts in the face of a darkening outlook for the industry.

            In response to the layoffs, Google's unionized workers, members of the Alphabet Workers Union-CWA rallied outside of the company's New York City office during the company's earnings call.

            “Alphabet is one of the most profitable companies in the world, and well positioned to weather any economic storm. Yet instead our executives decided to layoff 12,000 of our coworkers, including many on medical or parental leave, as well as many with over a decade of loyal service,” the union said in a statement. 

            Alphabet is contending with a “challenging” economic climate and is working to reengineer its cost structure to build “financially sustainable, vibrant growing businesses” across the company, CEO Sundar Pichai said.

            “Our long-term investments in deep computer science make us extremely well-positioned as AI reaches an inflection point, and I’m excited by the AI-driven leaps we’re about to unveil in search and beyond,"" Pichai said in a statement. 

            Google is facing some competition in artificial intelligence from Microsoft, which last month announced it is making a “multiyear, multibillion dollar investment” in the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, the maker of the wildly popular ChatGPT and other tools that can write readable text and generate new images.

            The technology could help Microsoft’s own search engine, Bing, compete with Google in answering search queries with more complete answers instead of just links. 

            Pichai also touted “great momentum"" in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and Pixel devices, signaling to investors that Alphabet has plenty revenue sources outside of advertising to grow its business. 

            Nonetheless, advertising still makes up the bulk of Alphabet's revenue. 

            Beyond the economic squeeze, Google is also facing regulatory pressure. Last month, the Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government.

            The government alleged in the complaint that Google is looking to “neutralize or eliminate” rivals in the online ad marketplace through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors’ offerings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798742,Hurts ready for historic Super Bowl matchup with Mahomes,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Brandon Graham laughed as he recalled all the doubters who rushed him during the offseason and blurted out the same question — the main concern, really — about the state of the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback.

            “What’s Jalen going to do?” said Graham, the strip-sacking defensive end.

            Yes, it's hard to remember now, but Jalen Hurts was a bit of a mystery headed into his second full season as the starting QB. His solid 2021 season was marred by a poor playoff performance against Tampa Bay (that included two crushing interception) and reports of a rough go at organized team activities.











            So the question raised around Philly really was, what’s Jalen going to do?

            “I don’t know how many times I got that from fans, even some media people,” Graham said. “'I don’t know, the X-factor factor is Jalen. We don’t know what Jalen is going to do.'”

            How about take the Eagles to the brink of their second Super Bowl championship?

            Hurts launched the Eagles from preseason 30-1 odds to win the Super Bowl to staking them as 1 1/2-point favorites against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.

            As the seconds ticked down in the NFC championship victory over San Francisco, Graham and Fletcher Cox embraced Hurts on the sideline. Just a couple of defensive stalwarts who wanted to thank the quarterback that made it all happen.

            “I was just telling him, I appreciate him because of all the things that he had to overcome this year,” Graham said. “You didn’t see him get rattled not one time. Man, I’m going to fight for a guy like that every time.”

            The only true setback this season was a sprained right shoulder that cost Hurts two games. He still is playing through it; Hurts was a modest 15-of-25 passing for 121 yards and ran for 39 yards and a touchdown against the 49ers. The 24-year-old Hurts has downplayed the severity of the injury from the beginning. He simply said Thursday, “I’m getting there.”

            The AFC champion Chiefs are prepared for Hurts at full speed.

            “This is the Jalen Hurts Show at the end of the day,” defensive end Frank Clark said. “If you can stop what he’s doing, you can possibly slow them down. But he’s playing some great football.”

            Hurts is appreciative of the magnitude of the moment. Mahomes and Hurts are both Texas natives. They are both NFL MVP finalists. And they will be the first Black QBs to face off in a Super Bowl.

            Hurts said he tried to live up to the trail blazed in Philadelphia by fellow Black quarterbacks such as Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Randall Cunningham. While they are the most notable names, Rodney Peete and Vince Young were also Black starting QBs in Philly.

            Hurts was honored to match up with Mahomes.

            “I think it’s history. I think it’s something that’s worthy of being noted,” Hurts said.

            The Chiefs beat the Eagles in October 2021 when Hurts threw for 387 yards and two touchdowns. Mahomes? Well, he threw for five. But the game was one of the earliest signs that Hurts would grow into the man in Philly.

            “He had a great game this day,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said, “but he continues to get better.”

            The Eagles stunned their fans when they drafted Hurts out of Oklahoma in the second round in 2020. They seemingly had Carson Wentz entrenched at QB and had more pressing needs. Hurt was expected to serve as insurance for Wentz. Instead, he supplanted him. Now the Eagles are on the road to Glendale, Arizona.

            “When we drafted him, it was the upside we were banking on,” Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said. “We thought he had a huge upside. It takes a couple years. And somebody so dedicated as Jalen and such a great teammate, inevitably he is going to maximize everything he has and that’s what he’s done.”

            The only mystery surrounding Hurts these days is just how much he can maximize his next contract. Hurts is due for a raise and he’s going to get paid. Mahomes agreed in July 2020 to a 10-year extension worth up to $503 million. The deal is worth $477 million in guarantee mechanisms and included a no-trade clause and opt-out clauses if guarantee mechanisms aren’t met. What’s Hurts worth? Try in the neighborhood of $50 million a season when it’s time to negotiate his second contract.

            The only hiccup might be the length. The NFL’s salary cap will be $224.8 million in 2023, an increase of $16.6 million. At that rate, Hurts could be in his late 20s when the cap creeps toward $300 million and there’s more room to spend.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Brandon Graham laughed as he recalled all the doubters who rushed him during the offseason and blurted out the same question — the main concern, really — about the state of the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback.“What’s Jalen going to do?” said Graham, the strip-sacking defensive end.Yes, it's hard to remember now, but Jalen Hurts was a bit of a mystery headed into his second full season as the starting QB. His solid 2021 season was marred by a poor playoff performance against Tampa Bay (that included two crushing interception) and reports of a rough go at organized team activities.So the question raised around Philly really was, what’s Jalen going to do?“I don’t know how many times I got that from fans, even some media people,” Graham said. “'I don’t know, the X-factor factor is Jalen. We don’t know what Jalen is going to do.'”How about take the Eagles to the brink of their second Super Bowl championship?Hurts launched the Eagles from preseason 30-1 odds to win the Super Bowl to staking them as 1 1/2-point favorites against Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.As the seconds ticked down in the NFC championship victory over San Francisco, Graham and Fletcher Cox embraced Hurts on the sideline. Just a couple of defensive stalwarts who wanted to thank the quarterback that made it all happen.“I was just telling him, I appreciate him because of all the things that he had to overcome this year,” Graham said. “You didn’t see him get rattled not one time. Man, I’m going to fight for a guy like that every time.”The only true setback this season was a sprained right shoulder that cost Hurts two games. He still is playing through it; Hurts was a modest 15-of-25 passing for 121 yards and ran for 39 yards and a touchdown against the 49ers. The 24-year-old Hurts has downplayed the severity of the injury from the beginning. He simply said Thursday, “I’m getting there.”The AFC champion Chiefs are prepared for Hurts at full speed.“This is the Jalen Hurts Show at the end of the day,” defensive end Frank Clark said. “If you can stop what he’s doing, you can possibly slow them down. But he’s playing some great football.”Hurts is appreciative of the magnitude of the moment. Mahomes and Hurts are both Texas natives. They are both NFL MVP finalists. And they will be the first Black QBs to face off in a Super Bowl.Hurts said he tried to live up to the trail blazed in Philadelphia by fellow Black quarterbacks such as Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Randall Cunningham. While they are the most notable names, Rodney Peete and Vince Young were also Black starting QBs in Philly.Hurts was honored to match up with Mahomes.“I think it’s history. I think it’s something that’s worthy of being noted,” Hurts said.The Chiefs beat the Eagles in October 2021 when Hurts threw for 387 yards and two touchdowns. Mahomes? Well, he threw for five. But the game was one of the earliest signs that Hurts would grow into the man in Philly.“He had a great game this day,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said, “but he continues to get better.”The Eagles stunned their fans when they drafted Hurts out of Oklahoma in the second round in 2020. They seemingly had Carson Wentz entrenched at QB and had more pressing needs. Hurt was expected to serve as insurance for Wentz. Instead, he supplanted him. Now the Eagles are on the road to Glendale, Arizona.“When we drafted him, it was the upside we were banking on,” Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie said. “We thought he had a huge upside. It takes a couple years. And somebody so dedicated as Jalen and such a great teammate, inevitably he is going to maximize everything he has and that’s what he’s done.”The only mystery surrounding Hurts these days is just how much he can maximize his next contract. Hurts is due for a raise and he’s going to get paid. Mahomes agreed in July 2020 to a 10-year extension worth up to $503 million. The deal is worth $477 million in guarantee mechanisms and included a no-trade clause and opt-out clauses if guarantee mechanisms aren’t met. What’s Hurts worth?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798743,"Michigan man says son, 6, ordered $1K in food from Grubhub","CHESTERFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan man says he was left with a $1,000 bill after his 6-year-old son ordered a virtual smorgasbord of food from several restaurants last weekend, leading to a string of unexpected deliveries — and maybe a starring role in an ad campaign.

            Keith Stonehouse said the food piled up quickly at his Detroit-area home Saturday night after he let his son, Mason, use his cellphone to play a game before bed. He said the youngster instead used his father's Grubhub account to order food from one restaurant after another.

            The boy's mother, Kristin Stonehouse, told The Associated Press on Thursday that Grubhub has reached out to the family and offered them a $1,000 gift card. The company also is considering using the family in an online promotional campaign, she said. Grubhub officials did not immediately respond to a message from the AP seeking comment.











            Keith Stonehouse said he was alone with his son while his wife was at the movies when Mason ordered jumbo shrimp, salads, shawarma and chicken pita sandwiches, chili cheese fries and other foods that one Grubhub driver after another delivered to their Chesterfield Township home.

            “This was like something out of a ‘Saturday Night Live’ skit,” Keith Stonehouse told MLive.com.

            He added: ""I don’t really find it funny yet, but I can laugh with people a little bit. It’s a lot of money and it kind of came out of nowhere.”

            Keith Stonehouse said his son ordered food from so many different places that Chase Bank sent him a fraud alert declining a $439 order from Happy’s Pizza. But Mason's $183 order of jumbo shrimp from the same restaurant went through and arrived at the family's house.

            Stonehouse said it took the arrival of a few orders of food for him to realize what was going on. By that time, there was nothing he could do to stop the orders from coming.

            Kristin Stonehouse told the AP that Mason is extremely intelligent and has been reading since he was 2 1/2 years old.

            “He's very smart,” she said. “He's not your average 6-year-old.”

            She said her husband had just used the Grubhub app on his phone to order dinner before she left and probably just left the app open. She said her son took the phone, hid in the basement and proceeded to order his feast.

            She said she and her husband had a talk with Mason on Sunday morning and told him what he did was akin to stealing.

            “I don't think he grasped that concept at first,” she said.

            To drive the point home, she and her husband opened up Mason's piggy bank and pocketed the $115 he had gotten for his birthday in November, telling him the money would go to replenish their accounts. That didn't seem to faze the boy.

            “Then he found a penny on the floor and said he could start all over again,” she said.

            Keith Stonehouse said most of the food went into the family’s refrigerators. He said he also invited some neighbors over to eat some of it.

            He said he’s heard of things like this happening to other parents, but not at the level he experienced last weekend. He recommends making sure important apps are not readily available for children to click on when they’re using a parent's phone. He said he’s changing his password.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798744,Interior: $580M headed to 15 tribes to fulfill water rights,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Fifteen Native American tribes will get a total of $580 million in federal money this year for water rights settlements, the Biden administration announced Thursday.

            The money will help carry out the agreements that define the tribes' rights to water from rivers and other sources and pay for pipelines, pumping stations, and canals that deliver it to reservations. 

            “Water rights are crucial to ensuring the health, safety and empowerment of Tribal communities,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement Thursday that acknowledged the decades many tribes have waited for the funding.











            Access to reliable, clean water and basic sanitation facilities on tribal lands remains a challenge across many Native American reservations.

            The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1908 that tribes have rights to as much water as they need to establish a permanent homeland, and those rights stretch back at least as long as any given reservation has existed. As a result, tribal water rights often are senior to others' in the West, where competition over the dwindling resource is often fierce.

            But in many cases, details about those water rights were not specified and have had to be determined in the modern era.

            Many tribes opted for settlements because litigation over water can be expensive and drawn out, with negotiations involving states, cities, private water users, local water districts and others that can take years, if not decades.

            Of the funding announced Thursday, $460 million comes from the $2.5 billion set aside for Native American water rights settlements in the Biden administration's infrastructure bill. A federal fund created by Congress in 2009 to pay for water rights settlements will contribute the other $120 million.

            About $157 million will go to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana. The federal government signed the tribes' water rights compact in 2021 and promised over the following decade to fund the rebuilding of an irrigation project on the Flathead Indian Reservation constructed in the 1900s.

            Interior said Thursday's funding was part of the $1.9 billion trust created when Haaland signed the tribes' compact. 

            Tribal Council Chairman Tom McDonald said passage of the compact came “after work that stretches back 40 years.” 

            The Navajo Nation, which spans parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, will receive $137 million for an ongoing project to bring drinking water to members in northwestern New Mexico and the city of Gallup. The project, expected to be completed in 2027, is a network of pipelines and pumping stations that will deliver treated water from the San Juan River, which flows through the deserts of northwestern New Mexico. 

            About $39 million is headed to the Navajo Nation for a separate settlement that will fund drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County, a part of the 27,000-square-mile (71,000-square kilometer) reservation that is in Utah.

            Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren, in a statement, called water the tribe's “most critical resource"" and said it was ""time to move forward” with both infrastructure projects. 

            The Gila River Indian Community in Arizona will get $79 million this year, which the tribe's Gov. Stephen Lewis said would help its water conservation efforts amid stubborn drought in the West. The funding will help finish construction of an irrigation system on the reservation. 

            Lewis said the funding was also a nod to the “role that tribal governments ... play in being good stewards for our water and other natural resources.” 

            Elsewhere, the Blackfeet Nation in Montana will receive $45 million for a settlement that was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2016 and called for improvements to irrigation systems and the development of a community water system.

            The Crow Nation, San Carlos Apache Nation, Southern Ute Indian Tribe, Ak-Chin Indian Community and Pueblos of San Ildefonso, Nambe, Pojoaque, and Tesuque are among other tribes sharing in the money announced Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798745,"Ford 4Q profit drops 90%, company says more cost cuts coming","DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. reported Thursday that its fourth-quarter net income fell 90% from a year earlier, leading company officials to say the automaker's costs are too high and to pledge more belt-tightening this year.

            CEO Jim Farley said Ford should have done better last year, and it left $2 billion in profits on the table that were within its control. He said Ford will correct that with improved urgency and execution this year.

            “These are the simple facts, and to say I'm frustrated is an understatement, because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford,” Farley said.











            The company, he said, is transforming its product development, manufacturing and supply-chain management to reduce costs, at the same time it's shifting to electric vehicles. 

            “We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out,” he said. “The strength of our products and revenue has masked this dysfunctionality for a long time.”

             The global shortage of computer chips and other parts hit Ford hard at the end of last year, costing it production of roughly 100,000 vehicles that could have been sold, Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters.

            “Our cost structure is not competitive, and our quality is not where it needs to be,” Lawler said. He and Farley said there will be more white-collar layoffs, and the company needs to cut manufacturing and warranty costs. 

            Lawler said about $1 billion of the $2 billion in lost profits was due to lower production and lost sales, the other $1 billion was in operational costs. He attributed about 60% of the production problem to the chip shortage, with the rest coming from parts suppliers who had trouble ramping up factories.

            “It’s something that we need to do a better job managing through,” he said, adding that it’s “hand-to-hand combat” securing chips. 

            To fix the problem, Ford will work with chip suppliers and brokers, as well as redesign car computers to use different chips that are more abundant. “It’s about being as flexible as we can,” he said.

            For this year, Lawler sees industry sales volumes in the U.S. rising to about 15 million vehicles, which should help Ford with increased sales, especially for its newer models, Lawler said.

            Lawler also said Ford sees a mild recession in the U.S. this year and a moderate one in Europe.

            But in addition to the recessions, Ford sees higher interest rates, lower pension income, lower profits for its credit arm and currency fluctuations as headwinds this year.

            The company sees vehicle prices falling about 5% this year as automakers increase discounts and other incentives while vehicle supplies improve. Some of that will come from dealers, and some from Ford, Lawler said.

            The Dearborn, Michigan, automaker said it made $1.26 billion from October through December, with revenue up 17% to $44 billion. The company made an adjusted 51 cents per share, falling short of Wall Street estimates of 62 cents.

            Quarterly revenue, however, exceeded estimates of $41.39 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.

            To be sure, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were inflated by one-time items such as the $8.2 billion increase in Ford’s investment in electric vehicle startup Rivian as its stock price skyrocketed.

            For all of 2022, Ford posted a $2 billion net loss, which it attributed largely to one-time items. During the year, the investment in Rivian dropped $7.4 billion as its stock value plummeted. The company also had a $2.7 billion drop in its stake in autonomous vehicle unit Argo AI, which was disbanded last year.

            Ford declared a first-quarter dividend of 80 cents per share, attributing it to strong cash flow and a profit it made on sale of the Rivian investment.

            Ford, which announced earnings after Thursday’s closing bell, saw its shares fall 6.3% in after-hours trading.

            Before taxes last year the company made $10.4 billion, below its guidance of $11.5 billion. 

            The company said it expects pretax earnings of $9 billion to $11 billion this year, below last year's estimates. 

            Pretax income in North America rose $1.8 billion to $9.2 billion. That means roughly 56,000 unionized factory workers will see profit-sharing checks of $9,176 in March, about $1,800 more than they got last year. 

            Ford’s sales in the U.S., its most profitable market, dropped 5% during the fourth quarter as the company was hit hard by parts shortages along with other automakers. 

            Strong prices for Ford vehicles helped to offset declining sales. Customers paid an average of $56,143 for company vehicles in the fourth quarter, about 10% more than the previous year, according to Edmunds.com. Many of those sales were high-end trucks and SUVs.DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co. reported Thursday that its fourth-quarter net income fell 90% from a year earlier, leading company officials to say the automaker's costs are too high and to pledge more belt-tightening this year.CEO Jim Farley said Ford should have done better last year, and it left $2 billion in profits on the table that were within its control.

            Officers had responded around 12:40 p.m. to a call about a “dangerous situation” in a residence, the department said. When police tried to make contact, a person in the house fired multiple gunshots. It wasn't immediately clear if he was shooting at the officers.











            Police haven't said if anyone was injured. Multiple agencies were at the home assisting police.

            Hood River is a city of about 8,000 on a bluff over the Columbia River, about an hour east of Portland, Oregon. It’s known as a mecca for windsurfing and kiteboarding, wineries, as well as fruit orchards and beautiful scenery in the Columbia River Gorge. It's also near Mount Hood, and many visit the area for winter sports.

            The initial law enforcement bulletin about an “active shooter” in the quaint town instead appeared to be a standoff between one person and police. Residents soon returned to normal activities after several hours of a lockdown that sowed fear and confusion in the community.

            Staff at the Lone Pine Motel near the suspect's home told KGW-TV that police said they were working to locate a shooter. 

            Nearby Dairy Queen employees said the restaurant was shut down, and the area was being evacuated.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798747,Jessy Wilson on 'Keep Rising' anthem and the hope it brings,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Singer-songwriter Jessy Wilson was ready to give up her musical dream when a film about female African warriors showed her the power of perseverance.

            Wilson’s Grammy -nominated song “Keep Rising,” was picked by director Gina Prince-Bythewood to be featured in her action epic “The Woman King.”

            Wilson and her co-writers Angelique Kidjo and Jeremy Lutito are nominated alongside Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Billie Eilish in the category of best song written for visual media during Sunday's ceremony.











            “'The Woman King’ really brought me back to life, truly,” said Wilson.

            The anthemic, uplifting song came after the darkest period in Wilson’s life. The pandemic had left her questioning her career after decades of singing and writing not only for her own records, but for other artists as well.

            When she and her husband found out she was pregnant in 2021, Wilson was ready to devote her attention instead to being a mother. But four months into her pregnancy, she had a miscarriage.

            “Sometimes in life, you can just hit a patch and you feel like, ‘This is it. This is going to take me out. This is going to be the way I am forever. I’m going to always be depressed. I’m going to always feel dark and like I can’t see my way up from here,’” Wilson recalls.

            The song, which she had written months prior, reminded her of the need to hold onto hope. “It was just sort of this two-way sensation, this two-way nuance thing for me of like speaking to people, but also speaking to myself,” Wilson said.

            The Brooklyn-born Wilson has been performing since she was 7 in musical theater and in clubs in New York. She was a backup singer for Alicia Keys, then started working with John Legend, who encouraged her to start songwriting.

            “He is such a phenomenal songwriter and a lot of the ways that I approach songwriting today is because I watched him from start to finish, how he developed the song and how it was conceived and all of those things,” Wilson said.

            Legend invited her to a songwriting trip to Nashville, Tennessee, to write with country star Faith Hill and felt so encouraged by the musical community there that she later relocated.

            In Nashville, she explored different musical interests, forming a rootsy rock duo with singer Kallie North called Muddy Magnolias and then working with The Black Keys’ Patrick Carney for her solo record “Phase” in 2019. 

            “It was an artistic statement and it’s a beautiful, beautiful album,” said Wilson “And I’m super proud of the chances that I’m willing to take as an artist along my journey.”

            Right around the same time as she was working on her solo album, she got a message on Instagram from rapper and producer Tyler, The Creator, who asked her to help him with background vocals on his 2019 critically acclaimed “Igor” record. That record went on to win best rap album at the Grammy Awards in 2020.

            But the pandemic upturned her career and life. Her father, a health care worker in New York, caught COVID-19 in April 2020, when the city was hit hard by the deadly pandemic. He survived after days of being on a ventilator.

            She couldn’t perform and songwriting over Zoom left her uninspired. But before she left her publishing deal, she recorded an unfinished version of “Keep Rising.”

            With input from Prince-Bythewood and the studio, lyrics were added to fit the film’s storyline of a West African kingdom led by an all-female group of warriors. They also brought in Kidjo, the hugely influential activist and Grammy-winning singer, to sing along with Wilson.

            Wilson said she immediately connected on a personal level to the film’s cast of darker-skinned Black women, including actors like Oscar-winner Viola Davis.

            “I definitely experienced being told that I wasn’t the right kind of pretty or the right kind of marketable because of my skin tone,” said Wilson. “And it was really empowering to see a cast full of beautiful brown women existing in their power, existing in their strength and intelligence.”

            The signs from the universe seemed to be telling her that she shouldn’t give up on her music. The day that she heard from the studio that her song was going to be in the movie was the due date for her son, Willing Reve. Now she's writing again and hopes “The Woman King” opens more doors for her to write songs for films.

            “I still have so much to say. My voice is important,” she said. “And I should, like the song says, keep rising.”NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798748,Defensemen are in very short supply at NHL All-Star Game,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — There have been 296 players listed as defensemen who have appeared in the NHL so far this season.

            Only six are All-Stars.

            Such is the reality for those who play hockey’s most thankless position, one where a player is rarely called upon to score and usually gets noticed only for screwing up. The format of the NHL All-Star Game — where teams will play 3-on-3 in a tournament between teams representing divisions — doesn’t really spark an overwhelming need for defensemen. 











            It’s about scoring, flair, finesse, getting to open space and making the world’s best goaltenders sometimes look like sieves.

            There are some gritty guys in Sunrise, Florida, this weekend, sure. But at the All-Star Game, especially under these rules, grit need not apply. 

            And that means a bunch of All-Star-caliber players who play on the blue line might be on a beach somewhere this weekend, but not the beach events for All-Stars in South Florida.

            “It's just part of it,"" said Chicago defenseman Seth Jones, now a five-time All-Star selection. “I think you've seen a lot of defensemen have success in the 3-on-3. Obviously, some of the more electric players overall are forwards.""

            The six defenseman picks this year — and it was five, until an injury replacement was named Thursday — is, based on the lists of past rosters provided by the NHL, an all-time All-Star low. There were seven last year, 10 in 2019 and 2020, 11 in 2018 and 12 in both 2016 and 2017.

            “I didn't know that, first off,"" said defenseman Cale Makar of the Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche. “But I think it's tough. Obviously, there could be 10 to 12 defensemen here. It's just the way the voting is now. That's how it goes. It's very cool to be recognized.""

            There wasn't going to be any defenseman standing out on the Atlantic Division team on Saturday — because there wasn't going to be any defenseman on the Atlantic Division roster. 

            That would have been an NHL first, an All-Star team without an All-Star defenseman. But the league fixed that Thursday, when Buffalo's Rasmus Dahlin was announced as the replacement for injured Sabres teammate Tage Thompson. Dahlin certainly earned the nod, with 55 points in 49 games, 24 of those points on the power play. No defenseman has more this season.

            “It's fun to watch him,"" Makar said. “He's so smart.""

            Adam Fox of the New York Rangers is the lone defenseman from the Metropolitan Division, getting his trip to All-Star weekend through a fan vote. San Jose’s Erik Karlsson — by far the leading scorer among those at his position with 66 points so far this season — is the only defenseman from the Pacific Division.

            The Central Division at least has some real representation. It has three defensemen on the 11-player roster — Jones, Makar and Winnipeg’s Josh Morrissey.

            “It's a huge honor, first and foremost, for me,"" Morrissey said. “I look at the names that are here — defensemen, forwards, goalies — and it's pretty cool to be in that company. There's a lot of players who could be here, too, that aren't here. The league's so talented and there's so many good players, so many good defensemen too, who aren't here. But it's a big honor to be one of those guys and enjoy my first All-Star game.""

            Morrissey is an avid stick collector. A neat perk of his All-Star trip: He's going to take another shot at getting a stick from Pittsburgh star Sidney Crosby. He's been unsuccessful in past attempts.

            “I'll try it,"" Morrisey said.

            The numbers show how defensemen get the short end of the hockey stick when it comes to being able to tout being an All-Star. Out of all the players who have logged at least one game in the NHL this season, 9.2% of the goaltenders are All-Stars, 5.5% of the forwards are All-Stars — but only 2% of the defensemen.

            All-Star weekends have never exactly been geared toward showcasing great defensemen. They’ve handed out an All-Star MVP award 51 times and it’s been won by a defenseman exactly twice – Ray Bourque in 1996 and Bobby Orr in 1972.

            Wayne Gretzky has three MVP awards by himself. So does Mario Lemieux. And Makar was asked if he'll have a shot at being the leading scorer Saturday — which would likely give him a chance at MVP honors.

            “Yeah, that won't be happening,"" Makar said. “I think I can almost guarantee that.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798749,Court: US needs to consider effects of drilling near Chaco,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A federal appeals court has sided with environmentalists, ruling that the U.S. government failed to consider the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the approval of nearly 200 drilling permits in an area surrounding Chaco Culture National Historical Park.

            Home to numerous sites significant to Native American tribes, the region has been a focal point of conflict over energy development that has spanned multiple presidential administrations. Now, environmentalists and some tribal leaders have accused the Biden administration of “rubber-stamping” more drilling.

            In a ruling issued Wednesday, a three-judge panel for the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that federal land managers violated the law by not accounting for the direct, indirect and cumulative effects of air pollution from oil and gas drilling.











            The court also put on hold the approval of additional drilling permits pending a decision from a lower court.

            Kyle Tisdel, a senior attorney with the Western Environmental Law Center, accused the Bureau of Land Management of prioritizing oil and gas extraction at the expense of those who live in northwestern New Mexico, including many Navajo communities. 

            “Frontline Diné communities and their allies were vindicated today in a step toward environmental justice. We will continue to demand justice, and that their water, health and the climate stop being sacrificed to big oil profits,” Tisdel said in a statement.

            Environmentalists have long complained about pollution from increased drilling, but the fight took on new urgency when Native American tribes began raising concerns that a spider web of drill pads, roads, processing stations and other infrastructure was compromising culturally significant sites beyond Chaco park’s boundaries.

            The Bureau of Land Management had an informal process of not leasing land within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of Chaco park to address those concerns.

            During the Obama administration, the Bureau of Indian Affairs for the first time joined federal land managers in planning how to manage resources. Following a visit by then-Interior Secretary David Bernhardt during the Trump administration, oil and gas leasing within a certain distance of the park was put on hold.

            Now, the U.S. Interior Department is considering formalizing the 10-mile buffer around the park, putting off limits to future development of more than 507 square miles (1,310 square kilometers) of federal mineral holdings.

            As part of the effort, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland — a member of Laguna Pueblo and the first Native American to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency — wants to create a system for including tribal perspectives and values when land management decisions are made. 

            She first detailed the steps her agency would be taking during a visit to Chaco park in November 2021. That process is ongoing.

            Much of the land surrounding the park belongs to the Navajo Nation or is owned by individual Navajos. While the federal government's planned 20-year withdrawal would not affect tribal lands, the Navajo Nation and allottees have expressed concerns about being landlocked and losing out on leasing revenue and royalties.

            There are about 23,000 active oil and gas wells in the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico. The BLM is required to approve an application for permit to drill before a developer can begin work. As part of that process, the agency typically prepares a site-specific environmental assessment to determine whether the project will have significant environmental effects.

            The judges noted their review was limited to only those applications for permits to drill that had already been approved by the Bureau of Land Management, not pending applications. 

            While the Bureau of Land Management's analysis of potential impacts to water resources was sufficient, the court noted that the agency was unreasonable in using one year of direct emissions to represent total emissions over the 20-year lifespan of a well.

            It will be up to a lower court to decide how the agency can fix deficiencies in the environmental assessments that sparked the legal challenge.ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798762,Six Nations: England launches new era against Scotland,"The oldest fixture in rugby union was, not so long ago, one of the most one-sided.

            From 1991-2007, England and Scotland met 29 times. Scotland won just three of the games — and all of those victories came in grim Edinburgh weather at its home of Murrayfield.

            How the tide has turned.











            The boys in blue crossed the border and headed south this week, looking to claim a fourth win in their last six meetings with the auld enemy when they face off at Twickenham on Saturday.

            It’s a match that launches not only the 2023 Six Nations but also a new era in English rugby. Steve Borthwick takes charge for the first time since replacing Eddie Jones as coach.

            The Calcutta Cup is often viewed as a bigger deal for Scotland.

            Maybe not this time.

            “We haven’t played a game yet,” England back-rower Sam Simmonds said, “but, within the few training sessions that we’ve had, it feels like we’re going in the right direction. There’s a buzz around the squad of excitement and enjoyment.

            “The first game against Scotland is huge.”

            Boos rang around Twickenham the last time England played there. That was in late November, at the end of the team’s 27-13 pumping by South Africa that spelt the end for Jones and his seven-year tenure.

            England’s players might get some more slack from the home fans on Saturday, as Borthwick is unlikely to get a slick performance straight out of the gate as he molds his own team (with eight changes) at the start of a Rugby World Cup year.

            A below-par performance might be accepted, even expected. Another loss isn’t.

            Scotland will be hit with the combined might of a full house and fired-up opponents eager to impress their new coach — factors that weren’t in play when the Scots won at an empty Twickenham in 2021 during the pandemic.

            Two years earlier, there was the epic, breathless 38-38 draw between the old foes. Before that, a string of unbroken, mostly comfortable England wins since the 12-12 draw in 1989.

            So Scotland cannot really relax. Not after a largely underwhelming 2022 where the high point was the first game of the year — an attritional home win over the English.

            “We’re in a good place,” said Scotland captain Jamie Ritchie, pointing to the domestic form of Edinburgh and Glasgow and what he saw as an encouraging autumn series featuring victories over Fiji and Argentina.

            Then there's the return of the mercurial Finn Russell at flyhalf now that he has patched up his differences with Scotland coach Gregor Townsend.

            Russell against Marcus Smith will be a must-watch head to-head.

            Townsend is wary of England, especially as the host might be changing game plans under Borthwick and new attack coach Nick Evans. Whatever it is — and Borthwick criticized England's lack of adaptability in the autumn — it doesn't include Manu Tuilagi.

            Tuilagi was the icebreaker Eddie Jones embraced when fit. But he and the outside backs struggled to be used while Jones bedded in Smith and Owen Farrell together. Smith and Farrell have survived but Tuilagi has been axed beside Jonny May and Jack Nowell.

            London Irish winger Ollie Hassell-Collins will make his England debut, along with Harlequins hooker Jack Walker if he comes off the bench. Prop Dan Cole has been recalled for the first time since the 2019 World Cup final.

            Townsend dropped Ali Price for in-form London Irish scrumhalf Ben White. Another Lion, center Chris Harris, has made way for Huw Jones, who has four tries against England. The game was a week too soon for recovering Lions forwards Zander Fagerson and Hamish Watson. Townsend was still bullish.

            ""Over the last five years we have been a good match for them,” Townsend said, “and I’m sure this will be competitive, too.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798763,Oregon man accused of stalking charged in accuser's killing,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An Oregon man has been charged with murder in the killing of a man who had accused him of stalking after the defendant allegedly had an affair with the victim's wife.

            Hillsboro police said they arrested Steven Milner on Tuesday in the killing of 56-year-old Kenneth Fandrich, an Intel contractor who was found dead in his car in a company parking garage last week.

            An autopsy revealed that Fandrich, of Oregon City, died from blunt compression trauma to the neck, police said.











            Milner, a 55-year-old retired veterinarian also of Oregon City, just south of Portland, had a stalking order that barred him from contact with Fandrich, according to police, who said there was “a history of problematic interactions between the two.""

            The conflict between the men began after Milner had an affair with Fandrich's wife while she was his employee, Fandrich alleged in a lawsuit filed in September against Milner.

            According to the lawsuit, which claimed emotional harm and invasion of privacy, Milner followed Fandrich's car, trespassed on his property, attached GPS tracking devices to his car and threatened to cut his body into pieces.

            “My client claims that he had been stalked for years,” KPTV quoted Fandrich's lawyer, Michael Fuller, as saying. “I think the lesson to be learned here is justice delayed is justice denied.”

            Shelley Aschenbrenner, a defense attorney appointed by the court to represent Milner, didn't immediately respond to a Thursday phone message seeking comment.PORTLAND, Ore.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798764,Apple suffers 1st quarterly sales decline in nearly 4 years,"Apple on Thursday posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season.

            The company's sales of $117 billion for the October-December period represented a 5% decline from the same time in the previous year, a deeper downturn than analysts had projected.

            It marks Apple’s first year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue since the January-March period in 2019 when sales also slipped 5% amid slowing iPhone demand and the fallout of a trade war with China that was being waged by then-President Donald Trump.











            Apple’s profit also eroded during the past quarter, even though the Cupertino, California, company remained a pillar of prosperity. Earnings totaled $30 billion, or $1.88 per share, a 13 decrease from the same time in the previous year. Those results also missed a target of $1.94 per share set by analysts polled by FactSet Research.

            Investors reacted to the letdown by initially driving down Apple's stock by nearly 5% in Thursday's extended trading. But management remarks made during a conference call with analysts raised hopes that Apple's disappointing performance may have been a mere hiccup, paring the decrease in the company's shares to less than 1%.

            Apple’s rare stumble came against a backdrop of renewed investor optimism about tech’s outlook for this year, helping to spur a 17% increase in the sector’s bellwether Nasdaq composite index so far this year.

            But now Wall Street seems likely to reassess things in light of Apple’s latest results and ongoing worries about a potential recession in the wake of rising interest rates aimed at tamping down inflation, said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.

            With Google also disclosing a year-over-year quarterly decline in its digital ad sales on Thursday alongside Apple's disappointing performance, Cohen said it's clear there are “several challenges the tech sector faces amid the current economic climate of slowing growth and elevated inflation.”

            Despite the quarterly downturn in its fortunes. Apple hasn’t signaled any intention to resort to mass layoffs — a stark contrast to its peers in technology. Industry giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta Platoforms have announced plans to jettison more than a combined 50,000 employees as they adjust to revenue slowdowns or downturns caused by people’s lessening dependence on the digital realm as the pandemic has eased. 

            “We manage for the long term,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts during the conference call. “We invest in innovation and people.” 

            Cook had tried to brace investors for tougher sledding in late October when he warned of “increasingly difficult economic conditions” heading into the holiday season. Then, just a few days later, Apple cautioned that China’s attempts to clamp down on the spread of COVID was affecting its production lines and would prevent meeting all the demand for the premium iPhone 14 models during the holidays.

            That contributed to an 8% decrease in iPhone sales from the previous year to $65.8 billion in the most recent quarter.

            Cook indicated Apple's supply headaches are now over, assuring analysts that “production is now back where we want it to be.""

            In another positive sign, Apple also disclosed that it now has more than 2 billion iPhones, iPads, Macs and other devices in active use for the first time. That is likely to help Apple sell more digital subscriptions and ads, helping to fuel long-term revenue growth.Apple on Thursday posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years after pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season.The company's sales of $117 billion for the October-December period represented a 5% decline from the same time in the previous year, a deeper downturn than analysts had projected.It marks Apple’s first year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue since the January-March period in 2019 when sales also slipped 5% amid slowing iPhone demand and the fallout of a trade war with China that was being waged by then-President Donald Trump.Apple’s profit also eroded during the past quarter, even though the Cupertino, California, company remained a pillar of prosperity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798765,"Amazon beats Q4 revenue estimates, but profits slump","NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon on Thursday reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter profits, but its revenue beat expectations boosted by sales in its cloud-computing unit AWS, which is also seeing a slow-down in growth. 

            Amazon said it earned $300 million, or 3 cents per share, in the October-December quarter. Industry analysts were expecting the Seattle-based company to earn 17 cents a share, according to FactSet.

            The e-commerce giant said its bottom line was dented by a $2.3 billion write-down of the value of its stock investment in electric vehicle startup Rivian Automotive. 











            Amazon's fourth quarter profits represent a significant drop from the $14.3 billion it posted during the same period in 2021, when the company had a nearly $12 billion gain from its investment in Rivian Automotive. 

            Shares in Amazon.com Inc. fell 4% in after-hours trading.

            At the same time, Amazon said its overall revenue rose 9% to $149.2 billion, higher than the $145.7 billion analysts were expecting. It said it expects revenue of between $121 billion and $126 billion during the current quarter. Analysts had been expecting $125 billion. 

            The earnings report closes a rough 2022 for Amazon. The company's stock lost nearly half of its value last year amid a broader sell-off of tech shares tied to rising inflation, interest rates and concerns about the wider economy. On Thursday, it posted a loss of $2.7 billion for the full-year. 

            “While some of this is down to the company’s investment in Rivian, which is putting significant pressure on the bottom line, it is also clear that a material slowdown across many parts of the business is causing considerable pain,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. 

            Amazon has been struggling to right-size its business in the past year as consumers pulled back from the pandemic-induced move towards online shopping. To keep up with the demand at the time, it boosted hiring at its corporate offices and its warehouses, nearly doubling its workforce to more than 1.6 million by the beginning of last year. 

            But as its retail business cooled, Amazon has been attempting to curb expenses that have outpaced sales in its North America and international businesses since the fourth quarter of 2021. It spent some of last year reducing its warehouse workforce through attrition, and canceling or delaying plans to open warehouses in different parts of the country. The company said Thursday its North America business grew by 13%, but expenses still outpaced growth.

            Amazon has been further tightening its budget by eliminating certain parts of its business and laying off workers in the past few months amid rising concerns about whether the U.S. will dip into a recession. In November, it began what would be the largest set of job cuts among its corporate offices, expected to be over 18,000 jobs in total, according to a note to employees by the company’s CEO Andy Jassy. Other tech companies that hired rapidly during the pandemic, including Facebook parent Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce, have also been cutting jobs. 

            Shoppers have been reducing their spending in recent months amid high inflation and wider economic uncertainty. Retail sales fell a worse-than-expected 1.1% in December, following a revised 1% drop in November, according to the Commerce Department.

            To entice budget-conscious shoppers, Amazon, along with other retailers, began offering holiday deals in October. The company said in November it saw its biggest ever Thanksgiving holiday shopping period. But Thursday’s report shows its online stores division fell by 2%.

            “We saw customers spend less in discretionary categories, shift to lower-priced items and value-brands,” Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said during a media call Thursday, adding the company was seeing lower growth rates internationally as consumers abroad feel the effects of high inflation and the economic repercussions of war in Ukraine.

            Amid the consumer pullback in online shopping, the company has relied on other profitable areas of its business to boost its revenue. Amazon’s advertising arm saw a 23% growth during the fourth quarter, but it's been slowing in growth as businesses cut their advertising costs. Meanwhile, its cloud-computing unit AWS grew by 20%, compared to 40% during the same period in 2021. Jassy said in an earnings call with analysts on Thursday that businesses that would use the service are being more cautious and looking for ways to save money. 

            “We’re going to help our customers find ways to spend less money,” he said. 

            Amazon's physical stores unit, which includes Whole Foods, grew by 6%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798767,Gatland wants focus on rugby as Wales meets top-ranked Irish,"For Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland, the Six Nations game against Ireland on Saturday cannot come soon enough.

            And that’s not just because it marks the start of the New Zealander’s second spell in charge of the national team.

            It also means, for many, the focus of Welsh rugby turns to exactly that — rugby.











            “Last week, there was only one topic of discussion and that was understandable,” Gatland said, referring to the scandal engulfing the Welsh Rugby Union following allegations of sexism, bullying and racism made in a scathing TV documentary.

            “This week, the message to the players is we have a test match to focus on. Rugby has been the only talking point and the players have been great in terms of that. It has been a bit of a challenge, but our whole focus is on Saturday.”

            After all, that’s what he was hired — again — for. To ignite the energy and spark in a Welsh team that appeared to be drifting under his predecessor, Wayne Pivac, less than a year out from the Rugby World Cup in France. Heck, Wales lost to Georgia in November.

            
                With Gatland back, excitement levels have been raised. Belief is back. That’s what happens when you bring in one of the world’s best coaches — perhaps the best of this generation.

            “I often get asked about the Welsh and what they are like,” he said. “They are very knowledgeable about the game, passionate and opinionated. And I love that.

            “The emotion is all about playing in an incredible stadium, with a passionate crowd and the buzz that you get from that. There is a lot of pressure, a lot of expectation, a lot of scrutiny — that comes with the role — but there is nothing better than playing in a full stadium with the intensity that is required.”

            Watch out, Ireland. A red tide is coming your way.

            Then again, this is an Irish team coming off a series win in New Zealand and a clean sweep of autumn victories over South Africa, Fiji and Australia. This is the world’s top-ranked nation, which — whisper it — might just be ready for a tilt at a first World Cup title.

            Indeed, for Ireland coach Andy Farrell, savoring the experience of playing in the white-hot atmosphere of the Principality Stadium is important for his players in the bigger picture.

            He's agreed, even though the weather forecast is dry, to close the stadium roof. That guarantees a wall of noise visitors often struggle with, but Farrell wants his players to bank the experience.

            “We've been there before when it's closed and there's no atmosphere like it. It’s fantastic. It can only be good for us,” Farrell said. “We want . . . to sample the atmosphere and keep progressing on our journey.”

            Understandably, Gatland has retained veterans he chided Pivac for not retiring, so there's new skipper Ken Owens, Alun Wyn Jones in his 17th Six Nations, Justin Tipuric, Taulupe Faletau, Dan Biggar and George North. Leigh Halfpenny was starting until he had a back spasm on Thursday. Liam Williams has come in at fullback despite limited training and match time.

            “I would love (Jones) to make the decision when he calls time but he is well aware of the needs of the team at the moment,” Gatland said.

            Farrell dropped tighthead prop Tadhg Furlong, who wasn't fully recovered from a calf issue and was being saved for the France clash next week. Australia-born Finlay Bealham will make his first Six Nations start at age 31.

            His and captain Jonathan Sexton's inclusion were the only changes to the side which beat Australia 13-10 in Ireland's last autumn test.

            More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsFor Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland, the Six Nations game against Ireland on Saturday cannot come soon enough.And that’s not just because it marks the start of the New Zealander’s second spell in charge of the national team.It also means, for many, the focus of Welsh rugby turns to exactly that — rugby.“Last week, there was only one topic of discussion and that was understandable,” Gatland said, referring to the scandal engulfing the Welsh Rugby Union following allegations of sexism, bullying and racism made in a scathing TV documentary.“This week, the message to the players is we have a test match to focus on. Rugby has been the only talking point and the players have been great in terms of that. It has been a bit of a challenge, but our whole focus is on Saturday.”After all, that’s what he was hired — again — for. To ignite the energy and spark in a Welsh team that appeared to be drifting under his predecessor, Wayne Pivac, less than a year out from the Rugby World Cup in France. Heck, Wales lost to Georgia in November.With Gatland back, excitement levels have been raised. Belief is back. That’s what happens when you bring in one of the world’s best coaches — perhaps the best of this generation.“I often get asked about the Welsh and what they are like,” he said. “They are very knowledgeable about the game, passionate and opinionated. And I love that.“The emotion is all about playing in an incredible stadium, with a passionate crowd and the buzz that you get from that. There is a lot of pressure, a lot of expectation, a lot of scrutiny — that comes with the role — but there is nothing better than playing in a full stadium with the intensity that is required.”Watch out, Ireland. A red tide is coming your way.Then again, this is an Irish team coming off a series win in New Zealand and a clean sweep of autumn victories over South Africa, Fiji and Australia. This is the world’s top-ranked nation, which — whisper it — might just be ready for a tilt at a first World Cup title.Indeed, for Ireland coach Andy Farrell, savoring the experience of playing in the white-hot atmosphere of the Principality Stadium is important for his players in the bigger picture.He's agreed, even though the weather forecast is dry, to close the stadium roof.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798768,"Doctor, GOP governor clash over private Medicaid discussion","JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said in a private conversation that expanding Medicaid to people working low-wage jobs would be in the best interest of the state, but that he refuses to support the policy for political reasons, a former chancellor of the University of Mississippi said Thursday.

            Dr. Dan Jones is a physician who led the University of Mississippi Medical Center before serving as chancellor of the university from 2009 to 2015. During a news conference organized by Democratic state lawmakers on Thursday, Jones said that Reeves acknowledged in a private conversation with him in 2013 or 2014 that expanding Medicaid would benefit Mississippi's economy, and provide health care to more residents of a state bedeviled by poor health outcomes. 

            Jones said he was trying to persuade Reeves, who was the lieutenant governor at the time, to take advantage of a 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama that allowed for Medicaid expansion, with the federal government covering most of the cost. Jones said the conversation took place in Jones' office at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. 











            “The governor after a few moments put his hands up and said, ‘Chancellor, I recognize that it would be good for Mississippians, that it would be good for our economy, good for health care to expand Medicaid,’"" Jones recounted. ""I had a big smile on my face, and I said ‘I’m glad to hear that and I’m glad to hear you’ll support Medicaid expansion.’ His response was, ‘Oh no, I’m not going to support it because it’s not in my personal political interest.’”

            Reeves wrote on Twitter Thursday that Jones' remarks were “obviously a lie.”

            ""I’d bet I hadn’t talked to this dude since well before he was fired by Ole Miss, and I never would have said this,"" Reeves wrote. “Do you believe he has held this ‘juicy scoop’ for 8 years? Through 2019? And remembered it just before a presser with Democrats in 2023?”

            Jones returned to the University of Mississippi Medical Center after the state college board chose not to renew his contract as chancellor. He retired two years ago, and said that since then, he has more freedom to speak publicly.

            Reeves is seeking a second term as governor this year. He has frequently said that he does not want to add people to a government health program. A Democrat running for governor, Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley, is making Medicaid expansion a central promise in his own campaign.

            During his State of the State speech Monday, Reeves said Mississippi should shore up health care resources by cutting bureaucracy, increasing medical residency programs and relying on technology.

            Mississippi is among 11 states that have not taken the option from the federal government to expand Medicaid coverage to people working low-wage jobs without health insurance. At least 15 bills that would have done so expired under a Tuesday deadline without a legislative debate or a vote in the Republican-controlled legislature. 

            Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality, infant mortality and pre-term birth rates. At a Jan. 13 legislative hearing, Dr. Daniel Edney, the state health officer, said Mississippi doesn’t have the medical workforce to address a wide range of poor health outcomes. Some hospitals are on the brink of permanent closure due to staff shortages and population decline in poor areas. 

            At the state Capitol on Thursday, Jones said he is sharing details about his conversation with Reeves now because he has never before seen Mississippi’s health care system under the strain it is now, even with a $4 billion surplus in the state budget.

            “Shame on us for allowing the citizens of Mississippi to have health care problems and not have access to health care solutions,” Jones said. “Shame on us in a state with billions of dollars in its coffers to not act on this to make health care available to all of our citizens. It is immoral.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798769,US condemns Sudan freeing man convicted in diplomat's death,"CAIRO (AP) — The United States asked the Sudanese government Thursday to re-arrest a man convicted of killing a U.S. diplomat in the country 15 years ago. 

            Abdel-Raouf Abu Zaid, the Sudanese man freed Jan. 30, was found guilty of murdering John Granville, an official with the U.S. Agency for International Development, and his Sudanese driver, Abdel Rahman Abbas.

            State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that Abu Zaid's release was based on untrue assertions.











            “The Sudanese claim that the Granville family had extended forgiveness is false,” Price said. “We call on the Sudanese government to exercise all available legal means to reverse this decision.” 

            Price emphasized that Abu Zaid's sentencing and imprisonment were not a part of a 2020 settlement between the U.S. and Sudan. 

            In 2020, Sudan agreed to pay $335 million to settle compensation lawsuits at U.S. courts related to the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the 2000 attack of the USS Cole at Yemen’s southern port of Aden that killed 17 sailors and Granville’s killing.

            The settlement was made by Sudan’s former transitional government with the Trump administration to stop any future compensation claims being filed against the African country in U.S. courts.

            Granville, 33, was working to implement a 2005 peace agreement between Sudan’s north and south that ended more than two decades of civil war. He was returning from a New Year Eve party when another vehicle intercepted his car and gunmen inside opened fire, killing Granville and Abbas, also a USAID employee. 

            Three other men were sentenced to hang along with Abu Zaid for the attack.

            The four broke out of prison in June 2010, killing a Sudanese police officer and wounding another in a shootout in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman, according to a Sudanese notice to the international police agency, Interpol. Abu Zaid was recaptured weeks later and returned to Kubar Prison. The three other men were not re-arrested. 

            Price said that Sudan's ambassador to the United States had been summoned and that other top diplomats would be pressing the Sudanese government in the coming weeks.

            Big-spending Chelsea hosts Fulham in the Premier League on Friday in its first match following the end of a record-breaking January transfer window, with Graham Potter looking to incorporate some of the expensive new signings into his struggling team. Chelsea completed the deadline day signing of Enzo Fernandez for a British record fee of $131.4 million and will hope he can inspire a turnaround in the team's form as it mounts a bid for Champions League qualification. 











            SPAIN

            Athletic Bilbao hosts Cadiz looking for its first Spanish league win since before the World Cup. Athletic is winless in five straight league games, with two draws and three consecutive defeats. Its last win in the competition was 3-0 at home against Valladolid in November. The Basque Country club, sitting in ninth place, did succeed in the Copa del Rey recently, making it to the semifinals for the fourth straight season. Cadiz's 2-0 league win against Mallorca last weekend was only its second victory in eight matches in all competitions. It sits just inside the relegation zone in the league.

Coach Xabi Alonso has given Bayer Leverkusen a lift since taking over in October but his momentum was checked last week in a 2-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund, ending a run of five wins. Now Leverkusen visits an Augsburg team which is on the fringes of the relegation fight. Augsburg signed no fewer than seven new players in the January transfer window, the most of any team in the league, on bargain deals and loans from across Europe. Coach Enrico Maassen faces the task of integrating them all into his squad.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798771,Guyana court sentences two pirates to death for 2018 attack,"GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) — A Guyanese court handed down death sentences for two men found guilty of high seas piracy attacks that killed seven fishermen off the nation’s coast in 2018, and authorities said they have broken the back of a deadly group that preyed on fishermen for years.

            Nakool Manohar, 45, and Premnauth Persaud, 48, were convicted of masterminding an attack on a group of fishing vessels in waters near the neighboring South American country of Suriname in a row over access to prime fishing grounds. Seven fishermen perished, while about a dozen others were rescued after drifting on the waters for days.

            Police said some of the men were thrown overboard with their hands tied or weighed down with boat batteries. Others were reportedly chopped with machetes or burned with hot engine oil and tossed into the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.











            Sentencing the men on Tuesday after a jury returned guilty verdicts, Justice Navindra Singh described the attacks as heinous, saying he found “no reason not to impose the death sentence.""

            “It would be reckless and irresponsible of the court to allow them to be released into society at any time,” the judge said.

            He called their actions “gruesome, heinous and cold-blooded” as he imposed death by hanging.

            The men can appeal the ruling to the local court of appeals and also to the Trinidad-based Caribbean Court of Justice, which is the final court for Guyana. Their lawyer declined to comment Thursday on their plans.

            While death by hanging is still on local law books, no one has been hanged in Guyana since 1997 and authorities have made no effort to enforce death sentences imposed by courts. More than a dozen people are on death row in Guyana, some sentenced as far back as two decades ago. 

            Authorities have so far resisted lobbying efforts from the European Union and other international rights groups to scrub hanging from the law books. In some cases, appeal courts have commuted sentences to life in prison as those on death row simply bide their time behind bars.

            Until the April 2018 attack, authorities had been battling such attacks along the southeastern coast with Suriname and less frequently in the northwest near Venezuela. Police at the time blamed Venezuelan gangs for the attacks.

            Police figures recorded almost 30 deaths from piracy in the past decade. But police regional commander Shiv Bacchus told The Associated Press on Thursday that piracy had not been a major problem in the Berbice border region with Suriname since the arrest of the suspects. 

            “For all of last year we had none. For this year, none as well. I must admit that the arrest and sentencing of those responsible had led to a 100% reduction,” Bacchus said.

            Bremer's first-half goal was enough to put Juventus into the semifinals of the competition with a 1-0 win over Lazio on Thursday, setting up a meeting with Inter Milan in a rematch of last year's final.

            Juventus broke the deadlock on the stroke of halftime when Bremer took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Luís Maximiano to head in a cross from Filip Kostić.











            Juventus came into the match on the back of a 2-0 loss at home to Monza in the league. That was preceded by a draw against Atalanta and a hefty 5-1 loss at Napoli.

            Its poor run of results and a 15-point penalty for false accounting has left it just 10 points above the Serie A relegation zone. 

            Juventus has won the Italian Cup a record 14 times, however, and also beat Lazio 3-0 in the league in November.

            The other semifinal pits Fiorentina against Cremonese, which surprisingly eliminated Roma on Wednesday. The two-legged semifinals take place in April.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798774,3 charged with clashing with cops in separate Jan. 6 cases,"Three men have been arrested on accusations that they clashed with police officers during separate incidents at the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, according to the U.S. Justice Department. 

            Federal prosecutors announced charges Wednesday against men from Vermont, Illinois and Pennsylvania — more than two years after the riot that halted the certification of President Joe Biden's electoral victory. Nearly 1,000 people across the U.S. have been charged with federal crimes in the Capitol attack and new arrests are still happening nearly every week. 

            William Nichols, 41, of Manchester, Vermont, was identified through a number of open-source videos and police body-camera images that showed him struggling with police officers outside the Capitol building, prosecutors said. 











            According to court papers, Nichols is seen in the footage engaging in “violent interactions"" with police officers. He is seen “wielding a large circular shield” to hit officers, in one case causing an officer to lose his balance, an affidavit states. In another instance, he is seen using the shield to hit and push several officers, it says.

            Defense attorney Michael Desautels said his office represented Nichols for the preliminary proceedings in Vermont, but he did not know who would be representing him in Washington. He did not comment about the specifics of the case. Nichols was arrested in Vermont on Wednesday and appeared in federal court in Rutland, where he was released. 

            He faces charges including assaulting, resisting or impeding officers as well as civil disorder. 

            Another man, Joseph Pavlik, 65, of Chicago, whom authorities believe is affiliated with a militia group called “B Squad,"" was arrested Tuesday on charges including obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder, according to prosecutors. 

            Authorities say Pavlik wore a black tactical vest, gas mask and helmet and carried what appeared to be chemical irritant spray during the riot. Pavlik joined a group of rioters that were trying to force their way past officers attempting to secure a Capitol tunnel, prosecutors say. Inside the tunnel, he was seen applying pressure to the police line, according to court papers. 

            Pavlik was released after a court appearance in Illinois on Tuesday. No attorney was listed in the court docket so it was not immediately clear if Pavlik has a lawyer to comment on his behalf. 

            A third man, Dustin Sargent, 30, of Kunkletown, Pennsylvania, was also arrested on Wednesday on charges including assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers as well as obstruction of an official proceeding. 

            Sargent was seen during the riot pushing one officer and grabbing another “in an apparent attempt to physically force these officers and others away from the doors to allow other rioters into the Capitol,” authorities wrote in court papers. In a video, he was heard telling an officer who was trying to keep rioters out of the House Chamber: “You let us in there, you deserve a medal of honor,"" authorities say. 

            Investigators say that records received from Facebook show that two days before the riot, Sargent was asked in a message how he thought the “protest” was going to go. Authorities say Sargent responded that he wanted his wife to be able to come to the hospital if is going to die, and wrote that people in government “may be publicly hung.” 

            An email seeking comment was sent to an attorney who represented Sargent during his initial court appearance in Pennsylvania. 

            Charges brought against rioters have ranged from misdemeanor offenses for those who entered the Capitol illegally but didn't cause damage or assault any officers to felony seditious conspiracy for members of far-right extremist groups accused of plotting to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power.

            As of early last month, at least 538 cases had been resolved through guilty pleas, trials, dismissals or the defendant’s death, according to an Associated Press review of court records.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798778,"Hungary fined almost €40,000 over refugee death","The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Thursday sentenced Hungary to an almost €40,000 ($43,700) fine over the death of a 22-year-old Syrian refugee at the hands of Hungarian border guards in 2016.The case was brought by a Syrian man who now lives in Germany. He accused the border forces of being responsible for the death of his brother.The ECHR found that Hungary had failed to properly investigate the death and had violated the brother's right to life.The fines handed down by the court amount to €34,600 in damages and €5,600 in costs and expenses.Court documents show that the man who had brought the case and his brother, along with other refugees including an Iraqi family with children, had crossed the Tisza river from Serbia into Hungary on a boat run by smugglers on June 1, 2016.The man said that the refugees had disembarked amid reeds before Hungarian border guards began throwing stones at them and shouting at them to go back to Serbia.When they attempted to hand over the children of the Iraqi family to the officers, they began firing tear gas and they released police dogs.The whole group then tried to swim back across to Serbia as the boat had already left, but the applicant noticed his brother having difficulties — he had been hit by a rock and had been coughing due to the tear gas, the court documents said.The brother never made it to the other side. His body was found two days later.The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organization, said that in the preceding month alone, the UN refugee commission (UNHCR) had documented over 100 similar cases where violence had been used against people trying to cross the border.It added that pushbacks — deemed a severe violation of human rights by European courts — were only legalized in Hungary after the incident, making the actions of the border police unlawful even by Hungary's laws.""It is incomprehensible why this young man, fleeing a civil war in his country, had to die instead of receiving help from the Hungarian police and army who, unfortunately, have put a cruel and inhumane border protection policy before protecting human life,"" lawyer Gabor Gyozo from the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, who was representing the applicant, said in a statement.Hungary's far-right government has implemented harsh policies to block migrants from entering or moving through the country, often using nationalist and racist rhetoric to justify its actions.The ECHR, which is based in Strasbourg, is an independent judicial body focused on the protection of human rights among the 46 member states of the Council of Europe.ab/jcg (dpa, EFE)",2023/02/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798779,Turkey summons German envoy over consulate closure,"Turkey on Thursday summoned the ambassadors of nine countries following the temporary closure of a number of European consulates in Istanbul.According to a diplomatic source cited by the AFP news agency, envoys from Germany, Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden and the United States were called to attend a meeting at the Foreign Ministry.Germany shut its Istanbul consulate on Wednesday, citing a heightened risk of terror attacks following Quran-burning incidents in some European countries. At least six other countries took the same step as a precaution.The US consulate remains open, as the complex is not in Istanbul's city center and is therefore considered to be a less vulnerable target. Washington has, however, joined a number of other governments in issuing travel warnings advising citizens to be vigilant and avoid tourist hotspots.Tensions between Turkey and Western countries have been rising over Ankara's refusal to approve Sweden and Finland's NATO membership bids.Recent protests in Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, at which far-right activists burned or desecrated copies of the Quran, the Muslim holy book, have only strained ties further.The actions have infuriated Muslims in Turkey and other parts of the world.Norwegian police said Thursday they had canceled a planned anti-Islam protest in Oslo, saying security could not be ensured. The group behind the protest had reportedly planned to burn the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy.Turkish officials have reacted angrily to the Quran-burnings, travel warnings and consulate closures.Speaking Thursday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu called the measures an attempt to meddle in Turkey's election campaign ahead of presidential and parliamentary votes on May 14.""They are waging psychological war against Turkey,"" Soylu told Turkey's NTV news channel. ""They are trying to destabilize Turkey.""Soylu, who is known for his anti-Western rhetoric, said the travel alerts and consulate closures were part of a plot to prevent Turkey's tourism sector from rebounding after the coronavirus pandemic.Meanwhile, the chief spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party said Turkey was a safe country and that the security alerts from the West were ""irresponsible.""""Some embassies and consulates are making statements to raise concerns about our country's security conditions,"" spokesman Omer Celik tweeted. ""This type of irresponsible behavior is unacceptable.""In apparent retaliation for the security alerts from Western countries, Turkey issued its own warnings over the weekend. It told its citizens there was a risk of ""possible Islamophobic, xenophobic and racist attacks"" in the US and Europe.nm/jcg (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/02/02,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798780,'Boom': FirstEnergy exec text revels in landing state plane,"CINCINNATI (AP) — New details emerged Thursday at the trial of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder on the use of the state plane scheduled to bring state lawmakers back to Columbus to vote on the now-tainted nuclear bailout legislation at the heart of Ohio's largest ever corruption case. 

            Text messages presented to jurors in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati, where Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges are facing racketeering charges in an alleged $60 million bribery scheme, featured Householder telling a group of lawmakers who were out of town at an event that the aircraft was coming to get them.

            Michael Dowling, FirstEnergy’s since-fired vice president for external affairs, then appeared in the text messages to revel in the plane's procurement on behalf of a bill the Akron-based energy company cared deeply about. FirstEnergy has admitted to secretly funding the scheme to pass House Bill 6 as part of a deferred prosecution agreement. 











            “The state plane has been arranged to come get you, Tom Brinkman and Bob Cupp on Tuesday morning at Midway and return you to Chicago that afternoon. Jay Edwards will be calling you,” Householder texted an unidentified legislator on July 21, 2019. 

            Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s then-chief of staff, Laurel Dawson — married to a FirstEnergy consultant — approved the expense. ”Mike Dawson’s wife. Boom,” Dowling wrote. 

            DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney said the only consideration by the governor's office in deploying the plane was that it was a request of the speaker. Tierney said such requests are “rare,” but that state officials are able to request the aircraft if need be. 

            Tierney said Dowling appeared to be promoting his own worth to his employer.

            “He's a paid lobbyist and FirstEnergy clearly had an expectation that their lobbyists show they're earning the fees that we’re paying you,” Tierney said. “We've seen communications throughout this case that were either flat-out incorrect or taking credit for stuff they weren’t involved in. This is taking credit for something he wasn't involved in.”

            Mike Dawson declined comment.

            Magen Fieramusca, 37, was sentenced to 55 years in prison for the death of Heidi Broussard, 33, Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza announced in a statement. Fieramusca waved her right to appeal. 

            The conviction follows a crime in Austin, Texas, that began with the disappearance of a 3-week-old baby girl and was followed with widening interest as the investigation unfolded and police zeroed in on Fieramusca. Police say the child was later found alive at a home in the Houston area along with Broussard's body in the trunk of Fieramusca's car. 











            
                According to an arrest affidavit at the time, Fieramusca abducted Broussard on Dec. 12, 2019, and packed her into a black duffel. Broussard had last been seen dropping off an older child at an elementary school in Austin. Her death was ruled homicide by strangulation.

            The baby, Margot Carey, was returned to her father. 

            “We are hopeful that this outcome will bring some closure to the Broussard and Carey families and help them continue their healing process,” Garza said. 

            Fieramusca and Broussard were friends who met about a decade ago at church camp, according to court records. At one point, Fieramusca had a key to Broussard’s apartment and the women discussed being pregnant together, even considering that they might give birth on the same day, the court record states.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798783,Pentagon: Chinese spy balloon spotted over Western US,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down over concerns of hurting people on the ground, officials said Thursday. The discovery of the balloon puts a further strain on U.S.-China relations at a time of heightened tensions.

            A senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has “very high confidence” it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.

            Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, provided a brief statement on the issue, saying the government continues to track the balloon. He said it is “currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground.”











            He said similar balloon activity has been seen in the past several years. He added that the U.S. took steps to ensure it did not collect sensitive information. 

            A senior administration official, who was also not authorized to publicly discuss sensitive information, said President Joe Biden was briefed and asked the military to present options. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised against taking “kinetic action” because of risks to the safety of people on the ground. Biden accepted that recommendation.

            The defense official said the U.S. has “engaged” Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.

            The incident comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was supposed to make his first trip to Beijing, expected this weekend, to try to find some common ground. Although the trip has not been formally announced, both Beijing and Washington have been talking about his imminent arrival.

            It was not immediately clear if the discovery of the balloon would impact Blinken’s travel plans.

            The senior defense official said the U.S. did get fighter jets, including F-22s, ready to shoot down the balloon if ordered to by the White House. The Pentagon ultimately recommended against it, noting that even as the balloon was over a sparsely populated area of Montana, its size would create a debris field large enough that it could have put people at risk.

            It was not clear what the military was doing to prevent it from collecting sensitive information or what will happen with the balloon if it isn’t shot down.

            In a letter sent Thursday to Austin, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., wrote: “The fact that this balloon was occupying Montana airspace creates significant concern that Malmstrom Air Force Base and the United States’ intercontinental ballistic missile fields are the target of this intelligence gathering mission. ... It is vital to establish the flight path of this balloon, any compromised U.S. national security assets, and all telecom or IT infrastructure on the ground within the U.S. that this spy balloon was utilizing.”

            The defense official said the spy balloon was trying to fly over the Montana missile fields, but the U.S. has assessed that it has “limited” value in terms of providing China intelligence it couldn’t already collect by other means, such through spy satellites. 

            The official would not specify the size of the balloon, but said it was large enough that despite its high altitude, commercial pilots could see it. All air traffic was halted at Montana's Billings Logan International Airport from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, as the military provided options to the White House. 

            A photograph of a large white balloon lingering over the area was captured by The Billings Gazette, but the Pentagon would not confirm if that was the surveillance balloon. The balloon could be seen drifting in and out of clouds and had what appeared to be a solar array hanging from the bottom, said Gazette photographer Larry Mayer.

            The defense official said what concerned them about this launch was the altitude the balloon was flying at and the length of time it lingered over a location, without providing specifics. 

            Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte said he was briefed Wednesday about the situation after the Montana National Guard was notified of an ongoing military operation taking place in Montana airspace, according to a statement from the Republican governor and spokesperson Brooke Stroyke. 

            “From the spy balloon to the Chinese Communist Party spying on Americans through TikTok to CCP-linked companies buying American farmland, I’m deeply troubled by the constant stream of alarming developments for our national security,” Gianforte said in a statement.

            The administration official said congressional leaders' staffs were briefed on the matter Thursday afternoon. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., tweeted, “China’s brazen disregard for U.S. sovereignty is a destabilizing action that must be addressed.”

            Tensions with China are particularly high on numerous issues, ranging from Taiwan and the South China Sea to human rights in China’s western Xinjiang region and the clampdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong. Not least on that list of irritants are China’s tacit support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its refusal to rein in North Korea’s expanding ballistic missile program and ongoing disputes over trade and technology.

            On Tuesday, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets, put its navy on alert and activated missile systems in response to nearby operations by 34 Chinese military aircraft and nine warships that are part Beijing’s strategy to unsettle and intimidate the self-governing island democracy.

            Twenty of those aircraft crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait that has long been an unofficial buffer zone between the two sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949.

            Beijing has also increased preparations for a potential blockade or military action against Taiwan, which has stirred increasing concern among military leaders, diplomats and elected officials in the U.S., Taiwan’s key ally.

            The surveillance balloon was first reported by NBC News. 

            Some Montana residents reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around the time of the airport shutdown Wednesday, but it’s not clear that what they were seeing was the balloon.

            From an office window in Billings, Chase Doak said he saw a “big white circle in the sky” that he said was too small to be the moon.

            He took some photos, then ran home to get a camera with a stronger lens and took more photos and video. He could see it for about 45 minutes and it appeared stationary, but Doak said the video suggested it was slowly moving.

            “I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,” he said. “So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.""

            Associated Press writers Matthew Lee, Aamer Madhani and Zeke Miller in Washington and Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down over concerns of hurting people on the ground, officials said Thursday. The discovery of the balloon puts a further strain on U.S.-China relations at a time of heightened tensions.A senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has “very high confidence” it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, provided a brief statement on the issue, saying the government continues to track the balloon. He said it is “currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground.”He said similar balloon activity has been seen in the past several years. He added that the U.S. took steps to ensure it did not collect sensitive information.A senior administration official, who was also not authorized to publicly discuss sensitive information, said President Joe Biden was briefed and asked the military to present options. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised against taking “kinetic action” because of risks to the safety of people on the ground. Biden accepted that recommendation.The defense official said the U.S. has “engaged” Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.The incident comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was supposed to make his first trip to Beijing, expected this weekend, to try to find some common ground.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798784,Pelosi backs Trump impeachment leader Schiff in Senate race,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed fellow Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff on Thursday in his 2024 bid for the seat now held by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, providing the long-serving incumbent doesn’t seek a seventh term.

            The public blessing of Schiff’s candidacy, though conditional, was significant. Feinstein has said she will make a decision about her future in the next couple of months. But Pelosi’s announcement represented the strongest signal to date that it’s unlikely Feinstein — at 89 the oldest member of Congress — will run again.

            The endorsement gives the Southern California congressman the support of one of the most powerful Democrats in the country in what is expected to be a highly competitive race, and signals to Pelosi’s vast donor network that he is her choice for the job. 











            Neighbors in San Francisco, Pelosi and Feinstein are personally close and have worked together for decades in Washington, suggesting her decision to back Schiff early in the campaign also carried with it a tacit nod from the senator. 

            If Feinstein decides to seek re-election “she has my whole-hearted support,” Pelosi said in a statement. If not, she said she will support Schiff, who rose to national prominence as the lead prosecutor in President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial. 

            Schiff “knows well the nexus between a strong democracy and a strong economy,” said Pelosi, who tapped him for the impeachment position.

            It also was unusual to see Pelosi pick sides in a contest expected to draw a crowd of rival candidates from within her own party. Democratic Rep. Katie Porter entered the race for the safe Democratic seat last month. Other possible contenders include Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.

            Feinstein's reticence about her future has created a publicly awkward dynamic — the Senate race to replace her is unfolding, even as the senator remains unclear about her intentions. 

            In recent years, questions have arisen about her cognitive health and memory, though she has defended her effectiveness in representing a state that is home to nearly 40 million people.

            Pelosi's support for Schiff was not surprising. They have worked together for years and are close. Porter, a leader in the party's progressive wing who was first elected in 2018, ran as an outsider looking to shake up the Washington status quo. She has had occasional breaks with Democratic leadership, including her opposition to the revival of so-called earmarks, or spending for legislators' home-district projects.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi endorsed fellow Democratic Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798785,"Vinícius scores, escapes injury after hard hit in Madrid win","Vinícius Júnior had more than his goal to celebrate in Real Madrid’s 2-0 win over Valencia in the Spanish league on Thursday.

            Vinícius also was glad to escape serious injury after a vicious foul by Gabriel Paulista in the second half, which ignited a brawl and earned the Valencia defender a straight red card.

            Paulista struck a hard kick at Vinícius’ legs after the Brazil forward got past him with the ball in the 72nd minute, sending the Brazil forward hard to the ground. Vinícius quickly got up and went to confront Paulista, shoving him from behind as other players arrived to join the scuffle.











            “It was a hit without the ball, for no reason,” Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said. 

            Madrid defender Éder Militão, who had been taken off earlier in the match, confronted Paulista as he made his way to the tunnel after being sent off.

            “What Paulista did wasn’t correct, it was a clear red card,” Valencia coach Voro González said. “The match was already tough, and it became impossible with a player down.”

            Vinícius scored his goal after a long run on a breakaway in the 54th, two minutes after Marco Asensio had given the hosts the lead with a shot from outside the area. 

            Vinícius endured a tumultuous period last week after his effigy was hanged off a bridge in a hate attack before Madrid’s game against city rival Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey.

            “We have to protect Vinícius a bit,"" Courtois said. ""He is always dribbling and the defenders don’t like that. He is always getting hit. They think he is provoking them, but it’s his way of playing. We need this Vini to destabilize the opposing defense.” 

            Thursday’s win put Madrid back within five points of league leader Barcelona at the halfway point of the season. The Catalan club won 2-1 at Real Betis on Wednesday.

            Both games were postponed from January because of the teams’ participation in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where Madrid beat Valencia in the semifinals after a penalty shootout before losing to Barcelona in the final. 

            Madrid, which hadn’t won in two matches in all competitions, lost two of its key players because of injuries -- Militão had to be replaced in the first half and Karim Benzema early in the second. 

            Madrid has one last league game — at Mallorca on Sunday — before traveling to Morocco to play in FIFA's Club World Cup next week, when it will seek a record-extending eight title. 

            It was Valencia’s first game without coach Gennaro Gattuso, whose contract was terminated by mutual agreement amid the team’s poor run. González, a club director who often acts as an interim manager, is expected to stay in charge until the end of the season.

            Valencia has won only one of its last 11 league games and is one point from the relegation zone. Its only two wins this year came in the Copa del Rey, though it failed to get past the quarterfinals.

            Defender Antonio Rüdiger thought he had put Madrid ahead with a header off a corner kick three minutes into first-half stoppage time, but the goal was disallowed after video review saw a foul by Benzema away from the ball.

            Madrid, the defending league champion, is six points in front of third-place Real Sociedad.

            Apple suffers 1st quarterly sales decline in nearly 4 years

            CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) — Apple has posted its first quarterly revenue drop in nearly four years. It suffered from pandemic-driven restrictions on its China factories that curtailed sales of the latest iPhone during the holiday season. The company’s sales of $117.15 billion for the October-December period represented a 5% decline from the same time in the previous year, a deeper downturn than analysts had projected. It marks Apple’s first year-over-year decrease in quarterly revenue since the January-March period in 2019. The company’s profit also tumbled by 13% from the previous year, a steeper slide than analysts anticipated. Apple’s stock fell nearly 5% in extended trading.

            Alphabet posts lower Q4 profit amid ad squeeze, competition

            MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google parent company Alphabet has posted lower profit and a small revenue increase for last year’s fourth quarter. A decline in online ad spending and competition from rivals are weighing on the search giant. Alphabet’s profit declined 34% in the October-December quarter, while revenue grew only 1%. But while overall revenue grew, advertising revenue fell by nearly 4% and revenue at YouTube declined 8% year-over-year. This appeared to spook investors, who sent the company’s stock lower in after-hours trading.

            Amazon beats Q4 revenue estimates, but profits slump

            NEW York (AP) — Amazon reported worse-than-expected profits, but its revenue beat expectations boosted by sales in its cloud-computing unit AWS. Amazon said it made $300 million in profits, or 3 cents per share, well below the $2.03 billion analysts surveyed by FactSet had been expecting. The company said its profits were dented by a $2.3 billion write-down of the value of its stock investment in electric vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive. Shares in Amazon.com Inc. fell 7% in after-hours trading. The earnings report closes a rough 2022 for Amazon, when it lost nearly half of its value amid a broader sell-off of tech shares tied to rising inflation, interest rates and concerns about the wider economy.

            Ford 4Q profit drops 90%, company says more cost cuts coming

            DETROIT (AP) — Ford says its fourth-quarter net income fell 90% from a year earlier. That led company officials to say Thursday that the automaker’s costs are too high and to pledge more belt-tightening this year. CEO Jim Farley said in a statement that Ford should have done better last year, and it left $2 billion in profits on the table. He said Ford will correct that with improved execution this year. Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters the global shortage of computer chips and other parts hit Ford hard at the end of last year, costing it production of roughly 100,000 vehicles. He would not rule out further white-collar layoffs. Ford said it made $1.26 billion from October through December.

            SEATTLE (AP) — Starbucks reported lower-than-expected sales in its fiscal first quarter, hurt by COVID restrictions in China and lower consumer demand in other markets. Global same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, were up 5% in the October-December period, but that was partly due to higher prices. Store transactions were down 2%. Starbucks fell short of Wall Street’s forecast for same-store sales, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Starbucks said its revenue rose 8% to a record $8.7 billion, but that also fell short of analysts’ expectations.

The S&P 500 rallied 1.5% Thursday, a day after hitting its highest level since August. The Nasdaq composite soared by more than double that, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged because it has less of an emphasis on tech. Stocks have jumped this year on hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon pause on raising interest rates. The next big milestone for the market is Friday morning’s jobs report, which economists expect will show a slowdown in hiring.

Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Jan. 28 fell by 3,000 last week to 183,000, from 186,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the third straight week claims were under 200,000 and the third straight weekly decline. Jobless claims generally serve as a proxy for layoffs.

            FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The European Central Bank has hiked interest rates by another half-point and vows a similar hike at its next meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Thursday that even beyond an intended hike in March, “we know that we are not done.” The bank is aggressively raising rates to fight inflation that has slowed but is still way too high at 8.5% annually. The ECB got a later start in raising rates than the U.S. Federal Reserve and as a result is now moving faster. The Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter-point Wednesday, while the Bank of England went bigger with a half-point hike Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798788,"Kyrgios pleads guilty to assault, has no conviction recorded","CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios apologized for shoving a former girlfriend to the ground two years ago after he escaped conviction Friday on a charge of common assault.

            The 2022 Wimbledon runner-up pleaded guilty in the Australian Capital Territory Magistrates Court to assaulting Chiara Passari during an argument in his hometown of Canberra in January 2021.

            Magistrate Beth Campbell did not record a conviction against Kyrgios for reasons including that the offense was at the low end of seriousness for a common assault, was not premeditated and he had no criminal record.











            Kyrgios, who was using crutches following recent surgery on his left knee, ignored reporters’ questions as he left court but issued a statement through a management company.

            “I respect today’s ruling and am grateful to the court for dismissing the charges without conviction,” Kyrgios said. “I was not in a good place when this took place and I reacted to a difficult situation in a way I deeply regret. I know it wasn’t OK and I’m sincerely sorry for the hurt I caused. 

            “Mental health is tough. Life can seem overwhelming. But I’ve found that getting help and working on myself has helped me to feel better and to be better,” he added.

            The only media question he responded to as he was about to be driven away from the court was: “what’s next for Nick Kyrgios?” 

            “Just recovery and get back on court,” Kyrgios replied.

            Campbell described the shove as an act of “stupidity” and “frustration.” 

            She assured him his celebrity was not a factor in him avoiding a criminal record.

            “You’re a young man who happens to hit the tennis ball particularly well and your name is widely recognised outside this court room,” Campbell told Kyrgrios. 

            “I deal with you exactly the same way as any young man in this court.”

            Kyrgios’ psychologist, Sam Borenstein, said in a written report and testimony by phone that Kyrgios had suffered major depressive episodes around the time of the assault and had used alcohol and drugs to cope. Kyrgios’ mental health led to impulsive and reckless behavior.

            His recent knee injury had resulted in mild to moderate symptoms of depression, but his mental health was improving, Borenstein said.

            “He’s doing very well,” Borenstein said. “His mental health has improved significantly.”

            “Given the history, he is still vulnerable to recurrent episodes of depression depending on life circumstances,” Borenstein added.

            Lawyers for Kyrgios had sought to have charge dismissed on mental health grounds but the application was unsuccessful.

            In arguing against a conviction being recorded, defense lawyer Michael Kukulies-Smith cited the opinion of Kyrgios’s manager of a “strong likelihood of sanctions and impact upon sponsorship” from a conviction. Kyrgios had faced a potential maximum 2-year prison sentence if convicted. 

            The assault occurred when Kyrgios had been attempting to leave Passari during an argument late Jan. 10, 2021, outside her apartment in the inner-Canberra suburb of Kingston.

            He called an Uber but Passari stood in the way of him closing the front passenger door. The driver wouldn’t leave with the door open. 

            Kyrgios eventually pushed Passari’s shoulders backward with open palms, causing her to fall to the pavement and graze her knee, according to agreed facts read to the court.

            Passari signed a police statement alleging the assault 11 months later, after her relationship with Kyrgios had ended.

            His current partner, Costeen Hatzi, wrote in a character reference that she had no concerns of such violence in her relationship. Hatzi was among Kyrgios’ supporters who sat behind him in court.

            Kyrgios, wearing a dark suit and using the crutches for support, first spoke in court when the magistrate asked him if he could stand to enter a plea.

            Kyrgios replied: “Yep, no worries, Your Honor,” as he rose to plead guilty.

            In February last year, Kyrgios opened up about his performance at the 2019 Australian Open, saying what appeared to be a positive time in his life had been “one of my darkest periods.”

            “I was lonely, depressed, negative, abusing alcohol, drugs, pushed away family and friends,” he wrote on Instagram. “I felt as if I couldn’t talk or trust anyone. This was a result of not opening up and refusing to lean on my loved ones and simply just push myself little by little to be positive.”

            Kyrgios made further references to his mental health struggles during his runs last year to the final at Wimbledon and the quarterfinals at the U.S. Open.

            After ending Daniil Medvedev’s U.S. Open title defense last September to reach the quarterfinals, Kyrgios expressed pride at lifting himself out of “some really tough situations, mentally” and “some really scary places” off the court.

            The 27-year-old Kyrgios had a career setback last month when he withdrew from the Australian Open because the knee injury which later required arthroscopic surgery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798789,Mississippi House seeks to control Jackson sales tax revenue,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The Mississippi House voted Thursday to further restrict how the capital city of Jackson, which has struggled with water problems, can spend money from a 1% local sales tax — the latest effort in the Republican-led Legislature to control actions of the Democratic-led city.

            Jackson voters approved the tax in 2014, with the money designated for roads, bridges, water and sewer. Under House Bill 1168 that passed the House Thursday, all of the money would go toward the city's struggling water system.

            Jackson lawmakers and other Democrats opposed the plan. They said directing all the 1% sales tax revenue to water would hinder Jackson’s ability to fix heavily damaged roads and bridges, including those pockmarked by potholes deep enough to flatten tires.











            “Our streets will go to the devil,” said Democratic Rep. Earle Banks of Jackson.

            Jackson has had water problems for years and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems in the main water treatment plant. Parts of Jackson lost water again after a cold snap in December.

            House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Trey Lamar, a Republican from Senatobia, sponsored the bill. He said ensuring clean, fresh drinking water is a higher priority now than fixing potholes.

            “There is a serious need to spend money on water and sewer in the city of Jackson,” Lamar said.

            Opponents of the bill pointed out that Jackson is set to receive $600 million from the federal government for water system improvements. Lamar said he does not know when the federal money will arrive. He also acknowledged he has not spoken with Ted Henifin, who was appointed by the federal government to oversee improvements to the Jackson water system.

            Democratic Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez pointed out that money generated by the 1% sales tax in Jackson is already overseen by a commission with members chosen by the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker. Critics of that commission say it was created by the majority-white Legislature to curb the power of elected officials in a city that is more than 80% Black.

            Speaking of Lamar's new proposal, Johnson said: “This is another one of those paternalistic ideas that, 'We’re going to tell y'all what to do because we want to punish you while we're doing it.'”

            House Bill 1168 passed 76-41. The vote was largely along party lines, with support from Republicans and most of the opposition from Democrats.

            Follow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus.JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The Mississippi House voted Thursday to further restrict how the capital city of Jackson, which has struggled with water problems, can spend money from a 1% local sales tax — the latest effort in the Republican-led Legislature to control actions of the Democratic-led city.Jackson voters approved the tax in 2014, with the money designated for roads, bridges, water and sewer. Under House Bill 1168 that passed the House Thursday, all of the money would go toward the city's struggling water system.Jackson lawmakers and other Democrats opposed the plan. They said directing all the 1% sales tax revenue to water would hinder Jackson’s ability to fix heavily damaged roads and bridges, including those pockmarked by potholes deep enough to flatten tires.“Our streets will go to the devil,” said Democratic Rep. Earle Banks of Jackson.Jackson has had water problems for years and most of the city lost running water for several days in late August and early September after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems in the main water treatment plant. Parts of Jackson lost water again after a cold snap in December.House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Trey Lamar, a Republican from Senatobia, sponsored the bill. He said ensuring clean, fresh drinking water is a higher priority now than fixing potholes.“There is a serious need to spend money on water and sewer in the city of Jackson,” Lamar said.Opponents of the bill pointed out that Jackson is set to receive $600 million from the federal government for water system improvements. Lamar said he does not know when the federal money will arrive. He also acknowledged he has not spoken with Ted Henifin, who was appointed by the federal government to oversee improvements to the Jackson water system.Democratic Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez pointed out that money generated by the 1% sales tax in Jackson is already overseen by a commission with members chosen by the governor, lieutenant governor and House speaker. Critics of that commission say it was created by the majority-white Legislature to curb the power of elected officials in a city that is more than 80% Black.Speaking of Lamar's new proposal, Johnson said: “This is another one of those paternalistic ideas that, 'We’re going to tell y'all what to do because we want to punish you while we're doing it.'”House Bill 1168 passed 76-41. The vote was largely along party lines, with support from Republicans and most of the opposition from Democrats.The bill was held for the possibility of more House debate and it eventually would have to go to the Senate for more work.The Republican-controlled state Senate recently passed a bill that would transfer the ownership and management of the Jackson water system to a regional board after the federally-appointed administrator leaves.A bill that awaits House debate would create a new court system in parts of Jackson with appointed rather than elected judges.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798793,Murder case dropped in 2021 death of private eye Palladino,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Prosecutors in San Francisco have dropped all charges against two men accused in the murder of famed private investigator Jack Palladino two years ago, citing a lack of evidence. 

            Palladino, whose clients included presidents, corporate whistleblowers and Hollywood moguls, died Feb. 1, 2021, outside his home after suffering a brain injury resulting from a drive-by attempt to rob his camera, San Francisco police said at the time. 

            The 76-year-old man fell and hit his head, but not before snapping photos of the two men driving by. Police used the photos to track down and arrest the men. 











            But the district attorney's office dismissed the case Tuesday after a witness admitted he never saw one of the men, in the passenger's seat, attempt to steal the camera through the car window, the San Francisco Public Defender's Office said in a statement. Also, the suspect's DNA was not found on the camera, the office said. 

            “The prosecution did the ethical thing in dismissing these charges, as none of the physical evidence corroborated the early assumptions reported by an unreliable witness,” said Kleigh Hathaway, a deputy public defender who represented the driver. 

            Randy Quezada, spokesperson for the district attorney's office, said the goal of the office is “to prosecute cases ethically, fairly and impartially."" 

            The dismissal has disappointed the Palladino family, said longtime family friend and lawyer Mel Honowitz. He said circumstantial evidence clearly showed the men attempted to steal Palladino's camera, resulting in his death. But there was no video of the moment that Palladino made contact with the men, he said. 

            “There's no question in our minds, and it’s our opinion the two defendants were in fact the killers of Jack Palladino,” Honowitz said. “We understood the decision by the district attorney. We don't necessarily agree with it.”

            Hathaway's client said he drove away because Palladino was yelling at them through the window and also hit the car with his hand, she said. Palladino lost his footing and fell, the office said. 

            The public defender's office used the case dismissal to highlight a massive trial backlog at San Francisco Superior Court that has kept suspects in jail pending trial. The trial was set for September 2021. 

            Records show both men were released from a San Francisco jail. 

            Palladino was a colorful figure whose high-profile career spanned more than 40 years. Clients included Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, which hired him to thwart women who were coming forward to claim they had had sex with the future president. 

            He was also the investigator for the family of a 14-year-old boy who won a multimillion-dollar settlement from Michael Jackson after accusing the entertainer of molesting him. Jackson was never charged with a crime in that case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798794,Teen arrested after entering Texas school following shooting,"HOUSTON (AP) — A teenager who was involved in a shooting on Thursday with Houston police fled into a nearby high school, resulting in a lockdown of the campus and his arrest, police said. No injuries inside the school were reported. 

            The teenager was part of a group of individuals who had been under surveillance by a crime suppression unit late Thursday morning at an apartment complex on the city’s west side when one of the suspects exchanged gunfire with an officer, said Houston Police Chief Troy Finner. 

            The 18-year-old suspect was shot in the knee and he along with a 17-year-old were arrested at the complex. But a third suspect, who was 17 or 18 years old, fled the scene and got a ride from a local resident to Wisdom High School, located about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away, Finner said. Police did not release the names of the three suspects. 











            “We interviewed that citizen and ... he gave that kid a ride back to the school — didn’t know that he was involved in anything,” Finner said. 

            The suspect who traveled to the high school and one of the two arrested at the complex are enrolled at the school, according to authorities. 

            Houston school district Police Chief Pete Lopez said as soon as his agency was notified the suspect had entered the high school, the campus was placed on lockdown. 

            After arriving at the campus, the suspect went into the school’s auditorium, which had at least 100 students, Finner said.

            “We were able with our SWAT teams and other police officers, went in and got that suspect out safely with no one hurt,” he said. 

            Officers were still searching the campus to determine if the suspect had brought a weapon, according to Finner. 

            Finner said when the suspect was in the auditorium, the other students were not aware and “thought it was business as usual.” 

            “It ended as well as expected,” he said. 

            The three suspects are expected to face charges of aggravated assault of a police officer and possibly additional counts, Finner said.

            Eva Bratcher, 69, appeared in court Thursday on charges of concealing her 96-year-old mother’s death and possessing a fraudulent identification card.

            Regina Michalski's body was discovered this week in a freezer in the garage near the apartment they had shared, police said. Investigators believe she died in March 2021. The cause won't be determined until the body is thawed.











            The allegations are “very disturbing,” Judge David Kelly said in setting a $20,000 bond for Bratcher.

            Kelly turned down a defense lawyer's request for a lower bond to get Bratcher out of jail.

            She has past convictions for forgery, and investigators said they were trying to determine if Bratcher was collecting her late mother's Social Security benefits, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

            Bratcher's daughter, who lives in Kentucky, asked police to check the home after losing contact with her grandmother.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798813,ACLU settles two lawsuits of police abuse cases in Louisiana,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A civil rights group in New Orleans is pointing to two federal lawsuit settlements as examples of how civil litigation can hold police accountable for violent tactics in the wake of Tyre Nichols' death in Memphis. 

            The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana said Thursday it had settled a lawsuit stemming from the 2020 arrest in New Orleans of Michael Celestine, a Black man who said he was threatened with a gun and required hospitalization after police used a Taser on him as he fled what the ACLU called an unjustified stop and search. 

            Celestine's settlement and a similar one announced earlier this week by the ACLU come amid renewed national focus on police abuses after Nichols' death from a fatal beating by law enforcement on Jan. 7. President Joe Biden and members of Congress face fresh pressure to reach an agreement on proposals aimed at curbing abuses. The reform package includes a national registry for police officers disciplined for misconduct, a ban on no-knock warrants and other measures. It was introduced in response to George Floyd's death in 2020, but stalled more than a year ago.











            Celestine's lawsuit alleged police unlawfully used a Taser on him as he ran from them and tried to climb a fence. He was jailed for more than a year on charges that were eventually dropped, according to court documents. 

            The lawsuit acknowledged that police found a small amount of cocaine and a gun on Celestine, but argued that officers never had a reason to approach him. 

            Celestine sought damages for what his lawyers said was an illegal stop and search, excessive force and false arrest. He also said officers were indifferent to his medical needs after he fell from the fence, and that he was hospitalized with shortness of breath and a rapid heartbeat. “Mr. Celestine’s experience reflects a long trend that shows Black men are subjected to excessive force and baseless stops,” the ACLU said. “While no amount of money will ever repay the harm inflicted upon Mr. Celestine, the recent settlement allows him the ability to finally begin the healing process as he attempts to move on from this deeply traumatizing experience.”

            Details of the confidential settlement were not made public. 

            In answering Celestine's lawsuit, lawyers for police officers Bryan Bissell, Cody O’Dell and Daniel Grijalva said they made a “lawful investigatory stop.” They admitted no liability in the settlement. The Associated Press emailed city officials Thursday seeking comment. 

            Earlier in the week, the ACLU chapter announced a settlement between Shreveport police and Brandon Kennedy, who said he suffered a retaliatory beating by police officer Montrell Jackson. Kennedy, who is Black, was then detained for hours in a mental health ward. He said Montrell struck him after overhearing a conversation in which Kennedy talked about bad experiences with Shreveport police and expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement.

            Terms of the Shreveport settlement were not made public and police admitted no wrongdoing.

            The confidential settlements resulted from lawsuits filed as part of the ACLU of Louisiana’s Justice Lab program, which enlists the aid of private attorneys in suing over racially discriminatory police practices. 

            The organization said in a news release that both cases underscore the need for national police reform in light of Nichols' death. 

            “It’s our hope that this settlement, as with every other Justice Lab settlement, will result in fewer incidents of unconstitutional policing and vicious brutality,” the organization's legal director, Nora Ahmed, said.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A civil rights group in New Orleans is pointing to two federal lawsuit settlements as examples of how civil litigation can hold police accountable for violent tactics in the wake of Tyre Nichols' death in Memphis.The American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana said Thursday it had settled a lawsuit stemming from the 2020 arrest in New Orleans of Michael Celestine, a Black man who said he was threatened with a gun and required hospitalization after police used a Taser on him as he fled what the ACLU called an unjustified stop and search.Celestine's settlement and a similar one announced earlier this week by the ACLU come amid renewed national focus on police abuses after Nichols' death from a fatal beating by law enforcement on Jan. 7.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798814,Authorities: Woman sent to Iowa funeral home was alive,"A continuing care home in suburban Des Moines, Iowa, has been fined $10,000 after a funeral home discovered a woman sent to it in a body bag was still alive.

            The Iowa Department of Inspection and Appeals said in a report filed Wednesday that the 66-year-old woman was declared dead at the Glen Oaks Alzheimer's Special Care Center in Urbandale on Jan. 3. 

            The woman, whose name has not been released, had early onset dementia, anxiety and depression and had been in hospice care since Dec. 28.











            She was placed in a zipped body bag and taken to the Ankeny Funeral Home & Crematory, where workers found that she was breathing and called 911, the report said. 

            She was taken to Mercy West Lakes Hospital, where she was breathing but unresponsive. The woman was ultimately returned to hospice care, where she died on Jan. 5 with her family by her side, according to the report. 

            A Glen Oaks staff member who had worked a 12-hour shift and was on the team caring for the woman told investigators she first reported to a nurse practitioner early Jan. 3 that the woman was not breathing and had no pulse. 

            The nurse practitioner who had cared for the woman throughout the night also was unable to find a pulse and said the woman was not breathing. She continued to assess the woman for about five minutes before determining the woman had died.

            The woman was declared dead about 6:30 a.m., roughly 90 minutes after the staff member's first report. A funeral home employee and a second nurse practitioner who put the woman into the body bag and the funeral home's vehicle about an hour later also found no signs of life, according to the report. 

            The department of inspections and appeals found the care center “failed to provide adequate direction to ensure appropriate cares and services were provided” before the woman was declared dead. 

            Lisa Eastman, executive director of the Glen Oaks Alzheimer’s Special Care Center, said in a statement that the center cares deeply about its residents and remains committed to supporting end-of-life care.

The woman was ultimately returned to hospice care, where she died on Jan. 5 with her family by her side, according to the report.A Glen Oaks staff member who had worked a 12-hour shift and was on the team caring for the woman told investigators she first reported to a nurse practitioner early Jan. 3 that the woman was not breathing and had no pulse.The nurse practitioner who had cared for the woman throughout the night also was unable to find a pulse and said the woman was not breathing. She continued to assess the woman for about five minutes before determining the woman had died.The woman was declared dead about 6:30 a.m., roughly 90 minutes after the staff member's first report. A funeral home employee and a second nurse practitioner who put the woman into the body bag and the funeral home's vehicle about an hour later also found no signs of life, according to the report.The department of inspections and appeals found the care center “failed to provide adequate direction to ensure appropriate cares and services were provided” before the woman was declared dead.Lisa Eastman, executive director of the Glen Oaks Alzheimer’s Special Care Center, said in a statement that the center cares deeply about its residents and remains committed to supporting end-of-life care.“All of our employees are given regular training in how best to support end-of-life care and the death transition for our residents,” Eastman said.The Ankeny police department is not pursuing criminal charges, spokesperson Sgt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798815,James cleared to play at Indiana as scoring chase continues,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was set to resume his NBA scoring-record chase Thursday night at Indiana after being cleared to start.

            James entered the day 89 points away from breaking Kareem Abdul Jabbar’s mark of 38,387.

            James, a 19-time All-Star, had been listed as questionable because of a sore left ankle. Coach Darvin Ham told reporters about 90 minutes before tip-off that James needed to go through pregame warmups before the team would make a decision about his playing status.











            About an hour later, the Lakers announced the 38-year-old James had been cleared.

            Some people thought the Lakers might hold James out of a game or two during their five-game trip so he could break the record at home. Los Angeles heads home after a game in New Orleans on Saturday and will host Oklahoma City on Tuesday and Milwaukee next Thursday.

            Pacers point guard Tyrese Haliburton also will be available against the Lakers. The NBA assists leader missed 10 games with injuries to his left knee and left elbow.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798816,Execution of man convicted in killing of 3 in Texas delayed,"HOUSTON (AP) — A judge has delayed next week’s scheduled execution of a man convicted of killing three teenagers while they slept in a Texas Panhandle home more than 25 years ago.

            John Balentine, 54, had been set to receive a lethal injection at the state prison in Huntsville on Feb. 8.

            He was condemned for the January 1998 shooting deaths of Edward Mark Caylor, 17, Kai Brooke Geyer, 15, and Steven Watson, also 15, at a home in Amarillo. Caylor was the brother of Balentine’s former girlfriend and prosecutors said the shootings were the result of a feud between Caylor and Balentine.











            Balentine was arrested in Houston six months after the slayings. Evidence at the trial showed all three victims were shot once in the head as they slept in a tiny house where Balentine also once lived.

            On Tuesday, state District Judge Steven Denny in Potter County withdrew Balentine’s execution date and warrant because the inmate’s attorneys had not been properly notified of the execution date and warrant outlining the lethal injection. Such notification is required under state law.

            On Wednesday, Denny rejected a request by prosecutors to reconsider his order. The judge asked prosecutors to reset the execution as soon as practical with proper notice to Balentine’s attorneys.

            Balentine’s attorneys have alleged that racial bias and other misconduct affected the jury’s deliberations at his trial. Balentine is Black.

            Balentine is also one of five Texas death row inmates who are part of a lawsuit seeking to stop the state’s prison system from using what they allege are expired and unsafe execution drugs. Despite a civil court judge in Austin preliminarily agreeing with the claims, the state’s top two courts allowed two of the inmates who had been part of the litigation to be executed on Jan. 10 and on Wednesday.

            Prison officials deny the lawsuit’s claims and say the state’s supply of execution drugs is safe.

            Six more executions are scheduled in Texas for later this year, including the next one on March 7.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798822,Judge dismisses lawsuit over US utility's long-term deals,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by environmental groups that challenged how the nation's largest public utility signs up local power providers for two-decade contracts.

            On Wednesday, a ruling by U.S. District Judge Thomas L. Parker in Memphis sided with the Tennessee Valley Authority, agreeing that the environmental groups don't have legal standing. The judge also found that TVA “acted reasonably” under a law requiring it as a federal agency to assess environmental effects of major projects before making decisions.

            The lawsuit filed in August 2020 argued that 20-year deals signed by most of TVA’s customers lock the power distributors into exclusive contracts with the TVA and “will forever deprive distributors and ratepayers the opportunity to renegotiate with TVA to obtain cheaper, cleaner electricity,” according to the Southern Environmental Law Center, which filed the suit for three plaintiff groups.











            The judge, however, agreed with TVA that the groups — Protect Our Aquifer, Energy Alabama and Appalachian Voices — have no standing to sue for a variety of reasons, saying in part that they “have not shown a particularized, imminent environmental injury.”

            Additionally, Parker wrote that TVA did not violate the National Environmental Policy Act, either. The law “does not require review of every major federal action,” but only those closely related to causing environmental changes, the judge said.

            The judge wrote that the environmental groups' arguments are resolvable by congressional lawmakers, not the court system.

            TVA commended the decision, saying 147 of 153 local power companies have signed long-term agreements, while arguing they help keep TVA's power affordable, reliable and resilient.

            ""We are pleased with the court’s decision which affirms that TVA followed the law in offering the long-term agreement to local power company customers,"" TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said in a statement.

            The Southern Environmental Law Center, meanwhile, said it is evaluating its legal options after the ruling.

            “We are disappointed the court ruled against this challenge to TVA’s never-ending contracts,"" Amanda Garcia, the Southern Environmental Law Center's Tennessee office director, said in a statement. “These highly restrictive contracts make it essentially impossible for TVA customers to have meaningful negotiations with the federal utility.”

            The issue has sprung up prominently in Memphis, Tennessee. The utility company there announced in December that it rejected a 20-year contract with TVA, but will remain the power provider’s largest customer for the “foreseeable future.” It stuck with its five-year rolling contract.

            The environmental groups argued that the deals hurt the ability of local power companies to seek out and use renewable power such as solar energy from sources outside the TVA. The deals replaced existing agreements of varying lengths, or followed expiring ones. Contracts require a 20-year notice to terminate, and they renew each year.

            Garcia has argued that the notice-to-terminate provision made the contracts “never-ending,” and violate TVA’s own rules that its contracts with power companies should not last longer than 20 years. The deals carry a 3.1% monthly rebate on wholesale power rates that local companies could pass on to their customers, or use to invest in infrastructure, TVA has said. 

            The deals also allow local power companies to seek up to 5% in acquired renewable energy, which TVA says could help them meet their energy needs. But the groups say that percentage is too limiting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798823,Ally claims Bolsonaro plotted coup to block Lula presidency,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A Brazilian magazine on Thursday released audio of a senator claiming then President Jair Bolsonaro sought help in a plot to annul the October elections and keep himself in power.

            In the recording, Sen. Marcos do Val tells the magazine Veja that the idea was discussed when he met with Bolsonaro and lawmaker Daniel Silveira on Dec. 9 at the presidential residence, three weeks before leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was set to take office. 

            Do Val, who was an ally during Bolsonaro’s four-year term, said the far-right leader gave him the “mission” of recording Alexandre de Moraes, a Supreme Court justice who also heads Brazil's electoral authority, while trying to get the judge to admit he overstepped his powers under the constitution. 











            “'I annul the election, Lula isn't sworn in, I stay in the presidency and arrest Alexandre de Moraes because of his comments,'” do Val quotes Bolsonaro as saying. 

            Veja released the audio in response to denials the senator issued following the magazine's report Thursday morning about the purported plot, which had not cited him as its source. Do Val told reporters after the magazine published its story that the plot had been Silveira's idea and that the former president hadn't said a word during the meeting.

            Later Thursday, de Moraes ordered the Federal Police to take do Val's sworn testimony within five days. Bolsonaro, who has been keeping a low profile in Florida since Dec. 30, did not comment on the matter on any of his social media channels. He recently applied for a six-month tourist visa to stay in the U.S.

            Contacted by The Associated Press, Bolsonaro’s lawyer Frederick Wassef declined to comment.

            The alleged meeting adds to the growing list of woes for Bolsonaro, who is already under investigation for his possible role in his supporters' uprising in the Brazilian capital on Jan. 8. 

            Bolsonaro cast doubt on the nation's electronic voting system for months in the lead-up to the election, and he then refused to concede defeat. His die-hard supporters have accused de Moraes of rigging the election in Lula’s favor, without offering any evidence, and of overstepping his authority by blocking social media accounts and ordering allegedly arbitrary arrests and searches.

            Suspicions of a coup plot increased after police searching the home of Bolsonaro’s former justice minister found a draft decree that would have seized control of the electoral authority and potentially overturned the election. The origin of the unsigned document is unclear, and it remains unknown if Bolsonaro or his subordinates took any steps to implement the measure.

            Lula said in an interview Thursday that Bolsonaro tried to stop him from taking office. He also said supporters of the former president had hoped to invade government buildings on his inauguration day but had to settle for Jan. 8, one week later.

            “Now I am aware, and I will say it loud and clear: That man prepared the coup. They wanted to make that mess on January 1st, but they noticed they could not because there was too much police, too many people on the street,” Lula told the TV network RedeTV!.

            Do Val told both Veja magazine and journalists later Thursday that he informed de Moraes of what was discussed at the meeting with Bolsonaro and Silveira, and that he declined to participate in the alleged plot.

            Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president’s son, said he was aware of the meeting, which he described as an attempt by Silveira to persuade the other two men to do something “absolutely unacceptable, absurd and illegal.” But discussing such an idea does not constitute a crime, he said.

            Silveira was arrested Thursday on de Moraes' order for violating terms of his release from prison. Silveira was previously sentenced for anti-democratic acts after issuing threats against de Moraes and other justices, but was released after Bolsonaro pardoned him. Still, he was prohibited from using his social media accounts and required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet as other investigations targeting him proceed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798831,CIA chief warns against underestimating Xi's ambitions toward Taiwan,"WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns said on Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping's ambitions toward Taiwan should not be underestimated, despite him likely being sobered by the performance of Russia's military in Ukraine.Burns said that the United States knew ""as a matter of intelligence"" that Xi had ordered his military to be ready to conduct an invasion of self-governed Taiwan by 2027.""Now, that does not mean that he's decided to conduct an invasion in 2027, or any other year, but it's a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,"" Burns told an event at Georgetown University in Washington.""Our assessment at CIA is that I wouldn't underestimate President Xi's ambitions with regard to Taiwan,"" he said, adding that the Chinese leader was likely ""surprised and unsettled"" and trying to draw lessons by the ""very poor performance"" of the Russian military and its weapons systems in Ukraine.Russia and China signed a ""no limits"" partnership last February shortly before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, and their economic links have boomed as Russia's connections with the West have shriveled.The Russian invasion had fueled concerns in the West of China possibly making a similar move on Taiwan, a democratic island Beijing says is its territory.China has refrained from condemning Russia's operation against Ukraine, but it has been careful not to provide the sort of direct material support which could provoke Western sanctions like those imposed on Moscow.""I think it's a mistake to underestimate the mutual commitment to that partnership, but it's not a friendship totally without limits,"" Burns said.As Burns spoke, news came from U.S. officials that a suspected Chinese spy balloon had been flying over the United States for a few days, and that senior U.S. officials had advised President Joe Biden against shooting it down for fear the debris could pose a safety threat.Burn made no mention of the episode but called China the ""biggest geopolitical challenge"" currently faced by the United States.""Competition with China is unique in its scale, and that it really, you know, unfolds over just about every domain, not just military, and ideological, but economic, technological, everything from cyberspace, to space itself as well. It's a global competition in ways that could be even more intense than competition with the Soviets was,"" he said.There was no immediate comment from China's Washington embassy about the remarks from Burns or the balloon flight.Burns said the next six months will be ""critical"" for Ukraine, where Moscow has been making incremental gains in recent weeks.He also said Iran's government was increasingly unsettled by affairs within the country, citing the courage of what he described as ""fed up"" Iranian women.",2023/02/03,2669,Politics

            The 20-year-old Hisatsune picked up further shots on the eighth and 10th holes but then couldn't make another birdie until the 15th, and then dropped his only shot of the day on the 18th to finish with an 8-under 64. 

            “It’s the first time I’ve made six (birdies) in a row and I was nervous to start,"" Hisatsune said. ""I tried to keep going but there are some tough holes on the back nine.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798835,Ewing caddie for a week to see Pebble ahead of Women's Open,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — The two-month break in the LPGA Tour's domestic schedule worked out beautifully for Ally Ewing, who is at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in a different role.

            She's a caddie.

            Her father-in-law is Dallas businessman Fin Ewing, a regular among the amateur portion for this PGA Tour event. There was no better time to be his caddie, especially with the U.S. Women's Open coming to Pebble Beach this summer for the first time.











            “I had a down week and a good reason to get out to Pebble,"" Ewing said Thursday. “I can spend time with my in-laws and get an opportunity to see Pebble Beach before the U.S. Open in July.”

            It won't be exactly the same course. Pebble has hosted a PGA Tour event and a U.S. Open in the same year six times, and they're never quite the same except for the gorgeous scenery along the Monterey Peninsula.

            “I expect the rough to be longer, a little more penalizing,” Ewing said. “But it's Pebble Beach. The greens will be what they are (small), maybe a smidgen faster, all depending on what the USGA does.”

            She has played Pebble a couple of times on her own. But it was a good experience to see it in a different role, not with a club in her hand but a bag on her shoulder.

            Ewing got a good look at the new eighth green, where some of the ridges have been softened to allow for new pin positions. She stood over Fin Ewing's putt, gave it a good look and then motioned to him the size of the break, which was substantial.

            And while this was their only day at Pebble Beach — the next two rounds are at Spyglass Hill and the Shore Course at Monterey Peninsula — Ewing was able to see how the ball reacts on the ground from four players — Greyson Sigg and Matthew NeSmith on the PGA Tour, and the two amateurs.

            “I'm getting to see two guys at the peak of men's golf getting around Pebble Beach,” she said. “You can see the intricacies of the golf course, the bounces and the breaks.”

            Pebble Beach is one of several big upgrades for the U.S. Women's Open, which already features the largest purse in women's golf at $10 million. Future sites include Riviera, Oakmont, Merion and Oakland Hills.

            “It's awesome. These prestigious golf courses we're now getting on is exciting for the game,” Ewing said. “Pebble is on our rotation, we had Muirfield last year for AIG Women's (British) Open. It speaks to what the LPGA and women's golf is doing to get us on these courses, and the courses opening their doors and being very welcoming.”

            As for her job for the week? The weather and the views were ideal Thursday, though Ewing finished before the wind began whipping and a marine layer covered the sun and reduced temperatures by about 10 degrees.

            Ewing said she carries her own bag at home when she plays with her husband, Charlie, the women's golf coach at Mississippi State. She had a regular caddie or her mother pushed a cart during her year on the Symetra Tour.

            How much will this week help? She has made the cut in her last four U.S. Women's Open appearances, her best finish a tie for 10th in 2019 at the Country Club of Charleston in South Carolina.

            But there was one immediate benefit.

            “It's great to be out here for the Open,” she said. “But it's just great to be out here. Who's going to turn down a trip to Pebble Beach?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798836,"Embiid, Morant, Brown lead NBA All-Star reserve class","Philadelphia's Joel Embiid, Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Portland's Damian Lillard had to have known they were going to the All-Star Game. Players averaging more than 30 points per game typically don't have to worry about not hearing their name called.

            Other players — like Miami's Bam Adebayo, Indiana's Tyrese Haliburton and Utah's Lauri Markkanen — had reason for concern.

            NBA coaches made them very happy. And probably made a few other guys very unhappy.











            The reserves for the Feb. 19 All-Star Game in Salt Lake City were announced Thursday night. From the Eastern Conference, it was Embiid, Adebayo, Haliburton, Boston's Jaylen Brown, Chicago's DeMar DeRozan, Milwaukee's Jrue Holiday and New York's Julius Randle.

            Even for a now six-time All-Star like DeRozan, it still matters.

            “It’s everything,"" DeRozan said. “I just hope anybody out there, whatever field you work in, never listens to the outside noise, to people doubting you, counting you out, everything. As long as you’re true to yourself, believe in yourself, you keep putting in the work with a genuine heart and genuine passion, you’ll be rewarded.”

            From the Western Conference, the picks were Gilgeous-Alexander, Lillard, Memphis teammates Ja Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr., Markkanen, Sacramento's Domantas Sabonis and the Los Angeles Clippers' Paul George.

            “Every single year, starter or not, I’m competitive,"" Embiid said. “Obviously you want to be the best. I felt like I put myself in position to be up there and the best.""

            He was an easy pick. Other candidates probably were tougher for coaches to pass on — that list including Phoenix's Devin Booker, the Los Angeles Lakers' Anthony Davis, Atlanta's Trae Young, all of them averaging around 27 points per game this season. Philadelphia's James Harden, averaging 11 assists per game, also was left out; unless he's picked as an injury replacement, his streak of 10 consecutive All-Star appearances is over.

            Same goes for Denver's Aaron Gordon. The West-leading Nuggets were hoping, and weren't happy when the results were announced.

            “Aaron Gordon deserves to be an All-Star,"" Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “When you have the best record in the Western Conference, and you’ve had it for a while now, and you’ve been able to sustain that high level, and you look at the year that Aaron Gordon is having, to me it’s just a travesty that the coaches didn’t vote him in.""

            The reserves are selected by the 30 NBA head coaches, who each cast ballots for seven players from their own conference.

            “It means a lot,"" Morant said on the TNT broadcast of the announcements. “Obviously, it shows my work that I've put in day in and day out. ... Hopefully, Jaren gets picked on the same team as me.""

            The 14 players who were announced Thursday join this pool of starters: team captains LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, Brooklyn teammates Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell, Boston’s Jayson Tatum, Golden State’s Stephen Curry, Dallas’ Luka Doncic, Denver’s Nikola Jokic and New Orleans’ Zion Williamson.

            Durant and Williamson are currently out with injuries. If either of them, or any other All-Star selection, cannot play for whatever reason then the task of replacing them falls on Commissioner Adam Silver.

            
                James and Antetokounmpo will draft their teams live, shortly before the All-Star Game in a new twist this season; past All-Star drafts in the now-6-year-old captain's format had been done ahead of time. Boston interim coach Joe Mazzulla will coach Antetokounmpo's team; the Nuggets' Malone is an All-Star coach now for the second time and will coach the team that James selects.

            James — closing in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA career scoring record — is 5-0 as a captain, having served as one in every season of this format. He got two of those wins over teams that Antetokounmpo selected. Abdul-Jabbar is expected at All-Star weekend, and Silver said in Paris last month that the weekend could provide the league with the opportunity to properly salute James taking over as the scoring leader, assuming it happens by then as expected.

            
                The Rising Stars event is Feb. 17, the first night of the three-night All-Star weekend. All-Star Saturday — featuring the 3-point contest, dunk contest and skills competition — takes center stage the next night, followed by the 72nd All-Star Game on Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798838,Ryans returns 'home' looking to turn around the Texans,"HOUSTON (AP) — DeMeco Ryans was a highly sought-after candidate for head coaching jobs in this coaching cycle and had plenty of suitors other than the Houston Texans. 

            No team really had a chance to land him with the Texans as an option. 

            “When it came down to it, there is no place I wanted to be any more than H-town,” he said. “So, it was an easy pick for me. It was a no-brainer to be here, be home.”











            Ryans was introduced as Houston’s new coach Thursday, giving him his first head coaching job in the place where he began his NFL playing career. 

            The 38-year-old Ryans joins the Texans from the San Francisco 49ers, where he spent the past two seasons as their defensive coordinator.

            He replaces Lovie Smith, who was fired after just one season where the team went 3-13-1.

            Ryans' introduction Thursday had a celebratory feel for a team that hasn’t had much to celebrate recently as the team endured three straight dreadful seasons where coaches Bill O’Brien and David Culley were also let go. 

            Ten current players and more than two dozen former players attended the event and many of them clapped and cheered as Ryans talked about his plans for this struggling franchise. 

            People around town are buzzing about the Texans hiring one of their own, and Houston rappers “Bun B” and “Trae tha Truth” illustrated that Thursday, attending the news conference both wearing the No. 59 jersey Ryans wore as a player.

            Houston’s career leading receiver Andre Johnson was among those there to laud the new hire. 

            “It’s a great day for the Texans organization to have DeMeco back,” he said. “I just felt like it was the right decision. The league now is going to a place where you have to have a guy who can relate to players, develop players, create those relationships with players and have the belief of the players. And I think DeMeco is the guy for that.”

            The Texans interviewed seven other candidates for the job, but it became clear pretty quickly that Ryans was their man. 

            General manager Nick Caserio talked about their first interview with Ryans that came over Zoom minutes after he left the practice field where he was helping the 49ers prepare for a playoff game. 

            “What did we like? Everything,” Caserio said. “It was one of the more impressive interviews, interactions I’ve ever been around. And the thing about it is he’s genuine. DeMeco is who he is. He’s sincere. He’s real.” 

            At the end of that first interview Ryans left Caserio and team owner Cal McNair with some strong parting words. 

            “I want to come home,” Caserio said Ryans told them. “This is my dream job. Let’s make it happen.”

            Ryans was a star linebacker in six seasons in Houston after being drafted in the second round in 2006. He won AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2007 and 2009. 

            “When we drafted him in ’06, he took over the defense, stepped into the middle, called the plays,” McNair said. “He was captain and they called him ‘Cap’. So, he’s been a leader for a long, long time. ... I can’t tell you how excited I am that he’s here.”

            Ryans, who spent his entire six-year coaching career in San Francisco, knows he has a difficult task ahead of him to turn this team around. But he’s looking forward to the challenge. 

            “We’re excited now, but we have to win,” he said. “We want to build the right staff. We want to get the right players so we can go out and win and compete. That’s when the excitement continues and that’s what we want to bring here.”

            Ryans joins Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin and Tampa Bay’s Todd Bowles as the only three Black head coaches in the NFL. There are three other minority coaches, including Miami’s Mike McDaniel, who has a Black father and identifies as biracial. 

            Arizona and Indianapolis have yet to hire new coaches after firing their head coaches. 

            “It’s an honor to be a head coach in the National Football League,” Ryans said. “And it is humbling. It’s truly a blessing to just be one of 32. There’s not a ton of these jobs. So, to be trusted to lead this organization is something I take seriously. And I know the men who came before me and the sacrifices they made for me to be in this position leading the organization.”

            Ryans said he received more than 500 texts congratulating him, with many saying how proud they were of him for reaching the pinnacle of coaching. 

            “Those same messages that I've gotten telling me how proud they are of me, I want to reflect that in our team,"" Ryans said. “We're preparing to make the city of H-town proud.”

It was a no-brainer to be here, be home.”Ryans was introduced as Houston’s new coach Thursday, giving him his first head coaching job in the place where he began his NFL playing career.The 38-year-old Ryans joins the Texans from the San Francisco 49ers, where he spent the past two seasons as their defensive coordinator.He replaces Lovie Smith, who was fired after just one season where the team went 3-13-1.Ryans' introduction Thursday had a celebratory feel for a team that hasn’t had much to celebrate recently as the team endured three straight dreadful seasons where coaches Bill O’Brien and David Culley were also let go.Ten current players and more than two dozen former players attended the event and many of them clapped and cheered as Ryans talked about his plans for this struggling franchise.People around town are buzzing about the Texans hiring one of their own, and Houston rappers “Bun B” and “Trae tha Truth” illustrated that Thursday, attending the news conference both wearing the No. 59 jersey Ryans wore as a player.Houston’s career leading receiver Andre Johnson was among those there to laud the new hire.“It’s a great day for the Texans organization to have DeMeco back,” he said. “I just felt like it was the right decision. The league now is going to a place where you have to have a guy who can relate to players, develop players, create those relationships with players and have the belief of the players. And I think DeMeco is the guy for that.”The Texans interviewed seven other candidates for the job, but it became clear pretty quickly that Ryans was their man.General manager Nick Caserio talked about their first interview with Ryans that came over Zoom minutes after he left the practice field where he was helping the 49ers prepare for a playoff game.“What did we like? Everything,” Caserio said. “It was one of the more impressive interviews, interactions I’ve ever been around. And the thing about it is he’s genuine. DeMeco is who he is. He’s sincere. He’s real.”At the end of that first interview Ryans left Caserio and team owner Cal McNair with some strong parting words.“I want to come home,” Caserio said Ryans told them. “This is my dream job. Let’s make it happen.”Ryans was a star linebacker in six seasons in Houston after being drafted in the second round in 2006. He won AP Defensive Rookie of the Year and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2007 and 2009.“When we drafted him in ’06, he took over the defense, stepped into the middle, called the plays,” McNair said. “He was captain and they called him ‘Cap’. So, he’s been a leader for a long, long time. ... I can’t tell you how excited I am that he’s here.”Ryans, who spent his entire six-year coaching career in San Francisco, knows he has a difficult task ahead of him to turn this team around. But he’s looking forward to the challenge.“We’re excited now, but we have to win,” he said. “We want to build the right staff. We want to get the right players so we can go out and win and compete. That’s when the excitement continues and that’s what we want to bring here.”Ryans joins Pittsburgh’s Mike Tomlin and Tampa Bay’s Todd Bowles as the only three Black head coaches in the NFL. There are three other minority coaches, including Miami’s Mike McDaniel, who has a Black father and identifies as biracial.Arizona and Indianapolis have yet to hire new coaches after firing their head coaches.“It’s an honor to be a head coach in the National Football League,” Ryans said. “And it is humbling. It’s truly a blessing to just be one of 32. There’s not a ton of these jobs. So, to be trusted to lead this organization is something I take seriously. And I know the men who came before me and the sacrifices they made for me to be in this position leading the organization.”Ryans said he received more than 500 texts congratulating him, with many saying how proud they were of him for reaching the pinnacle of coaching.“Those same messages that I've gotten telling me how proud they are of me, I want to reflect that in our team,"" Ryans said. “We're preparing to make the city of H-town proud.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/03,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798839,Kansas commits $304M to chip plant to lure federal funds,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas plans to give $304 million in taxpayer-funded incentives to a semiconductor company in its largest city to build a huge new factory, but the project won't go forward without funds the U.S. government has promised for rebuilding the nation's chip-making capacity.

            Gov. Laura Kelly announced Thursday that Kansas has an agreement with Integra Technologies, based in Wichita, for a 10-year package of tax breaks and reimbursement of expenses. State officials said the new, $1.8 billion plant would cover 1 million square feet, have 2,000 employees and create 3,000 additional jobs among suppliers and other local businesses.

            The announcement comes with the U.S. trying to reverse a loss of capacity for making the chips that are vital to smartphones, laptops and other modern-day conveniences, as well as automobiles and life-saving medical devices. Congress last year approved a measure that provides more than $52 billion in grants and other incentives for the semiconductor industry.











            Kelly told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that the state's incentives are crucial to attracting the federal funds and ""making Kansas an essential part of our country's national security efforts.”

            “This advanced manufacturing facility is part of a national push to restore our semiconductor industry so that U.S. workers and businesses can compete and win in the race for the 21st Century,"" Kelly said.

            Integra CEO Brett Robinson would not say how much federal funding the company needs, only that there is “no commercially viable way” to do the project without it. He and state officials said other states were trying to attract the project, though they did not disclose the competitors.

            “It's not just critical to the United States and to security, but it's critical to the supply chain,” said Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, a Wichita-area Republican.

            President Joe Biden pushed Congress last year to boost the U.S. semiconductor industry, because of a shortage of chips made worse by the global coronavirus pandemic and concerns about competing with international rivals, particularly China. There’s been a decades-long shift to cheaper-to-operate Asian chip plants, and the industry is now dependent on Taiwan, which China has long claimed as its own.

            “If we were ever to lose, for a sustainable amount of time, access to the southeast Asian supply chain, what we just went through would pale in comparison,” Robinson said.

            Integra, founded in 1983, has about 500 employees in Wichita and Silicon Valley and describes itself as the largest U.S. provider of the last two major assembly and testing steps in the chip manufacturing process. The new factory is expected to pay an average annual wage of $51,000, about 46% higher than the state's average of roughly $35,000.

            For Integra to receive its incentives, it must invest at least $1.5 billion in the new factory in the next five years and consistently provide the equivalent of 1,600 full-time jobs for 10 consecutive years.

            The incentives are part of a program Kansas created last year to ramp up its efforts to compete with other states for new, large factories. Under that program, the state was allowed to offer up to $1 billion in incentives to a single company each in 2022 and 2023.

            In July 2022, Kelly and other state officials announced that Panasonic Corp. plans to build a mega-factory to produce electric vehicle batteries for Tesla and other carmakers. The state lured the Japanese electronics giant's project to the edge of the Kansas City area with incentives worth $829 million over 10 years, the most the state has ever offered.

            
                The law allowing the incentives required top leaders of the Republican-controlled Legislature to sign off any deal between a company and the state Department of Commerce, which is led by Lt. Gov. David Toland, a Democrat like Kelly. The legislative leaders gave their approval just minutes ahead of the announcement, after meeting in private with Kelly for half an hour to review the agreement, with no opportunity for public review or input.

            The law also requires Kansas to drop its corporate income tax rates by half a percentage point for each mega-deal. If the Integra project goes forward, the top rate would decline to 6% from 7%, saving all corporations roughly $100 million a year.

            While both mega-projects have had bipartisan support, some lawmakers are critical of promising such big taxpayer-funded incentives to a single firm.

            “We have not written the checks for this first project and they’re starting the second one without even knowing that it works,” state Senate tax committee Chair Caryn Tyson, a conservative Republican from eastern Kansas, said before Thursday's announcement.

            McPherson has played just two games in the last 800 days. She had a knee injury that sidelined her for her senior year of high school and a different lower-body injury that kept her out of the Tar Heels' first 20 games this season. It didn't show against Virginia.

            McPherson, who had eight points in North Carolina's 69-58 road win over Clemson on Sunday, connected on 6 of 10 shots with two 3-pointers and added four assists for the Tar Heels (17-5, 8-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who have won eight straight conference games after a three-game skid to open ACC play. 











            Deja Kelly finished with 13 points and five rebounds for North Carolina. Alyssa Ustby had 12 points and Anya Poole and Kennedy Todd-Williams both scored 11. Poole grabbed eight rebounds.

            London Clarkson scored 23 points off the bench to lead the Cavaliers (14-9, 3-9), who have lost five straight. Clarkson made 8 of 13 shots and 7 of 8 free throws. Mckenna Dale had 15 points and nine rebounds, while Camryn Taylor scored 10.

            North Carolina managed just three free throws through the first six minutes and trailed by a point. Poole hit a jumper at the 3:17 mark and McPherson made two baskets in the final 94 seconds to give the Tar Heels a 9-8 lead after one quarter. 

            The Tar Heels used a 7-0 run, capped by Ustby's three-point play, to push their lead to 21-11 with 5:56 left before halftime. Ustby and McPherson each finished with five points in the quarter as North Carolina stretched its lead to 33-21 at halftime. Poole and McPherson combined to score 17 at intermission. The Tar Heels, who missed their first six shots and shot 30% in the first quarter, sank 9 of 12 attempts in the second. 

            North Carolina beat Virginia for a seventh straight time and for the 27th time in the last 30 games. 

            Virginia has lost 15 straight ACC road games and hasn't beaten a ranked team since 2017.

It didn't show against Virginia.McPherson, who had eight points in North Carolina's 69-58 road win over Clemson on Sunday, connected on 6 of 10 shots with two 3-pointers and added four assists for the Tar Heels (17-5, 8-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who have won eight straight conference games after a three-game skid to open ACC play.Deja Kelly finished with 13 points and five rebounds for North Carolina. Alyssa Ustby had 12 points and Anya Poole and Kennedy Todd-Williams both scored 11. Poole grabbed eight rebounds.London Clarkson scored 23 points off the bench to lead the Cavaliers (14-9, 3-9), who have lost five straight. Clarkson made 8 of 13 shots and 7 of 8 free throws. Mckenna Dale had 15 points and nine rebounds, while Camryn Taylor scored 10.North Carolina managed just three free throws through the first six minutes and trailed by a point. Poole hit a jumper at the 3:17 mark and McPherson made two baskets in the final 94 seconds to give the Tar Heels a 9-8 lead after one quarter.The Tar Heels used a 7-0 run, capped by Ustby's three-point play, to push their lead to 21-11 with 5:56 left before halftime. Ustby and McPherson each finished with five points in the quarter as North Carolina stretched its lead to 33-21 at halftime. Poole and McPherson combined to score 17 at intermission. The Tar Heels, who missed their first six shots and shot 30% in the first quarter, sank 9 of 12 attempts in the second.North Carolina beat Virginia for a seventh straight time and for the 27th time in the last 30 games.Virginia has lost 15 straight ACC road games and hasn't beaten a ranked team since 2017.UP NEXTNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels travel to play Louisville on Sunday.Virginia: The Cavaliers travel to play Pittsburgh on Sunday.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/03,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798851,Bengals' Joe Mixon charged with pointing gun at woman,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Cincinnati Bengals running back Joe Mixon has been charged in a warrant with pointing a gun at a woman and threatening her, according to court documents.

            Mixon faces a misdemeanor charge of aggravated menacing, according to the documents, which were filed Thursday in Hamilton County Municipal Court and obtained by The Associated Press. No attorney is listed for him in court records.

            According to the warrant, Mixon pointed the gun at the woman and told her, “You should be popped in the face. I should shoot you, the police (can't) get me.”











            The incident occurred on Jan. 21, the day before the Bengals beat the Buffalo Bills in a divisional-round playoff game.

            The 26-year-old Mixon rushed for 814 yards and seven touchdowns this season, his sixth. He also had 60 receptions for 441 yards, both career highs, and two touchdowns.

            A second-round draft pick out of Oklahoma in 2017, Mixon has spent his entire career with Cincinnati and rushed for career highs of 1,205 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2021.

            In 2014, when he was 18, Mixon punched a female Oklahoma student in the face, an attack captured on surveillance video. He was suspended from the football team for a year and entered an Alford plea, in which a defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges there is sufficient evidence for a conviction. He received a deferred sentence and was ordered to perform community service and undergo counseling.

            The incident hurt his standing in the draft, with several teams saying they passed on him because of concerns about his character.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798852,Messi has doubts about playing 2026 World Cup at age 39,"BUENOS AIRES (AP) — Lionel Messi may be in doubt as to whether he’ll be still playing for Argentina at the 2026 World Cup but he’s sure about one thing: he wants Lionel Scaloni to stay on as head coach until then, regardless. 

            The 35-year-old Messi led Argentina to the title in Qatar last December and wasn’t entirely sure if his fifth trip to the World Cup would be his last. The next edition will take place in Mexico, Canada and the United States when Messi is 39. 

            Messi told newspaper Olé in an interview published Thursday that he'd regularly said his age would make it difficult to play another World Cup.. 











            “I love playing soccer, I love what I do and while I am feeling well and feel I am fit and continue to enjoy it, I will do it. But it seems to be too much until the next World Cup,"" he told the newspaper. “I have to see where my career goes, what I will do. It depends on many things.”

            In the near future, he suggested he wants to play in next year's Copa America in the U.S. to help Argentina defend its title.

            “I will stay a little longer, I have to enjoy this,"" he said.

            Scaloni is negotiating an extension of his contract with the Argentinian soccer federation and Messi thinks the coach should remain on the job.

            “He is very important for the national team,"" Messi said. “To continue with this process would be spectacular.”

            Asked what it was like returning to his club París Saint Germain after Argentina beat France on penalties to win the World Cup, Messi said he didn't have deep discussions about it with his teammate Kylian Mbappé, the French striker.

            “One doesn't want to speak and bring the topic of the final,"" Messi said, recalling his own experience after losing the 2014 World Cup final to Germany in Brazil. ""I was also on the other side, I lost a World Cup final and I didn't want to talk about it."" 

            “Truth is there is no problem with Kylian, quite on the contrary,"" Messi said. 

            Messi is set to play for Argentina in friendlies to be scheduled in Buenos Aires in March to celebrate the team's third World Cup title with their fans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798860,US lawmakers call on secretary of state to visit Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of U.S. lawmakers has penned a letter urging U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to add a stop in Taiwan as he prepares to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) in Beijing.

            The letter, dated Thursday (Feb. 1), said that an official visit would demonstrate Washington’s “rock solid” commitment to Taiwan. It would “send a clear message that the United States strongly opposes China’s reckless military provocations in the region,” the congresspeople argued.

            They also said a stopover would be a chance for Blinken to comment on delays of U.S. arms delivery to Taiwan. The nation currently has approximately US$19 billion (NT$589 billion) in arms sales delayed in the U.S., including Javelin missiles, Stinger missiles, and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems.

            The lawmakers said a Taiwan visit “would be consistent with the congressional intent of the Taiwan Travel Act,” which allows U.S. government officials at all levels to meet with Taiwanese counterparts.











            The letter’s authors included Tom Tiffany, Scott Perry, Nancy Mace, Burgess Owens, Scott DesJarlais, Dan Crenshaw, Andy Ogles, Byron Donalds, and Earl L. Carter.

            Blinken is set to travel to China on Feb. 5 in hopes of thawing tense ties with Beijing. Blinken will also meet with the Director of China’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission, Wang Yi (王毅), and Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang (秦剛), according to the Financial Times.

            Blinken is the first secretary of state to meet Xi in China since Rex Tillerson visited in 2017, during the Trump administration, per the Financial Times.

            Additionally, newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has expressed interest in visiting Taiwan, told reporters at a press conference Thursday that he has no current plans to do so. “China’s never going to tell me where I can and can’t go. But I have nothing scheduled right now to go to Taiwan,” he said.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A group of U.S. lawmakers has penned a letter urging U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to add a stop in Taiwan as he prepares to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping (習近平) in Beijing.The letter, dated Thursday (Feb. 1), said that an official visit would demonstrate Washington’s “rock solid” commitment to Taiwan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798864,"As James nears record, Tuesday's Lakers game moved to TNT","NEW YORK (AP) — The NBA has further adjusted the schedule of nationally televised games with LeBron James closing in on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the league’s scoring record.

            James is on pace to break the record Tuesday at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder. That game will now be shown on TNT, a change that forced a reworking of that night’s entire schedule on the network.

            TNT was supposed to show Atlanta at New Orleans, followed by Minnesota at Denver. Instead, it’ll show Phoenix at Brooklyn first, followed by the Thunder-Lakers game.











            It’s a move that follows the NBA making similar adjustments earlier this week to show James and the Lakers nationally on Saturday, as he presumably moves closer to Abdul-Jabbar. That game was moved up two hours to a 6 p.m. Eastern start. The Lakers-Pelicans game was moved to ESPN2, preceding a national broadcast between Dallas and Golden State at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.

            James entered Thursday needing 89 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, who has been the league’s leading scorer since 1984.

            NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month in Paris that the league would ensure James’ record-breaking game is shown nationally, as well as making it globally available.

            If James doesn’t have the record after Tuesday’s game, his next game is already scheduled for national TV. The Lakers’ home game Feb. 9 against Milwaukee — the team that Abdul-Jabbar started his career with, before he joined the Lakers — will be shown on TNT.

Instead, it’ll show Phoenix at Brooklyn first, followed by the Thunder-Lakers game.It’s a move that follows the NBA making similar adjustments earlier this week to show James and the Lakers nationally on Saturday, as he presumably moves closer to Abdul-Jabbar. That game was moved up two hours to a 6 p.m. Eastern start. The Lakers-Pelicans game was moved to ESPN2, preceding a national broadcast between Dallas and Golden State at 8:30 p.m. on ABC.James entered Thursday needing 89 points to pass Abdul-Jabbar, who has been the league’s leading scorer since 1984.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month in Paris that the league would ensure James’ record-breaking game is shown nationally, as well as making it globally available.If James doesn’t have the record after Tuesday’s game, his next game is already scheduled for national TV. The Lakers’ home game Feb. 9 against Milwaukee — the team that Abdul-Jabbar started his career with, before he joined the Lakers — will be shown on TNT.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798866,NHL continues diversity efforts during All-Star celebrations,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Kim Davis sees a change in hockey from when she was a girl growing up in Chicago. Back then, she said, the sport didn’t seem like a place for Black girls like her.

            “There were no intentional messages that said the sport was for me, or for us,” said Davis, the NHL’s executive vice president of social impact, growth and legislative affairs.

            That is slowly changing, Davis said.











            She was hired in 2017 to lead diversity and inclusion initiatives in a league that has been criticized for its efforts in those areas. As the NHL prepares for its All-Star celebration in South Florida, its attempts to increase diversity continue to attract attention, not all of it positive.

            Some have questioned the NHL's commitment to change, and others have resisted some of its diversity efforts. Davis said the league hopes to combat criticism by holding itself accountable and “proving people wrong.”

            “We don't mind the hard questions being asked,” Davis said, “as long as the assessment is fair.""

            As the start of Black History Month coincided with the All-Star events, the NHL debuted a mobile museum that highlights minority and underrepresented contributors to the game, from Angela James, who was the first Black woman inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, to Kevin Weekes, the former NHL goalie who became the first Black former player to be a hockey analyst on national television.

            “Inclusion is what’s most important because you can be diverse, but if you’re not inclusive, what’s the point of having diversity?” said Jeff Scott, the NHL’s vice president for community development and growth, who helped with the museum’s creation. “What we’re showing here with this experience is the representation of access and opportunities.”

            Scott, who is Black, mentioned that hockey did not appear to be an option for him growing up. The goal of the museum, which is set up inside a bus that the league plans to bring to all 32 NHL markets, is to help eliminate some of the same barriers to entry into the sport that existed when he was young.

            ""Had I known that there was an option, or there were people out there that look like me,"" Scott said, “I may have been more inclined to do that.”

            The league in October released an internal demographic study of its staff and 32 teams. The report found that the NHL’s workforce is 83.6% white with men making up 62% of the total, based on the 4,200 people who participated in a voluntary and anonymous survey (about 67% of all employees). More than 90% of the league’s players and nearly all of its coaches and officials are white.

            Davis said the league plans to update the survey every two years to mark its progress.

            “We knew our demographics would be controversial at best,” Davis said, “but we wanted to be transparent because we are holding ourselves, first of all, accountable to the change.”

            By the time the next report is released, Davis said she hopes both fans and employees feel more welcomed by the league.

            “The word I like to use is intentionality,” Davis said. “We’re being intentional about making sure that people who otherwise have not seen the sport of hockey as something that was accessible to them, see it as accessible.”

            One of those ways is through the NHL's “Pathway to Hockey"" summit, which encourages newcomers to learn about hockey and consider careers in the NHL by telling the stories of people who work for the league.

            Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and potential presidential candidate, criticized the league's original advertisement of the summit, calling it discriminatory. The ad noted that participants must identify as female, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, Indigenous, LGBTQIA+ and/or disabled.

            “We do not abide by the woke notion that discrimination should be overlooked if applied in a politically popular manner or against a politically unpopular demographic,” Bryan Griffin, DeSantis’ press secretary, said in a statement. “We are fighting all discrimination in our schools and our workplaces, and we will fight it in publicly accessible places of meeting or activity. We call upon the National Hockey League to immediately remove and denounce the discriminatory prohibitions it has imposed on attendance to the 2023 ‘Pathway to Hockey’ summit.”

            The NHL, after revising the post, held the summit in Fort Lauderdale as planned, with more than 120 attendees, Davis said. She estimated that the participants had an average age of 25.

            As recently as five years ago, Davis added, the league likely wouldn't have been able to attract a diverse pool of people in that age group.

            “When you're not visible, a lot of times you're nonexistent,” Scott said. “We as a league are hyper-focused on what the future and growth of our game looks like while also sustaining and maintaining our current fan base.""

            Brown sank 10 of 13 shots from the floor and all seven of her free throws for the Wolverines (18-5, 8-4 Big Ten Conference). She added five assists and four rebounds. Maddie Nolan and Emily Kiser scored 10 points apiece. Kiser snagged six rebounds.

            Kendall Bostic and Genesis Bryant both had 18 points to pace the Fighting Illini (17-6, 7-5).











            Brown scored 11 points in the second quarter and Michigan turned a five-point first-quarter lead into a 41-22 advantage at halftime. The Wolverines shot a blistering 59.3% in the first half (16 of 27). Illinois shot 28.6% overall (8 of 28) and made only 3 of 15 from 3-point range.

            Bostic scored eight points in the third quarter and the Illini pulled within 55-41 by quarter's end.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798868,Former US Navy captain sentenced in massive bribery scandal,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — A former U.S. Navy captain who was caught up in a massive contracting scandal was sentenced Thursday to 2 1/2 years in federal prison for taking nearly $91,000 in bribes.

            Retired Capt. David Haas also was ordered to make restitution and to pay a $30,000 fine.

            Prosecutors said Haas, 54, of Kailua, Hawaii, was among dozens of Navy officials who were bribed to help obtain defense contracts for a man known as “Fat Leonard” Francis. 











            Francis owned Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd., or GDMA, which supplied food, water and fuel to vessels for decades. He has acknowledged overbilling the Navy by $35 million with the help of officers whom he plied with prostitutes, Kobe beef, cigars and other bribes so they would direct their ships to Pacific ports Francis controlled in Southeast Asia. 

            More than 30 people have been convicted or pleaded guilty in the sweeping corruption case. Francis, who also pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2015, was awaiting sentencing when he fled home confinement in San Diego last year and is now in custody in Venezuela, where he has requested asylum.

            From 2011 to 2013, Haas, who was captain of the 7th Fleet command ship Blue Ridge, accepted tens of thousands of dollars' worth of entertainment, including hotel rooms, prostitutes, alcohol and dinners, during multi-day parties arranged by Francis overseas, prosecutors said.

            Haas pleaded guilty in 2020 to conspiracy to commit bribery, a charge that could have carried up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

            In federal court in San Diego on Thursday, he told the judge he had brought shame on his family and the Navy and tarnished his two-decade career, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.

            “I should never have had a relationship with that guy,” Haas said. “I should never have allowed Leonard Francis into anywhere.”SAN DIEGO (AP) — A former U.S. Navy captain who was caught up in a massive contracting scandal was sentenced Thursday to 2 1/2 years in federal prison for taking nearly $91,000 in bribes.Retired Capt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798883,Free rides to be offered on New Taipei’s Ankeng Light Rail,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ankeng Light Rail in New Taipei, which connects with the Circular Line of the Taipei Metro, is offering month-long free rides starting next Friday (Feb. 10), when it enters a trial run.The New Taipei Metro confirmed on Thursday (Feb. 2) some rides on the light rail will be free after operations begin, but said details of the plan were still being hammered out.The Ankeng Light Rail, which completed construction in December and passed inspection in January, was granted a permit to start operations on Thursday. The project took six years to complete at a cost of NT$16.6 billion (US$560 million).With a length of 7.5 kilometers and nine stations, the line serves as an answer to the traffic woes of the Ankeng area, the suburbs of the city’s Xindian District which is going through robust development.A ride along the line's nine stops takes 21 minutes and residents can expect a reduction of 15 to 20 minutes in travel time before they reach Taipei, according to the New Taipei Department of Rapid Transit Systems.Ticket prices start at NT$20, modeled on the fares of the Danhai Light Rail that runs in Tamsui. Transfer discounts are available for passengers accessing public buses, the metro, and the bike rental service YouBike.The Ankeng Light Rail. (Facebook, Dortsntpc photos)",2023/02/03,856,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798894,"Miles, Citron lead No. 9 Irish past Boston College 72-59","BOSTON (AP) — Olivia Miles and Sonia Citron had already scored 10 straight points to put away Boston College when they turned their attention to other things.

            “I told Sonia I needed two more assists for the double-double. And she was like, ‘All right, I’ve got you,’” Miles said after helping No. 9 Notre Dame beat BC 72-59 on Thursday night.

            “That’s just kind of our communication on the court,” said Miles, who found Citron for baskets on the next two Irish possessions to complete a 14-0 run — with all 14 points from Miles and Citron. ""We just really play off each other really well.











            Miles scored 22 points with 10 assists and eight rebounds, and Citron scored 23 for the Irish (18-2, 9-1 Atlantic Coast Conference).

            Maria Gakdeng scored 16 points, T’Yana Todd had 13 and Andrea Daly scored 10 with eight rebounds for BC (14-11, 4-8). The Irish beat BC at home 85-48 on New Year’s Day but hadn’t won in Chestnut Hill since 2019.

            “This is such a tough place to play,” said Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey, whose team faces No. 16 Duke next. “We’ll celebrate it until about 12:30, and then we’ve got film. Tomorrow we start focusing on Duke.” 

            BC came within five points, 55-50, before the Irish ran off 14 points in a row — nine by Citron, and five by Miles. That put an end to what had been a back-and-forth game in which the Irish opened big leads and then frittered them away. 

            “I always feel like we’re close,” BC coach Joanna Bernabei-McNamee said. ""They’re young; I think consistency comes with experience. 

            “I think it’s a big improvement from the first time we played Notre Dame,” she said. “I still want to see more, and I want to see us grow up as fast as humanly possible because I think we do have a dangerous team when we going well.”

            Notre Dame led by 11 in the first quarter and held a 38-30 lead with two minutes gone in the third. BC scored 13 of the next 18 points, capitalizing on back-to-back Irish turnovers to tie it 43-all with three minutes left in the quarter.

            But Natalija Marshall put back the rebound of her own miss, Miles drove to the basket, Maddy Westbeld added a pair of baskets and then Miles stole the ball and found Citron on the fast break to make it 53-43.

            BIG PICTURE

            Notre Dame bounced back from their first league loss of the season, a 69-65 defeat at North Carolina State on Sunday. Now they face No. 16 Duke.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798895,Jazz forward Lauri Markkanen selected NBA All-Star reserve,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Growing up in Finland, Lauri Markkanen loved watching the NBA All-Star Game on television but never imagined he’d be a part of it. Even watching the selection show on TNT with his family Thursday night, Markkanen wondered if he’d get an invitation.

            “It was a nerve-racking experience,” Markannen said about having his name read next to last. “But everything worked out and I’m extremely happy.”

            Markkanen, a 7-foot forward, was named a first-time All-Star as a reserve for the game in Salt Lake City on Feb. 19.











            When the Jazz traded cornerstones Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert before the season, Markkanen arrived from Cleveland as somewhat of an enigma. But it didn’t take long for him to become Utah’s number one option. 

            Markkanen is averaging career highs of 24.9 points and 8.7 rebounds.

            “This wouldn’t happen without them,” Markkanen said about his teammates, coaches and staff. “I just got a chance to talk to everybody and thank them individually for all the hours they put in with me.”

            The Jazz are 27-26 and in the thick of the playoff race. Much of the credit goes to Markkanen’.

            “None of us are hoping. We are all expecting Lauri to be an All-Star,” Jazz coach Will Hardy said ahead of the announcement.

            Rookie teammate Walker Kessler has been his unofficial campaign manager and rarely misses an opportunity to tout Lauri’s accomplishments or hand out sweatshirts that have his image with ‘THE FINNISHER’ emblazoned on it.

            “The way he plays and the way he affects winning is just unbelievable — his efficiency and just how good he is at everything. He’s extremely physical and wants to win above everything,” Kessler said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798897,Lebioda leads on a day of ever-changing conditions at Pebble,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Changes in weather and fortunes can happen without notice in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, which seems to suit Hank Lebioda just fine these days.

            Playing his sixth different course in his last six rounds on the PGA Tour, Lebioda ran off six birdies in an eight-hole stretch for an 8-under 63 on the Shore course at Monterey Peninsula and a one-shot lead after the opening round Thursday.

            His big advantage was finishing before a pleasant day of mostly sunny, relatively calm conditions gave way to wind strong enough to bend flagsticks and force players to remove caps before they putted so they wouldn't blow off.











            Lebioda was among six players from the leading 12 scores who have yet to win on the PGA Tour. He doesn't have a good recipe for success in tournaments with multiple courses except to be prepared for anything.

            “This would be eight courses in three weeks for us,” said Lebioda, who missed the cut in the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines and The American Express. “Three courses in Palm Springs, two last week in San Diego and three this week. So the best thing you can do is take care of yourself, relax and make sure you're good to go.”

            Three of the top four scores to par were at Monterey Peninsula. Kurt Kitayama made four straight birdies around the turn and had a bogey-free 64, while Harry Hall made five straight birdies and was tied for the lead until a late bogey on No. 8. He also had 64.

            “The birdie streak on the front was pretty cool because I think I went bogey and then had a par on the second hole and then had five in a row. So it was really good,” Hall said. “Coming down the last two holes it started to blow 45 miles an hour. It was crazy. Happy to get in at 7 under today.”

            Chad Ramey had a 7-under 65 at Pebble Beach. He was tied for the lead until going into the front bunker on the par-3 17th and taking bogey.

            The best score at Spyglass Hill belonged to Keith Mitchell at 5-under 67. It was the only course where the average score was over par. Mitchell was alongside a pair of NFL quarterbacks. His amateur partner is Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills, whose caddie for the week is Kyle Allen of the Houston Texans. 

            The change in weather was not terribly severe — it's not like it snowed. Even so, it caused havoc among those trying to finish at Pebble Beach, the most exposed of the courses. 

            Will Gordon was tied for the lead to par at 8 under with three holes to play. From the middle of the 16th fairway into a strengthening wind, he came up 35 yards short of the back pin and made bogey. Dead into the wind on the par-3 17th to a right pin — the easiest location for three days to account for amateurs — he was some 30 yards short and dropped another shot.

            He finished with a triple bogey, driving into the ocean rocks left of the fairway and having to reload. His approach into a strong wind coming off the ocean left him behind a tree, and he hit that over the green into a bunker.

            In three holes, he went from tied for the lead to a tie for 24th.

            The celebrity rotation was at Spyglass Hill, regarded as the toughest of the three in calm conditions. U.S Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick and three-time major champion Jordan Spieth each managed a 71, while Viktor Hovland had a 70.

            Hovland is playing the tournament for the first time, though he won the U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach and was low amateur at Pebble in the 2019 U.S. Open.

            Spieth, who won this event in 2017, was mixture of birdies and bogeys, and then had to hang on for dear life over the final hour when temperatures plunged and the wind began whipping.

            “It was really bizarre the last four holes or so with the wind,” Spieth said. ""It went from nothing to flipping and then blowing about 25 out of nowhere the other direction than the forecast. That throws us through a big loop when you’re prepping for something and you got to make the adjustment.

            “But I had a good last three holes and that always kind of puts a smile on your face.”

            He played them in 1 under, with a tough par save from a flyer lie in the rough, having no idea what the wind was going to do when his ball got in the air.

About Malvern College 

            Malvern College UK is a day and boarding school founded in 1865. Together with its preparatory school, The Downs Malvern, Malvern College provides high quality education for boys and girls aged from 3 to 18 years. The School is renowned for its innovative approach to education; it pioneered the adoption of the Nuffield Science teaching approach (learning by experimenting) and was one of the first UK schools to adopt the IB Diploma programme and the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme. Malvern College UK now has an enviable reputation for being one of the most established IB schools in the UK and it comfortably beats the world average scores in all subject areas.   Thanks to its academic rigour, scientific heritage and its desire to offer a holistic education, the College, together with The Downs Malvern, has produced four Nobel Prize Winners: Francis William Aston, a Chemist; James Meade, an Economist; Alan Hodgkin, a physiologist; and Frederick Sanger, a Biochemist and double Nobel Laureate. Other famous alumni or, as they are referred to, 'Old Malvernians', include R. E. Foster, the only man to have captained both England football and cricket teams; C. S. Lewis, author of  The Chronicles of Narnia; Lord MacLaurin, the former Chairman of Tesco and Vodafone and until recently, Chairman of Malvern College; and Baron Weatherill, the former Speaker of the British House of Commons, as well as psychologist Edward Titchener, and England's current Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty.   40% of the 2022 International Baccalaureate (IB) cohort achieved 40 points or over (out of a maximum 45 points). Worldwide, only 1% of candidates score more than 44 points but, in 2022, four candidates managed to achieve this accolade. The average points scored, over the past five years, by Malvern's graduates has maintained the schools consistently excellent level of 37 points, which compares favourably to the 2022 world average of 32 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798917,UN envoy: Iraq's new leaders must keep fighting corruption,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. special envoy for Iraq urged the country’s new government Thursday to keep fighting corruption and move quickly on much-needed economic, fiscal and financial reforms.

            Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert told the U.N. Security Council many other areas also need immediate government attention, among them ensuring human rights, resolving issues with the Kurdistan Regional Government, improving public services, addressing environmental challenges, and continuing to return Iraqis from camps and prisons in northeast Syria.

            “The hope is that the confirmation of Iraq’s new government will provide an opportunity to structurally address the many pressing issues facing the country and its people,” she said. “The urgency is for Iraq’s political class to seize the brief window of opportunity it is awarded, and to finally lift the country out of recurring cycles of instability and fragility.”











            A more than year-long political stalemate punctuated by outbreaks of street violence ended in late October with the confirmation by Iraq's Council of Representatives of a new government and Cabinet led by Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. 

            Hennis-Plasschaert said that during its first three months, al-Sudani’s government has shown a commitment to tackle endemic corruption, poor public services and high unemployment.

            Turning to the fight against corruption, she pointed to a number of important steps taken by the government, including trying to recover stolen funds and investigating allegations of graft.

            “That said, I can only encourage the Iraqi government to persevere, as those who stand to lose will undoubtedly seek to hinder these efforts,” she said. “But if Iraq is to build a system that serves the need of society instead of serving a closed community of collusion, then ensuring accountability across the spectrum is absolutely essential.”

            The U.N. special representative said “systemic change” is vital to address corruption and improve services that directly affect people’s lives.

            As for economic, fiscal and financial reforms, Hennis-Plasschaert expressed concern at the increase in the exchange rate on the parallel market “adding to the pressure on everyday Iraqi women and men.”

            “On the short term, it is obviously essential that the federal budget is passed expeditiously,” she said. “A further delay will only result in worsening the situation due to the well-known spending constraints.”

            Despite high unemployment, Hennis-Plasschaert cautioned against any “further bloating” of Iraq’s “already extremely inflated public sector.”

            She cautioned the government against relying totally on the country’s oil, which is vulnerable to price shocks, and urged it to focus on diversifying the economy, including by developing an employment-generating private sector.

            Hennis-Plasschaert said the government also needs to swiftly implement the Sinjar Agreement brokered by the U.N. in October 2020 between Baghdad and the Kurdish-run regional government to jointly manage the Sinjar region. It is home to Iraq’s Yazidi religious minority, and the agreement aims to restore the state’s hold over the patchwork of militia groups and competing authorities in the area after the defeat of Islamic State extremists. 

            When IS fighters swept into northern Iraq in 2014 the militants massacred thousands of Yazidi men and enslaved an estimated 7,000 women, including Nadia Murad, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her campaign to end sexual violence as a weapon of war. She returned to her home village in Sinjar this week with actress and activist Angelina Jolie to meet survivors of IS brutality and see progress in redeveloping the region.

            U.S. deputy ambassador Richard Mill called on the government to improve its respect for human rights and commit to implementing the Sinjar Agreement in close consultation with the Yazidi community.

            He said the United States supports the prime minister’s efforts to root out corruption and improve public services, particularly providing electricity, and encourages development of the private sector and job growth, “with a focus on increasing women’s participation in the workforce.” 

            Mills added that the Biden administration is eager to work with the government on addressing the negative impacts of climate, including through the use of renewable energy and reducing gas flaring.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. special envoy for Iraq urged the country’s new government Thursday to keep fighting corruption and move quickly on much-needed economic, fiscal and financial reforms.Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert told the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798918,"UAB beats No. 19 FAU, ending nation-best 20-game win streak","BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Eric Gaines, Jordan “Jelly” Walker and UAB figured out a way to end the nation's longest winning streak.

            Gaines scored 21 points, Walker returned from an injury with 13 points and six assists and the Blazers ended No. 19 Florida Atlantic's 20-game winning streak with an 86-77 victory on Thursday night.

            The Owls (21-2, 10-1 Conference USA) hadn't lost since falling 80-67 to Mississippi on Nov. 11 and made their debut in the AP Top 25 2 1/2 weeks ago.











            “I don’t say we’re glad it’s behind us, because we wish it was behind us after the season was over,” Florida Atlantic coach Dusty May said. “Now, we’ll fade back into a really good team instead of a media darling.”

            Walker returned from a foot injury that had sidelined him since Jan. 11. He came in averaging 23.8 points a game and the Blazers (16-7, 7-5) had averaged just 62 points in their last three outings, while winning two of them.

            “When he’s on the floor it’s just as important with the spacing he creates to allow others to finish,” UAB coach Andy Kennedy said. “He goes for a very pedestrian 13 but we score 86. That’s usually two games' worth without him. It’s good to see us scoring the ball efficiently.” 

            The Blazers closed the first half on a 14-2 run capped by back-to-back 3-pointers from Walker and Ty Brewer for a 43-30 lead.

            Tavin Lovan added 10 points for UAB. 

            Nick Boyd led Florida Atlantic with 18 points. Johnell Davis added 17 on 5-of-19 shooting. Vladislav Golden had 13 points and seven rebounds, scoring 10 in the first half.

            UAB: The Blazers, who have struggled at the free-throw line in some losses, were 26 of 31 from the line (84%). Gaines was 10 of 11. They also made 27 of 60 shots (45%) from the field.

He came in averaging 23.8 points a game and the Blazers (16-7, 7-5) had averaged just 62 points in their last three outings, while winning two of them.“When he’s on the floor it’s just as important with the spacing he creates to allow others to finish,” UAB coach Andy Kennedy said. “He goes for a very pedestrian 13 but we score 86. That’s usually two games' worth without him. It’s good to see us scoring the ball efficiently.”The Blazers closed the first half on a 14-2 run capped by back-to-back 3-pointers from Walker and Ty Brewer for a 43-30 lead.Tavin Lovan added 10 points for UAB.Nick Boyd led Florida Atlantic with 18 points.

            The victory is just the second win away from home for the Wolverines this season and the first since they knocked off Minnesota in their Big Ten Conference opener December 8 in Minneapolis. 

            Brooks Barnhizer's jumper with four seconds left in the first half pulled Northwestern within a point at intermission, 26-25.

Dickinson dunked, was fouled and added the free throw and Terrance Williams II knocked down a 3-pointer to push the Wolverines' lead into double digits and the Wildcats never got within 10 points again. 

            Dickinson was 5 of 5 from the free-throw line and is 22 of 24 from the line over his last five games. Kobe Bufkin finished with a double-double, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. He added eight assists, two steals and a block. Baker hit 3 of 4 from distance and scored 14.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798924,Recording: Wife told police mentally ill husband had gun,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police in Culver City, California, released body camera footage Thursday showing events before officers shot an unarmed man diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the back last year, including audio recordings of his estranged wife telling police he was armed and dangerous. 

            In the footage, officers are seen chasing after Guillermo Medina and yelling, “Stop running. You're going to get shot!” and then saying to each other that Medina was reaching into his waistband: “Gun in hand! Gun in hand!"" 

            One officer is then heard saying “cell phone” as shots ring out and Medina falls to the ground, dropping a black phone. 











            Culver City police said none of the officers involved reported hearing the officer say it might be a cell phone in Medina's hand. 

            In recordings of Medina's wife speaking to a dispatcher and later to an officer who stayed with her after Guillermo Medina fled her apartment building that night, Adriana Medina described her husband as “dangerous,"" a gang member and said, “He's got a gun and I'm scared.” She also told the officer Medina had threatened to kill her and told her he had considered killing himself in a shootout.

            The recordings contradict what she and her attorney told reporters on Tuesday at a press conference to announce they were filing a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Dec. 18 fatal shooting in the Los Angeles suburb. 

            Adriana Medina told reporters she purposely avoided calling 911 and dialed the main number of the police station when her husband showed up at her apartment complex, pounding on windows. She said she hoped for a mental health intervention because her husband hadn't taken his medication for his schizophrenia in a couple of weeks. 

            She told police she did not believe her husband was going to hurt anyone, according to the lawsuit.

            Attorney V. James DeSimone echoed that. “There was no report of domestic violence,” DeSimone said. “There was no report that he was threatening her with a handgun. She never saw a gun.”

            DeSimone presented a surveillance video from a building that showed Medina loping up to a utility pole and then dropping to his knees and rolling onto his back. Officers approached slowly and one appeared to handcuff him. It appeared to take several minutes before first aid was rendered.

            “I did not intentionally mislead,” DeSimone said Thursday when reached by The Associated Press for comment on the newly released recordings. He said his firm did its best to accurately convey what the client told them and she “clearly didn’t recall everything she told the police.”

            “I think the underlying issue here still remains the same: he didn’t have a gun and he was shot in the back,” DeSimone said. ""The law still does not justify killing him when less lethal means could have been used to apprehend him.”

            Ed Obayashi, a policing expert who investigates use of force incidents for law enforcement in California and nationwide, disagrees. He said police were justified in firing their weapons based on what he saw in the body camera footage and what was said to dispatch. 

            In the recordings, Adriana Medina tells police her husband was outside her apartment waving around a gun and pounding on windows. Body camera footage then shows him ignoring police commands to come out of the complex, put his hands up and walk toward police. Instead, he ran and got into his car. Police pursue him through the streets of Los Angeles for nearly an hour as he rams a car at an intersection to move it out of the way and then crashes into a curb before getting out and running on foot. 

            Officers later found a replica handgun in his crashed vehicle, police said. 

            “Under these circumstances these officers were more than justified in believing that Guillermo has a gun and is willing to use it,"" Obayashi said.

            The shooting is being investigated by the state attorney general’s office.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798928,"James closes in on scoring record, Lakers rally past Pacers","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — LeBron James just put his head down and repeatedly drove to the basket Thursday night.

            It was his vintage move.

            The same late-game philosophy that led to four NBA championships and has him on the precipice of becoming the NBA's new career scoring champ worked perfectly again at Indiana. James finished with 26 points, seven rebounds and seven assists and fueled another frantic fourth-quarter rally, helping erase a 14-point deficit to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 112-111 victory over the Pacers.











            
                He's now 63 points away from breaking Kareem Abdul Jabbar's career record, 38,387 points.

            “I just understood my game was needed more on the interior tonight,” James said. “Needed to get some rebounds, need to get some baskets in there and and I felt like we were attacking, especially in the fourth quarter.”

            James looked content doing the dirty work even though the Lakers trailed the entire first three quarters, usually by double digits.

            But with a friendly road crowd imploring James to lead the Lakers back, his 3-pointer with 2:35 left in the game gave Los Angeles its first lead of the game. Anthony Davis' short jumper with 35.1 seconds left and subsequent block proved to be the decisive plays on a night he had 31 points and 14 rebounds, but was left out of the All-Star Game.

            For the third time in 21 months, Indiana found itself at the forefront of a league-changing pursuit. It was here in May 2021 that Russell Westbrook recorded his 181st career triple-double to tie Oscar Robertson’s career mark. And it was here in December 2021 that Stephen Curry made five 3-pointers to pull within one of matching Ray Allen’s career mark of 2,973.

            James is now at 38,325 and this one clearly means something special to him.

            “I think it's one of the greatest records in sports, in general,” he said. “It's like the home run record in baseball. It's one of those records that you don't ever see or think will be broken. You see guys like Hank Aaron, who had it for so long. You see guys like Sammy (Sosa) and Mark McGwire and you start climbing it and it's like ‘Oh, this could really happen.’ It's a fun thing as a sports person. It was fun watching those guys chasing it.""

            But it was the Pacers who were chasing late.

            On a night Aaron Nesmith scored a career-high 24 points, newly minted All-Star Tyrese Haliburton added 26 points and 12 assists in his first game in three weeks and Myles Turner had 20 points and 13 rebounds after signing a two-year contract extension, Buddy Hield missed a 17-footer as the clock ran out.

            Indiana has lost four straight and this one befuddled longtime coach Rick Carlisle.

            Indiana relied on pace and speed to take control and still led led 98-84 early in the fourth.

            But the Lakers won it by going to the free-throw line 16 times, compared to zero for Indiana, in the final quarter.

            “The foul discrepancy and free-throw discrepancy (16-0 in the fourth quarter), is something I've never seen in my 38 years in the league,"" Carlisle said, crediting the Lakers for being aggressive. “There was a lot going on out there and they'll see it in black and white in New York. Or actually, they'll see it in HD.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798931,"ASEAN ministers urge reduced violence, dialogue in Myanmar","JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Southeast Asian foreign ministers urged Myanmar's military rulers on Friday to reduce violence and allow unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to pave the way for a national dialogue aimed at ending the country's worsening crisis.

            Meeting in Indonesia's capital, the ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also granted observer status to East Timor, Asia's newest nation, ahead of it becoming the regional bloc's 11th member.

            Myanmar is an ASEAN member, but its foreign minister was excluded from Friday's annual ministers' retreat because of his country's failure to implement a five-step consensus on restoring peace forged in 2021 between ASEAN and Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.











            Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, who hosted Friday's meetings, said the ministers agreed that an inclusive national dialogue “is key to finding a peaceful resolution to the situation in Myanmar,” and that reducing violence and providing humanitarian assistance are “paramount for building trust and confidence.” 

            She said the lack of progress in Myanmar “tests our credibility” as a group, and that ASEAN's efforts toward peace would be coordinated with those of other countries and the United Nations.

            Myanmar's military leader promised in the five-point agreement to allow a special ASEAN envoy to meet with jailed ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others to foster a dialogue aimed at easing the crisis, set off by the military's seizure of power two years ago. But Myanmar refused to let an ASEAN envoy meet with Suu Kyi last year, resulting in Min Aung Hlaing's exclusion from an ASEAN summit last November.

            The increasing violence in Myanmar since the military takeover loomed large over the foreign ministers' meetings, even as Indonesia, this year's ASEAN chair, sought to dampen concerns that the crisis will overshadow other issues and hold the bloc “hostage.” 

            In her opening remarks, Marsudi said the ministers were meeting in the midst of immense global challenges in which the Indo-Pacific region is not immune, including geopolitical, food, energy, financial and ecological crises, as well as major power rivalries that could spill over and potentially destabilize the region.

            The ministers warmly applauded the East Timor delegation as it participated in an ASEAN ministerial meeting for the first time.

            “It is a crucial steppingstone in our long journey to join the big family of the ASEAN community,” East Timor Foreign Minister Adaljiza Magno said,

            ASEAN agreed in principle to admit East Timor as the group’s 11th member at last November's ASEAN summit.

            East Timor applied for full membership in ASEAN in 2011, but some members feared its poverty would be a burden and slow efforts to achieve an ASEAN Economic Community.

            The U.N. estimates that nearly half of East Timor’s population lives below the extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day, and that 42 of every 1,000 babies die before their fifth birthday because of malnutrition.

            The former Portuguese colony was occupied by Indonesia for a quarter-century and gained independence after a U.N.-sponsored referendum in 1999. Indonesia’s military responded with scorched-earth attacks that devastated East Timor.JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Southeast Asian foreign ministers urged Myanmar's military rulers on Friday to reduce violence and allow unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to pave the way for a national dialogue aimed at ending the country's worsening crisis.Meeting in Indonesia's capital, the ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also granted observer status to East Timor, Asia's newest nation, ahead of it becoming the regional bloc's 11th member.Myanmar is an ASEAN member, but its foreign minister was excluded from Friday's annual ministers' retreat because of his country's failure to implement a five-step consensus on restoring peace forged in 2021 between ASEAN and Myanmar’s military leader, Senior Gen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798954,Cavs All-Star Mitchell calls Grizzlies' Brooks dirty player,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell took his most vicious shots at Dillon Brooks after the game.

            Accusing Brooks of being a dirty player, Mitchell said the NBA needs to do something about the Memphis guard's unruly bad behavior after he smashed Cleveland's All-Star guard in the groin during the Cavaliers' 128-113 victory over the Grizzlies on Thursday night.

            “That’s just who he is,” said Mitchell, who was ejected in the third quarter for throwing the ball at Brooks. ""We’ve seen it a bunch in this league with him. Him and I have had our personal battles for years.











            “There’s no place for that in the game. This has been brewing for years with me and other guys in the league. You all see it. This isn’t new.”

            Darius Garland scored 32 points shortly after being left off the All-Star team and carried Cleveland following Mitchell's ejection as the Cavs handed the Grizzlies their seventh loss in eight games.

            Garland was one of several players having All-Star-caliber seasons not named an Eastern Conference reserve by the coaches. He added 11 assists as the Cavs bounced back from a tough loss to Miami on Tuesday night.

            “He was brilliant,” Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “He knew how important this game was to us and what we needed from him. That’s what leaders do.”

            Mitchell, voted an All-Star starter last week, was tossed in the third quarter for throwing the ball at Brooks after the pair tangled under the basket. Brooks also was thrown out.

            With the Cavs leading 81-76, Brooks missed a shot and fell in the lane. While on the floor, he flung his arm back and struck Mitchell, who was standing over him, in the groin area. Mitchell dropped in pain and retaliated by firing the ball at Brooks and then charging and shoving him along the baseline in front of the Memphis bench.

            As the altercation threatened to spill into the seats, officials and players were able to get things under control before any punches were thrown.

            It's possible the league could punish Brooks further, and Mitchell believes additional penalities are warranted.

            “There should be something,” he said. ""This isn’t just a Donovan thing. This has happened to other players throughout this league, and it’s complete (expletive). Those guys talk (junk) and that’s fine, that’s all a part of basketball. We all grew up playing that way.

            ""But when you start doing cheap (stuff), that ain’t it. That’s where my frustration lies. It’s not about talking back and forth. That’s cool, but when you start doing little stuff like that.”

            Bickerstaff felt Mitchell, who said he has had previous run-ins with Brooks, had every right to defend himself.

            “That was a cheap shot in multiple ways,” he said. ""A guy should have the right to stand up for himself. I thought Donovan did that. I’m proud of our guys. We don’t have those guys that start (expletive)t, but we have guys who don’t run from (expletive) shit and you have to in this league.

            ""You have to stand up for yourself. That’s what he did and his teammates had his back.”

            Brooks refused to discuss the altercation with Mitchell in any detail. When he was asked about the exchange, Memphis All-Star Ja Morant stepped in and said the Grizzlies would not talk about the incident.

            Brooks did say he agreed with the flagrant-2 call.

            “It saved me some T’s (technicals),” he said.

            The Grizzlies have a reputation as the NBA’s most talkative team, but Morant believes they're being unfairly judged.

            “Anything when it comes to negative about the Grizzlies, we normally, you know, get the punishment,"" Morant said. ""It ain’t the same. They (the NBA) hate us.”

            While Mitchell said he and Brooks have a long history, Morant denied the Grizzlies having any issues with the four-time All-Star.

            “We don’t got no history with nobody,” Morant said. ""We don’t beef with nobody.” 

            Cedi Osman scored 21 points and Jarrett Allen added 18 points and 11 rebounds for Cleveland.

            Evan Mobley had 17 points and 14 rebounds.

            Desmond Bane scored 25 points and Morant had 24 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for Grizzlies despite being in foul trouble most of the night. 

            Memphis played without All-Star forward Jaren Jackson Jr., who sustained a thigh bruise in Tuesday night in a loss to Portland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798960,"Barrett scores 30, helps Knicks hold off Heat 106-104","NEW YORK (AP) — RJ Barrett never gave his coach a chance to sit him for long Thursday night. 

            Barrett rebounded from a late-game benching with 30 points, Isaiah Hartenstein made big plays on both ends of the floor in the final minute and the New York Knicks beat the Miami Heat 106-104.

            Barrett played about five minutes to start the fourth quarter Tuesday, then never got back in the rest of regulation or overtime in the Knicks’ 129-123 loss to the Lakers. He was on the floor for 41 minutes this time, including the whole fourth quarter, when he delivered some timely drives to the basket.











            “The thing that I love about RJ is I always believe he’s going to bounce back and I saw it immediately the next day after the Laker game,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I said we’ll be fine because I know, like, it’s important to RJ, so I knew he’d come out aggressive.” 

            New York pulled out the victory after Erik Spoelstra correctly challenged a call that turned a Heat foul into a Knicks turnover. But Tyler Herro's potential winning 3-point attempt bounced off the rim.

            Julius Randle added 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Knicks, who pulled within a game of Miami for sixth place in the Eastern Conference, the final guaranteed playoff spot. Quentin Grimes scored 17 points.

            Hartenstein dunked with 33 seconds left for a three-point lead. After Herro's 3-point attempt rimmed out, the Heat got a steal and got another chance to tie, but Hartenstein knocked away a pass and the Knicks got it to Randle all alone for a dunk and a 106-101 lead. 

            Max Strus made a 3-pointer to cut it two, setting the Heat up for another chance before Herro's miss from the corner.

            “I thought we had a good look,” Herro said. ""It was still a tough shot, but it was a good shot. Missed it, and get back to the drawing board.”

            Bam Adebayo finished with 32 points and nine rebounds for the Heat, while Herro scored 25 points and Strus had 17.

            The Knicks snapped a two-game losing streak despite playing without point guard Jalen Brunson, who was scratched with an illness unrelated to COVID-19. But they had a much better Barrett than Tuesday, when he was 5 for 13 for 13 points.

            “I feel like I hadn’t really had aggression from start to finish in a while, so today I just tried to do that,” Barrett said. 

            The Knicks started the third quarter with an 11-0 run, extending a three-point lead to 62-48 as the Heat missed their first seven shots. Then Adebayo made a jumper to start a 21-4 response, which included Kyle Lowry making a go-ahead 3-pointer after missing his first seven shots, as Miami rallied for a 69-66 edge.

            New York swung momentum right back its way with another 11-0 burst and led 77-72 after three.

            Heat: G Victor Oladipo missed the game with a sprained right ankle. Spoelstra said the injury was unrelated to the serious leg injuries that cost him significant time the last few seasons and said the guard was day to day. ... Haslem, whose had played only five games with a season high of 11 minutes in his 20th NBA season, played 10 minutes. 

            Knicks: Immanuel Quickley started for Brunson and had eight points and six rebounds. 

            ALL-STAR SELECTIONS

            Both teams believed they should have two All-Stars, but had to settle for one. Randle was picked for the second time, but the Knicks hoped Brunson would also get the nod in his first season in the Eastern Conference. Adebayo also is now a two-time All-Star, but Jimmy Butler was not selected. He had just 10 points on 5-of-13 shooting.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsNEW YORK (AP) — RJ Barrett never gave his coach a chance to sit him for long Thursday night.Barrett rebounded from a late-game benching with 30 points, Isaiah Hartenstein made big plays on both ends of the floor in the final minute and the New York Knicks beat the Miami Heat 106-104.Barrett played about five minutes to start the fourth quarter Tuesday, then never got back in the rest of regulation or overtime in the Knicks’ 129-123 loss to the Lakers. He was on the floor for 41 minutes this time, including the whole fourth quarter, when he delivered some timely drives to the basket.“The thing that I love about RJ is I always believe he’s going to bounce back and I saw it immediately the next day after the Laker game,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “I said we’ll be fine because I know, like, it’s important to RJ, so I knew he’d come out aggressive.”New York pulled out the victory after Erik Spoelstra correctly challenged a call that turned a Heat foul into a Knicks turnover. But Tyler Herro's potential winning 3-point attempt bounced off the rim.Julius Randle added 23 points, 10 rebounds and six assists for the Knicks, who pulled within a game of Miami for sixth place in the Eastern Conference, the final guaranteed playoff spot. Quentin Grimes scored 17 points.Hartenstein dunked with 33 seconds left for a three-point lead. After Herro's 3-point attempt rimmed out, the Heat got a steal and got another chance to tie, but Hartenstein knocked away a pass and the Knicks got it to Randle all alone for a dunk and a 106-101 lead.Max Strus made a 3-pointer to cut it two, setting the Heat up for another chance before Herro's miss from the corner.“I thought we had a good look,” Herro said. ""It was still a tough shot, but it was a good shot. Missed it, and get back to the drawing board.”Bam Adebayo finished with 32 points and nine rebounds for the Heat, while Herro scored 25 points and Strus had 17.The Knicks snapped a two-game losing streak despite playing without point guard Jalen Brunson, who was scratched with an illness unrelated to COVID-19. But they had a much better Barrett than Tuesday, when he was 5 for 13 for 13 points.“I feel like I hadn’t really had aggression from start to finish in a while, so today I just tried to do that,” Barrett said.The Knicks started the third quarter with an 11-0 run, extending a three-point lead to 62-48 as the Heat missed their first seven shots. Then Adebayo made a jumper to start a 21-4 response, which included Kyle Lowry making a go-ahead 3-pointer after missing his first seven shots, as Miami rallied for a 69-66 edge.New York swung momentum right back its way with another 11-0 burst and led 77-72 after three.“We just couldn’t put them away. Any time we got a little bit of a lead, we couldn’t put them away.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798968,Carr says he won't extend deadline to assist Raiders trade,"HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Derek Carr said Thursday night he will not extend the Feb. 15 deadline to help facilitate a trade from the Las Vegas Raiders.

            The Raiders must trade or release the quarterback by that date — three days after the Super Bowl — or Carr's contract will become guaranteed and Las Vegas will have to pay him $40.4 million over the next two years.

            Because a trade wouldn't be official until March 15 when the new league year begins, a team could renege on a deal made before then. Carr would have to agree to extend the mid-February deadline to ensure any agreements remained in place.











            “I don't think that would be best for me,” said Carr, who has a no-trade clause in his contract.

            Even so, Carr said a trade could be reached by Feb. 15, but didn't sound as though he was in a hurry to make it happen.

            The Raiders have not given Carr or his agent, Tim Younger, permission to speak with other teams regarding a potential deal. 

            “I’m just abiding by the rules,” Carr said. “If it gets to that date, then it gets to that date, and I’ll be able to talk to all my friends.”

            Carr competed in the precision passing contest at Raiders headquarters as part of Pro Bowl festivities, and his event-high 31 points helped give the AFC an early 9-3 lead over the NFC. When asked on ESPN's broadcast whether he had ever been that hot in Las Vegas, Carr quipped: “Not that hot. Probably why I'm going somewhere else.”

            Carr played nine seasons for the Raiders and holds club records for career yards passing (35,222) and touchdown passes (217). But he also never won a playoff game. And after struggling late in the season, Carr was benched with two games remaining and acknowledged he was angry about the decision.

            He said he is prepared to try free agency should the Raiders release him, and said Peyton Manning shared his experiences with him after going through a similar situation. The Indianapolis Colts released Manning, who is coaching the AFC team at the Pro Bowl, in 2012 and he went on to win a Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos.

            “He’s like, ‘Man, it was kind of surreal in the moment. Like, wow, you can’t even believe it. But then you just go to the next place and you move on and do your best there,'"" Carr said. “It’s nice to hear that from someone who I think is the best to play the game.”

            Carr said he will always consider himself as part of the Raiders organization and anticipates possibly returning for team events in the future, but is looking forward to what might be coming next for his playing career.

            “I’m just looking for teams that have made that decision consistently that they’ll do whatever it takes to put a winning program out there,” Carr said. “So for me, that’s just to win, win a championship. That’s at the forefront of the mind. It’s not money.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4798969,Surge in enterovirus cases worries Taiwan medical experts,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The medical community in Taiwan is sounding the alarm on enteroviruses amid a spike in cases, with young children at particularly high risk.The country recorded 890 cases between Jan. 22-28, down from the previous week with 2,019 infections, but it was due to the limited clinical services during the Lunar New Year holiday. Last week the emergency departments added 134 cases, up 74% from a week earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).An epidemic of the virus among schoolchildren could be on the horizon, warned Hsieh Tsung-hseuh (謝宗學), a pediatric emergency medicine physician at the Chung Shan Medical University Hospital. He advised the adoption of measures including class suspension and quarantine in the event of an outbreak as the winter break is about to end soon.The fact that the more than 400,000 Taiwanese newborns during the past three years have largely not been exposed to enteroviruses thanks to COVID-19 prevention is worrying, he said. With restrictions being removed, a surge in cases can be anticipated in youngsters, he said in a Facebook post.The CDC on Jan. 16 said the country recorded its first death from the virus in two years, a girl aged five months. She had developed symptoms of coughing and excessive mucus in December before being identified as a severe enterovirus-D68 infection on Jan. 6 and passed away on Jan. 12.Adimmune and its subsidiary Enimmune have jointly developed a vaccine targeting the strain A71, the first homegrown enterovirus vaccine.

This was an eightfold increase and met a surging demand for protective equipment when the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020.Shen is also known for his strong interpersonal and communication skills. His appointment as the head of TFH has been described as a trump card for the state-run financial holdings group in developing SMEs and finance businesses.Joseph Lu, a longtime banker and former finance minister, will head the Bank of Taiwan as president.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799011,AFC takes early lead over NFC in newly designed Pro Bowl,"HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — Las Vegas quarterback Derek Carr scored an event-high 31 points in the precision passing contest of the Pro Bowl skills competitions Thursday night to give the AFC an early 9-3 lead over the NFC.

            Carr, in familiar territory with the events being held at Raiders headquarters, said he will not extend the Feb. 15 deadline to help facilitate a trade from Las Vegas. The Raiders must trade or release the quarterback by that date — three days after the Super Bowl — or Carr’s contract will become guaranteed and Las Vegas will have to pay him $40.4 million over the next two years.

            But his performance during the two-day competitions boosted the AFC with each event counting as three points.











            The AFC also won the lightning round — a series of competitions that included a water balloon toss — and long drive contest, and the NFC got on the scoreboard by winning the dodgeball tournament.

            The NFL changed the Pro Bowl format this year, replacing the traditional all-star game with a flag football contest and series of other skills events. Four skills events take place Sunday at Allegiant Stadium, and those also will be three points each.

            Three flag football games will then be played, the first two each worth six points. The points will then be combined with those accumulated from the skills events, which will be the score entering the third and final flag football game to determine the winner.

            Most of Thursday's events were played at the Raiders' facility before about 500 fans, cheerleaders from 12 teams and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

The points will then be combined with those accumulated from the skills events, which will be the score entering the third and final flag football game to determine the winner.Most of Thursday's events were played at the Raiders' facility before about 500 fans, cheerleaders from 12 teams and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/03,,World

            Ingram was called for a foul, and New Orleans successfully challenged. Doncic returned after the break for the review, but after one trip down the court, the 23-year-old star screamed in frustration as he limped to the locker room without looking at the Dallas bench.

            The Mavericks were up by 27 points when Doncic exited with 6:47 remaining in the third, and the lead was all the way down to four when Herbert Jones hit a layup with 58 seconds left in the game. Ingram scored 26 points.

            Mitchell, voted an All-Star starter last week, was tossed in the third quarter for throwing the ball at Grizzlies guard Dillon Brooks after the pair tangled under the basket. Brooks also was thrown out.

            With the Cavs leading 81-76, Brooks missed a shot and fell in the lane. While on the floor, he flung his arm back and struck Mitchell, who was standing over him, in the groin area. Mitchell dropped in pain and retaliated by firing the ball at Brooks and then charging and shoving him along the baseline in front of the Memphis bench.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799018,Reese rescues No. 3 LSU in 82-77 OT win over Georgia,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Angel Reese showed little interest in celebrating after extending her LSU-record double-double streak to help the third-ranked Tigers maintain their unblemished record.

            She wasn't all that pleased with how she or her team played. 

            Reese had 23 points and 14 rebounds to extend her streak of double-doubles to 22 games, and No. 3 LSU narrowly remained unbeaten with an 82-77 victory over Georgia in overtime Thursday night. 











            “Honestly, it's a wake-up call,” Reese said. ""We beat Tennessee (on Monday) and then we came into Georgia thinking they were going to lay down.

            “They didn't lay down,” Reese continued. “We're definitely the hunted and I think they did a great job scouting us, they did a great job playing against us.” 

            Alexis Morris highlighted her 15-point night with a 3 from the right corner in the final minute of the extra period to give LSU (22-0, 10-0 SEC) a 77-74 lead, and the Tigers held on from there.

            “Lex has hit a few of those big shots this year,” LSU coach Kim Mulkey said. “It was big.”

            Morris was coming off a career-high 31 points against Tennessee, but didn't score in the first half against Georgia. She hit one 3 in the third quarter and scored 12 of her points in the fourth period and overtime

            “I was clutch when I needed to be,” Morris said. “Of course, it’s frustrating because everybody’s expecting me to have another 30-ball right? But I showed up in a way I needed to.”

            Diamond Battles scored 22 points for Georgia (15-9, 4-6), which had a chance to pull within a point when De'Mauri Flournoy was fouled behind the 3-point line with 8 seconds left. But Flournoy made just one free throw. 

            Morris rebounded Flournoy's last miss and then hit two free throws for the final margin.

            Reese grabbed 11 of her rebounds on the offensive end, helping LSU score 20 vital second-chance points.

            “We didn't shoot well tonight, so I just tried to get as many rebounds as I could get to get second-chance opportunities,” said Reese, whose point total could have been higher had she not missed six of her 15 free throws. 

            Sa'Myah Smith and LaDazhia Williams each scored 10 points for LSU, which rallied from a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter.

            Brittney Smith scored 13 points, Javyn Nicholson 12 and Alisha Lewis 11 for Georgia, which held the Tigers to their second-lowest regulation point total this season.

            The Lady Bulldogs “fought, they stayed together, they stayed focused, they stuck to the game plan,"" Georgia coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson said. ""Maybe the only thing we didn’t do really well is box out.”

            Georgia led 59-50 after Battles converted her steal of Flau’Jae Johnson’s pass into a fast-break layup with 7:53 left.

            But the Tigers quickly cut it to 59-55 on Reese’s basket inside and Morris’ 3.

            Reese hit four straight free throws over multiple possessions to pull LSU back into a tie at 63. After Battles' free throws put Georgia back in front, Morris again tied it with a fast-break layup.

            Smith and LSU's Kateri Poole each made one of two free throws, and regulation ended tied at 66 after both teams failed to score on their final possessions of the period.

            The Lady Bulldogs never trailed by more than four points until the final seconds of overtime. LSU held a 30-29 lead at halftime, but Georgia led for the last 5:07 of the third quarter, going up 55-48 after Battles' fast-break layup.

            “We can't get lax,” Reese said. “Just getting back in the gym and being able to get better, I think that's going to be important for us.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Georgia: The Lady Bulldogs looked formidable defensively in recent victories over Missouri (62-51) and Mississippi State (62-34) and maintained that form at LSU, holding the Tigers to 36% shooting (24 of 67). Nicholson scored at least 10 points for the 10th time this season, and for the seventh time in a reserve role. 

            LSU: This marked just the fourth time this season the Tigers were held below 70 points in regulation and the first time they were pushed to overtime. Georgia's defense had a lot to do with that, but LSU missed a number of open shots. The Tigers' 18 turnovers were relatively few against a Georgia squad that has forced 20 or more opponent turnovers in 15 games this season, but Georgia was efficient in scoring 21 points off turnovers. LSU outscored Georgia at the foul line 28-15.

But Flournoy made just one free throw.Morris rebounded Flournoy's last miss and then hit two free throws for the final margin.Reese grabbed 11 of her rebounds on the offensive end, helping LSU score 20 vital second-chance points.“We didn't shoot well tonight, so I just tried to get as many rebounds as I could get to get second-chance opportunities,” said Reese, whose point total could have been higher had she not missed six of her 15 free throws.Sa'Myah Smith and LaDazhia Williams each scored 10 points for LSU, which rallied from a nine-point deficit in the fourth quarter.Brittney Smith scored 13 points, Javyn Nicholson 12 and Alisha Lewis 11 for Georgia, which held the Tigers to their second-lowest regulation point total this season.The Lady Bulldogs “fought, they stayed together, they stayed focused, they stuck to the game plan,"" Georgia coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson said. ""Maybe the only thing we didn’t do really well is box out.”Georgia led 59-50 after Battles converted her steal of Flau’Jae Johnson’s pass into a fast-break layup with 7:53 left.But the Tigers quickly cut it to 59-55 on Reese’s basket inside and Morris’ 3.Reese hit four straight free throws over multiple possessions to pull LSU back into a tie at 63. After Battles' free throws put Georgia back in front, Morris again tied it with a fast-break layup.Smith and LSU's Kateri Poole each made one of two free throws, and regulation ended tied at 66 after both teams failed to score on their final possessions of the period.The Lady Bulldogs never trailed by more than four points until the final seconds of overtime. LSU held a 30-29 lead at halftime, but Georgia led for the last 5:07 of the third quarter, going up 55-48 after Battles' fast-break layup.“We can't get lax,” Reese said. “Just getting back in the gym and being able to get better, I think that's going to be important for us.”BIG PICTUREGeorgia: The Lady Bulldogs looked formidable defensively in recent victories over Missouri (62-51) and Mississippi State (62-34) and maintained that form at LSU, holding the Tigers to 36% shooting (24 of 67). Nicholson scored at least 10 points for the 10th time this season, and for the seventh time in a reserve role.LSU: This marked just the fourth time this season the Tigers were held below 70 points in regulation and the first time they were pushed to overtime. Georgia's defense had a lot to do with that, but LSU missed a number of open shots. The Tigers' 18 turnovers were relatively few against a Georgia squad that has forced 20 or more opponent turnovers in 15 games this season, but Georgia was efficient in scoring 21 points off turnovers. LSU outscored Georgia at the foul line 28-15.UP NEXTGeorgia: Visits Vanderbilt on Sunday afternoon.LSU: Visits Texas A&M on Sunday afternoon.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball",2023/02/03,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799019,"Dosunmu, White lead way as Bulls beat Hornets 114-98","CHICAGO (AP) — Ayo Dosunmu matched a season high with 22 points, Coby White scored 20 points and the Chicago Bulls overcame shaky outings by DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine to beat the Charlotte Hornets 114-98 on Thursday night.

            Dosunmu made 9 of 10 shots, and White hit three 3-pointers. Nikola Vucevic added 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Andre Drummond had 15 points and 11 rebounds in just under 15 minutes.

            The Bulls used a big third quarter to turn a four-point halftime lead into an 85-70 advantage heading to the fourth.











            They stayed in control the rest of the way and got some payback for a loss one week earlier in Charlotte even with DeRozan and LaVine not performing to their usual standards.

            “It's just a testament to our team,” Dosunmu said. “We have a very deep team. At this point of the season, we're gonna need everyone to come out and play on both ends.”

            DeRozan finished with 15 points on 4-of-12 shooting, after getting his sixth All-Star selection and second in as many seasons with the Bulls. LaVine scored 10 points. But even with its two best players not scoring the way they normally do, Chicago had six players in double figures and made enough plays to beat the team with the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference.

            Terry Rozier scored 23 points for Charlotte. LaMelo Ball, coming off a triple-double Tuesday night in a loss at Milwaukee, added 19 points, eight rebounds and six assists before getting ejected with 1:21 remaining. He was furious about a non-call after LaVine blocked his layup and picked up two separate technical fouls. Mason Plumlee had 16 points and 11 rebounds.

            The Bulls scored the first 10 points of the second half to bump a four-point lead to 63-49.

            Dosunmu started the run and finished it with layups, and Vucevic and Patrick Williams made back-to-back 3-pointers.

            BIG SPARK

            Drummond became the first NBA player since Darryl Dawkins in 1978-79 to record at least 15 points and 11 rebounds while playing 15 minutes or less, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. 

            The two-time All-Star signed with Chicago last summer to back up Vucevic. He's been in and out of the rotation and been used sparingly of late. 

            “At the end of the day, I just have to be a good teammate,” Drummond said. “That’s what I can focus on. When you focus on the stuff you can’t control, that’s when you start getting to that dark place.”

            Drummond played just 3:31 in Tuesday's loss to the Los Angeles Clippers and did not appear in five of the seven games prior to that.

            “Am I OK with it?"" he said. “I’m never OK with it. I’m a basketball player. I want to play. But circumstances that I'm in, I have to work my way back to get to where I want to get to.”

            Drummond said the best path for him is “being a good teammate” and doing ""whatever it takes to help this team win.”

            ON POINT

            This was only the second time this season that DeRozan, LaVine or Vucevic did not lead the Bulls in scoring. Javonte Green did it in a win over Charlotte on Nov. 2. Williams also tied DeRozan for the lead in a win over Brooklyn on Jan. 4.

            TIP-INS

            Hornets: The Hornets, last in the NBA in 3-point percentage coming in, made 7 of 35 from beyond the arc.

            Bulls: G Alex Caruso left the game with a sprained right foot. He scored seven points in seven minutes before exiting early in the second quarter. ... Williams tweaked his right ankle in the fourth quarter, but said he'll be fine. ... Coach Billy Donovan said the All-Star break will be “important” for Green as he recovers from right knee surgery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799045,"Caitlin Clark scores 42, No. 6 Iowa tops No. 8 Maryland","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Caitlin Clark scored 42 points and Monika Czinano had 28 as No. 6 Iowa defeated No. 8 Maryland 96-82 on Thursday night.

            Clark, who entered second in the nation in scoring at 27.1 points per game, was 13 of 19 from the field, including 6 for 11 on 3-pointers. She also had seven rebounds and eight assists.

            It was the sixth time in her career that Clark scored 40 or more points. 











            “A once-in-a-lifetime player,” Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. “Just a huge night. She is a special player.”

            And it prompted Iowa coach Lisa Bluder to begin campaigning for Clark to be national player of the year.

            “I don’t know how you can say that she is not,"" Bluder said. ""She was unbelievable.”

            Clark said she appreciated being mentioned in the conversation.

            “I don’t, like, just brush it off. It is something you should be proud of and our program should be proud of, but that’s not the reason you play the game of basketball,” Clark said. “I play it because I love it. When you get wins like this, that’s the most important thing and that’s what makes basketball so fun.”

            Diamond Miller led Maryland with 27 points despite being in foul trouble most of the game. Shyanne Sellers had 26 points and Abby Meyers added 15.

            Clark scored 18 points in the second half, nine on free throws, but at the beginning of the period she was bent over as she stood near midcourt.

            “I thought I was going to throw up,” she said, laughing. “I know, it's a little (too much information).”

            Frese said Clark and Czinano were going to be the focus of Maryland's defense, but the two combined to shoot 27 of 37 from the field.

            “They had monster games,” Frese said.

            When Bluder pointed out the shooting statistic, Clark and Czinano laughed and high-fived each other. Iowa was 37 of 60 (61.7%) for the game.

            “I thought we took really good shots as a team,” Clark said. “I didn't think we forced them.”

            Iowa freshman Hannah Stuelke added 13 points as the Hawkeyes (18-4, 10-1 Big Ten) extended their winning streak to seven and stayed in second place in the Big Ten, a half-game behind No. 4 Indiana.

            Maryland (18-5, 9-3) had its five-game winning streak snapped and fell into a third-place tie with No. 10 Ohio State. The Terrapins host the Buckeyes on Sunday.

            Czinano, who led the nation in field-goal percentage the last two seasons and ranks third this season, was 14 of 18 from the field.

            Clark and Czinano combined for 42 first-half points, making 18 of 22 shots, as Iowa took a 56-38 halftime lead.

            That start rattled the Terrapins, Frese said, especially in the first quarter, when Maryland was behind 20-8 seven minutes into the game.

            “They came out really aggressive,” Frese said. “They crushed us in every area. We allowed the crowd, we allowed a lot of different emotions, to take us out of the game.”

            The Hawkeyes, whose biggest lead was 58-38, maintained a double-digit advantage throughout the second half. Maryland got to 85-75 with 4:17 to play, but no closer.

            “It’s hard to battle back on the road,” Bluder said. “And so I thought that was an outstanding beginning. Some of Caitlin’s shots were crazy, but we got Monika some real high-percentage shots.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Maryland: The Terrapins’ attempt at a comeback was thwarted by their poor 3-point shooting. Maryland came in ranked 11th nationally in 3-point percentage but went 2 of 18 in this one, including 1 for 9 in the second half. “I thought they were great looks,” Frese said. “Typically we hit those.”

            Iowa: The Hawkeyes set an early tone, and other than a small run by Maryland early in the third quarter controlled the game. They kept pace with Indiana atop the conference standings — the teams play Feb. 9 at Indiana. Iowa has won 13 of its last 14 dating to early December. “I think we can get better,” Bluder said. Asked if the Hawkeyes were playing at their highest level, Czinano said: “There's always another level.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799047,"Mavs hang on after Doncic hurt, hand Pels 10th straight loss","DALLAS (AP) — The Dallas Mavericks barely held on after leading by 27 points when Luka Doncic exited the game with a right heel injury on a hard fall.

            The New Orleans Pelicans thought their one chance to finish the rally and end a long losing streak was taken away by the officials, who acknowledged two incorrect calls in the final seconds.

            Doncic scored 31 points before leaving midway through the third quarter, and the Mavericks survived a 16-point fourth quarter without him in a 111-106 victory Thursday night, handing the travel-weary Pelicans their 10th consecutive loss.











            Dallas' lead was three points when the Mavericks were inbounding with 4.9 seconds left. Brandon Ingram tipped Josh Green's pass and appeared to save it before his foot landed out of bounds.

            C.J. McCollum grabbed the loose ball, but officials had blown the whistle. There was no review, and Dallas inbounded again with 3.4 seconds to go. No time was put back on the clock, and Spencer Dinwiddie made two free throws after a foul with 2.4 seconds as the Mavericks held on.

            Crew chief Kevin Scott said the officials' review after the game showed Ingram wasn't out of bounds when he made contact with the ball, and that the clock incorrectly ran after the whistle.

            Pelicans coach Willie Green said he wasn't given an explanation why the call couldn't be reviewed, and Larry Nance Jr. said players saw the same thing as officials after the game.

            “The players should have decided the game, and they didn't,” Nance said. “There were two wrongs done. The clock was wrong, and the call was wrong. I just hope we get the same calls at home. That would be lovely.”

            New Orleans (26-27) dropped below .500 for the first time this season after arriving on the day of the game because wintry weather in Dallas had the team stuck in Denver since Tuesday night.

            Doncic stayed in the game after taking a hard fall when he was winding up for a one-handed dunk and Ingram knocked the ball out of his hand as Doncic was bumped by Jonas Valanciunas.

            Ingram was called for a foul, and New Orleans successfully challenged. Doncic returned after the break for the review, but after one trip down the court, the 23-year-old star screamed in frustration as he limped to the locker room without looking at the Dallas bench. 

            “We’ll see how he feels tomorrow,” coach Jason Kidd said. “I think no matter what the score was, he wasn't coming back.”

            The 27-point lead at Doncic's exit with 6:47 remaining in the third was all the way down to four when Herbert Jones hit a layup with 58 seconds left in the game.

            Ingram, who scored 26 points, missed a jumper that would have cut the deficit to two, then hit a jumper to cut the deficit to three after Reggie Bullock made one of two free throws. Dallas called a timeout to avoid a turnover in the backcourt, setting up the disputed late sequence.

            “Looking at the defense, sometimes you can relax with a big lead,” Kidd said. “Understanding the Pelicans are a good team, they're trying to break a losing streak.”

            New Orleans, which finished a three-game trip, has been without All-Star Zion Williamson throughout its longest losing streak since a 13-game skid before the pandemic paused the 2019-20 season. Williamson missed his 16th game with a right hamstring strain.

            Doncic had 27 points at the break, when Dallas led 70-43 and had 25 points off 13 turnovers by New Orleans, which arrived midday and tried its best to get into a game-day routine.

            ___

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDALLAS (AP) — The Dallas Mavericks barely held on after leading by 27 points when Luka Doncic exited the game with a right heel injury on a hard fall.The New Orleans Pelicans thought their one chance to finish the rally and end a long losing streak was taken away by the officials, who acknowledged two incorrect calls in the final seconds.Doncic scored 31 points before leaving midway through the third quarter, and the Mavericks survived a 16-point fourth quarter without him in a 111-106 victory Thursday night, handing the travel-weary Pelicans their 10th consecutive loss.Dallas' lead was three points when the Mavericks were inbounding with 4.9 seconds left. Brandon Ingram tipped Josh Green's pass and appeared to save it before his foot landed out of bounds.C.J. McCollum grabbed the loose ball, but officials had blown the whistle. There was no review, and Dallas inbounded again with 3.4 seconds to go. No time was put back on the clock, and Spencer Dinwiddie made two free throws after a foul with 2.4 seconds as the Mavericks held on.Crew chief Kevin Scott said the officials' review after the game showed Ingram wasn't out of bounds when he made contact with the ball, and that the clock incorrectly ran after the whistle.Pelicans coach Willie Green said he wasn't given an explanation why the call couldn't be reviewed, and Larry Nance Jr. said players saw the same thing as officials after the game.“The players should have decided the game, and they didn't,” Nance said. “There were two wrongs done. The clock was wrong, and the call was wrong. I just hope we get the same calls at home. That would be lovely.”New Orleans (26-27) dropped below .500 for the first time this season after arriving on the day of the game because wintry weather in Dallas had the team stuck in Denver since Tuesday night.Doncic stayed in the game after taking a hard fall when he was winding up for a one-handed dunk and Ingram knocked the ball out of his hand as Doncic was bumped by Jonas Valanciunas.Ingram was called for a foul, and New Orleans successfully challenged. Doncic returned after the break for the review, but after one trip down the court, the 23-year-old star screamed in frustration as he limped to the locker room without looking at the Dallas bench.“We’ll see how he feels tomorrow,” coach Jason Kidd said. “I think no matter what the score was, he wasn't coming back.”The 27-point lead at Doncic's exit with 6:47 remaining in the third was all the way down to four when Herbert Jones hit a layup with 58 seconds left in the game.Ingram, who scored 26 points, missed a jumper that would have cut the deficit to two, then hit a jumper to cut the deficit to three after Reggie Bullock made one of two free throws. Dallas called a timeout to avoid a turnover in the backcourt, setting up the disputed late sequence.“Looking at the defense, sometimes you can relax with a big lead,” Kidd said. “Understanding the Pelicans are a good team, they're trying to break a losing streak.”New Orleans, which finished a three-game trip, has been without All-Star Zion Williamson throughout its longest losing streak since a 13-game skid before the pandemic paused the 2019-20 season. Williamson missed his 16th game with a right hamstring strain.Spencer Dinwiddie scored 21 points for Dallas, and Josh Green scored nine of his 15 points after Doncic exited.Doncic had 27 points at the break, when Dallas led 70-43 and had 25 points off 13 turnovers by New Orleans, which arrived midday and tried its best to get into a game-day routine.“Obviously, it's been a hell of a day,” said Nance, who had 10 points and 12 rebounds. “That first half wasn't us.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799062,Duke women's coach Lawson says men's ball used vs. FSU,"Duke coach Kara Lawson said her team played with a men's basketball for the first half of a loss to Florida State last Sunday.

            The 16th-ranked Blue Devils lost to the Seminoles 70-57 in Tallahassee, Florida — the team's second Atlantic Coast Conference loss of the season.

            After her team beat Pittsburgh 53-44 on Thursday, Lawson ended her news conference by speaking animatedly about Sunday's game.











            “This would never happen in a men’s game. This would never happen. It’s embarrassing for our sport,"" she said.

            The circumference of a women’s ball is about an inch smaller than a men’s ball and it is typically 2 ounces lighter. While it may not seem like a lot, that’s a big difference.

            Lawson said throughout the first half, Duke players were “complaining about the ball.” The Blue Devils were 7 for 34 from the field in the opening 20 minutes of that game. They were 12 for 38 in the second half. Florida State made 10 of its 30 shots in the first two quarters and 14 of 31 in the second half.

            “To have a game that, at the end of the season, could be the difference between a seed, between a title, my players don’t deserve that and neither do their players,"" Lawson said. “It’s a complete failure. And you can figure out who the people I’m talking about that failed the sport and our players and both teams.”

            Lawson said assistant coach Winston Gandy went to the scorer’s table at the half to check on the ball when he realized what the problem was. She said the game officials changed the ball to start the second half.

            “We have concluded through our investigation that it was a men’s ball,” Lawson said. ”The conference and Florida State is saying that it wasn’t.” 

            The ACC said it did a comprehensive review talking with game officials, administrators, the table crew and both schools.

            “Following the thorough and objective review process, there was no evidence found to support the claim,” the conference said in a statement. “Per NCAA playing rules, there is no appeal or protest process.""

            The ACC has instituted a procedural change that the game ball will be brought to the pregame meeting with the captains for approval.

            “It’s very frustrating that (the game) ... was not treated with the utmost respect that players on both teams deserve,” she said.

            This wasn't the first time this has happened in women's basketball. In 2017, the College of Charleston played home games and practiced with men's balls for most of its season until the error was was discovered.

            “Let me be clear: Florida State beat us. They beat us playing with a men’s ball in the first half and a women’s ball in the second half. But I can’t say if we’d have played with a women’s ball in the first half and the second half that we would have won. But they can’t say that either,” Lawson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799064,"Murray, Jokic lead charge as Nuggets beat Warriors 134-117","DENVER (AP) — Jamal Murray just nodded when asked if this might be the most confident he’s ever been.

            Nothing else really needed to be said.

            Murray had 33 points and Nikola Jokic recorded his 17th triple-double of the season, leading the Denver Nuggets to a 134-117 win over the short-handed Golden State Warriors on Thursday night. 











            “Jamal, his greatness is on full display,” said Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who campaigned for Murray to be added to the All-Star roster should a replacement be necessary. 

            Murray scored 17 of his points in a pivotal third quarter, when the Nuggets broke open a tight game with a 16-0 run. 

            “Guys are shooting well,” Murray explained. “Everybody.”

            Jokic had another big night with 22 points, 16 assists and 14 rebounds. The reigning two-time MVP had a triple-double by the midway mark of the third quarter as the Nuggets remain unbeaten this season when he reaches the plateau. 

            With that performance, Jokic is now averaging a triple-double for the year. It's latest into a season a player 6-foot-11 or taller has averaged a triple-double in NBA history, according to ESPN Stats & Info.

            “He’s good at everything,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “Literally every time he has the ball, everybody is a threat. Your entire defense has to be engaged.""

            Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 18 points for the Western Conference-leading Nuggets, who improved to 24-4 at home. 

            Stephen Curry had 28 points and Jordan Poole added 22 on a night when Golden State hit 19 3-pointers. The Warriors started off hot — building an 11-point lead in the second quarter — before losing steam. They lost in overtime a night earlier at Minnesota. 

            The reigning NBA champions fall to 26-26. No panic, though.

            “I’m very optimistic we can get it turned around,” Curry said. ""But we do have to address certain issues with our team, whether it’s performance issues or whether it’s trying to find the right combinations.”

            Both teams were missing key components. The Warriors were without Klay Thompson (injury management) and Draymond Green, who was a late scratch with tightness in his right calf. Denver didn’t have Aaron Gordon due to a sore ankle.

            Jokic was just named the Western Conference’s player of the month. He picked up where he left off after averaging 24 points, 11.6 rebounds and 11.3 assists in January. 

            “There’s a reason he’s a two-time MVP and obviously a front-runner for a third one,” Kerr said.

            Warriors: Golden State is 5-6 on the second night of a back-to-back. ... Forward Andrew Wiggins had 10 rebounds.

            Malone was disappointed that Gordon didn’t make the reserve squad for the All-Star Game. Gordon's averaging 16.8 points and 6.8 rebounds.

            “As disappointed as we all are, our goals are much higher than the individual accolades that come along,” Malone said. ""We are striving to win a championship and we know that Aaron Gordon is a huge part of that.”

            SUPPORT

            Malone has been checking in on Porter and offering support. Porter’s brother, University of Denver basketball player Coban Porter, was charged Wednesday with felony counts of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault stemming from a suspected drunken-driving crash that killed a 42-year-old woman.

            “Without getting into details, it’s just showing Michael Porter how much we all care about him and letting him know that if there’s anything that I or we can do for him and his family, to make sure he lets us know,” Malone said.

            Marcus Sasser also scored 15 for the Cougars (21-2, 9-1 American Athletic Conference), who trailed by six midway through the second half. Jamal Shead added 13 points and seven assists.

            ""We are showing signs of maturity, not getting too high or too low,” Shead said. ""We are following our leader, Marcus. When he came in and started to do his thing, we rallied behind him.”











            All five starters scored in double digits to help Houston win its third straight since a one-point loss to Temple. 

            Jaykwon Walton equaled his career high with 24 points for the Shockers (11-11, 4-6), who went 3 for 20 from 3-point range and shot 39% from the field overall.

            “I thought the difference in the game was the 3-point line,” Wichita State coach Isaac Brown said. “We went 3 for 20 and, down the stretch, their big man, Walker, was 3 for 6 from the 3-point line and I thought that was the difference in the game.”

            James Rojas added 15 points and seven rebounds for the Shockers. Kenny Pohto pulled down 12 boards to go with eight points.

            Coming off a career-best 25 points against Cincinnati, Walker shot just 3 for 9 in the first half. But he drained a 3-pointer to trim Houston's deficit to 50-47 with 10:17 remaining, then tied it 54-all with another 3 at the 6:15 mark.

            Walker followed with his 3 from the corner that put the Cougars ahead 57-54, and they opened a seven-point cushion with under three minutes left after a layup by Shead and a 3 from Tramon Mark.

            “We made some bad mistakes, but when it came winning time, I think our DNA kicked in,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. ""We know how to win and there is a lot to be said about that.” 

            In a matchup between the top two scoring defenses in the AAC, the Cougars held a 30-29 lead at halftime.

            Wichita State built a seven-point advantage early in the second half as foul trouble began to pile up for Houston.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799071,Chill pervades China's tech firms even as crackdown eases,"HONG KONG (AP) — A grinding crackdown that wiped billions of dollars of value off Chinese technology companies is easing, but the once-freewheeling industry is bracing for much slower growth ahead. 

            Analysts say China’s easing of restrictions on companies like e-commerce giant Alibaba and online games company Tencent and talk of support for the private sector reflects Beijing’s decision to refocus on growth after the economy was ravaged by the pandemic and restrictions imposed to fight COVID-19. 

            But controls on internet content r emain firmly in place. And the crackdown has left a “chilling” effect on the industry, potentially slowing innovation, while U.S. restrictions against China’s computer chips industry are hindering progress in developing leading edge technology in 5G and artificial intelligence.











            In January, a top official at China’s central bank said in an interview with state-owned media that the crackdown on technology companies was “basically” over, adding that companies would be encouraged to lead economic growth and create more jobs. That came just weeks after China dropped stringent entry restrictions and testing and quarantine requirements that were part of its “zero-COVID"" strategy meant to quash the virus. 

            “With the end of the zero-COVID policy, China is returning to prioritizing economic growth, and the technology sector is obviously a critical driver of growth in China and a celebrated source of innovation,” said Gregory Allen, a senior fellow in the Strategic Technologies Program at the U.S. research organization Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

            Companies like Alibaba and Tencent control everyday apps and services that are used ubiquitously by large swathes of the population – including online payments, messaging, food delivery and e-commerce. 

            Such companies flourished for two decades with scant regulation before Beijing launched a barrage of anti-monopoly, data security and other restrictions from late 2020, seeking to rein in e-commerce, social media and other companies it viewed as too big and independent. 

            Signaling an easing, Didi Global — which was ordered to stop new-user registrations in 2021 following accusations that it violated data security rules — recently was allowed to resume taking on new users. 

            Regulators said e-commerce giant Alibaba’s finance affiliate Ant Group can go ahead with plans to raise $1.5 billion for its consumer finance unit, an important step forward after the government called off a planned IPO two years ago and ordered the firm to restructure.

            After slamming online games as “spiritual opium” and enforcing strict controls on screen time for minors, regulators last April begun approving new games following an eight-month hiatus, with the first foreign titles greenlighted in December. 

            Stocks of technology companies, including Alibaba, Tencent as well as others such as food delivery company Meituan and search engine and artificial intelligence firm Baidu have seen their stock prices nearly double since they hit rock bottom in late October. The market valuations of these companies, however, are still far from their peak in 2019. 

            The crackdown’s chilling effects for investors and entrepreneurs will linger, Allen said, since the authorities have shown they're willing and able to forego growth to impose controls on the industry at any time.

            Over the past two years, several founders of technology companies have stepped down as CEO or chairman of their respective firms – including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, JD.com’s Richard Liu, Bytedance’s Zhang Yiming and Pinduoduo’s Colin Huang. 

            In January, Alibaba’s financial affiliate Ant Group said that Ma — once China’s richest man — would give up control of the firm following a restructuring, and that no single shareholder would have control. Ma has rarely been seen in public since regulators pulled the plug on Ant Group's market debut in Hong Kong and Shanghai following his criticism of China’s financial sector in 2020. He since reportedly has moved to Tokyo.

            “If you were a technology entrepreneur in China five years ago, very likely someone like Jack Ma was your hero, your idol, and was precisely what you aspired to achieve and the sort of person you aspire to become,” said Allen. “And to see a man like that kind of torn down, I think sends a really strong message.”

            He and other analysts say the crackdown could potentially stifle innovation, as investors and entrepreneurs become more cautious about operating in China.

            “The crackdown was deep and cut far to the bone, probably more than the government expected it to,” said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “Because what’s happened is over the last two years, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have been scared to deploy capital and start new companies.”

            The value of venture capital deals in China plunged 44% to $62.1 billion in the first 10 months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to research firm Preqin.

            Some entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are taking a wait-and-see attitude, “worried in the long term that if they invest in a hot sector that the government that goes against China’s agenda or doesn’t fit with the government’s agenda for the private sector that they might get wiped out,” Rein said. 

            Well-established internet companies are still at an advantage to other tech industries in China that face added uncertainty due to friction between Washington and Beijing over advanced technology and trade as the U.S. seeks to block exports of high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment and to limit Western dealings with companies like Huawei Technologies, the world's largest maker of telecommunications networking gear. 

            The Biden administration has stopped approving renewal of licenses to some U.S. companies that have been selling essential components to the Chinse tech giant. That’s according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

            Washington gradually has tightened controls over U.S. exports to Huawei but had allowed some companies like Intel and Qualcomm to sell it processors used in devices like laptops and lower-end smartphones. The U.S. has justified such sanctions on national security grounds. Huawei denies the accusations.

            Under such pressure, China has accelerated efforts to become more self-sufficient in semiconductors and other advanced technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. But it remains years behind in some of the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and a U.S. prohibition against supporting development and production of integrated circuits at some chip factories in China has deprived Chinese chip firms of the foreign talent that has long contributed to its domestic industry. 

            A U.S. ban on selling crucial semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China is another obstacle. 

            “It’s one thing to go into areas like software and cloud services, in which Chinese companies are already quite strong,” said Allen of CSIS.

            “It’s a very different thing to take Chinese companies that are a decade or two behind in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment and tell them to grow up immediately by replicating some of the most advanced technologies that the world has ever produced.”HONG KONG (AP) — A grinding crackdown that wiped billions of dollars of value off Chinese technology companies is easing, but the once-freewheeling industry is bracing for much slower growth ahead.Analysts say China’s easing of restrictions on companies like e-commerce giant Alibaba and online games company Tencent and talk of support for the private sector reflects Beijing’s decision to refocus on growth after the economy was ravaged by the pandemic and restrictions imposed to fight COVID-19.But controls on internet content r emain firmly in place.

He since reportedly has moved to Tokyo.“If you were a technology entrepreneur in China five years ago, very likely someone like Jack Ma was your hero, your idol, and was precisely what you aspired to achieve and the sort of person you aspire to become,” said Allen. “And to see a man like that kind of torn down, I think sends a really strong message.”He and other analysts say the crackdown could potentially stifle innovation, as investors and entrepreneurs become more cautious about operating in China.“The crackdown was deep and cut far to the bone, probably more than the government expected it to,” said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “Because what’s happened is over the last two years, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have been scared to deploy capital and start new companies.”The value of venture capital deals in China plunged 44% to $62.1 billion in the first 10 months of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, according to research firm Preqin.Some entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are taking a wait-and-see attitude, “worried in the long term that if they invest in a hot sector that the government that goes against China’s agenda or doesn’t fit with the government’s agenda for the private sector that they might get wiped out,” Rein said.Well-established internet companies are still at an advantage to other tech industries in China that face added uncertainty due to friction between Washington and Beijing over advanced technology and trade as the U.S. seeks to block exports of high-end semiconductors and chip-making equipment and to limit Western dealings with companies like Huawei Technologies, the world's largest maker of telecommunications networking gear.The Biden administration has stopped approving renewal of licenses to some U.S. companies that have been selling essential components to the Chinse tech giant. That’s according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Washington gradually has tightened controls over U.S. exports to Huawei but had allowed some companies like Intel and Qualcomm to sell it processors used in devices like laptops and lower-end smartphones. The U.S. has justified such sanctions on national security grounds. Huawei denies the accusations.Under such pressure, China has accelerated efforts to become more self-sufficient in semiconductors and other advanced technologies, providing billions in subsidies and investments for the industry. But it remains years behind in some of the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes and a U.S. prohibition against supporting development and production of integrated circuits at some chip factories in China has deprived Chinese chip firms of the foreign talent that has long contributed to its domestic industry.A U.S. ban on selling crucial semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China is another obstacle.“It’s one thing to go into areas like software and cloud services, in which Chinese companies are already quite strong,” said Allen of CSIS.“It’s a very different thing to take Chinese companies that are a decade or two behind in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment and tell them to grow up immediately by replicating some of the most advanced technologies that the world has ever produced.”",2023/02/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799074,Jaquez leads No. 9 UCLA past Washington to end 2-game skid,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jaime Jaquez Jr. had 15 points and 10 rebounds, Amari Bailey scored 13 points and No. 9 UCLA beat Washington 70-61 on Thursday night.

            UCLA completed a season sweep of Washington and stopped a two-game skid that had followed a 14-game winning streak. The Bruins (18-4, 9-2 Pac-12) won their 20th straight home game dating to last season and remained in first place in the conference standings.

            UCLA dominated inside and defensively in the first half, scoring 26 of its first 30 points in the paint. However, the Bruins were sloppy, finishing with 18 turnovers. Tyger Campbell and Bailey each had five giveaways and Jaquez had four.











            “Eighteen turnovers to me, would be like to other coaches what is 25,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. “It’s beyond unacceptable. Our supposed best two players had nine turnovers. ... Those two single-handedly let the other team back in the game with their carelessness with the ball.”

            Keion Brooks Jr. led Washington (13-11, 5-8) with 23 points.

            The Huskies — who finished with 20 turnovers of their own — cut the lead to seven points several times in the second half but never got closer.

            “If you turn the ball over they get out in transition and you don’t have a chance to get back and get your defense set up,” Jacquez said. “Ball security dictates a lot of your offense and defense in the second half. We just didn’t have that.”

            Washington fell behind early and didn’t score for a six-minute stretch. Braxton Meah dunked to end that drought and pull his team within 26-10 with 6:44 left in the first half.

            “In the second half I thought we shared the ball, and Keion Brooks did a great job on isolations and moving the ball,” Washington coach Mike Hopkins said. “You have to make shots. In the first half, we were 2 for 14 from the 3-point line. You’re not going to win too many games shooting that percentage.”

            UCLA's Jaylen Clark caught the opening tip between two defenders and scoring on an uncontested layup 5 seconds into the game.

            UCLA beat Washington 79-49 last month and has won eight straight in the series.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799097,Indian gay couples begin legal battle for same-sex marriage,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Utkarsh Saxena and Ananya Kotia’s love story began just like any other college romance. Except no one else knew about the gay couple’s relationship.

            It was 2008. Homosexuality was yet to gain a degree of acceptance in deeply conservative India, with many gay couples facing stigma and isolation. So Saxena and Kotia took their time, watching from a distance how people’s acceptance of homosexuality was changing.

            “We were actually quite scared about the consequences,” said Saxena, a public policy scholar at the University of Oxford. “We were very fragile and vulnerable, a young couple figuring out ourselves, and didn’t want, you know, something as drastic as this to break us in some sense.”











            Over the years, as Indian society became more accepting of homosexuality and much of the country’s LGBTQ community began celebrating their sexuality openly, the couple decided to make their relationship known to their friends and family. Most of them were accepting.

            Now, 15 years into their relationship, they have set out for a bigger challenge and filed a petition to India’s Supreme Court that seeks the legalization of same-sex marriage. Three other gay couples have filed similar petitions that will be heard by the country's top court in March.

            If legalized, India would become the second economy in Asia after Taiwan to recognize same-sex marriage, a significant right for the country’s LGBTQ community more than four years after the top court decriminalized gay sex. A favorable ruling would also make India the biggest democracy with such rights for LGBTQ couples but run counter to the ruling Hindu nationalist government’s position, which opposes same-sex marriages.

            “Our relationship has been, in a social sense, undefined for so long that we would like it to now be embraced in the same way as any other couples’ relationship,” Saxena said.

            Legal rights for LGBTQ people in India have been expanding over the past decade, and most of these changes have come through the Supreme Court’s intervention.

            In 2014, the court legally recognized non-binary or transgender persons as a “third gender” and three years later made an individual's sexual orientation an essential attribute of their privacy. The historic ruling in 2018 that struck down a colonial-era law that had made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison expanded constitutional rights for the gay community. The decision was seen as a landmark victory for gay rights, with one judge saying it would “pave the way for a better future.""

            Despite this progress, legal recognition of same-sex marriage has been met with resistance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.

            In a court filing last year it said same-sex marriages would cause “complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country.” Sushil Modi, a lawmaker from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, told Parliament in December that such marriages would be “against the cultural ethos of the country” and a decision on that should not be left to “a couple of judges.”

            India's Supreme Court has, however, signaled it could challenge the government's position.

            In January, its collegium — comprising the Chief Justice of India and two Justices — said the government was opposing a gay judge’s nomination in part because of his sexual orientation. India’s federal government did not respond to the allegations.

            Gay couples and LGBTQ activists argue that by refusing to recognize same-sex marriage, the government is depriving homosexual couples of their right to equality enshrined in the constitution and opportunities enjoyed by married heterosexual couples.

            “Basically, you need to be treated the same as any other citizen. It’s not special rights that are being asked for, it’s just the right that every other citizen has,” said Ruth Vanita, an expert on gender studies and author of “Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West.”

            In India, marriage is governed by a set of different laws tailored to the country’s religious groups, and a secular law for interfaith couples called the Special Marriage Act. All limit marriage between men and women.

            With no legal backing for same-sex marriages, many couples say they have faced a host of hurdles.

            Indian law restricts owning and inheriting property to LGBTQ individuals. Gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to have children born with the help of an Indian surrogate mother. And LGBTQ persons can only apply for adoption as single parents.

            Many such couples believe that legal recognition of same-sex marriage would not just be a vital step toward equality but also result in more people coming out as homosexuals and strengthening their relationship with the state.

            “We would want the state to recognize marriage as an institution also for same-sex couples … for acceptance at a social level,” said Kotia, an economics scholar at the London School of Economics.

            Homosexuality has long carried a stigma in India’s traditional society, even though there has been a shift in attitudes toward same-sex couples in recent years. India now has openly gay celebrities and some high-profile Bollywood films have dealt with gay issues. According to a Pew survey, acceptance of homosexuality in India increased by 22 percentage points to 37% between 2013 and 2019.

            But many same-sex couples continue to face harassment in many Indian communities, whether Hindu, Muslim or Christian.

            In December, India's LGBTQ community found support from an unexpected quarter.

            The head of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a Hindu nationalist group that is the ideological parent of Modi’s party, said LGBTQ people are “a part of the Indian society” and that Indian civilization has traditionally acknowledged the community. Mohan Bhagwat's comments, which could force the government to reassess its position, were a departure from the group’s long-held views on homosexuality, which has a tangled history in India, even though some of Hinduism’s most ancient texts are accepting of same-sex couples. 

            “In the West, right up to the 19th century, people were executed for same-sex relations, or they were put in prison. India has, as far as we know, no such history. We have always written about it (homosexuality), talked about it, and discussed it,” said Vanita.

            Without the legal right to marriage, many LGBTQ couples have still been participating in commitment ceremonies, particularly in big cities. Such marriages are not legally binding under Indian laws, but it has not stopped them from having traditional Indian wedding rituals.

            Saxena and Kotia said they were planning one as well, preferably if the court rules in their favor.

            “I think we would like a big wedding. Our relatives and our family and friends would like an even bigger wedding,"" Saxena said.NEW DELHI (AP) — Utkarsh Saxena and Ananya Kotia’s love story began just like any other college romance. Except no one else knew about the gay couple’s relationship.It was 2008. Homosexuality was yet to gain a degree of acceptance in deeply conservative India, with many gay couples facing stigma and isolation. So Saxena and Kotia took their time, watching from a distance how people’s acceptance of homosexuality was changing.“We were actually quite scared about the consequences,” said Saxena, a public policy scholar at the University of Oxford. “We were very fragile and vulnerable, a young couple figuring out ourselves, and didn’t want, you know, something as drastic as this to break us in some sense.”Over the years, as Indian society became more accepting of homosexuality and much of the country’s LGBTQ community began celebrating their sexuality openly, the couple decided to make their relationship known to their friends and family. Most of them were accepting.Now, 15 years into their relationship, they have set out for a bigger challenge and filed a petition to India’s Supreme Court that seeks the legalization of same-sex marriage. Three other gay couples have filed similar petitions that will be heard by the country's top court in March.If legalized, India would become the second economy in Asia after Taiwan to recognize same-sex marriage, a significant right for the country’s LGBTQ community more than four years after the top court decriminalized gay sex. A favorable ruling would also make India the biggest democracy with such rights for LGBTQ couples but run counter to the ruling Hindu nationalist government’s position, which opposes same-sex marriages.“Our relationship has been, in a social sense, undefined for so long that we would like it to now be embraced in the same way as any other couples’ relationship,” Saxena said.Legal rights for LGBTQ people in India have been expanding over the past decade, and most of these changes have come through the Supreme Court’s intervention.In 2014, the court legally recognized non-binary or transgender persons as a “third gender” and three years later made an individual's sexual orientation an essential attribute of their privacy. The historic ruling in 2018 that struck down a colonial-era law that had made gay sex punishable by up to 10 years in prison expanded constitutional rights for the gay community. The decision was seen as a landmark victory for gay rights, with one judge saying it would “pave the way for a better future.""Despite this progress, legal recognition of same-sex marriage has been met with resistance by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.In a court filing last year it said same-sex marriages would cause “complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws in the country.” Sushil Modi, a lawmaker from Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, told Parliament in December that such marriages would be “against the cultural ethos of the country” and a decision on that should not be left to “a couple of judges.”India's Supreme Court has, however, signaled it could challenge the government's position.In January, its collegium — comprising the Chief Justice of India and two Justices — said the government was opposing a gay judge’s nomination in part because of his sexual orientation. India’s federal government did not respond to the allegations.Gay couples and LGBTQ activists argue that by refusing to recognize same-sex marriage, the government is depriving homosexual couples of their right to equality enshrined in the constitution and opportunities enjoyed by married heterosexual couples.“Basically, you need to be treated the same as any other citizen. It’s not special rights that are being asked for, it’s just the right that every other citizen has,” said Ruth Vanita, an expert on gender studies and author of “Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West.”In India, marriage is governed by a set of different laws tailored to the country’s religious groups, and a secular law for interfaith couples called the Special Marriage Act. All limit marriage between men and women.With no legal backing for same-sex marriages, many couples say they have faced a host of hurdles.Indian law restricts owning and inheriting property to LGBTQ individuals. Gay and lesbian couples are not allowed to have children born with the help of an Indian surrogate mother. And LGBTQ persons can only apply for adoption as single parents.Many such couples believe that legal recognition of same-sex marriage would not just be a vital step toward equality but also result in more people coming out as homosexuals and strengthening their relationship with the state.“We would want the state to recognize marriage as an institution also for same-sex couples … for acceptance at a social level,” said Kotia, an economics scholar at the London School of Economics.Homosexuality has long carried a stigma in India’s traditional society, even though there has been a shift in attitudes toward same-sex couples in recent years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799098,Ex-UK leader Truss to urge tougher China stance in Tokyo,"LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss will join the former leaders of Australia and Belgium at a conference in Tokyo later this month to call for a tougher international approach to China.

            The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international group of lawmakers concerned about how democratic countries approach Beijing, said Friday that Truss will speak alongside former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the Feb. 17 event in the Japanese Diet. Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is also a European Parliament lawmaker, will attend as well.

            Conference organizers hope the event would help spur more coordinated diplomacy on threats raised by China ahead of the next Group of Seven richest democratic countries' summit, scheduled in May in Hiroshima. 











            Truss is expected to address growing concerns over Beijing's threats to Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory. Morrison will call for more targeted sanctions against Chinese officials for serious human rights violations, while Verhofstadt will speak about the European Union’s role in maintaining international rules under pressure from Beijing.

            “The scale of the challenge posed by the People’s Republic of China is such that we all need to rise above our differences and come together to defend our fundamental values and interests,” Verhofstadt said in a statement.

            The three former leaders will address about 40 Japanese lawmakers as well as legislators from the U.K., Canada, the European Union and Taiwan. Senior Japanese ministers are also expected to attend. 

            Truss has kept out of the public eye since she quit as Conservative British prime minister in October after just 45 days in office, following an ill-conceived economic plan she unveiled that triggered a political and financial crisis. 

            As foreign secretary she was outspoken in criticizing China, advocating stronger ties between democracies so they can counter China and Russia more effectively. She had suggested that the U.K. should work with its allies to ensure Taiwan could defend itself against Chinese military aggression. 

            Her successor, current British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, has rejected “grand rhetoric” against China and wants a more “pragmatic” relationship with Beijing. While he has called China's growing authoritarianism a “systemic challenge,"" he stopped short of describing China as a threat to British security and said the U.K. and its allies needed to engage Beijing in diplomacy.

            Western countries are rethinking their relationship with Beijing after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the U.S., Britain and the EU's 27 member states have disagreed with each other over how to approach an increasingly assertive China.

            In November, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was criticized by both his European partners and his own coalition government when he led a delegation of senior business leaders to visit Beijing. 

            Critics said the bilateral visit undermined unity among EU leaders, who discussed reducing their heavy economic dependence on China during a Brussels summit in October. While Scholz said there should be recognition that China was increasingly a competitor and systemic rival, he also warned against decoupling ties.LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss will join the former leaders of Australia and Belgium at a conference in Tokyo later this month to call for a tougher international approach to China.The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international group of lawmakers concerned about how democratic countries approach Beijing, said Friday that Truss will speak alongside former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison at the Feb. 17 event in the Japanese Diet.

            Consider what happened in January: The government said Friday that employers added a sizzling 517,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate dipped to 3.4%, the lowest level since 1969.











            The job gain was so large it left economists scratching their heads and wondering why the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes haven't slowed hiring at a time when many foresee a recession nearing.

            Friday’s report added instead to the picture of a resilient U.S. labor market, with low unemployment, relatively few layoffs and many job openings. Though good for workers, employers’ steady demand for labor has also helped accelerate wage growth and contributed to high inflation.

            Still, the Fed's inflation watchers might be reassured somewhat by January's wage data: Average hourly pay rose 4.4% last month from a year earlier, slower than the 4.8% year-over-year increase in December. And from December to January, wages rose 0.3%, below the 0.4% increase the previous month.

            On top of the sizzling job growth it reported for January, the government on Friday also revised up its estimate of the gains in November and December by a combined 71,000.

            President Joe Biden called the jobs report “strikingly good news"" and asserted that his Republican critics were wrong in their warnings of continued high inflation and a coming recession and layoffs.

            “Our plan is working,” Biden said, ""because of the grit and resolve of the American worker.”

            January’s hiring gain, which far exceeded December’s 260,000, was broad-based across industries. A category that includes restaurants and bars added 99,000 workers. Professional and business services jobs, including bookkeepers and consultants, rose by 82,000.

            Governments added 74,000, boosted by the end of a worker strike against California’s state university system. Health care added 58,000 jobs, retailers 30,000. Construction gained 25,000 jobs. Manufacturing added 19,000.

            Economists had collectively estimated that the economy added just 185,000 jobs last month.

            “This is a labor market on heat,’’ said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. It would be difficult, she suggested, “to see the Fed stop raising rates and entertain ideas of rate cuts when there is such explosive economic news coming in.”

            The Fed has raised its key rate eight times since March to try to slow the job market and contain inflation, which hit a 40-year high last year but has slowed since then. 

            Yet companies are still seeking more workers and are hanging tightly onto the ones they have. Putting aside some high-profile layoffs at big tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and others, most workers are enjoying an unusual level of job security even at a time when many economists foresee a recession approaching.

            For all of 2022, the economy added a sizzling average of roughly 375,000 jobs a month. That was a pace vigorous enough to have contributed to some of the painful inflation Americans have endured. A tight job market tends to put upward pressure on wages, which, in turn, feed into inflation.

            But year-over-year measures of consumer inflation have steadily eased since peaking at 9.1% in June. At 6.5% in December, though, inflation remains far above the Fed’s 2% target, which is why the central bank’s policymakers have reiterated their intent to keep raising borrowing rates for at least a few more months. 

            Giacomo Santangelo, an economist at the jobs website Monster, said he doubted the Fed would take much comfort from the decelerating wage gains — or relent in its rate-hiking campaign.

            “As long as unemployment continues to go down,"" Santangelo said, ""as long as the economy continues to be strong, the Fed’s going to keep fighting inflation.’’ 

            The Fed is aiming to achieve a “soft landing” — a pullback in the economy that is just enough to tame high inflation without triggering a recession. The policymakers hope that employers can slow wage increases and inflationary pressures by reducing job openings but not necessarily by laying off many employees.

            But the job market’s resilience isn’t making that hoped-for outcome any easier. On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that employers posted 11 million job openings in December, an unexpected jump from 10.4 million in November and the largest number since July. There are now about two job vacancies, on average, for every unemployed American.

            And in response, many employers have raised wages.

            Stew Leonard Jr., CEO of Stew Leonard’s, a supermarket chain in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, said the company’s series of hourly wage increases over the past two years have helped expand their job applicant pool. Entry-level hourly wages are now $17. 

            For more specialized workers like butchers and bakers, hourly wages start at $25 to $30. Those pay gains have helped the chain attract about 10 to 12 applicants per job posting, the same level as before the pandemic. Earlier, the chain had been receiving as few as seven applicants per posting.

            “If you want good people, you have to pay,” Leonard said. 

            He said he’s unsure whether the company will have to keep raising pay.

            “It’s almost a day-to-day decision,"" he said. ""But right now, we're happy.”

            Over the past year or so, the job market has earned the label “The Great Resignation’’ because jobs are so plentiful and many workers are willing to change jobs to seek better pay or working conditions.

            Centura Health, a nonprofit that runs hospitals and clinics in Colorado and Kansas, has offered $15,000 “retention’’ bonuses to retain nurses, respiratory therapists and others for 24 months; 2,500 have accepted the offer. And for employees who perform routine but vital tasks like changing sheets and delivering meals to patients, Centura has raised entry-level hourly pay as high as $18.

            By streamlining hiring and directing managers to prioritize the filling of vacancies, Centura has slashed the time needed between receiving an application and putting a new hire to work.

            Sebastien Girard, who holds the title of “chief people officer,’’ said Centura has about 1,500 job openings each month. The market for clinical staff, like doctors, nurses and radiologists, remains extraordinarily tight, he said, though it’s eased a bit recently for other positions.

            Girard doesn’t think labor shortages are going away. He thinks America’s aging population means there will be an ongoing scarcity of available workers.

            “The Great Resignation is there to stay,’’ he said. “It is a generational shift.’

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799130,Tubelis scores 40 in No. 5 Arizona's 91-76 rout of Oregon,"TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Azuolas Tubelis took his family and friends from Lithuania to breakfast in the morning, then to see the desert surrounding Tucson.

            After a 40-minute nap, the Arizona big man arrived at McKale Center and started roasting Ducks.

            Not a bad way to show off for his mother and sister.











            Tubelis scored 40 points, most by an Arizona player in 28 years, and the fifth-ranked Wildcats avenged an earlier loss to Oregon with a 91-76 rout Thursday night.

            “She didn’t see me like basically the first two years, so it was pretty cool,” Tubelis said of his mother. “Her friends are supporting here, too. They all flew here on Monday. It’s really cool. I think she’s proud of me.” 

            The Ducks (13-10, 7-5 Pac-12) manhandled Arizona 87-68 at home last month in Arizona's biggest loss under coach Tommy Lloyd.

            The Wildcats (20-3, 10-3) returned the favor with a dominant performance, riding an early 21-2 run to a 15-point halftime lead. Arizona kept its foot on the gas from there, shooting 54% and dishing out 23 assists on 31 field goals. 

            Tubelis was the catalyst.

            Limited to 14 points in the first meeting, the 6-foot-11 Lithuanian overpowered and outran the Ducks in transition, hitting 16 of 21 shots. It was the most points by an Arizona player since Damon Stoudamire had 40 against Washington State in 1995.

            Tubelis didn't score in the final 7 1/2 minutes and fell one point shy of the McKale Center record set in 1976 by Al Fleming, who was honored posthumously at halftime.

            “What he did today, I don’t even know how to put it into words,” Arizona point guard Kerr Kriisa said. “I’ve never witnessed anything like this.”

            Oregon won the first meeting by shooting 53% from the floor and outmuscling the Wildcats in the paint.

            This time, Arizona grounded the Ducks early with stifling defense and crisp offense, using a 21-2 run to build an early 14-point lead.

            Oregon tried to get back in it, but Tubelis seemed to have an answer each time.

            With N'Faly Dante on the bench in foul trouble, the athletic big man bulled his way through Oregon's lankier frontcourt players for a trio of three-point plays. 

            Tubelis had 27 points on 10-of-14 shooting in the first half, putting Arizona up 50-35 on a breakaway dunk with 27 seconds left that sent roars echoing off the McKale Center ceiling.

            “We didn’t take away strengths,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said. “We let him get to that left hand, right shoulder time and time again, and he's going to score. He's talented that way.”

            Oregon again tried to make a run starting the second half, but Tubelis turned back the Ducks once more. He hit a jumper, scored on a reverse layup and beat Oregon's big men down the floor for a dunk. Kriisa hit two 3-pointers and Cedric Henderson Jr. added another to put Arizona up 69-51.

            Will Richardson had 20 points to lead the Ducks, who rallied late to pull within 10 in the closing minutes.

            “We gave up a lot of easy baskets and Tubelis really got going, went to his strengths, and we couldn't slow him down,” Altman said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Oregon: The Ducks' dominance of Arizona came to a crashing end. Oregon had won eight of nine in the series, including three of four in Tucson, but took an early body blow and had no answer for Tubelis all night.

            Arizona: The loss at Oregon on Jan. 14 seemed to spark the Wildcats. Arizona has won six straight since and is back to playing the type of basketball that led to early-season Final Four projections.

            KRIISA’S IMPACT

            Kriisa struggled to get shots to fall early in the game before hitting four 3-pointers in the second half.

            He ran Arizona's offense effectively all night, making good decisions and keeping it flowing against Oregon's pressure defense.

            “He did a really good job controlling the game and in managing their defenses,"" Lloyd said. “A lot of good decisions.”

            Kriisa finished with 13 points on 4-of-9 shooting from 3 with seven assists and two turnovers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799132,DeSantis eyes 2024 from afar as GOP rivals move toward runs,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may be months away from publicly declaring his presidential intentions, but his potential rivals aren't holding back.

            No fewer than a half dozen Republicans eyeing the White House have begun actively courting top political operatives in states like New Hampshire and Iowa, which traditionally host the opening presidential primary contests. At the same time, former President Donald Trump, the only announced candidate in the race, is launching regular attacks against DeSantis — and others — while locking down key staff and endorsements in early voting South Carolina.

            For now, DeSantis is plowing forward with a fiery “anti-woke” agenda in the legislature before a presidential announcement in late spring or early summer. His team is beginning to hold informal conversations with a handful of prospective campaign staff in key states, according to those involved in the discussions. But compared with would-be rivals, the Florida governor, famous for crafting his own political strategy, appears to be stepping into the 2024 presidential primary season much more deliberately.











            “They understand they are in kind of a sweet spot now. They can feel the demand building and they don’t really have to show any leg yet,” said David Kochel, a veteran Republican operative who has been in touch with DeSantis’ team to relay interest from activists. “I just don’t think there’s any urgency yet to start putting things in place.”

            For voters, it may seem early in the 2024 presidential election season. But by historical standards, it is not. The GOP's opening presidential primary debates are just six months away, expected in late July or early August when the Republican National Committee holds its summer meeting in Milwaukee.

            Already, Trump has been in the race for more than two months. The former president on Saturday released a list of high-profile supporters in South Carolina, including Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. Lindsay Graham. And on Feb. 15, Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is set to launch her own White House bid in South Carolina, followed by immediate appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire. 

            Haley is among a half dozen Republican prospects in various levels of conversations with political operatives in New Hampshire and Iowa about job openings, according to people involved with the discussions who requested anonymity to discuss internal planning. Beyond Haley, they include former Vice President Mike Pence, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.

            Hogan, a term-limited governor who left office only two weeks ago, talked up his executive experience in multiple New Hampshire radio interviews on Thursday. He told The Associated Press he was launching a multi-day fundraising tour beginning this weekend in DeSantis' Florida.

            “There’s plenty of room for Trump and DeSantis and me in the same state,” Hogan said with a laugh. “Everybody says it’s Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis. But I think it might be somebody that nobody’s talking about right now, which is what usually happens. ... My argument is the frontrunners almost never win.”

            Indeed, recent political history is littered with tales of seemingly strong early contenders who ultimately failed. They include the likes of former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who looked like a frontrunner in 2015 and was forced out of the race before the first voting contest. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush then emerged as the strong favorite before being overtaken by Trump.

            Veteran Republican strategist Ari Fleischer recalled the 2000 presidential campaign when his then-boss, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, successfully waited until mid-June to enter the Republican presidential primary. In the months before the announcement, Bush aggressively worked behind the scenes to line up donors, staff and endorsements. 

            For DeSantis to adopt a similar winning playbook, Fleischer said, it's critical to work now to assemble a strong campaign apparatus in private. He likened a successful strategy at this phase to a duck, who appears calm but is paddling hard just below the water’s surface.

            “So long as (DeSantis) is paddling furiously underwater like a duck, he can afford to wait,” Fleischer said. “The amount of work it takes to build a presidential campaign is phenomenal. I don’t think people understand what’s involved unless they’ve done it. It’s brutal. ... And if you don’t put the labor into it quietly, privately, it falls apart.”

            DeSantis' team declined to comment on his 2024 plans publicly, but the Florida governor's allies expect him to enter the race in late June or early July.

            In the short-term, he's preparing to promote his upcoming book, “The Courage to be Free,” set for release on Feb. 28. And he'll spend much of the coming months stacking up legislative victories in the Florida statehouse, where the Republican supermajority stands ready to deliver a bevy of measures sure to entice the most conservative voters in a GOP presidential primary.

            In recent days, DeSantis said he's backing new laws that would ban abortions after 6 weeks of conception, ease restrictions for those wishing to carry concealed firearms and end the state’s unanimous jury requirement for death penalty cases. He released a plan to end sales taxes on gas stoves, picking up on a false claim circulating on the right that the Biden administration plans to ban the appliance.

            DeSantis is also asking the state legislature for an additional $12 million to relocate unwanted migrants, signaling a continued focus on illegal immigration after spending millions in Florida taxpayer dollars to fly migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard last year. 

            And he's zeroing in on issues related to race and education. He installed a conservative majority on the board of trustees at a small liberal arts school and has debuted a proposal to block programs on diversity, education and inclusion from state colleges. At the same institutions, he would also ban programs on critical race theory, which centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.

            In the coming days, DeSantis is expected to declare victory in his battle against Disney, the state's largest employer, which drew the governor's ire after opposing the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law. State lawmakers are expected to meet for a special session as soon as next week to complete a takeover of a self-governing district Disney controls over its properties in Florida, all at DeSantis’ request.

            As DeSantis focuses on Florida's statehouse, Trump has dramatically escalated his attacks on the man he and his aides see as, by far, his most concerning rival. But as other Republicans prepare to enter the race, Trump is also attacking them.

            For example, in a Thursday interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Trump described Haley in sexist terms as “overly ambitious,” noting that she once vowed not to seek the presidency in 2024 if Trump was also running.

            “She’s a very ambitious person. She just couldn’t stay in her seat,” Trump said.

            In the same interview, he also criticized DeSantis, claiming he cried while asking for Trump's endorsement during the 2018 governor's race. 

            “DeSantis got elected because of me. You remember he had nothing. He was dead. He was leaving the race. He came over and he begged me, begged me for an endorsement,” Trump said. “He said, ‘If you endorse me, I’ll win.’ And there were tears coming down from his eyes.”

            DeSantis has largely avoided responding to Trump’s digs. And without a campaign apparatus, he doesn't have a rapid response team or surrogate operation designed to engage with 2024-related fire. 

            But earlier this week, he seemed to be knocking Trump — at least, indirectly — when asked about the former governor's repeated attacks.

            “The good thing is, is that the people are able to render a judgment on that whether they re-elect you or not,"" DeSantis said when asked about Trump, who lost his 2020 reelection.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799138,"China, Hong Kong scrap cross-border travel quota, COVID test","HONG KONG (AP) — Travel between Hong Kong and China will no longer require COVID-19 PCR tests nor be held to a daily limit, authorities announced Friday, as both places seek to drive economic growth.

            Hong Kong’s tourism industry has suffered since 2019 after months of political strife that at times turned into violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as harsh entry restrictions implemented during the pandemic.

            “From Monday, there will be a full resumption of travel between Hong Kong and the mainland,” Hong Kong leader John Lee said Friday at a news briefing. 











            Lee said quotas for travelers will be scrapped and all boundary checkpoints will reopen next week. 

            The announcement came a day after Lee unveiled a tourism campaign aimed at attracting travelers to Hong Kong that includes 500,000 free air tickets for tourists to visit the semi-autonomous Chinese city.

            China had already eased travel restrictions with Hong Kong on Jan. 8, dropping a mandatory quarantine period required for travelers entering the mainland. However, the number of travelers entering the mainland from Hong Kong via land checkpoints was limited to 50,000 a day.

            From Feb. 6, most travelers crossing the border between mainland China and Hong Kong will no longer need to present a negative PCR test for COVID-19 prior to travel. Only those who have traveled overseas within the past seven days would be required to produce their negative PCR result, Hong Kong and Chinese authorities said Friday.

            Both Hong Kong and mainland China were among the last holdouts globally to keep entry restrictions including mandatory quarantine periods, even as the rest of the world began reopening their borders in 2022.

            Hong Kong — a business hub reputed as a popular city for tourists — has seen its tourism industry battered over the past three years.

            In spite of China’s easing of entry restrictions last month, Hong Kong’s tourism industry has a long road to recovery.

            In 2022, nearly 605,000 visitors came to Hong Kong — up sixfold from the year before, but about 90% less than 2019 before the pandemic, which saw 55.9 million arrivals.HONG KONG (AP) — Travel between Hong Kong and China will no longer require COVID-19 PCR tests nor be held to a daily limit, authorities announced Friday, as both places seek to drive economic growth.Hong Kong’s tourism industry has suffered since 2019 after months of political strife that at times turned into violent clashes between protesters and police, as well as harsh entry restrictions implemented during the pandemic.“From Monday, there will be a full resumption of travel between Hong Kong and the mainland,” Hong Kong leader John Lee said Friday at a news briefing.Lee said quotas for travelers will be scrapped and all boundary checkpoints will reopen next week.The announcement came a day after Lee unveiled a tourism campaign aimed at attracting travelers to Hong Kong that includes 500,000 free air tickets for tourists to visit the semi-autonomous Chinese city.China had already eased travel restrictions with Hong Kong on Jan. 8, dropping a mandatory quarantine period required for travelers entering the mainland. However, the number of travelers entering the mainland from Hong Kong via land checkpoints was limited to 50,000 a day.From Feb. 6, most travelers crossing the border between mainland China and Hong Kong will no longer need to present a negative PCR test for COVID-19 prior to travel. Only those who have traveled overseas within the past seven days would be required to produce their negative PCR result, Hong Kong and Chinese authorities said Friday.Both Hong Kong and mainland China were among the last holdouts globally to keep entry restrictions including mandatory quarantine periods, even as the rest of the world began reopening their borders in 2022.Hong Kong — a business hub reputed as a popular city for tourists — has seen its tourism industry battered over the past three years.In spite of China’s easing of entry restrictions last month, Hong Kong’s tourism industry has a long road to recovery.In 2022, nearly 605,000 visitors came to Hong Kong — up sixfold from the year before, but about 90% less than 2019 before the pandemic, which saw 55.9 million arrivals.",2023/02/03,148,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799141,Biden sounds ready to seek 2nd term while rallying Democrats,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Joe Biden sounded like a candidate making his case for a second term Friday night as he rallied a raucous meeting of national Democrats who chanted, “Four more years!” 

            The only thing missing was an official announcement — that's not expected for at least several weeks.

            Speaking to the Democratic National Committee after a strong jobs report, Biden boasted about helping create a strong economy and said his administration had made the country's most significant federal investments in public works, health care and green technology in decades. He also slammed Republican extremism, suggesting that party is still too beholden to former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again movement.











            “Let me ask you a simple question. Are you with me?” a grinning Biden asked onstage in Philadelphia as hundreds of party leaders from around the country interrupted him with cries of “Four more years! Four more years!” 

            He later added, to nearly as loud applause, “America is back and we're leading the world again.”

            Biden has sought to seize the political offensive after a strong midterm election season for his party and as he looks toward 2024, with Trump having already announced another bid for the White House. It’s especially important given mounting pressures in Washington, including a special counsel investigation into his handling of classified documents and a Republican-controlled House eager to serve as a check against Biden and his agenda on Capitol Hill.

            Speaking before Biden on Friday night, Vice President Kamala Harris was just as defiant about the GOP and its staunch opposition to issues like abortion rights.

            “There are those who want to stand in the way of our momentum,” she said. ""The extremist, so-called leaders, who want to distract and divide our nation as they ban books, as they reject the history of America, as they criminalize doctors and nurses and the sacred right to vote.”

            At a DNC fundraiser before taking the stage, Harris referenced Democrats' holding onto Senate control during fall's midterms and reminded a smaller crowd: “It’s not the time to pat ourselves on the back. It’s the time to see it through."" 

            “And that’s going to take as much work, if not more, than everything that everyone here put into where we are today,"" she said.

            Looking to the future himself, Biden told the same reception: “No matter who is president, things are going to change radically in the next 15 years.”

            “Are we going to be leading the pack?” he added. “Or are we going to be the end of it?”

            Earlier in Philadelphia on Friday, Biden and Harris visited a water treatment plant and hailed $15 billion in funding to remove lead pipes from service lines around the country. That comes from a bipartisan infrastructure package, which is also bankrolling railway projects the president spent this week trumpeting. 

            “The issue has to do with basic dignity,” Biden said. “No amount of lead in water is safe. None.” 

            With the State of the Union address coming next week, Biden has renewed calls for political unity, something he's acknowledged being unable to achieve despite his promises as a candidate in 2020. But those appeals haven't tempered Biden's broadsides against Trump and the former president's MAGA movement.

            “This ain’t your father’s Republican Party,” Biden said, adding that the GOP agenda was so extreme that “we have to keep pointing out what the other team wants.” Of Trump loyalists, he said, ""These aren’t conservatives.” 

            That's made some Democrats anxious to see Biden stay aggressive in touting his record.

            “The president is trying to solve the problems of the nation on infrastructure, on microchips, on gun safety, on health care,"" said Randi Weingarten, a DNC member and president of the American Federation of Teachers. “Compare (that) to the GOP, which seems to be on a revenge agenda.” 

            Biden’s speech comes the day before the DNC is set to approve an overhauled presidential primary calendar starting next year that would replace Iowa with South Carolina in the leadoff spot. New Hampshire and Nevada would go second, followed by Georgia and Michigan — a change the president has championed to ensure that voters of color have more influence deciding the party’s White House nominee. 

            The new calendar would be largely moot if Biden runs again, since party elders won't want to oversee a drawn-out primary against him. Democrats have been solidly unified in their opposition to the new Republican-controlled House, while no major Democratic challenger is thought to be preparing to run against Biden. 

            Biden's advisers haven't waited for his official reelection announcement, already spending weeks making staffing arrangements and readying lines of political attacks against Republicans seen as early presidential front-runners, including Trump, who launched his campaign in November, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

            Alan Clendenin, a DNC member from Florida, said Biden has strengthened the economy, reestablished U.S. global standing and promoted inclusive values — the opposite of what Trump and DeSantis stand for. 

            “They predicted gloom and doom. He's proved them all wrong,” said Clendenin, who kicked off a DNC Southern caucus meeting by noting that Florida has begun lagging behind other states in key policy areas and joking of its governor, ""That’s what happened when you’re led by the devil.” 

            Biden repeatedly denounced “extreme MAGA Republicans” as a threat to the nation's democracy in the runup to the midterms and gloated a bit Friday about the results. 

            “People looked at me like I was nuts,” he said, referring to his repeated emphasis on MAGA Republicans last fall. “They’re nuts. I’m not nuts.”

            The president, meanwhile, will have a harder time campaigning on future legislative accomplishments now that the GOP controls the House. A coming fight over extending the nation's legal debt ceiling may only harden partisan clashes. 

            Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he and the White House would continue talking about ways to avoid a debt limit crisis. But, referring to federal spending, McCarthy said, “The current path we’re on we cannot sustain.” 

            Biden has also suggested that simply bashing Republicans won't be enough, however, noting that Democrats have seen their support among Americans without a college degree decline. He said Friday night that his party ""stopped talking to” blue-collar workers. 

            ""We have to get working-class people to say we see them,” the president added.

            In a more lighthearted nod to the coming Super Bowl, Biden declared “Fly, Eagles, fly!” and called fans in Philadelphia “the most informed, obnoxious fans in the world.""

            That would ostensibly include his wife, Jill, who is a diehard Eagles supporter.PHILADELPHIA (AP) — President Joe Biden sounded like a candidate making his case for a second term Friday night as he rallied a raucous meeting of national Democrats who chanted, “Four more years!”The only thing missing was an official announcement — that's not expected for at least several weeks.Speaking to the Democratic National Committee after a strong jobs report, Biden boasted about helping create a strong economy and said his administration had made the country's most significant federal investments in public works, health care and green technology in decades.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799144,Controversy continues to build around Taiwan's proposed 4th natural gas terminal,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taipower’s plan to construct two new natural gas power plants in Keelung has met opposition, with an international expert meeting Keelung's mayor on Wednesday (Feb. 1) to discuss the issue.Keelung Mayor George Hsieh (謝國樑) is a staunch opponent of the plan. He met with Swedish direct democracy expert Bruno Kauffman to discuss the failure of a local referendum that sought to oppose the construction, held in June last year.Organized by local campaigners, the referendum gained enough support within one week to meet the requirements for a government review. According to Keelung HiHi, the referendum ran into difficulties when the Keelung city government (then led by current Minister for the Interior Lin Yu-chang (林右昌) referred the issue to the Cabinet.The Cabinet decided the proposed works came under the purview of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and therefore was not a matter for local authorities to decide.Hsieh has disputed this, citing the Local Government Act. He said the land reclamation process proposed for construction of the power plants constitutes an environmental issue, which the act gives local governments the authority to control.Leader of the referendum effort and Keelung city councilor Wang Xing-zhi (王醒之) said that if the central government was to decide on the outcome, it would be a disruption of local democracy, according to CNA. UDN reported that Wang said that he will decide next week how to move forward, though he is sure the outcome of the proposed construction will be decided by local government.“It will not be sent to the central government to get caught up in their confusion, the city government will be responsible for approving it directly,” he said.The “Fourth Connection” is an abbreviation for the “Fourth Natural Gas Terminal” (第四天然氣接收站) and describes a proposal to construct Taiwan’s fourth port for receiving imports of natural gas and accompanying power plant. The proposal seeks to use the site of coal power plants near Keelung that have either recently been or are set for decommissioning.The new power plants will greatly reduce air pollution, and will serve nearly 5 million people in the north of Taiwan. However, converting the plants to natural gas will have a severe impact on the surrounding marine environment, and affect the livelihoods of local fishermen.The plan has already been revised significantly in order to minimize the environmental impact, with the proposed site being relocated eastward to avoid the destruction of coral reefs. Despite the move, campaigners still say the negative impacts outweigh the benefits.",2023/02/03,805,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799155,RGE closes inaugural US$550 million Sustainability-Linked Derivative with MUFG,"Sustainability-Linked Derivative (SLD) supports RGE's strategy of pivoting its financing towards SLLs, a total of US$1.6 billion secured in 2022   Besides hedging the interest rate risk of its latest SLLs, the SLD shows RGE's confidence in delivering on its SLL's sustainability KPIs    SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 3 February 2023 - Royal Golden Eagle (""RGE""), a global group of resource-based manufacturing companies, has announced that its member company Apical Group (""Apical""), a global leading processor of vegetable oil, has closed a two-year US$550 million Sustainability-Linked Derivative (""SLD""), its first SLD, with MUFG Bank, Ltd (""MUFG"").   In November 2022, Apical successfully secured a total of US$787 million in SLLs from a consortium of banks, with MUFG, First Abu Dhabi Bank, National Bank of Kuwait and Chang Hwa Bank among the Mandate Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners. The SLD will be used to partially hedge (US$550 million of the US$787 million) the interest rate risk of Apical's latest round of sustainability-linked loans (""SLLs"").   The SLD allows Apical to fix its interest rate for US$550 million of its latest round of SLLs for a period of two years. This agreement is tied to the same set of key performance indicators (""KPIs"") under the SLLs and penalties will be incurred under the SLD in the event the KPIs are not attained. These KPIs include raising the level of verified traceability to its plantations, increasing engagement of suppliers to promote sustainable practices and traceability, increasing the number of Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certifications among smallholder farmers, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through methane capture facilities.   Tey Wei Lin, President, RGE, said:    ""Sustainability is at the core of our business model and sustainable financing is the way forward for RGE. We have the support and interest from our banking partners and secured a total of US$1.6 billion in SLLs in 2022. We are now going one step further with the sustainability-linked derivative which imposes a second penalty on us if we do not meet the same set of KPIs for the SLLs. Acting on a belief that 'well done is better than well said', we have opted for this tool that facilitates an even greater level of accountability from us and we are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitments.""    In 2021, RGE was among the first non-property players in Singapore to secure an SLL and the second largest borrower of SLLs in Singapore. In 2022, it raised approximately US$1.6 billion in SLLs including US$700 million under its pulp and paper business in China, Asia Symbol; US$120 million under Apical, and another US$787 million under Apical's latest SLL to which the SLD is tied.   Nick Yee, Managing Director and Head of Global Client Solutions Sales for ASEAN, India and Oceania, MUFG, commented:    ""MUFG is proud to have partnered RGE in structuring our inaugural Sustainability-Linked Derivative that linked the Interest Rate Swap to RGE's sustainability commitments. With our market-leading Solutions and ESG Financing expertise, we have created a bespoke structure for RGE to achieve its sustainability targets and hedge its interest rate exposure concurrently. This collaboration demonstrates our collective sustainability commitments towards decarbonisation and tackling climate change, while managing financial risks.""   Hashtag: #RGE

Lai lost to incumbent Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) in the party’s primary in 2019 for the election of the top office in 2020.The de facto envoy to the U.S., Hsiao said the rumor ""came out of thin air” and did not merit further discussion. She added that the only thing on her mind now is pushing for better bilateral relations for Taiwan to secure a more peaceful and stable external environment, CNA quoted her as saying.Former Legislator Tsai Pi-ru (蔡壁如) of the Taiwan People’s Party said on a radio show Thursday (Feb. 2) that she believes Hsiao will be recruited as a running mate, whoever the DPP presidential candidate is. This is because she is trustworthy in the eyes of Washington and Lai’s leanings toward Taiwan's formal independence have caused concern, Tsai added.Having served four terms as a Taiwanese legislator and an adviser to President Tsai, Hsiao assumed her current position in July 2020. A diplomat who calls herself the “cat warrior,” Hsiao was described by the New York Times as one of the most influential ambassadors in Washington.",2023/02/03,585,Politics

The individual or group behind the threat claimed that barrels of fuel would be ignited in an attack on passengers on the Taoyuan Airport MRT line at the Taipei Main Station (A1) terminal. Police have been put on notice and will be increasing patrols and safety checks on all MRT lines in Taipei and Taoyuan over the next week.The message called for the central government to refuse entry to the Swiss delegation, which will arrive on Sunday for a six-day visit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799172,"Timme reaches 2,000 points, No. 12 Gonzaga tops Santa Clara","SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Drew Timme scored 15 points and surpassed 2,000 for his career, leading No. 12 Gonzaga past Santa Clara 88-70 on Thursday night. 

            Timme, who also had 10 rebounds, became the third player in school history to reach the scoring milestone on a dunk with 16:02 remaining. He needs eight points to pass Jim McPhee for second on Gonzaga's career scoring list. Timme also needs to average 18.9 points during the next 10 games to surpass Frank Burgess for the top spot. 

            “It’s kind of crazy, to be honest,"" Timme said. ""I hit that number in high school and it’s pretty cool. It’s a lot of points. Like I’ve been saying all year, it’s super cool, but as long as we win that puts a smile on my face. 











            ""We can enjoy the milestones when I’m done here.” 

            After having its 75-game home win streak snapped against Loyola Marymount, the Bulldogs (19-4, 8-1 West Coast Conference) relied on scoring in the paint and efficient shooting to extend their home winning streak over Santa Clara to 15. 

            Rasir Bolton scored 16 points and Julian Strawther added 12 for Gonzaga.

            Carlos Stewart had 22 points for Santa Clara (16-8, 4-5). Brandin Podziemski was held to 14 points after scoring 38 against Pacific in the Broncos' last game.

            Santa Clara challenged early after Stewart’s 3-pointer opened the game — but that basket gave Santa Clara its only lead of the night. 

            The Bulldogs outscored the Broncos 28-4 in the paint and held an eight-rebound advantage in the first half. A 13-1 run midway through the first gave Gonzaga a 16-point lead it wouldn’t relinquish. Anton Watson scored 11 points to pace the Zags in the first, finishing with 18. 

            “To be able to do that defensively to such a good offensive team, they showed in the second half what they were capable of doing,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. “I would definitely say it was up there with some of our better halves.”

            Bolton’s corner 3-pointer in the second half gave the Zags a 22-point lead – their largest of the night. 

            “We had a really hard time throughout the game getting stops,"" Santa Clara coach Herb Sendek said. ""They were really executing and scoring at a high level in a variety of ways. ... Our offense got a little better in the second half, but in the first half, their defense made it really tough on us.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Santa Clara: The Broncos have lost three straight and are tied for fourth in the WCC with Pacific with eight regular-season games remaining. Santa Clara hasn’t beaten Gonzaga in Spokane since 2007 and the Zags have won 49 of the last 51 meetings. 

            Gonzaga: The Zags have won three straight games ahead of a Saturday matchup with No. 18 Saint Mary’s. The Gaels hold a one-game lead in the WCC and beat the Zags 67-57 last time they played in Moraga, but are 2-8 in the last 10 games against Gonzaga.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799173,"Antetokounmpo scores 54 points, Bucks beat Clippers 106-105","MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrated his most famous 50-point performance by ordering 50 chicken nuggets at a Chick-fil-A drive-through the next day.

            He already has an idea how to commemorate reaching that plateau for the third time in the last month.

            Antetokounmpo scored 20 of his 54 points in the fourth quarter and the Milwaukee Bucks overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the Los Angeles Clippers 106-105 on Thursday night for their sixth consecutive victory.











            “Tomorrow I think I'm going to go to Culver's,” said Antetokounmpo, who also had 18 rebounds. “I'll go get 50 cheeseburgers and try to eat as many as I can. The rest, I'll have my son eat them or I give them to my dog.""

            The Greek star has scored at least 50 points in three of his last 11 games. He had a career-high 55 on Jan. 3 in a 123-113 victory over Washington and scored 50 in only 30 minutes Sunday in a 135-110 triumph over New Orleans.

            Antetokounmpo now has reached the half-century mark in six career regular-season games. That doesn’t include his 50-point outburst against the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 of the 2021 NBA Finals, which gave the Bucks their first title since 1971 and led to his trip to Chick-fil-A.

            He joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players in Bucks history to have at least three 50-point games in a season.

            “It's a great compliment to be up there with Kareem,” Antetokounmpo said. “Man, I never thought I was going to score 50 in the NBA when I got drafted. It's an insane, crazy journey.”

            Over his last six games, Antetokounmpo has averaged 40.2 points and 14.5 rebounds. His two free throws with 1:47 remaining put Milwaukee ahead 106-105 for its first lead since the second quarter as the Bucks scored the final seven points of the game.

            Antetokounmpo squandered an opportunity to put Milwaukee in front when he missed two free throws in a 105-104 game with 2:13 left. But he drove to the basket again on the Bucks' next possession, drew Ivica Zubac's sixth foul and hit his free throws this time around.

            “He's relentless,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He's going to put himself in position to help us win. Whatever it takes for us to win, he's going to do it. He's fearless and relentless. That's what you saw going down the stretch.”

            The Clippers failed to capitalize on a couple of Milwaukee turnovers in the closing seconds. Kawhi Leonard missed an 18-footer in the final second while being guarded by Wesley Matthews with help from Pat Connaughton.

            “I've been doing that since my mom told me I've got to guard the best player when I was 4 years old,” Matthews said. “That's just who I am. Nothing but respect for those guys. I feel like those guys have that same (respect) toward me. The best way to pay them respect is to try and stop them. The best way they can pay me respect is to go after me.”

            The Clippers had plenty of chances to pull back ahead.

            Paul George stole the ball from Jrue Holiday and the Clippers called a timeout with 27.1 seconds left in a one-point game, but Leonard missed a jumper. Antetokounmpo got the rebound but threw the ball out of bounds, giving Los Angeles possession with 15.1 seconds to go.

            The Clippers again got the ball to Leonard, who missed once more.

            “We wanted to run it to Connaughton, but they switched the matchup,"" Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. ""They brought Matthews into it. He did a good job of climbing into Kawhi, making him uncomfortable and making him back up a little bit so he couldn’t get right downhill.”

            Norman Powell scored 26 points to lead the Clippers. Leonard had 17 points, 11 rebounds and five assists, but shot 7 of 26. Marcus Morris and George had 16 points each. Zubac had 12 points and 13 rebounds.

            Khris Middleton had 16 points and Holiday added 12 for the Bucks. Holiday missed his first eight shots and didn’t get his first basket until late in the third quarter.

            TIP-INS

            Clippers: Morris returned after missing four games with a bruised rib. …George earned his eighth career All-Star selection earlier in the day. 

            Bucks: Holiday was named an All-Star reserve, marking his first All-Star selection since 2013 with the Philadelphia 76ers. He joins Antetokounmpo on the All-Star team. This is the fourth time in the last five seasons that the Bucks have had multiple All-Stars.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799174,"In South Dakota Senate, far-right lawmakers rankle GOP","PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — The conversation between a state senator and a legislative aide started with a seemingly routine discussion about a bill. It suddenly spiraled as the senator allegedly harassed the aide because she had vaccinated her young child, plunging the Senate into a political drama that has divided South Dakota's Republican Party.

            The Senate, where lawmakers pride themselves on a genteel code of conduct as they work from wooden desks that have been there for generations, has seemed largely insulated from the forces roiling the wider GOP. 

            But even here, controversy was inevitable as an insurgent brand of Republicans look to challenge the establishment by pushing for hardline stands on social issues and passionately staking out positions that defy evidence, whether it is from medical authorities or election officials.











            South Dakota is dominated by Republicans, and Gov. Kristi Noem, who is widely seen as mulling a 2024 White House bid, has branded it as the country's most conservative state. But party tensions have grown in recent years. 

            A contrarian group has gained traction in the House with support from activists. The State Freedom Caucus Network, which is looking to push politics rightward and disrupt business-as-usual in state Legislatures, including Montana, Wyoming, Illinois, Arizona and Mississippi, has organized in Pierre.

            “It’s just sound and fury, it’s blaming each other, talking smack about each other — and yet on most of the issues the principles are the same,” said Michael Card, a former Republican official and political scientist at the University of South Dakota.

            Nationally, the GOP has been plagued with similar strains of controversy. A politician like Rep. George Santos of New York is able to hold office despite lying about his background and facing multiple investigations into his personal and campaign finances. Former President Donald Trump remains an active and powerful force. And a handful of U.S. House holdouts were emboldened to hold up the selection of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

            Statehouses have become fertile ground for nationalized politics, said Gerald Gamm, a professor of political science and history at the University of Rochester who has researched state-level politics.

            “Polarization at the state level is probably as high today as it’s ever been,” he said.

            Julie Frye-Mueller, the Republican senator involved in the incident with the aide, is among a group of hardline right-wing lawmakers who have clashed with top Republicans.

            The encounter took place as the aide, who has not been publicly named, was discussing a draft bill in her office last week with Frye-Mueller and the senator's husband, Mike Mueller, who was at the Capitol assisting his wife and later in the week testified in support of a resolution expressing sympathy for those facing charges for the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.

            Both the aide and Frye-Mueller have said their discussion turned to childhood vaccinations and breastfeeding, but their accounts differ. 

            According to the aide's complaint, Frye-Mueller asked if she had vaccinated her child. When the aide said yes, the senator pointed her finger and aggressively told her the child could have health issues or die, according to the complaint.

            She also alleged that Frye-Mueller asked her about breastfeeding. When the aide said she wished she could breastfeed, Frye-Mueller allegedly suggested that the aide’s husband could “suck on my breasts” to get milk to come in, the complaint said. Frye-Mueller’s husband was in the room at the time and “smiled and nodded,” it added. 

            Frye-Mueller disputed that account in testimony to a Senate committee investigating the complaint. She said it was the staffer who brought up breastfeeding. Frye-Mueller said she asked the aide whether she wanted advice she had received as a young mother, and when the aide said yes, she said, “Have your husband help.”

            Frye-Mueller said she was “falsely accused” and called the aide’s complaint “shocking and filthy.” She also framed her comments as an issue of freedom of speech.

            The senator also testified that she questioned whether newborn babies in Pierre were receiving vaccinations and informed the aide about legislation that would have eliminated school requirements for childhood vaccinations.

            Republicans, who hold 31 out of 35 seats in the Senate, moved decisively and treated the incident as a personnel issue and a serious harassment allegation. The body suspended her last week, launched an investigation and on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to censure her. The Senate also ended her suspension and adopted a report that concluded she harassed the aide.

            Senate Republican leaders, who initially kept the allegations a secret, faced backlash from local party activists, a lawsuit from Frye-Mueller and accusations of political retribution. 

            During her Senate testimony, Frye-Mueller even pointed to a Facebook post from the Republican Senate Pro Tempore Lee Schoenbeck about the death of a family cat. She alleged it was somehow proof of a conspiracy that he was employing a “dead cat strategy” of drawing attention to something shocking to distract media attention from another story. 

            Schoenbeck said he was, in fact, referring to the death of a beloved family pet.

            The longtime lawmaker, known for wearing Mister Rogers-style sweaters and firing colorful insults at right-wing legislators, has limited his comments on Frye-Mueller's discipline and framed it as a personnel issue. Other Republican and Democratic leaders have sought to tone down the political context around her suspension and pointed out that all but one Senator voted for her censure.

            In the past, however, Schoenbeck has called Frye-Mueller and others “wackadoodles” and funded campaigns to unseat them in primaries, with limited success.

            Noem has also clashed with the right-wing lawmakers and last year supported a number of campaigns to defeat them — again, with limited success. 

            As her political ambitions stretch beyond South Dakota, she has shown a willingness to concede to hardline conservatives, however. When House lawmakers advanced a bill in 2020 to ban gender-affirming medical procedures for transgender minors, she criticized the legislation as trying “to fill parenting gaps with more government.” This year, her spokesman has voiced support for a similar proposal.

            “When you have a supermajority, you will always tear yourself apart,” said Tom Dempster, a former Republican state senator who remains a close political watcher. “The primary system incentivizes extreme candidates.”

            Back in Frye-Mueller's home district, support for her remains strong. Activists in the Fall River County Republican Party drafted a resolution backing the senator.

            “I’m conservative like she is — she votes the way I would,” said Ken Updike, a local party leader who pushed the resolution. Senate leaders, he said, “are more aligned with Democrats than they are Republicans.”PIERRE, S.D.

The State Freedom Caucus Network, which is looking to push politics rightward and disrupt business-as-usual in state Legislatures, including Montana, Wyoming, Illinois, Arizona and Mississippi, has organized in Pierre.“It’s just sound and fury, it’s blaming each other, talking smack about each other — and yet on most of the issues the principles are the same,” said Michael Card, a former Republican official and political scientist at the University of South Dakota.Nationally, the GOP has been plagued with similar strains of controversy. A politician like Rep. George Santos of New York is able to hold office despite lying about his background and facing multiple investigations into his personal and campaign finances. Former President Donald Trump remains an active and powerful force. And a handful of U.S. House holdouts were emboldened to hold up the selection of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.Statehouses have become fertile ground for nationalized politics, said Gerald Gamm, a professor of political science and history at the University of Rochester who has researched state-level politics.“Polarization at the state level is probably as high today as it’s ever been,” he said.Julie Frye-Mueller, the Republican senator involved in the incident with the aide, is among a group of hardline right-wing lawmakers who have clashed with top Republicans.The encounter took place as the aide, who has not been publicly named, was discussing a draft bill in her office last week with Frye-Mueller and the senator's husband, Mike Mueller, who was at the Capitol assisting his wife and later in the week testified in support of a resolution expressing sympathy for those facing charges for the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot.Both the aide and Frye-Mueller have said their discussion turned to childhood vaccinations and breastfeeding, but their accounts differ.According to the aide's complaint, Frye-Mueller asked if she had vaccinated her child. When the aide said yes, the senator pointed her finger and aggressively told her the child could have health issues or die, according to the complaint.She also alleged that Frye-Mueller asked her about breastfeeding. When the aide said she wished she could breastfeed, Frye-Mueller allegedly suggested that the aide’s husband could “suck on my breasts” to get milk to come in, the complaint said. Frye-Mueller’s husband was in the room at the time and “smiled and nodded,” it added.Frye-Mueller disputed that account in testimony to a Senate committee investigating the complaint. She said it was the staffer who brought up breastfeeding. Frye-Mueller said she asked the aide whether she wanted advice she had received as a young mother, and when the aide said yes, she said, “Have your husband help.”Frye-Mueller said she was “falsely accused” and called the aide’s complaint “shocking and filthy.” She also framed her comments as an issue of freedom of speech.The senator also testified that she questioned whether newborn babies in Pierre were receiving vaccinations and informed the aide about legislation that would have eliminated school requirements for childhood vaccinations.Republicans, who hold 31 out of 35 seats in the Senate, moved decisively and treated the incident as a personnel issue and a serious harassment allegation. The body suspended her last week, launched an investigation and on Wednesday overwhelmingly voted to censure her. The Senate also ended her suspension and adopted a report that concluded she harassed the aide.Senate Republican leaders, who initially kept the allegations a secret, faced backlash from local party activists, a lawsuit from Frye-Mueller and accusations of political retribution.During her Senate testimony, Frye-Mueller even pointed to a Facebook post from the Republican Senate Pro Tempore Lee Schoenbeck about the death of a family cat. She alleged it was somehow proof of a conspiracy that he was employing a “dead cat strategy” of drawing attention to something shocking to distract media attention from another story.Schoenbeck said he was, in fact, referring to the death of a beloved family pet.The longtime lawmaker, known for wearing Mister Rogers-style sweaters and firing colorful insults at right-wing legislators, has limited his comments on Frye-Mueller's discipline and framed it as a personnel issue. Other Republican and Democratic leaders have sought to tone down the political context around her suspension and pointed out that all but one Senator voted for her censure.In the past, however, Schoenbeck has called Frye-Mueller and others “wackadoodles” and funded campaigns to unseat them in primaries, with limited success.Noem has also clashed with the right-wing lawmakers and last year supported a number of campaigns to defeat them — again, with limited success.As her political ambitions stretch beyond South Dakota, she has shown a willingness to concede to hardline conservatives, however. When House lawmakers advanced a bill in 2020 to ban gender-affirming medical procedures for transgender minors, she criticized the legislation as trying “to fill parenting gaps with more government.” This year, her spokesman has voiced support for a similar proposal.“When you have a supermajority, you will always tear yourself apart,” said Tom Dempster, a former Republican state senator who remains a close political watcher. “The primary system incentivizes extreme candidates.”Back in Frye-Mueller's home district, support for her remains strong. Activists in the Fall River County Republican Party drafted a resolution backing the senator.“I’m conservative like she is — she votes the way I would,” said Ken Updike, a local party leader who pushed the resolution. Senate leaders, he said, “are more aligned with Democrats than they are Republicans.”",2023/02/04,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799175,"Wall Street rally hits wall of hot jobs, cold earnings data","NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s big rally to start the year wilted on Friday after a surprisingly strong jobs report fueled worries about inflation and higher interest rates. 

            The S&P 500 fell 1% for its first drop in four days, though it took an up-and-down route to get there. The bond market was more decisive in thinking the strong jobs data could push the Federal Reserve to stay firmer than expected on high interest rates, which hurt the economy and markets. 

            The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 127 points, or 0.4%, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.6%. 











            The market already looked like it was set to weaken coming into the day, before the jolting jobs report dropped. Late Thursday, several Big Tech companies among Wall Street’s most influential reported weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. 

            That cast concerns over a rally that had brought the S&P 500 back to its highest level since August, driven by hopes that cooling inflation may get the Federal Reserve to take a pause soon on its hikes to interest rates and possibly even cut them by late this year.

            Then came the jobs report, which showed employers created a net 517,000 jobs last month. That was way above the 185,000 that economists expected and a sharp acceleration from December’s 260,000 jobs. 

            Normally, a strong jobs report is good for Wall Street because it means the economy is on firmer footing. But in this upside-down post-COVID world, it could also be a worrisome sign. The Fed is in the middle of trying to cool down the job market, in hopes of taking pressure off inflation.

            
                The concern in the market is that the much stronger-than-expected hiring could keep the Fed on the “higher-for-longer” path on interest rates that it’s been talking about, even if markets haven’t been believing it fully. 

            “It’s going to get harder to argue that rate cuts may be in 2023’s future if the labor market is able to continue like this, especially considering that it remains to be seen how quickly inflation will fall, even if we have reached the peak,” said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.

            Treasury yields zoomed higher immediately after the jobs report on forecasts for a firm Fed. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for the Fed, jumped to 4.30% from 4.10% late Thursday. The 10-year yield, which helps sets rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.53% from 3.40%. 

            The reaction in the stock market was more hesitant. Stocks opened with sharp losses, erased them all and then fell back later. 

            Some analysts said they were paying more attention to the data on wages in the jobs report than on overall hiring, which wasn’t as surprising. 

            Average hourly earnings for workers were 4.4% higher in January than a year earlier. That’s a slowdown from December’s 4.8% raise, though it was a touch above expectations. Slower wage gains can mean less pressure on inflation, though it hurts workers trying to keep up with rising prices at the register. 

            “The Fed has been downplaying the importance of the unemployment rate and payrolls number, focusing more on wage gains instead,” said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments. “Wage gains were in line with the consensus expectations, so I’m not as worried as most about the path ahead for the Fed.”

            Also helping to muddy the picture was a report showing the U.S. services sector returned to growth in January. It was a much stronger reading than expected, though it also suggested pricing pressures may be easing. 

            Drops for some Big Tech stocks were weighing on the market following weaker-than-expected earnings reports.

            
                Amazon fell 8.4% and was the single biggest weight on the S&P 500, while Google's parent company dropped 2.7%. Because they're among the most valuable stocks on Wall Street, their movements carry more weight on the S&P 500 than others. 

            On the winning side was Clorox, which jumped 9.8% after reporting much stronger profit for the end of 2022 than expected.

            All told, the S&P 500 fell 43.28 to 4,136.48. The Dow dropped 127.93 to 33,926.01, and the Nasdaq lost 193.86 to 12,006.95.

            Despite the stall, the S&P 500 still closed out its fourth winning week in the last five. It also remains 15.6% above its low point reached in October.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799176,'Possible blanks' fired by man in San Francisco synagogue,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Police in San Francisco are investigating a shooting inside a synagogue during which the unidentified suspect may have fired blanks rather than live rounds Wednesday night in what a synagogue official called an attempt to terrorize Jewish people.

            The synagogue did not report the incident until Thursday morning. No injuries or property damage were reported.

            Officers responded to a report of threats at the synagogue on Balboa Street around 9:30 a.m. Thursday, the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement early Friday.











            The person who made the report described an incident around 7:20 p.m. Wednesday in which an unknown man entered the building and “shot several times,"" police said.

            “To me, this feels like an act of terrorism. The point was to terrify the Jewish people here,” Alon Chanukov, the synagogue's vice president, told KRON-TV.

            
                KRON reported the incident Wednesday was captured on video. A man wearing a baseball cap, jacket and sneakers enters a room with more than a dozen people at a table and makes hand gestures before taking out a gun and fires around the room. The man then waves and exits less than a minute after entering the room.

            Police did not name the synagogue.

            Chanukov said the witnesses did not call police after the suspect fired the rounds believed to be blanks, but he phoned authorities Thursday morning. 

            “I don’t think people knew what was happening. We are talking about elderly people. The youngest being 60, then 70s and 80s,” Chanukov said, adding that there was a fear about retaliation from speaking out.

            The police noted there was another report of a person with a gun at a theater on the same block of Balboa Street at 8 p.m. on Tuesday. A man brandished a gun at employees and then fled on foot.

            Police said the events appeared to be unrelated to the synagogue incident on Wednesday, but the similar descriptions indicate the man in each report is “possibly the same individual.” Investigators were searching for the suspect on Friday.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Police in San Francisco are investigating a shooting inside a synagogue during which the unidentified suspect may have fired blanks rather than live rounds Wednesday night in what a synagogue official called an attempt to terrorize Jewish people.The synagogue did not report the incident until Thursday morning.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799178,Bennett earns 500th win as No. 18 Saint Mary's beats USF,"MORAGA, Calif. (AP) — Randy Bennett earned his 500th win as Saint Mary's coach when the 18th-ranked Gaels beat San Francisco 68-59 on Thursday night for their 11th straight victory.

            Alex Ducas had 18 points and Aidan Mahaney scored 13 of his 17 in the second half to lead the Gaels (20-4, 9-0 West Coast Conference) on a milestone night for Bennett.

            But his focus was on beating a neighborhood rival and remaining perfect in conference play.











            “It’s really hard to think about it in any other way than that right now,” Bennett said. “In time you’ll reflect back, and the memories you’ll have of the players and coaches. That’s why we’re sitting here. We’ve had really good players, really good assistant coaches and great administration, and I work at a great place.”

            Bennett took over a team coming off a 2-27 season in 2001 and has built Saint Mary's into one of the most consistent winners on the West Coast over more than two decades at the small school in the San Francisco suburbs.

            The Gaels have won at least 20 games in 15 of the last 16 seasons — missing out only in the pandemic-shortened 2020-21 season — and his 500 wins are the sixth-most among active coaches at their current school.

            “That’s special,” he said about winning 500 games at one school. “It’s hard to do. It’s just cool to do it at one place, so hopefully we’ll get some more. I’m glad it happened at one place.” 

            Khalil Shabazz scored 16 points and Marcus Williams added 15 for San Francisco (15-10, 4-6). 

            The Dons had won three in a row since losing at home to Saint Mary's last month, but struggled down the stretch and lost the rematch.

            “Just a few minor mistakes like offensive rebounds,” Williams said. “It comes down to tough plays and mental toughness. For some reason we couldn’t get that down.” 

            San Francisco trailed by 13 early in the second half but used a 12-0 run fueled by a pair of 3-pointers from Williams to take a 50-49 lead with less than six minutes left.

            But the Gaels responded and scored eight straight points capped by Mahaney's 3 that made it 61-55 with 1:45 to play.

            They sealed it at the free throw line and then celebrated with a photo at midcourt of Bennett and his players — followed by an ice-cold water bath in the locker room.

            “It’s beautiful,"" guard Logan Johnson said. ""Just to be a part of his 500th, that’s huge. It’s an honor to be a point guard for him right now.”

            Both teams struggled offensively in the first half, combining to go nearly five minutes without making a shot from the field. 

            But the Gaels managed to get to the foul line frequently, making 11 of 12 free throws, and led 36-27 at the break after Johnson hit a 3-pointer in the closing seconds.

            BIG PICTURE

            San Francisco: The Dons have lost eight straight in the series but nearly broke through under first-year coach Chris Gerlufsen. They fell to 3-31 against ranked teams since the start of the 2012-13 season, with one of the wins coming earlier this season against Arizona State.

            Saint Mary's: The Gaels were far from their best in this game, missing 14 of 15 shots from the field during one stretch in the second half and shooting 32.7% for the game. But they made 32 of 37 free throws to maintain their perfect conference record. 

            HONORING A LEGEND

            The teams honored late Dons star Bill Russell, who died last summer at age 88. Russell led San Francisco to back-to-back national titles in 1955 and '56 before going on to have a Hall of Fame career in the NBA with the Boston Celtics, winning 11 championships in 13 seasons.

            The players wore shirts with Russell's No. 6 during warmups and there was a brief video tribute to him.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799179,"US seeks to expel Russian mercenaries from Sudan, Libya","CAIRO (AP) — The United States has stepped up pressure on Middle East allies to expel the Wagner Group, a military contractor owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russia’s president, from chaos-stricken Libya and Sudan where it has expanded in recent years, regional officials told The Associated Press.

            The U.S. effort described by officials comes as the Biden administration is making a broad push against the mercenaries. The U.S. has slapped new sanctions on the Wagner Group in recent months over its expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine.

            The group is owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Pentagon has described it as a surrogate for the Russian Defense Ministry. The Kremlin denies any connection.











            The Biden administration has been working for months with regional powers Egypt and the United Arab Emirates to pressure military leaders in Sudan and Libya to end their ties with the group, according to more than a dozen Libyan, Sudanese and Egyptian officials. They asked for anonymity to speak freely and because they were not authorized to discuss the issue with the media.

            A senior Egyptian government official with direct knowledge of the talks said the Wagner group “is at the top of every meeting.”

            The group doesn’t announce its operations, but its presence is known from reports on the ground and other evidence. In Sudan, it was originally associated with former strongman Omar al-Bashir and now works with the military leaders who replaced him. In Libya, it's associated with east Libya-based military commander Khalifa Hifter.

            Wagner has deployed thousands of operatives in African and Middle Eastern countries including Mali, Libya, Sudan, the Central African Republic, and Syria. Its aim in Africa, analysts say, is to support Russia’s interests amid rising global interest in the resource-rich continent. Rights experts working with the U.S. on Jan. 31 accused the group of committing possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Mali, where it is fighting alongside government forces.

            “Wagner tends to target countries with natural resources that can be used for Moscow’s objectives -– gold mines in Sudan, for example, where the resulting gold can be sold in ways that circumvent Western sanctions,” said Catrina Doxsee, an expert on Wagner at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.

            Asked for comment, Prigozhin told AP through his representatives on Friday that African countries should be wary of U.S. policy. 

            “We are closely following the movements of the CIA director and attempts to put pressure on the authorities of various states,"" the statement said. “We always have a sacred attitude to the sovereignty of countries.""

            The group’s role in Libya and Sudan was central to talks between CIA director William Burns and officials in Egypt and Libya in January. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also discussed the group with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in a late-January trip to Cairo, Egyptian officials said. Weeks after the visits, Burns acknowledged in a Thursday speech at Georgetown University in Washington that after recent travel to Africa, he was concerned about Wagner's growing influence in the continent.

            “That is a deeply unhealthy development and we’re working very hard to counter it,” Burns said.

            Burns and Blinken called on el-Sissi’s government to help convince Sudan’s ruling generals and Libya’s Hifter to end their dealings with Wagner, an Egyptian official briefed on the talks said.

            The group and Prigozhin have been under U.S. sanctions since 2017, and the Biden administration in December announced new export restrictions on its access to technology and supplies, designating it as a “significant transnational criminal organization.""

            SUDAN

            Leaders in Sudan have received repeated U.S. messages about Wagner’s growing influence in recent months, via Egypt and Gulf states, said a senior Sudanese official.

            Abbas Kamel, the director of Egypt’s Intelligence Directorate Agency, conveyed Western concerns in talks in Khartoum last month with the head of Sudan’s ruling sovereign council, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the official said. Kamel urged Burhan to find a way to address Wagner’s “use of Sudan as a base” for operations in neighboring countries such as the Central African Republic, the official said.

            Wagner started operating in Sudan in 2017, providing military training to intelligence and special forces, and to the paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces, according to Sudanese officials and documents shared with the AP.

            The RSF, which grew out of the feared Janjaweed militias, is led by powerful general Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, who has close ties with the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Dagalo has been sending troops to fight alongside the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen’s long-running civil war.

            Wagner mercenaries are not operating in a combat role in Sudan, officials said. The group, which has dozens of operatives in the country, provides military and intelligence training, as well as surveillance and protection of sites and top officials.

            Sudanese military leaders appear to have given Wagner control of gold mines in return. The documents show the group has received mining rights through front companies with ties to Sudan’s powerful military and the RSF. Its activities are centered in gold-rich areas controlled by the RSF in Darfur, Blue Nile and other provinces, according to officials.

            Two companies have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department for acting as fronts for Wagner’s mining activities — Meroe Gold, a Sudanese gold mining firm, and its owner, the Russian-based M Invest firm. Prigozhin owns or controls both, according to the Treasury Department. Despite sanctions, Meroe Gold is still operating across Sudan.

            The Russian mercenaries helped the paramilitary force consolidate its influence not only in the country’s far-flung regions, but also in the capital of Khartoum, where it helps run pro-RSF social media pages.

            The main camp of Wagner mercenaries is in the contested village of Am Dafok on the border between the Central African Republic and Sudan, according to the Darfur Bar Association, a legal group that focuses on human rights.

            “Nobody can approach their areas,"" said Gibreel Hassabu, a lawyer and member of the association.

            LIBYA

            In Libya, Burns held talks in Tripoli with Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, head of one of Libya’s two rival governments.

            The CIA director also met with Hifter in eastern Libya, according to officials with Hifter’s forces. One official briefed on the meeting in al-Rajma military complex, the seat of Hifter’s command just outside Benghazi, said Wagner was the main issue discussed.

            
                U.N. experts said Wagner mercenaries were deployed Libya since 2018, helping Hifter's forces in their fight against Islamist militants in eastern Libya. The group was also involved in his failed offensive on Tripoli in April 2019.

            The U.S. Africa Command, AFRICOM, estimated that some 2,000 Wagner mercenaries were in Libya between July-September 2020, before a cease-fire. The mercenaries were equipped with armored vehicles, air defense systems, fighter aircraft and other equipment supplied by Russia, according to AFRICOM. The report also said Wagner appeared to be receiving money from the UAE, a main foreign backer of Hifter.

            Since the 2020 cease-fire, Wagner's activities have centered around oil facilities in central Libya, and they have continued providing military training to Hifter forces, Libyan officials said. It is not clear how many Wagner mercenaries are still in Libya.

            U.S. officials have demanded that mercenaries be pulled out of oil facilities, another Libyan official said.

            Hifter did not offer any commitments, but asked for assurances that Turkey and the Libyan militias it backed in western Libya will not attack his forces in the coastal city of Sirte and other areas in central Libya.

            Egypt, which has close ties with Hifter, has demanded that Wagner not be stationed close to its borders.

            There is no evidence yet that the Biden administration’s pressure has yielded results in either Sudan or Libya, observers said.

            Doxsee, the expert, said the U.S. and allies should resist promoting narratives that “Russia is bad and what we have to offer is good,” and instead focus on offering better alternatives to Wagner.

            “Ultimately, at the end of the day, Wagner is a business. If you can cut out the profit and you can reduce the business case for using Wagner, that’s what is going to make it a less- appealing case,” she said.

            AP writer Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed.CAIRO (AP) — The United States has stepped up pressure on Middle East allies to expel the Wagner Group, a military contractor owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russia’s president, from chaos-stricken Libya and Sudan where it has expanded in recent years, regional officials told The Associated Press.The U.S. effort described by officials comes as the Biden administration is making a broad push against the mercenaries. The U.S. has slapped new sanctions on the Wagner Group in recent months over its expanding role in Russia’s war in Ukraine.The group is owned by Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Pentagon has described it as a surrogate for the Russian Defense Ministry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799180,Alleged Islamic State sniper trial looks at foreign fighters,"NEW YORK (AP) — He had been brought from the battlefields of Syria to a New York lockup, a U.S. citizen charged with serving as a sniper and weapons trainer for the Islamic State group. 

            And even in jail, Ruslan Maratovich kept a makeshift version of the militants' black flag right above the desk in his cell, according to trial testimony this week. 

            “What's the big deal? It's mine. It's religious,” then-jail lieutenant Judith Woods recalled him saying when she went to confiscate the hand-drawn image in 2020. 











            Years after the fall of the extremist group’s self-proclaimed Islamic caliphate, the trial is a reminder of the enduring and far-reaching fallout of a war that drew tens of thousands of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq. Their home countries are still contending with what should become of them.

            Jurors, who are expected to start deliberating as soon as Monday, have gotten a refresher course on IS's gruesome rule and its sophisticated, social media-savvy recruitment of distant supporters to come and take up arms. Prosecutors say Asainov did so and rose through the group's ranks, eventually becoming an “emir” who taught other members to use weapons.

            In post-arrest videos shown at his trial, he gives his occupation as “a sniper” to FBI agents and readily tells them that he provided instruction in everything from rifle maintenance to ballistics to adjusting for weather effects — and, of course, “how to actually pull the trigger.”

            “Oh, it's a long lesson,” he explains, sitting on a bed in a room where he was being held. “I would give, like, a three-hour lesson, just on that, just to pull the trigger.” 

            Jurors have seen photos alleged to be of Asainov in camouflage, aiming a rifle, and of the handmade flag that Woods said she took from his cell. Witnesses have included his flabbergasted ex-wife, who testified that he morphed from a Brooklyn family man into a zealot. She said he weighed in from Syria to complain about their daughter donning a Halloween costume and sent a photo of the bodies of what he said were comrades killed in a battle, according to the Daily News of New York. 

            Asainov, 46, chose not to testify, telling the court that he was “not part of this process.” 

            “My body is present here. I’m not present here,” added Asainov, who similarly refused at his 2019 arraignment to enter any plea. One of his lawyers, Susan Kellman, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, explaining that he didn't recognize the U.S. legal system.

            At trial, Kellman told jurors that Asainov went to Syria because he wanted to live under Islamic law.

            IS fighters seized portions of Iraq and Syria in 2014 and declared the establishment of a so-called Islamic caliphate there, at a time when Syria was already convulsed by civil war. Fighting laid waste to multiple cities before Iraq's prime minister declared the caliphate vanquished in 2017; the extremists lost the last of their territory two years later, though sporadic attacks persist even now. 

            During the height of the fighting, as many as 40,000 people from 120 countries showed up to join in, according to the United Nations. There is no comprehensive U.S. statistic on Americans among those foreign fighters; a 2018 report by George Washington University’s Program on Extremism found at least 64 who had joined jihadist fighting in Iraq and Syria since 2011. 

            Since IS's defeat, some foreign members and their families have lingered in detention facilities in Syria because their countries refused to take them back. Others accused of being foreign fighters have returned to their countries, including some who were prosecuted. 

            Recent U.S. cases include a Kansas mother who led an all-female IS battalion, a Minnesota man who served in a battalion that prepared foreign fighters for suicide attacks in Europe, and a Detroit-area man convicted this week of training with and then spending more than two years with the group.

            Born in Kazakhstan, Asainov is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He lived in Brooklyn starting in 1998, married and had a child. 

            Then he flew to Istanbul on a one-way ticket in December 2013 and made his way to Syria to join what he later described in a message as “the worst terrorist organization in the world that has ever existed,"" authorities say. 

            “You heard of ISIS,” he said in another text message in January 2015, according to prosecutors’ court filings. “We will get you.”

            By that April, Asainov told an acquaintance — in fact, a government informant — that he'd been fighting in Syria for about a year, according to court papers. They say that in various exchanges, he urged the informant to come to Syria and help with IS's media operations, asked for $2,800 to buy a rifle scope, and sent photos of himself with fatigues and rifle, saying he “didn't mean to show off” but was showing what was “just normal” in his new life.

            Authorities announced in July 2019 that U.S.-backed forces in Syria had captured Asainov and turned him over to the FBI.

            Asainov faces charges that include providing material support to a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799185,Metamorphosis By De Beers: Prelude,"Introducing the first chapter of De Beers’ magnificent new High Jewellery collection, inspired by Mother Nature’s transformation through the seasons

PARIS, FRANCE -  Media OutReach - 3 February 2023 - In nature, change is the only constant. Seasons shift as flower buds blossom, bloom and fade. A caterpillar forms a chrysalis, preparing for its magical transformation into a butterfly. Beneath the earth's crust, billions of years ago, a slow tectonic alchemy created ancient deposits of rough diamonds, the fruits of which are still being revealed. And it is through gradual adaptations that we achieve our innermost potential. De Beers pays homage to Mother Nature's constant evolution with Metamorphosis by De Beers, a High Jewellery collection dedicated to the transformative power of natural diamonds.            Launching in January 2023 during Paris Couture Week, Prelude is the first chapter of the new collection, with a further chapter to be revealed in July 2023. Prelude explores the cyclical rhythm of time, harmoniously capturing the four seasons within nine one-of-a-kind designs.   With a focus on exceptional craftsmanship, Metamorphosis by De Beers encapsulates the transformation at the heart of De Beers, the only global luxury brand that begins at the source. De Beers realises the potential of rough diamonds, transforming these treasures of nature into one-of-a-kind High Jewellery that radiates magnetic beauty. The collection continues the evolution of the House itself, with artistic and technically ambitious designs that celebrate artisanal skills as well as the rare beauty of the raw materials.   The Prelude set showcases an array of expert goldsmithing and diamond-setting techniques, including serti neige (snow setting), fil couteau (knife-edge) and perlage (gold beading). Spring, summer, autumn and winter collide, with each season represented through different design signatures, coloured metals, diamonds and settings. The collection combines white, yellow and rose gold with white, brown and fancy-coloured diamonds, selected to evoke the hues of each season.   Nature's metamorphic power is mirrored by an element of transformability in four of the nine pieces. A majestic transformable necklace features four diamond strands – one for each season – strung between two removeable clasps. Bead-set white diamonds and star-set yellow diamonds are joined by fil couteau to mimic the fledgling buds of spring; a twisted rope of diamond-set yellow gold evokes ripples on summer sand; brown diamonds set in rose-gold triangles conjure autumn's russet leaves; and white gold serti neige represents the glacial beauty of winter.   In a contemporary ear cuff, each diamond strand is finished with a coloured-titanium chrysalis, hinting at the beginnings of nature's most magnificent metamorphosis. The chrysalises can be removed and worn on a charm bracelet. Elsewhere, the four strands form a ring jacket for a 3.06 carat D-Flawless diamond solitaire from the De Beers Natural Works of Art collection, which can be interchanged with a pavé-set diamond ring. Another necklace features a detachable pear-shaped clip which can be worn as a brooch.   ""In Metamorphosis by De Beers we have transformed the spontaneous beauty of nature into our most complex and innovative designs yet,"" says Céline Assimon, CEO of De Beers Jewellers. ""Each design in our Prelude set showcases a masterclass of artisanal savoir-faire – we have honed in on the details, combining antique-inspired settings with contemporary techniques such as coloured titanium. We have pushed the boundaries with the ear cuff, which has a mesmerising sense of movement and volume. It's a very modern approach to classical High Jewellery, reflecting De Beers' DNA of excellence through experimentation and constant innovation.""  Hashtag: #DeBeers #DeBeersHK #naturaldiamonds

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799194,Taipei Zoo pangolins successfully breed in Prague,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A pangolin has given birth at the Prague Zoological Garden, less than a year since it was flown from Taipei to the Czech Republic capital.On April 14, 2022, the female pangolin Run Hou Tang (潤喉糖, “cough drop”) and her mate Gun Bao (果寶, “precious fruit”) arrived at the Prague Zoological Garden after a journey that took more than 24 hours. The two are on a pangolin loan program, which was launched after Taipei and Prague became sister cities in 2020.In October, the zoo announced in a press release that Run Hou Tang was pregnant. “I am very pleased that the intercity diplomacy between Prague and Taipei can bear such rare fruit as a small, lively ‘pinecone,’” Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib wrote on social media.On Thursday (Feb. 2), Hrib announced the pup was born, describing it as “an extremely rare moment.” The birth marks the first time a pangolin has been successfully bred in Europe.According to Prague Zoological Garden, the newborn pup weighed 135 grams. Hrib asked the public to keep their fingers crossed for the pup to grow up healthy because “the beginnings can be difficult.”Taipei Zoo confirmed Hrib’s statement, adding the first week is especially risky for pangolin pups, Liberty Times reported. As pangolins are not native to Europe and are generally found in Asia or Africa, where the climate is warmer, it is a challenge for Prague zoo to keep and raise pangolins.Additionally, as it is hard for zoos to replicate the variety of ants and termites found in a pangolin's natural diet, Prague zookeepers must provide Run Hou Tang and Gun Bao with specially designed feed. They must also pay constant attention to the habitat and comfort level because pangolins get anxious easily.Taipei Zoo staff got the chance to see the newborn pup on Thursday via a video conference, though the conference was kept short so the zookeepers in Prague could focus on tending to it. It is working closely with the Prague zoo to assist with caring for the pup.Run Hou Tang takes her young on a stroll while still living at Taipei Zoo. (Taipei Zoo photo)",2023/02/03,541,Environment

However, analysts expect the military takeover in Myanmar will dominate discussions despite the host country's resolve to not let the issue hold the bloc ""hostage.""""The issue of Myanmar will not be allowed to hold hostage the process of strengthening the ASEAN community development,'' Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi had said last month.Myanmar is one of the 10 ASEAN countries, but its foreign minister, Wunna Maung Lwin, is not in attendance. The exclusion resulted from Myanmar's lack of cooperation on the five-step agreement between ASEAN and Myanmar Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.The deal called for Myanmar to allow a special ASEAN envoy to meet the imprisoned former leader Aung San Suu Kyi to promote dialogue. Myanmar's lack of cooperation also led to its exclusion from the November 2022 ASEAN meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, after an ASEAN representative was not allowed to meet the former leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate.Indonesia's Marsudi, last month, had said she was disappointed by the lack of progress in Myanmar's political situation despite global pressure, threat of sanctions and political exclusion.Kicking off the nation's hosting duties late last month, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said the ASEAN bloc will continue its work on economic growth and stability in the region.""Economic crisis, energy crisis, food crisis as well as warfare, we face all of them this year,'' Widodo had said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799203,Israel probes legality of US giving artifact to Palestinians,"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) — An ivory spoon dating back 2,700 years that was recently repatriated to the Palestinian Authority from the United States has sparked a dispute with Israel's new far-right government over the cultural heritage in the occupied West Bank.

            The clash brings into focus the political sensitivities surrounding archaeology in the Middle East, where Israelis and Palestinians each use ancient artifacts to support their claims over the land.

            Israel's ultranationalist heritage minister has ordered officials to examine the legality of the U.S. government's historic repatriation of the artifact to the Palestinians earlier this month, and is calling for annexing archaeology in the occupied West Bank.











            The artifact — a cosmetic spoon made of ivory and believed to have been plundered from a site in the West Bank — was seized in late 2021 by the Manhattan District Attorney's office as part of a deal with the New York billionaire hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt.

            It was one of 180 artifacts illegally looted and purchased by Steinhardt that he surrendered as part of an agreement to avoid prosecution. 

            American officials handed an artifact over to the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities on Jan. 5 in what the U.S. State Department’s Office of Palestinian Affairs said was “the first event of such repatriation” by the U.S. to the Palestinians. 

            Dozens of Steinhardt’s surrendered artifacts have already been repatriated to Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Jordan, Libya and Israel. This spoon was the first and only item ever to be repatriated to the Palestinians.

            The repatriation coincided with the first weeks of Israel's new government, which is composed of ultranationalists who see the West Bank as the biblical heartland of the Jewish people and inextricably linked to the state of Israel.

            Heritage Minister Amihai Eliyahu’s office said last week that the legality of the repatriation “is being examined by the archaeology staff officer with the legal counsel, which will examine all aspects of the matter, including the Oslo Accords that the U.S. has signed.” 

            The case underscores how archaeology and cultural heritage are intertwined with the competing claims of the Israelis and Palestinians in the decades-long conflict.

            “Any artifact that we know that it comes out illegally from Palestine, we have the right to have it back,” said Jihad Yassin, director general of excavations and museums in the Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry. “Each artifact says a story from the history of this land.” 

            The ministry is part of the Palestinian Authority, the government established as part of the Oslo Accords in the 1990s that exercises limited autonomy in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

            Those agreements between Israel and the Palestinians were supposed to include coordination on a raft of issues, including archaeology and cultural heritage. 

            But the agreements have largely unraveled. Yassin said that the archaeology committee has not met in around two decades, and that there is virtually zero coordination between Israel and the Palestinians concerning antiquities theft prevention in the West Bank.

            “We try to do our best to protect these archaeological sites, but we face difficulties,” he said. 

            Yassin said that around 60% of the West Bank's archaeological sites are in territory under complete Israeli military control, and that his ministry's theft prevention workers “manage to control in a high percentage the looting” in areas under Palestinian Authority control.

            Nonetheless, many of the illicit artifacts that have made their way to Israel's legal antiquities market were looted from the West Bank, he said. 

            According to court documents, Steinhardt bought the ivory cosmetic spoon in 2003 from Israeli antiquities dealer Gil Chaya for $6,000. The artifact had no provenance — paperwork detailing where it came from and how it had entered the dealer's inventory — but Chaya said the object was from the West Bank town of El-Koum, which is under Palestinian Authority control.

            Another artifact believed to have been looted from the same town, a “Red Carnelian Sun Fish amulet (that) dates to circa 600 B.C.E.,” remains missing, according to the DA's office. Steinhardt has yet to locate the item, but if it is found, it will be repatriated to the Palestinians, the office said. 

            
                American authorities returned 28 objects to Israel last year, not including three that were seized in place at the Israel Museum of Jerusalem. Seven others meant to be returned to Israel have yet to be found. Several of the items returned to Israel are believed to have been looted from the West Bank.

            The Israel Antiquities Authority declined comment on the artifact’s repatriation to the Palestinians. 

            Heritage Minister Eliyahu, a religious ultranationalist in Netanyahu's government now in charge of the country’s Antiquities Authority, denies the existence of a Palestinian people.

            Since taking office, he has accused the Palestinian Authority of committing “national terrorism” and “erasing heritage” at an archaeological site in a Palestinian-controlled area near the West Bank city of Nablus. 

            It remains unclear what impact, if any, a review by the ministry's legal counsel could have. It appears unlikely Israel could confiscate the artifact from the Palestinians, but a legal opinion against the move could potentially complicate future repatriations.

            Earlier this week, Eliyahu said he would be giving the Israel Antiquities Authority full control over archaeological sites, cultural heritage and theft prevention throughout the West Bank — a move that critics say would in effect apply Israeli law over occupied territory in breach of international law.

            Currently, archaeological excavations and antiquities in the West Bank are managed by the Civil Administration's archaeology staff officer, which is part of the Defense Ministry. Israel has not formally annexed the West Bank, and the territory is treated as occupied and is governed under military law.

            “All heritage on both sides of the green line will earn full protection, at an international and scientific standard,” Eliyahu wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. He said the state of Israel would “act in a uniform and professional manner from the (Mediterranean) sea to the Jordan.” 

            Alon Arad, director of Israeli cultural heritage non-governmental organization Emek Shaveh, said that putting the Israel Antiquities Authority in charge of archaeology in the occupied territory was “activating Israeli law in the West Bank, which means annexation.” 

            Eliyahu’s office declined repeated interview requests.

            Yassin said that for the time being, the artifact will remain at the ministry, where it will be studied by one of its archaeologists. Then, he said, it will be displayed at one of the West Bank's museums.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799229,"Along Ukraine-Belarus border, a war of nerves — and drones","BELARUS BORDER, Ukraine (AP) — The reconnaissance drones fly several times a day from Ukrainian positions deep inside the thick forest that marches across the border into Belarus, a close Russian ally, scouring sky and land for signs of trouble on the other side.

            Ukrainian units are monitoring the 1,000-kilometer (650-mile) frontier of marsh and woodland for a possible surprise offensive from the north, a repeat of the unsuccessful Russian thrust toward Kyiv at the start of the war nearly a year ago.

            This time the Ukrainians are taking no chances. Since the summer they have been reinforcing defenses, building and expanding trenches and laying mines in the forest ahead of the springtime offensive military officials expect. Residents of villages in the region that were temporarily occupied last year are horrified by the prospect of it all starting again.











            “We’re listening out for every small sound and noise. This isn’t a way to live,” said Valentina Matveva, 64, from the village of Ripky. “When you’re in constant fear, that’s not life.” 

            Concerns of a renewed military push were stirred in January after Russia and Belarus held joint air force drills, one month after a rare visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Minsk.

            Military experts and Western intelligence have played down the possibility of a renewed northern offensive. The British Defense Ministry tweeted on Jan. 11 that Russian aircraft and existing Russian troops in Belarus, though numerous, are “unlikely to constitute a credible offensive force.”

            Belarusian officials attribute the troop deployment along the border to “strategic deterrence” according to local reports. The country's authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has insisted he will not send troops to Ukraine.

            But Ukrainian commanders are wary, remembering how Russia used Belarus as a launching pad in early 2022.

            “We continuously monitor the enemy from the ground and observe the movement of troops, if they are moving, how many troops, and where they are moving,” the area's army intelligence unit head said during a press tour this week a few kilometers from the border. The officer only identified himself by his first name, Oleksandr, citing security reasons.

            Unlike the east with its devastating artillery duels, here in the north it’s largely a war of quadcopters.

            Oleksandr said the Belarusians and Russians are “constantly monitoring our guard changes, trying to find our military’s positions.”

            At times, Oleksandr’s unit detects enemy reconnaissance drones and shoots them down using anti-drone rifles. Or an enemy drone detects a Ukrainian one and tails it, at which point the Ukrainians try to capture and add it to their stock.

            “We got four of their drones this way recently, and they took two of ours,” Oleksandr said. 

            He says the reconnaissance missions have revealed no sign of worrying activity — yet. “They have a reinforcement section, and the patrol has been strengthened, but we do not observe a significant accumulation of troops from our section,” he said. 

            Ukraine’s Lt. Gen. Oleksii Pavlyuk, who is responsible for Kyiv province, was quoted in local reports as saying his country was preparing for a possible fresh attack through Belarus. “We’ve created a group on the border with Belarus, which is ready to meet the enemy with dignity,” he was quoted as saying.

            Ukrainian officials argue that no one can know how Moscow will move in the coming months, and that a state of alert is necessary along the border.

            “The (fortifications) were made to prevent re-infiltration,” said Oleksandr, “Whether it will happen or not, we must always be ready.”

            Ukrainian soldiers armed with machine guns stand in five-foot-deep trenches dug into the forest floor and reinforced with planks.

            A local villager briskly cycles past. Memories here are still fresh from the temporary occupation when Russian troops attempted to lay siege to the main city of Chernihiv. They withdrew on April 3 as Moscow switched its focus to Ukraine’s eastern provinces. 

            But despite the Russian-Belarusian drills, there’s also hope.

            “The first time they invaded, we didn’t have the weapons and the army (at the border),” said Hanna Pokheelko, 66, from the village of Koluchivka. “But this time we do.”

            Attack or no attack, Olena, from the village of Novi Yarylovychi, fears the border situation means she may never see her mother, brother and two sisters living just 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) away in a village inside Belarus. 

            “I can’t believe they are so close and I can’t see them,” said the 63-year old, who is a Belarusian by birth but married into a Ukrainian family and who didn't give her full name out of concerns for her family.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799266,Belgian carnival town celebrates again after COVID hiatus,"BINCHE, Belgium (AP) — On a sunny winter morning heralding a radiant Mardi Gras, Beatrice and Karl Kersten don’t have a minute to spare.

            In their warm workshop decorated with ancestral photos, the couple bend over their sewing machines. They are busy putting the finishing touches to the delicate lace details adorning the carnival costumes that will send a whole town into rapture once paraded through the cobbled streets of Binche. 

            “It’s a total rush, we are late,” said Karl, a fourth-generation tailor.











            But to the Kerstens and their son Quentin, now in charge of the family business in the medieval western Belgian town, this year the pressure feels really good.

            After a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic that brutally brought one of Europe’s oldest Mardi Gras celebrations to a halt — and the Kerstens to the verge of bankruptcy — celebrations are back with a vengeance this winter.

            “There is a real excitement and enthusiasm,” said Quentin. ”People came much earlier to reserve their costumes than in other years.”

            The earliest records of the Binche Mardi Gras, which draws thousands of revelers, date to the 14th century. Many Belgian towns hold ebullient carnival processions before Lent. But what makes Binche unique are the “Gilles” — local men deemed fit to wear the Mardi Gras costumes. 

            Under rules established by the local folklore defense association, only men from Binche families or resident there for at least five years can wear the Gille costume. Other characters — the Peasant, the Sailor, the Harlequin, the Pierrot or the Gille’s Wife — also play a role in the carnival. 

            The UNESCO-listed event starts three days before Lent and reaches its climax on Mardi Gras, when the Gilles — in wax masks sporting green spectacles and thin moustaches — dance in their wooden clogs to the sound of brass instruments and clarinets until the early morning hours. Women can join in, but only men wear the Gille outfit.

            “The carnival is really the soul of the city of Binche, so we have been really sad over the past two years” said Patrick Haumont, a town hall staffer who often takes part in the celebrations, dressed in the red, yellow and black attire.

            Over the past three weeks, rehearsals for the main parade have attracted more participants than usual. And at weekends, excitement in the bars filling the town’s main square hits unprecedented levels.

            “Instead of the one beer you would normally drink, it’s now five,” Haumont said.

            After the economic struggles of the pandemic years, and amid pain from energy bills that went through the roof after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the people of Binche want to make this year’s carnival one for the ages.

            Although taking part requires a big financial commitment — renting a Gille costume and a lavish ostrich-feather hat costs around 300 euros ($327) — some 1,000 Gilles are expected to parade through the narrow streets of brick row houses to the beat of the drum and the tinkling bells of their outfits.

            “People have rented more costumes, more hats. Everybody wants to do it again. We can see that there is a need,” Haumont said.

            For Christian Mostade, an 88-year-old member of the biggest Gilles company, it will be his 38th carnival as a Gille.

            “In normal times, we would be around 140 or 145,"" he said. “This year we'll be 158. There are old-timers who have not participated for a long time who have returned, and also many new ones.""

            Charly Rombaux is among the newcomers. The 35-year-old delivery driver does not want to wear the daunting traditional hat that weighs nearly 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) for his grand debut as a Gille. 

            The experienced Mostade had the solution pat.

            “The solution is to find three men in your company with the same head size, so you can alternate with the hat on,"" Mostade said as the two met for the first time this week and quickly engaged in a passionate conversation. 

            That need to get together again in a city where the Carnival creates a unique sense of belonging is a relief for the “louageurs"" — the craftsmen making the costumes and renting them to the Gilles. 

            At some point during the pandemic, as he struggled to make ends meet, Quentin Kersten thought about calling it quits and starting anew as an electrician. His parents had to dip into their savings, forgetting about the trips they envisaged for their retirement days to salvage their business instead.

            “It was a catastrophe,"" Karl Kersten summed up. 

            But that dark chapter is now closed. Haumont marks his words: “For a regular carnival, there is effervescence. But this year, it is just going to be madness.""BINCHE, Belgium (AP) — On a sunny winter morning heralding a radiant Mardi Gras, Beatrice and Karl Kersten don’t have a minute to spare.In their warm workshop decorated with ancestral photos, the couple bend over their sewing machines.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799267,Chinese balloon soars across US; Blinken scraps Beijing trip,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A huge, high-altitude Chinese balloon sailed across the U.S. on Friday, drawing severe Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite China's firm denials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing U.S.-China tensions.

            Aside from the government response, fuzzy videos dotted social media as people with binoculars and telephoto lenses tried to find the “spy balloon” in the sky as it headed southeastward over Kansas and Missouri at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters).

            It was spotted earlier over Montana, which is home to one of America’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base, defense officials said.











            Later Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. ""We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted.

            The U.S. actually had been tracking the initial balloon since at least Tuesday, when President Joe Biden was first briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. According to three U.S. officials, Biden was initially inclined to order the surveillance balloon to be blown out of the sky, and a senior defense official said the U.S. had prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot it down if ordered. 

            The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly advised Biden against shooting down the balloon, warning that its size — as big as three school buses — and considerable weight could create a debris field large enough to endanger Americans on the ground. The Pentagon also assessed that after unspecified U.S. measures, the possibility of the balloon uncovering important information was not great.

            It was not the first time Chinese surveillance balloons have been tracked over U.S. territory, including at least once during former President Donald Trump’s administration, officials said.

            Blinken's trip cancellation came despite China’s claim that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China's contention that the balloon was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.

            Blinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China's) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”

            China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Saturday morning: “In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit. The U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that.”

            According to Beijing, Wang said China ""has always strictly followed international law, we do not accept any groundless speculation and hype. Faced with unexpected situations, both parties need to keep calm, communicate in a timely manner, avoid misjudgments and manage differences.”

            After passing the sensitive military sites in Montana, the balloon was moving southeastward over the heartland of the central United States during the day and was expected to remain in U.S. airspace for several days, officials said.

            The development dealt a new blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years over numerous issues. Still, U.S. officials maintained that diplomatic channels remain open and Blinken said he remained willing to travel to China “when conditions allow.”

            “We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important,"" he said.

            Biden declined to comment on the matter when questioned at an economic event. Two likely 2024 reelection challengers, Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should immediately shoot down the balloon.

            Several Republican congressmen said the same, and a number blasted the administration for “allowing” the balloon intrusion.

            “The idea that Communist China has a spy balloon headed towards Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri right now — the home of the Stealth Bomber — is absolutely unbelievable,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. “No American should accept this. I don’t.”

            Jean-Pierre did not shed light on why the administration waited until Thursday to make its concerns public.

            Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, refused to say Friday whether there was any new consideration of shooting the balloon down. He said it currently was posing no threat.

            Ryder said it was maneuverable, not just at the mercy of the wind, and had changed course.

            Still, weather experts said China’s claim that the balloon had gone off course was not unfeasible. China’s account of wind patterns known as the Westerlies carrying a balloon to the western United States was “absolutely possible — not possible, likely,” said Dan Jaffe, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington.

            As for Blinken's trip, Jean-Pierre said a diplomatic visit to China was not appropriate at such a time. She said that ""the presence of this balloon in our airspace ... is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and it is unacceptable this occurred.”

            A State Department official said Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had both protested to the top official at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday, a day before the Pentagon announced the discovery of the balloon.

            Blinken’s long-anticipated meetings with senior Chinese officials had been seen in both countries as a possible way to find some areas of common ground at a time of major disagreements over Taiwan, human rights, China’s claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change.

            Although the trip, which was agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Indonesia, had not been formally announced, officials in both Beijing and Washington had spoken in recent days about Blinken’s imminent arrival for meetings on Sunday and Monday.

            China, which angrily denounces surveillance attempts by the U.S. and others over areas it considers to be its territory and once forced down an American spy plane and held its crew captive on Hainan Island, was relatively conciliatory in its response to the U.S. complaints.

            In a statement that approached an apology, the Chinese foreign ministry said the balloon was a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research. It said said the airship had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds. 

            “The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,” the statement said, citing a legal term used to refer to events beyond one’s control.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799269,LeBron’s off-court legacy complements his basketball success,"Mya Smiley is a student at the University of Akron thanks to an assist from LeBron James, and she is determined upon graduation to become a social worker that helps foster kids.

            Her education and career path would not have been possible, the sophomore says, were it not for a scholarship and counseling that she received from the LeBron James Family Foundation. “He’s life-changing,” Smiley said.

            For all his accomplishments on the basketball court — four championships, 19 All-Star Game nominations and his coronation as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer — it is James' ambitious pursuits off-the-court that may ultimately distinguish his legacy from other superstar athletes.











            James co-founded a successful media and entertainment company, bought stakes in storied professional baseball and soccer franchises and, with a big assist from product endorsements, his net worth is estimated to have grown above $1 billion. The off-court achievement that James is most proud of, he says, is working to uplift the lives of people like Smiley in his hometown of Akron.

            Many athletes have excelled in one or more of these areas. But few have done all of them as well as James, who passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA's career scoring record on Tuesday night. James now has 38,390 points, three more than Abdul-Jabbar retired with.

            “His goal, I believe, is to have 10% of his wealth go to causes and support communities, which is an amazing goal,” said Lisa Delpy Neirotti, a professor of sports management at George Washington University. “I would say he’s maybe above and beyond others, just on that aspiration alone.”

            James is, by any measure, an overwhelming success. And he makes Smiley — one of the many people in Akron who have received financial support from his foundation — believe that she can be a success as well.

            “If I did not have the LeBron program, I probably wouldn’t have ever gone to college. I would be living in a not-so-positive environment,"" said the 19-year-old Smiley.

            “His ability to help people’s futures,"" she added, ""is what makes LeBron a great person.”

            James, who entered the NBA straight after high school in 2003, planned early on to use his talents, fame — and, yes, his growing financial resources — to have on impact on the world beyond basketball.

            “Even before I got into the NBA, I knew I wanted to find a way to give back to my community,” said James. Although James bounced from home to home during his childhood, and experienced financial insecurity for many of those years, he also was given enormous support from friends, neighbors and educators. 

            The LeBron James Family Foundation, founded in 2004, at first gained local attention by giving away bikes and backpacks. Then it began looking at after-school programs, with students scattered across several dozen schools, and eventually created a public school currently serving about 575 third through eighth graders. Today the school includes a family resource center that provides a wide-range of services to parents, including mental health, financial literacy, legal aid and GED courses. 

            Just down the street from the school, the foundation provides rent-free housing to as many as 16 different families — when needed — and it has plans to build 50 units of affordable housing. 

            “I couldn’t have guessed how much it would grow,"" James said in late January. “But we got here by listening and responding to our community and what they need.”

            James has made over $400 million in NBA salary during his time with Cleveland, Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. Another $100 million is on the way in the next 2-1/2 years or so.

            James is a pitchman for Nike, GMC, AT&T and many more multinational companies. He owns a piece of the Boston Red Sox and Britain's Liverpool football club. His entertainment company, SpringHill — named after the modest apartment complex he grew up in — is valued at $725 million and has produced movies for HBO and Netflix.

            “He’s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven’t had the same advantages as others,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said in 2018, a sentiment he’s repeated many times since. “They see in this guy somebody who has consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace and gives them a voice and lets them know that you can speak about anything.”

            James puts so much focus on giving back to Akron because of the help people there gave to him and his family. “He’s never lost sight of that,” said Michele Campbell, the executive director of James' foundation. ""I think that keeps him grounded.”

            Just how down to earth “King James” really was got called into question in 2010. That's when he went on television to announce that he was leaving Cleveland to play in Miami. Billed as “The Decision” — and broadcast on ESPN — the live event was widely ripped as egotistical. But from James' perspective, the broadcast raised around $4 million for charity, a fact that was largely overlooked.

            Just a couple of years later, James would use his star power to help draw attention to a cause bigger than himself.

            In the aftermath of the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin — a Black Florida teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer — James tweeted a photo of Heat players wearing hoodies and bowing their heads that included the hashtag “WeWantJustice.""

            In 2020, James helped lead the “More Than A Vote"" movement, which included registration and early-vote drives and stressed the need for people — particularly Black voters — to get to the polls to fight disenfranchisement.

            Also in 2020, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, James was one of the players calling for an end to racial inequality and police brutality.

            “Everything I do,” James said late last year, “has to have a purpose.”

            James has all the money and all the fame that he ever wanted or needed. His NBA records, including the scoring title, are going to last for a very long time.

            As will his off-court endeavors.

            “His ability to help others and put others first is what makes him a great person,” Smiley said. “Not the baskets he shot.”

And he makes Smiley — one of the many people in Akron who have received financial support from his foundation — believe that she can be a success as well.“If I did not have the LeBron program, I probably wouldn’t have ever gone to college. I would be living in a not-so-positive environment,"" said the 19-year-old Smiley.“His ability to help people’s futures,"" she added, ""is what makes LeBron a great person.”James, who entered the NBA straight after high school in 2003, planned early on to use his talents, fame — and, yes, his growing financial resources — to have on impact on the world beyond basketball.“Even before I got into the NBA, I knew I wanted to find a way to give back to my community,” said James. Although James bounced from home to home during his childhood, and experienced financial insecurity for many of those years, he also was given enormous support from friends, neighbors and educators.The LeBron James Family Foundation, founded in 2004, at first gained local attention by giving away bikes and backpacks. Then it began looking at after-school programs, with students scattered across several dozen schools, and eventually created a public school currently serving about 575 third through eighth graders. Today the school includes a family resource center that provides a wide-range of services to parents, including mental health, financial literacy, legal aid and GED courses.Just down the street from the school, the foundation provides rent-free housing to as many as 16 different families — when needed — and it has plans to build 50 units of affordable housing.“I couldn’t have guessed how much it would grow,"" James said in late January. “But we got here by listening and responding to our community and what they need.”James has made over $400 million in NBA salary during his time with Cleveland, Miami and the Los Angeles Lakers. Another $100 million is on the way in the next 2-1/2 years or so.James is a pitchman for Nike, GMC, AT&T and many more multinational companies. He owns a piece of the Boston Red Sox and Britain's Liverpool football club. His entertainment company, SpringHill — named after the modest apartment complex he grew up in — is valued at $725 million and has produced movies for HBO and Netflix.“He’s been a brilliant example for millions of kids, especially kids with lesser opportunity and haven’t had the same advantages as others,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said in 2018, a sentiment he’s repeated many times since. “They see in this guy somebody who has consistently exhibited excellence in the workplace and gives them a voice and lets them know that you can speak about anything.”James puts so much focus on giving back to Akron because of the help people there gave to him and his family. “He’s never lost sight of that,” said Michele Campbell, the executive director of James' foundation. ""I think that keeps him grounded.”Just how down to earth “King James” really was got called into question in 2010. That's when he went on television to announce that he was leaving Cleveland to play in Miami. Billed as “The Decision” — and broadcast on ESPN — the live event was widely ripped as egotistical. But from James' perspective, the broadcast raised around $4 million for charity, a fact that was largely overlooked.Just a couple of years later, James would use his star power to help draw attention to a cause bigger than himself.In the aftermath of the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin — a Black Florida teen who was wearing a hoodie when he was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer — James tweeted a photo of Heat players wearing hoodies and bowing their heads that included the hashtag “WeWantJustice.""In 2020, James helped lead the “More Than A Vote"" movement, which included registration and early-vote drives and stressed the need for people — particularly Black voters — to get to the polls to fight disenfranchisement.Also in 2020, in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, James was one of the players calling for an end to racial inequality and police brutality.“Everything I do,” James said late last year, “has to have a purpose.”James has all the money and all the fame that he ever wanted or needed. His NBA records, including the scoring title, are going to last for a very long time.As will his off-court endeavors.“His ability to help others and put others first is what makes him a great person,” Smiley said. “Not the baskets he shot.”___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/09,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799270,Pakistani troops kill 2 militants in raid near Afghan border,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistani troops on Friday raided a militant hideout in a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban militant group, in the country's northwest and near the border with Afghanistan, the military said. The raid triggered a shootout that killed that killed two militants.

            The shootout in North Waziristan, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, came days after a suicide bomber attacked a mosque within a police and government compound in the city of Peshawar, the provincial capital, killing 101 people and wounding at least 225. The attack was one of the deadliest in years in the volatile region. 

            The military said the militants killed in the raid had been involved in past attacks on security forces, without providing details. Such raids, most often against the Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, are routine in the country's northwest.











            Late Friday, Pakistan’s army chief visited the bombed mosque in Peshawar and expressed solidarity with the local police force, thanking them for their contribution in the war against militants and lauding their bravery. 

            “We as a nation together will root out this menace of terrorism,"" Gen. Asim Munir said. 

            Also on Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif said he invited his predecessor and now opposition leader, Imran Khan, to talks next week about how the country should respond to the surge of violence. 

            Sharif's government has blamed the TTP for the Peshawar bombing on Monday, when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives inside the mosque in the police compound. Most of the casualties were police. The bomber wore a police uniform and the guards at the site assumed he was a police officer — their colleague — and did not search him, authorities said.

            The Pakistani Taliban are a separate group but are allies of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout. The Taliban takeover in Afghanistan has emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, who have stepped up attacks since November, when they ended a cease-fire with the government.

            There was no immediate response to Sharif's invitation for talks from Khan, who was ousted in a no-conference vote in Parliament in April last year. 

            During his term in office, Khan had approved peace talks with TTP and even released some of the group's members held in Pakistani jails in a gesture of goodwill. The talks, hosted by the Afghan Taliban, collapsed in November.

            On Friday, more than 2,000 supporters of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, rallied in Peshawar to denounce the surge in violence and demand peace. Similar rallies were also held elsewhere, organized by civil society groups.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799271,S. Korean court sentences ex-minister to 2 years in prison,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court on Friday sentenced a former justice minister, Cho Kuk, to two years in prison, after he was found guilty of creating fake credentials to help his children get into prestigious schools, a scandal that rocked the country’s previous government and sparked huge protests.

            Cho was also found guilty of abusing his powers while serving as a senior aide to former President Moon Jae-in, by blocking an investigation into a former Financial Services Commission official seen as close to Moon who was eventually arrested for taking bribes from businesspeople.

            But the Seoul Central District Court decided not to place Cho under immediate arrest, saying he wasn’t a threat to flee and that his wife was already serving a prison term over the charges related to their children. Cho told reporters after the ruling that he plans to appeal, and if he does within seven days he will stay out of prison until at least the appellate ruling.











            The ruling culminated the public demise of the former Seoul National University law professor and liberal icon, whose political rise during the Moon government had him considered as a future presidential contender.

            “I will appeal the charges that I was found guilty of and put up a more sincere argument (in court),” Cho told reporters after the ruling. He left without taking any questions.

            After initially serving as Moon’s senior secretary of civil affairs, Cho was appointed as justice minister in 2019 but was forced to resign months later after allegations emerged that he colluded with his wife to forge documents and certificates to help their daughter get into a medical school. The couple later faced similar accusations surrounding the education of their son.

            Cho apologized for the perks his daughter has received as he stepped down as justice minister but has steadfastly denied legal wrongdoing.

            The charges struck a nerve in a country grappling with widening rich-poor gaps and where teenagers toil in hyper-competitive school environments because graduating from elite universities is seen as crucial to career prospects.

            Cho’s legal saga also tarnished the reformist image of Moon, who vowed to restore faith in fairness and justice after winning a presidential by-election in 2017 to replace his conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and jailed for corruption.

            Cho’s wife, Chung Kyung-shim, had already been serving a four-year prison sentence before the Seoul court on Friday added another year to her term, after finding her guilty of additional charges related to her son and also for trying to conceal her dubious private equity investments after her husband joined Moon's government. 

            The court said it was clear Cho had an active role in colluding with his wife to fake the credentials of their daughter to help her get into the medical school of Seoul National University, the most coveted school in the nation.

            Cho's daughter didn't make it there but later got into Pusan National University's medical school in 2015. The PNU nullified her enrollment last year, saying it was based on false records.

            The court found Cho guilty of violating an anti-graft law governing public servants by receiving 6 million won ($4,800) in the form of her daughter’s scholarship from Roh Hwan-jung, former head of PNU’s medical school, from 2017 and 2018.

            However, the court said it couldn’t apply more serious bribery charges against Cho over the payments, saying it was unclear whether Roh had specifically sought favors related to Cho’s job as Moon’s senior civil affairs secretary. The court sentenced Roh to a sixth-month prison term that was suspended for a year.

            The court found Cho and another former Moon aide, Baek Won-woo, guilty of abusing authority by blocking a government inspection into former Financial Services Commission official Yoo Jae-soo, months before Yoo became vice mayor in Busan. 

            Yoo, seen as a close ally to Moon, was later arrested for receiving bribes from businesspeople in exchange for favors during his time at the financial regulator. Baek was sentenced to 10 months in prison on Friday.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court on Friday sentenced a former justice minister, Cho Kuk, to two years in prison, after he was found guilty of creating fake credentials to help his children get into prestigious schools, a scandal that rocked the country’s previous government and sparked huge protests.Cho was also found guilty of abusing his powers while serving as a senior aide to former President Moon Jae-in, by blocking an investigation into a former Financial Services Commission official seen as close to Moon who was eventually arrested for taking bribes from businesspeople.But the Seoul Central District Court decided not to place Cho under immediate arrest, saying he wasn’t a threat to flee and that his wife was already serving a prison term over the charges related to their children.

Group tours between China and its two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau would resume, while the number of customs checkpoints open will return to pre-pandemic levels, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said in a statement on its website.
Even after China reopened its borders to the world on Jan. 8, a quota system and COVID testing requirement remained for travellers between the mainland and Hong Kong.
The three border checkpoints that have not yet reopened will do so from Feb. 6, Hong Kong's leader John Lee said at a press conference on Friday.
Hong Kong will also scrap a COVID vaccination requirement to enter Hong Kong for all arrivals, including non-Hong Kong residents, Lee added.
Searches on Chinese travel website Qunar for round trip air tickets to and from Hong Kong and the mainland increased seven-fold on Friday after China's announcement, data from state media China Transportation News showed.
China's announcement came a day after Hong Kong launched a promotion campaign including 500,000 free flights to lure back visitors, businesses and investors to the financial hub after more than three years of tough COVID curbs.
Hong Kong was largely sealed off behind closed borders for much of the past three years in a bid to ward off COVID, with mandatory quarantine of up to three weeks for people arriving as well as intensive testing and screening.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799313,Pope in South Sudan warns leaders as peace process stalls,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — Pope Francis, on a novel ecumenical peace mission to the world’s youngest country, warned South Sudan’s political leaders on Friday that history will judge them harshly if they continue to drag their feet implementing a 2018 peace accord.

            Accompanying him to the overwhelmingly Christian country were the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields. They hope to cast a spotlight on what Francis has called a “forgotten crisis.”

            South Sudan gained independence from the majority Muslim Sudan in 2011, but has been beset by civil war and conflict.











            Thousands of people ululated and sang in 96-degree Fahrenheit (35.5-degree Celsius) heat as President Salva Kiir greeted the religious leaders at the airport in the capital, Juba. Francis’ motorcade route was lined with Christians, Muslims, and traditional dancers waving Vatican, South Sudanese and British flags. 

            “The pope is closest to God,” said Poni Jadalla, 45, as she waited to welcome Francis on the first-ever papal visit to the country. “Let the pope give us peace so that this country can develop and no more bloodshed.”

            The Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian leaders have called for the country’s political leaders to put aside their differences and work for the good of their people.

            In his first address on South Sudanese soil, Francis addressed former rivals Kiir and deputy Riek Machar, who were gathered in the garden of the presidential palace.

            “Future generations will either venerate your names or cancel their memory, based on what you now do,” Francis said. “For just as the Nile leaves its sources to begin its course, so the course of history will leave behind the enemies of peace and bring renown to those who are true peacemakers.”

            Kiir, Machar and other opposition groups signed the peace agreement in 2018 ending five years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people. But the deal’s provisions, including the formation of a national unified army, remain largely unimplemented. The delays have forced the postponement of the country’s first presidential election for another two years.

            Meanwhile, clashes continue, including attacks this week in the south that killed 27 people. Combined with flooding last year, the number of internally displaced people has topped 2 million and the U.N. has warned that humanitarian needs are soaring. 

            Francis and Welby first announced plans to visit South Sudan in 2017, but security concerns repeatedly thwarted the trip. In an effort to move the process forward, Francis presided in 2019 over a joint prayer in the Vatican, and famously got down on hands and knees and kissed the feet of South Sudan’s rival leaders, begging them to make peace.

            “That gesture of humility did not go in vain,” Kiir, a Catholic, told Francis in welcoming him to Juba Friday. He recalled that at the time of that extraordinary gesture, Machar was living in exile, but that today the two of them “are seated here, working collectively to implement” the provisions of the accord.

            Calling Francis' visit ""historic,"" Kiir publicly committed to the government returning to talks, suspended last year, with opposition groups that didn’t sign the peace deal.

            In urging peace, Francis used the Italian exhortation “Basta!” (Enough!), saying: “Enough bloodshed. Enough conflicts. Enough violence and mutual recriminations about who is responsible for it. Enough leaving your people athirst for peace. Leave the time of war behind and let a time of peace dawn!”

            He called for an end to corruption, and for particular attention to be paid to women and to involving them in decision-making. “Anyone who commits an act of violence towards a woman commits it towards God,” Francis said. 

            The U.N. Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan has reported that “widespread rape” was being used as a weapon by armed groups across the country. It expressed shock at interviewees describing “staggeringly brutal and prolonged gang rapes perpetrated against them by multiple men, often while their husbands, parents or children were forced to watch, helpless to intervene.”

            Additionally, the United Nations warned in November that some 9.4 million people out of a population of 12.4 million would need humanitarian aid and protection this year, a half million more than in 2022. It cited violence, constraints on access by aid groups, and climate conditions including flooding and drought.

            At the same time, the U.N. has warned that funding for increased aid has dwindled, as donors redirect money to Ukraine and other crises.

            Welby acknowledged the donor fatigue and said international organizations were doing their best but meet “strong opposition” on the ground.

            ""When I remember the commitments made back in 2019, I am saddened that this is what I see and hear,"" he said in remarks to Kiir and Machar.

            The fighting that killed at least 27 people in Central Equatoria state’s Kajo-keji this week demonstrated the simmering violence in communities sometimes awash with arms and ethnic tensions in one of the world’s poorest countries. It pitted cattle herders against other residents, said county commissioner Phanuel Dumo.

            The South Sudan Red Cross said four of its volunteers were among the dead, “picked from their houses together with community members and callously killed.” It said others were taken from water-distribution points and “killed in groups.” South Sudan is one of the deadliest countries for aid workers.

            Human Rights Watch, for its part, urged Pope Francis and his fellow religious leaders to raise the issue of widespread impunity for abuses in South Sudan. It asked him to call for the immediate release of journalists with the state broadcaster who were detained last month in relation to a video of the 71-year-old president apparently urinating on himself, and for any charges against them to be dropped.

            Francis Wani, 30, who sat outside the airport gate on Friday waiting for Francis to arrive, said, “We have suffered so much in silence. Therefore we only need blessings and peace.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799314,"Indian tycoon Adani hit by more losses, calls for probe","NEW DELHI (AP) — Shares in troubled Adani Enterprises gyrated Friday, tumbling 30% and then rebounding after more than a week of heavy losses that have cost it tens of billions of dollars in market value.

            The company, the flagship of India’s second-largest conglomerate, canceled a share offering meant to raise $2.5 billion earlier this week after U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research issued a report accusing it of market manipulation and other fraudulent practices. Adani denies the allegations.

            Opposition lawmakers blocked Parliament proceedings for a second day Friday, chanting slogans and demanding a probe into the business dealings of coal tycoon Gautam Adani, who is said to enjoy close ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 











            ""We have no connection″ with the Adani controversy, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters outside Parliament on Friday.

            In an interview with CNN News 18, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman brushed off concerns that the losses would spook global investors and said India's financial market was “very well regulated.”

            “As a result, the investors' confidence which existed before shall continue even now,” she said, adding that the controversy wasn't “indicative of how well Indian financial markets are governed.”

            At least one prominent international investor, French oil giant TotalEnergies, defended its investments in Adani. TotalEnergies said Friday it has limited exposure to the current problems and has not re-evaluated its stakes in Adani businesses.

            The French company said it had carried out due diligence when it making $3.1 billion in investments in Adani, and that the entities TotalEnergies invested in “are managed in accordance with applicable regulations.”

            Amit Malviya, the governing Bharatiya Janata Party’s information and technology chief, said in a television interview that the opposition was using Adani’s crisis to target the Modi government over a private company's shares and their market movements. “Regulators are looking into” what happened, he said.

            The market watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, has not commented. The Economic Times newspaper reported, citing unnamed SEBI sources, that it had asked stock exchanges to check for any unusual activity in Adani stocks.

            Shares in Adani Enterprises fell as much as 30%, to 1,017 rupees ($12), on Friday. At the end of trading, the price had recovered to 1,531 rupees ($18.70) but was still down by 2%. The company's share price has plunged more than 50% since Hindenburg released its report last week, when it stood at 3,436 rupees ($41). Stock in six other Adani-listed companies was down 5% to 10% on Friday.

            So far there has been no indication that the company’s woes might threaten the wider financial sector in India. Its equities market is large enough to sustain the fallout at this moment, said Brian Freitas, a New Zealand-based analyst with Periscope Analytics who has researched the Adani Group. 

            “Adani stock forms a small part of the equities market and investor concerns right now are restricted to the company, not the whole system or market itself,” Freitas said. India's Nifty and Sensex indexes were both higher on Friday. 

            It could take time for problems to surface, Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a report. “From the macro perspective there are few signs of contagion,"" he said. “But it is too early to sound the all clear.""

            The S&P Dow Jones indices said Thursday it would remove Adani Enterprises from its sustainability indices beginning Tuesday, following a “media and stakeholder analysis triggered by allegations of stock manipulation and accounting fraud.” 

            That might dent the Adani Group's sustainability credentials and could affect investor sentiment, Freitas said. 

            Credit rating agency Fitch said there was no immediate impact on credit ratings for the Adani companies. 

            Gautam Adani, who made a vast fortune mining coal and trading before expanding into construction, power generation, manufacturing and media, was Asia's richest man and the world's third wealthiest before the troubles began with Hindenburg's report. 

            By Friday, his net worth had halved to $61 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, where he dropped to the 21st spot worldwide. 

            He has said little publicly since the troubles began, though in a video address after Adani Enterprises canceled its already fully subscribed share offering he promised to repay investors. The company has said it is reviewing its fundraising plans. 

            Hindenburg's report said it was betting against seven publicly listed Adani companies, judging them to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.” Other issues in the report included concerns over debt, alleged use of offshore shell companies to artificially raise share prices and past investigations into fraud. 

            Adani's speedy, debt-led expansion in recent years caused his net worth to shoot up nearly 2,000%. Even before last week, critics said his ascent was aided by his apparent close ties to Modi and his government. Analysts say he has been successful at aligning his priorities with those of the government by investing in key sectors, but point out that he also has major infrastructure projects in states that are ruled by opposition parties. 

            “The question now turns to the future of the Adani Group and how they will grow,” said Aveek Mitra, founder of Avekset Financial Advisory. 

            As a company heavily involved in infrastructure -- from airports and ports to highways -- it needs financing to grow in order to service its debt, which stands at $30 billion, out of which $9 billion is from Indian banks. 

            Adani may be able to sell some assets and continue its expansion, but at a much slower pace than earlier, Mitra said. 

            “Banks, financial institutions and investors will think five times before investing now,” he added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799315,Satellite photos: Damage at Iran military site hit by drone,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press on Friday showed damage done to what Iran describes as a military workshop targeted by Israeli drones, the latest such assault amid a shadow war between the two countries.

            While Iran has offered no explanation yet of what the workshop manufactured, the drone attack threatened to again raise tensions in the region. Already, worries have grown over Tehran enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels, with a top United Nations nuclear official warning the Islamic Republic had enough fuel to build “several” atomic bombs if it chooses. 

            Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose earlier tenure as premier saw escalating attacks targeting Iran, has returned to office and reiterated that he views Tehran as his country's top security threat. With State Department spokesperson Ned Price now declaring Iran has “killed” the opportunity to return to its nuclear deal with world powers, it remains unclear what diplomacy immediately could ease tensions between Tehran and the West.











            Cloudy weather had prevented satellite pictures of the site of the workshop since it came under attack by what Iran described as bomb-carrying quadcopters on the night of Jan. 28. Quadcopters, which get their name from having four rotors, typically operate from short ranges by remote control. 

            Video taken of the attack showed an explosion at the site after anti-aircraft fire targeted the drones, likely from one of the drones reaching the building's roof. Iran's military has claimed shooting down two other drones before they reached the site. 

            Images taken Thursday by Planet Labs PBC showed the workshop in Isfahan, a central Iranian city some 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Tehran. An AP analysis of the image, compared to earlier images of the workshop, showed damage to the structure's roof. That damage corresponded to footage aired by Iranian state television immediately after the attack that showed at least two holes in the building's roof. 

            The Iranian state TV footage, as well as satellite photos, suggest the building's roof also may have been built with so-called “slat armor.” The structure resembles a cage built around roofs or armored vehicles to stop direct detonation from rockets, missiles or bomb-carrying drones against a target. 

            Installation of such protection at the workshop suggests Iran believed it could be a drone target. 

            Iran’s Intelligence Ministry in July claimed to have broken up a plot to target sensitive sites around Isfahan. A segment aired on Iranian state TV in October included purported confessions by alleged members of Komala, a Kurdish opposition party that is exiled from Iran and now lives in Iraq, that they planned to target a military aerospace facility in Isfahan after being trained by Israel’s Mossad intelligence service.

            It remains unclear whether the military workshop targeted in the drone attack was that aerospace facility. Iran’s mission to the United Nations told the AP on Friday night that “technical information isn’t available” about the workshop.

            “All of Iran’s military and nuclear facilities are protected by air defense because they’ve always been under threat,” the mission added.

            The attack comes Iran’s theocratic government faces challenges both at home and abroad. Nationwide protests have shaken the country since the September death of Mahsa Amini, a Kurdish-Iranian woman detained by the country’s morality police. Its rial currency has plummeted to new lows against the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Iran continues to arm Russia with the bomb-carrying drone that Moscow uses in attacks in Ukraine on power plants and civilian targets.

            Israel is suspected of launching a series of attacks on Iran, including an April 2021 assault on its underground Natanz nuclear facility that damaged its centrifuges. In 2020, Iran blamed Israel for a sophisticated attack that killed its top military nuclear scientist.

            Israel has not commented on this drone attack. However, Israeli officials rarely acknowledge operations carried out by the country’s secret military units or the Mossad.

            
                A letter published Thursday by Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani, said that “early investigations suggest that the Israeli regime was responsible for this attempted act of aggression."" The letter, however, did not elaborate on what evidence supported Iran’s suspicion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799351,Dutch slavery exhibition to open at UN headquarters,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A landmark exhibition on slavery in the Dutch colonial era that was first staged at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum is going on display at the United Nations in New York.

            The show, titled “Slavery. Ten True Stories of Dutch Colonial Slavery,” will open in the the U.N. headquarters' visitors' lobby from Feb. 27-March 30, as part of a U.N. outreach program on the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the Rijksmuseum announced Friday. 

            “Recognizing the continuing impact of slavery on world history is of great importance. We are very grateful to the United Nations for drawing attention to this important subject through the exhibition,” Rijksmuseum General Director Taco Dibbits said in a statement.











            The exhibition at the U.N. is an adapted version of the show titled “Slavery” that was opened in 2021 at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and told the story of slavery by drilling down into the personal stories of 10 people, ranging from enslaved workers to a wealthy Amsterdam woman.

            The unflinching exhibition looks at the lives of people who were enslaved, those who profited from the inhumane trade and people who opposed it in the Dutch colonial era, from the 17th to the 19th century — in Brazil, Suriname and the Caribbean, as well as in South Africa, Asia and the Netherlands.

            The Rijksmuseum show tapped into a national debate about slavery that gained momentum amid the Black Lives Matter movement that swept the world after the 2020 death of Black man George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. In December, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized for the Dutch state's role in slavery.

            The grim centerpiece of the U.N. slavery exhibition will be a set of wooden stocks known as a tronco, derived from the Portuguese word for tree trunk, in which several enslaved people could be constrained by clamping their ankles.THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A landmark exhibition on slavery in the Dutch colonial era that was first staged at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum is going on display at the United Nations in New York.The show, titled “Slavery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799352,Dementia patient found alive with 3 dead family members in New Taipei,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Police discovered a troubling scene when they found three members of a family dead inside an apartment in New Taipei’s Zhonghe District, on Friday (Feb. 3).The borough chief and local police went to check on the family in the afternoon. After knocking and receiving no response, officers broke down the door to enter the apartment.Inside, they found the dead bodies of the mother, aged 81, and her two sons, aged 54 and 53. A fourth member of the family, the 83-year-old father, surnamed Yang (楊), was found alive in one of the apartment rooms, reported UDN.It is understood the father suffers from severe dementia, and the three men of the family were all dependent on the elderly mother, surnamed Chen (陳).Chen was often seen by neighbors going out to purchase groceries and other items. When neighbors realized they had not seen her or her sons since before the holidays, they began to worry and one of them contacted the local borough chief.Based on the condition of the mother’s body, investigators believe the mother died no less than three months prior to being found on Friday. The two sons were found in the living room, one lying on the sofa and another on the floor. Their bodies also showed signs of decomposition, but not to the extent of the mother’s.It is estimated the eldest son died around early January, and the youngest son died around two weeks before being found, which would have been at the start of the Lunar New Year holidays.Circumstances of the deaths are being investigated, but reports suggest the family members died of an unnamed illness. The New Taipei Social Welfare Department is taking care of the elderly father. A daughter of the family is also reportedly alive and has been contacted to manage the family’s affairs.",2023/02/03,5548,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799353,YouTuber shares encounter with Taiwan police over public handcuff use,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan-based Youtuber Hailey on Saturday (Jan. 28) shared in a video her family’s encounter with the Taiwan police over the use of handcuffs in public.In the video, Hailey, her husband Adam, and her brother Peyton reviewed their journey across Taiwan and highlighted memorable foods, attractions, and experiences. When discussing their most memorable conversation, they said it was one that they had with police officers while trying to film a “24-hour handcuff challenge,” a popular trend in the U.S. where people are handcuffed together for a day.Prior to doing the challenge, Hailey had discussed the idea with her agent and collaborators. “No one thought anything of it,” she said.Hailey added that she did not want to use toy handcuffs that were unlockable at the press of a button because it would provide an easy way for her brother to get out of the challenge. In the U.S., she said, “everyone” uses handcuffs requiring keys to open, which are usually available at stores and online for purchase.In the footage, the three handcuffed themselves together, got ready, and went out. They got through breakfast and even spent some time at a park before a police officer stopped them on their way to take the metro.“You can’t use these in Taiwan,” the officer can be heard saying. “They need to be confiscated … These are illegal in Taiwan.”Hailey repeatedly apologized, saying, “I’m sorry, we didn’t know.”Peyton, who did not have his passport on him, was escorted back to his hotel to retrieve it by three officers. “They wanted to know that we didn’t handcuff you,” she told him.Despite Hailey’s distress, which she said drove her to tears, Adam commended the officers for their professionalism: “They didn’t really escalate the situation, they were chill. They made it clear that they weren’t going to do anything more than just confiscating (the handcuffs), but in the end they didn’t confiscate them, they said just don’t wear these outside, in public.” He said the officers were surprised that they were able to get the handcuffs past customs.Hailey admitted in retrospect that the challenge had not been a good idea and added, “Thank you to the Taiwanese cops for pulling us over and stopping us from doing that.”In a statement, the Taipei police said handcuffs are a type of controlled item that cannot be made, sold, or owned without authorization from the Ministry of the Interior per the Act Governing the Use of Police Weapons. Most Taiwanese netizens who commented on Hailey’s video were not aware of the fact, either, and they thanked her for sharing the valuable lesson.Hailey Jane Richards lives in Taiwan with her husband, Adam Richards. Her YouTube channel focuses on her life in Taiwan, as well as cultural differences between Taiwan and the U.S.With over 1.48 million subscribers, Hailey is one of the most popular YouTubers in Taiwan.",2023/02/03,3117,Culture

The November figure was the lowest level recorded in almost four years.The NDC noted that trade, manufacturing, finance, and general economic confidence were staying weak, while domestic consumption was expected to remain stable, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. The retail and restaurant sectors were the only ones showing expansion last December.Global inflation and the pressure to raise interest rates meant that demand in major markets was weak, leading to the possibility of low exports for the near future, according to the NDC.",2023/02/03,951,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799372,EU prepares more Russia sanctions; Kremlin readies offensive,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The European Union will unveil its 10th package of sanctions against Russia on Feb. 24 to mark the anniversary of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a senior official from the bloc said in Kyiv on Friday, as Ukrainian forces gird for an expected Russian offensive in the coming weeks.

            The sanctions will target technology used by Russia’s war machine, among other things, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference.

            The sanctions will take aim in particular at components used in the manufacturing of drones, she said, naming Iran as a key supplier of Russia.











            Closing loopholes that the Kremlin uses to circumvent sanctions will also be a priority, according to Von der Leyen, who was on her fourth visit to the Ukrainian capital since the war began.

            The exact measures in the next EU sanctions package must be agreed upon by the bloc’s 27 member countries — a process that can take weeks.

            Top EU officials met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a show of support for the country as it battles to counter the Kremlin's forces and strives to join the EU as well as NATO.

            The last such summit was held in Kyiv in October 2021 — a few months before the war started. The highly symbolic visit is also the first EU political mission of its kind to a country at war.

            The high-level meeting came as a 60-year-old man was killed and six others were wounded Friday when Russian missiles hit central Toretsk, in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the local prosecutor’s office said in a statement on Facebook.

            Ukrainian authorities reported Friday that at least six civilians were killed and 20 others were wounded over the previous 24 hours.

            Among the dead were two brothers, ages 49 and 42, killed when Russian shelling destroyed an apartment building in the northeastern Kharkiv region, Ukraine’s presidential office said. Their 70-year-old father was hospitalized with injuries.

            Also, six people were wounded and 18 apartment buildings, two hospitals and a school were damaged in a Russian attack in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Thursday, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko told Ukrainian TV. Four people died when a Russian missile hit an apartment building in that city on Wednesday.

            European officials were adamant about continuing to support Ukraine militarily and economically, but they didn't provide any new details about Ukraine’s accession path to the EU. 

            Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s goal ""is to start negotiations this year.” But the process will likely take years and require the adoption of far-reaching reforms, including a clampdown on endemic corruption as the country receives billions of dollars in aid. Kyiv formally submitted its application last June.

            Zelenskyy said progress had been made to further integrate Ukraine economically into the EU across several sectors, including agriculture, industry, energy and customs.

            Ukraine’s government is keen to get more Western military aid, on top of the tanks pledged last week, as the warring sides are expected to launch new offensives once winter ends. Kyiv has pushed the West to provide fighter jets and long-range missiles.

            The U.S announced Friday it will send longer-range bombs to Ukraine, along with air defense systems and other weapons and ammunition as part of a new $2.17 billion aid package. The rocket-propelled, GPS-guided, ground-launched, small-diameter bombs (GLSDB) are fired from HIMARS rocket launchers and glide to targets up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) away, twice as far as the previously supplied U.S. rockets for HIMARS systems could reach.

            Pentagon Press Secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder noted that the bombs will give the Ukrainian armed forces a longer range capability and enable them to “conduct operations in defense of their country and to take back their sovereign territory.”

            Asked to comment on the U.S. move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov pointed to Thursday's statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who likened the Russian action in Ukraine to fighting the Nazis in World War II and issued an ominous warning to the West for announcing new weapons shipments.

            “Those who hope to defeat Russia on the battlefield apparently fail to understand that a modern war against Russia will be a completely different war for them,” Putin said. ""We do not send our tanks to their borders, but we have something to respond with, and it is not limited to the use of armour.""

            France and Italy also agreed Friday to supply Ukraine with a SAMP/T-MAMBA air-defense system, which French officials call the European equivalent of the Patriot system that the U.S. has given Ukraine. The missile battery is slated for delivery this spring.

            Kyiv’s forces “have a chance” of beating back an expected Russian offensive in eastern Ukraine if supplied with the right Western weapons, Zelenskyy said.

            “Our task is not to give them (an) opportunity (for revenge) until our army is strengthened with appropriate weapons. I think we have a chance,” Zelenskyy added.

            Officials in the eastern Luhansk region said Russian forces have disabled mobile internet connections, stepped up shelling and deployed more troops in preparation for an offensive.

            EU assistance for Ukraine has reached almost 50 billion euros ($55 billion) since the fighting started, according to officials from the bloc.

            The EU is providing Ukraine with financial and humanitarian aid, and announced it is ramping up its military training mission, from an initial target of pushing 15,000 troops through the schooling to up to 30,000 troops. One focus is to train the crews of tanks that Western countries have offered Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799398,Turkey says West failed to share details of security threat,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey for a second day on Friday railed against a group of Western countries that temporarily shut their consulates in Istanbul, accusing them of failing to share information on the security threat that led to the closures and of aiming to cause harm to Turkey.

            This week, nine Western nations either closed down their consulates in Istanbul or issued travel warnings to citizens visiting Turkey, citing security threats. The measures angered Turkey, which on Thursday summoned the countries’ ambassadors in protest. Turkey’s interior minister accused the countries of waging “psychological warfare” and attempting to wreck Turkey’s tourism industry. 

            Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu insisted that the nine countries did not share information with Turkish authorities about the alleged security threat. His ministry has identified the nine countries as the United States, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Britain, Germany, Belgium, France and Italy.











            “They tell us that they have concrete information that there is a threat. ... But where did it come from, where is the threat, who will carry it out? There is no information about that,” Cavusoglu said during a joint news conference with his Argentinian counterpart. 

            “We asked our Interior Ministry. They say there is no concrete sharing of information. ... We asked our intelligence agency. There is no concrete sharing of information.”

            The minister also said Turkey suspects an “ulterior motive” behind the closures, including alleged intent to hurt President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections that are likely to be held on May 14.

            “If they are trying to create the image that Turkey is unstable and that there is a threat of terrorism, this does not fit friendship or the spirit of alliance, he said. “This is especially true before the elections. If they are trying to put the (ruling party) government, the Presidential government, in a difficult situation, our people know very well what is behind it. ... It won’t serve their purpose.”

            The German Embassy this week cited the risk of possible retaliatory attacks following Quran-burning incidents in some European countries in announcing the closure of its consulate. The U.S. embassy cautioned its citizens about possible attacks against churches, synagogues and diplomatic missions as well as other places that Westerners frequent. 

            In November, a bombing on Istanbul’s bustling Istiklal Avenue, located in the heart of the city and near a number of foreign consulates, killed six people and wounded several others. Turkish authorities blamed the attack on Kurdish militants. 

            Radical Islamic groups and leftist militants have also carried out deadly attacks in Turkey the past.

            Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Thursday that Turkey had conducted as many as 60 operations against the Islamic State group so far this year and detained 95 people. Last year, close to 2,000 IS suspects were detained in more than 1,000 operations against the group, he said.

            Last weekend, Turkey’s foreign ministry issued a travel warning for European countries due to anti-Turkish demonstrations and what it described as Islamophobia. The warning followed demonstrations the week before outside the Turkish Embassy in Sweden, where an anti-Islam activist burned the Quran and pro-Kurdish groups protested against Turkey.ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkey for a second day on Friday railed against a group of Western countries that temporarily shut their consulates in Istanbul, accusing them of failing to share information on the security threat that led to the closures and of aiming to cause harm to Turkey.This week, nine Western nations either closed down their consulates in Istanbul or issued travel warnings to citizens visiting Turkey, citing security threats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799428,Companies pledge millions in fed effort to stem road deaths,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 50 businesses and nonprofits — including rideshare companies Uber and Lyft, industrial giant 3M and automaker Honda — are pledging millions of dollars in initiatives to stem a crisis in road fatalities under a new federal effort announced Friday.

            It's part of the Department of Transportation's “Call to Action” campaign, which urges commitments from the private sector, trade groups and health and safety organizations to reduce serious traffic injuries and deaths. 

            Traffic fatalities are near historic highs after a surge of dangerous driving during the coronavirus pandemic.











            The public-private effort, unveiled Friday as part of the department's multiyear strategy started last year to make roads safer, ranges from investments to improve school crosswalks to enhanced seat belt alerts in Uber vehicles and a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to promote proven injury prevention strategies, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told The Associated Press. 

            It comes on the heels of the award of 510 transportation grants this week totaling more than $800 million under the bipartisan infrastructure law to states and localities that, for the first time, focus on road safety such as by adding bike lanes, lighting, protected left turns and sidewalks.

            After a record spike in 2021, the number of U.S. traffic deaths dipped slightly during the first nine months of 2022, but pedestrian and cyclist deaths continued to rise. More than 40,000 people are killed in road crashes a year. 

            “It's still a crisis,” Buttigieg said, stressing a need for a national change in mindset. “We’re looking at road deaths coming in year after year in a similar proportion to gun deaths. The problem is they’re so widespread and so common that I fear as a country we’ve gotten used to it and perhaps fallen into the mistaken sense they’re inevitable.” 

            “We can’t solve any of this on our own,” he added. “We also know there isn’t one piece that will get this all down. But if we add all this together it can be enormous.” 

            Road travelers will see an array of safety measures this year. Uber told the AP that it is donating $500,000 — its single biggest investment in its effort to reduce drunken driving — for free and discounted rides in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Texas as part of the “Decide to Ride” program run in tandem with MADD and Anheuser-Busch. 

            The world's largest ride-share company also said it was doubling the availability of its bike lane alerts this month from 71 cities to 144 for passengers exiting vehicles near cycling routes and providing a safety checklist for Uber Eats bicycle couriers. It also pledged to strengthen its seat belt alerts, such as by increasing their frequency or adding an audio message along with pop-up messages urging riders to “buckle up.” 

            “We were thinking about how we could make an impact more broadly — how we can get people to start making better choices,” said Kristin Smith, head of Uber's road safety policy. “We know it's going to take a broad coalition of people to be tackling the crisis on U.S. roadways right now.” 

            Uber's investment comes along with separate commitments from Lyft, the second-largest rideshare company, which has partnered with the Governors Highway Safety Association in recent years to award tens of thousands of dollars in state grants to help reduce impaired driving and curtail speeding.

            3M, the maker of Post-it Notes, industrial coatings and ceramics, told the AP it was continuing its partnership with state transportation agencies to identify the best technology to make road signs and lane markings more visible and reflective. 

            It's already pledged to improve 100 school crossing zones and added to that a commitment of $250,000 this year for a new transportation equity initiative that will fund half a dozen major projects in underserved areas. The company cited as an example its partnership with nonprofit groups to help build out Providence, Rhode Island's, Hope Street Urban Trail last year, featuring new bike and pedestrian lanes connecting the neighborhood to schools and the commercial district. 

            Dan Chen, president of 3M's Transportation Safety Division, praised the federal government's call for action as the “right approach” that will allow companies like 3M to work in sync with policymakers and other stakeholders “to make roads safer for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists.” 

            Other businesses and groups joining the effort include American Honda Motor Co., which pledged continuing investments totaling $2 million to improve teen driver safety; UPS, which will install automatic emergency braking on its newer big delivery vehicles; and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group, which will step up its push for industry adoption of safety technologies such as auto high beam. 

            The Transportation Department said it was issuing an open call for pledges, and more companies were expected to join in the coming weeks.

            Buttigieg, noting the need for a sustained, multiyear effort to substantially reduce traffic fatalities, emphasized the opportunities as well with President Joe Biden's five-year $1 trillion infrastructure law and said much more work remained to rebuild public works and improve people's livelihoods.

            “I definitely have four years’ worth of items and then some,” he said, speaking of his job as transportation secretary.WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 50 businesses and nonprofits — including rideshare companies Uber and Lyft, industrial giant 3M and automaker Honda — are pledging millions of dollars in initiatives to stem a crisis in road fatalities under a new federal effort announced Friday.It's part of the Department of Transportation's “Call to Action” campaign, which urges commitments from the private sector, trade groups and health and safety organizations to reduce serious traffic injuries and deaths.Traffic fatalities are near historic highs after a surge of dangerous driving during the coronavirus pandemic.The public-private effort, unveiled Friday as part of the department's multiyear strategy started last year to make roads safer, ranges from investments to improve school crosswalks to enhanced seat belt alerts in Uber vehicles and a partnership between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to promote proven injury prevention strategies, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told The Associated Press.It comes on the heels of the award of 510 transportation grants this week totaling more than $800 million under the bipartisan infrastructure law to states and localities that, for the first time, focus on road safety such as by adding bike lanes, lighting, protected left turns and sidewalks.After a record spike in 2021, the number of U.S. traffic deaths dipped slightly during the first nine months of 2022, but pedestrian and cyclist deaths continued to rise.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799429,Sweden hits out at ‘disinformation’ on child kidnappings,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish government again sought Friday to discredit claims that Swedish social service agencies kidnap Muslim children, saying Sweden was again seeing a “systematized” and “extensive” disinformation campaign. 

            ""This campaign has now gained momentum again,” said Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. 

            “This is false. This is not true. Sweden does not kidnap children. The social services do not kidnap children,” Kristersson told a press conference. ”Neither Muslim nor other children.""











            He said that social workers and other employees are being ""exposed on social media and are being threatened.” 

            He said the government will post guards inside social services offices and will earmark more funds to the Swedish Psychological Defense Agency, which was established to counter misinformation, to help it tackle the “systematized” campaign against Sweden."" He didn't say how much money would be given to the agency. 

            The statement came at time of tensions with mostly Muslim Turkey over the applications of Sweden and Finland to become NATO members.

            Turkey is angry that Sweden has allowed anti-Turkish protests to take place, and particularly that it has not prevented an anti-Muslim activist from repeatedly burning the Quran, the Muslim holy book. It also thinks that Sweden is not doing enough to counter Kurdish activists that it considers terrorists. Unless its demands are met, it says it won't approve Sweden's NATO application, which must be accepted by all of the miliary alliance's 30 members.

            Kristersson said the disinformation campaign over child kidnappings started in 2021. The Psychological Defense Agency said last year that the allegations could be traced to an Arabic-language site whose creator expressed support for the Islamic State group.

            In February 2022, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said that “all children in Sweden are protected and cared for equally under Swedish legislation” and that social workers need a court order to remove children from their parents without consent.STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish government again sought Friday to discredit claims that Swedish social service agencies kidnap Muslim children, saying Sweden was again seeing a “systematized” and “extensive” disinformation campaign.""This campaign has now gained momentum again,” said Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.“This is false.

The Psychological Defense Agency said last year that the allegations could be traced to an Arabic-language site whose creator expressed support for the Islamic State group.In February 2022, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said that “all children in Sweden are protected and cared for equally under Swedish legislation” and that social workers need a court order to remove children from their parents without consent.",2023/02/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799450,Polish sports minister: 40 countries could boycott the 2024 Olympics,"As the European Union (EU) and Ukraine hold their first summit since the start of the Russian invasion, opposition to plans to reintegrate athletes from Russia and Belarus into the sports world is growing.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that it wanted to ""explore a pathway"" to allow Russian and Belarussian athletes to compete at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris under a neutral flag. The statement said that ""no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport,"" but it's a decision that may not be without consequence, with Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia rejecting the proposal in a joint-statement.""We condemn the IOC's efforts to bring athletes from the aggressor states of Russia and Belarus back into international competitions,"" the statement read. ""These efforts under the veil of neutrality legitimize the political decisions and widespread propaganda of these two countries, including through sport, as a distraction from the illegal aggression against Ukraine.""In a later appearance on Polish state television, sports and tourism minister Kamil Bortniczuk claimed that up to 40 countries could support a block on the IOC's plans before a meeting on February 10, saying:""I think, that in the coming week, 40 countries will take a very firm and very clear stand against the inclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the Olympics. Considering this I don't think we will face tough decisions before the Olympics and, if we were to boycott the Games, the coalition we will be a part of will be broad enough to make holding the Games pointless.""The IOC said on Thursday that any boycott would only ""punish athletes,"" but Ukraine sports minister Vadym Guttsait stressed that all efforts must be made to make sure Russia and Belarus are not represented in any way at the showpiece event in Paris.""For the whole Ukrainian sports community, this is a question of principle,"" Guttsait wrote on his Facebook page. ""Part of the International Federations are outraged by the IOC's efforts to promote the return of Russians and Belarusians. We have addressed and will address all international organizations that can influence the situation and whose opinions the IOC members can listen to.""Our position is unchanged: as long as there is a war in Ukraine, Russian and Belarusian athletes should not be in international competitions. Certainly, our national sporting federations need to strengthen communication with international federations to keep the ban in effect. If we are not heard, I do not rule out the possibility that we will boycott and refuse participation in the Olympics.""Speaking to DW, former Russian world number one tennis player Yevgeny Kafelnikov said he was in favor of allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at the Olympics, saying it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many and that they are simply unable to speak out against the current situation.""An athlete's career is not as long as that of those politicians declaring that they should not be allowed to compete under a neutral flag. They do not understand that, for many athletes, this may be the only chance in their lives to compete at the Games,"" said the 48-year-old, who won 26 singles titles, including the French Open in 1996 and the Australian Open in 1999.""I understand the situation and I think we are all against what is happening now,"" he continued. ""Any normal sane person understands that this complete nightmare must be ended. But the athletes who are now in our country cannot openly speak like that. Because it has consequences. And you don't have to be an Einstein to understand this.""The IOC and president Thomas Bach have referred to a resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 1, 2022, which recognized that ""major international sporting events should be organized in a spirit of peace, mutual understanding and international cooperation, friendship and tolerance, and without discrimination of any kind.""This resolution was adopted by consensus of all UN member states, including the governments of Ukraine and Russia. As a result, the IOC did receive backing from the UN as a press release urged them to ""ensure non-discrimination against athletes on the basis of their nationality.""The IOC also said that a ""large majority of participants"" in consultations with federations and athletes' representatives had spoken out in favor of such a step. The German Olympic Sports Federation (DOSB) have said they can imagine the reitegration of athletes from Belarus and Russia, but ""only under strict conditions.""For German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD), however, the IOC proposal is the ""completely wrong way"" to go about an issue that is likely to be ongoing until the Games start in July 2024.jt/mf (dpa, SID)",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799451,Hindenburg: the short-seller taking on India's Gautam Adani,"It could become a financial fraud scandal unlike any other. Hindenburg Research, a less than 5-year-old small trading and financial research firm based on Wall Street in New York, accuses the Indian industrial conglomerate of billionaire Gautam Adani of nothing less than the ""greatest fraud in economic history.""Hindenburg claims it has found evidence of ""brazen stock manipulation"" and financial fraud at Adani Group.The Indian conglomerate owns half a dozen major companies with interests ranging from energy to transportation and infrastructure development. At the same time, it's India's largest port operator and manages some of the country's biggest airports. The group's listed trading house, Adani Enterprises, reported $9.3 billion (€8.5 billion) in sales in the fiscal year 2022, which ended in March.In January, Hindenburg founder and chairman Nathan Anderson issued a 100-page report accusing Adani of using a web of companies in tax havens such as Mauritius and the Bahamas to inflate revenue and stock prices. The report also said family members were installed in top positions and that the Group falsified balance sheets to cover up debts, pumping up Adani shares by a staggering 85% in recent years.Since the release of the report, Gautam Adani's personal net worth has shrunk by over $50 billion. The man who last year was considered wealthier than Bill Gates and veteran investor Warren Buffet has now slipped to 15th place on Forbes Magazine's List of Billionaires.Nathan Anderson graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in international business. After that, he did a brief stint as an ambulance driver in Israel. Then, he started his career in finance at data company FactSet Research Systems, where he worked with investment management companies.""I realized they were doing a lot of run-of-the-mill analysis, there was a lot of conformity,"" he had told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) in 2020.In 2010, he left FactSet to develop his own money investment strategies for so-called boutique investment houses — those focused on a specific segment, such as corporate finance and wealthy families. It wasn't until 2017 that he founded Hindenburg Research.His great role model is Harry Markopolos, a securities manager who is considered one of the most successful US investigators in financial fraud. Makropolos made a name for himself with his research on Bernie Madoff, whose investment firm turned out to be a Ponzi scheme in 2008, marking the biggest fraud in US history to this day.On its website, Hindenburg says it looks for accounting irregularities, mismanagement and undisclosed related-party transactions. The firm invests its own capital to shorten the stocks of companies it finds indulging in any wrongdoing.Anderson already has an impressive track record of exposing supposedly successful firms. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he sounded the alarm when a wave of startups went public through so-called SPAC stock market vehicles and quickly posted massive gains. Hindenburg's research revealed that many of these companies not only failed to turn a profit but often didn't even have viable business models to show for, despite billions in stock market value.The company now employs about ten people, including former journalists and financial analysts. In recent years, they have published dozens of investigative reports targeting companies such as bitcoin-mining company Riot Blockchain and gold producer Pershing Gold. In at least 16 cases, the company says on its website, its findings led to regulatory investigations and criminal charges.Hindenburg is best known for its bet against electric-truck maker Nikola in September 2020, when it accused company founder and former chairman Trevor Milton of deceiving investors about its hydrogen-powered truck technology. Anderson challenged a video Nikola produced showing its electric truck cruising at high speed — when in fact, the vehicle was simply rolled down a hill. Ten months later, Milton was indicted by New York federal prosecutors on four counts of securities fraud. Nikola's stock collapsed by 94%.Another target of Anderson was US electric-car maker Lordstown Motors, which he accused in a 2021 report of inflating orders and whitewashing its production schedule.The research firm's name, Hindenburg, derives from the German airship that exploded in New Jersey in 1937, killing 36 passengers. ""We view the Hindenburg as the epitome of a man-made, completely preventable disaster,"" the company's website says, adding: ""We look for similar man-made disasters circulating in the marketplace and try to clear them up before they attract more unsuspecting victims.""Anderson now smells such fraud at the Adani Group, causing the Indian company's stock to bleed heavily in recent days, despite a 413-page response issued by Adani. The Indian industry mogul has rejected the accusations as unfounded, unmotivated and even as an attack on India in general.Meanwhile, Hindenburg has cashed in on shortening the Adani stock — a financial strategy that short-sellers claim serves an important watchdog function. As a matter of fact, so-called financial forensic research is needed to uncover financial fraud, or hidden market distortions, that could throw entire economies into crisis.Anderson defended his allegations in a statement on Twitter.Research done by financial-market data provider Refinitiv seems to prove Nathan Anderson right. Hardly any of the companies he targeted in the past two years has recovered after an attack, while only three companies returned to positive stock returns. Twelve other companies are still struggling, with losses in their market value of between 19% and 99%.Other data provided by the S3 Partners financial marketplace shows short sellers made $300 billion in profits last year alone.Whether Gautam Adani will recover from the scandal is far from clear.Hindenburg, which has gained massive financial firepower from shortening the Adani stock, said it stands by the published report and would ""welcome"" litigation.Even though Adani has called off a planned $2.5 billion stock offering in light of the attack, he seems determined to take the legal route.This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799452,Kanjuruhan Tragedy: Indonesian football four months on,"Four months ago, Indonesia suffered the most-deadly football stadium tragedy in the country's history after a police response to a pitch invasion during a match between Arema Maland and Persebaya Surabayaat the Kanjuruhan Stadium led to mass panic, stampedes and crushes which caused at least 135 fatalities.However, while many of the victims' families from the October 2022 tragedy are still fighting for justice for their loved ones, Indonesian football is now preparing to host the upcoming U20 World Cup in May, having been handed hosting duties for this year's tournament following the postponement of the 2021 edition due to the pandemic.Though the prestige of hosting one of FIFA's flagship tournaments holds much meaning for the country, it is a difficult pill to swallow for the families struggling to come to terms with the Kanjuruhan Tragedy.Aremania, an Arema supporter group, remain steadfast in their calls for justice by protesting often and taking collective action to give voice to their #UsutTuntasTragediKanjuruhan (""Investigate the Kanjuruhan Tragedy"") campaign.Febri Wibowo, an Aremania member, who is still in touch with the families of the victims, expressed his deep disappointment to DW. ""We don't believe anything anymore,"" he said.Following the Kanjuruhan Tragedy, competition in Indonesia's top three leagues was put on hold by the Indonesian Football Association (PSSI). Play resumed on December 5 behind closed doors.Yet, with the consultation of the PSSI, league operators and the police, a restricted number of fans were allowed to attend one of the most heated matches in the country, Persib Bandung vs Persija Jakarta, on January 11.The return of football against the backdrop of ongoing legal proceedings is a challenge, especially following a comment from a representative of the PSSI seeming to claim that Indonesian football fans were ""less educated.""Firzie Idris, an Indonesian sports journalist, who has been following the legal case since October, observed that the progress of the trial has not run optimally. ""Right now justice is proceeding very slowly and it seems that it is not being given enough priority from the government and the authorities,"" he told DW.The PSSI's decision to resume footballing operations across the top three leagues was partially tied to the U20 World Cup as, alongside agreements with various parties to complete the league, all footballing events are required to be completed before the FIFA tournament takes place.Aside from being the biggest footballing event the country has held, it is also the first time Indonesia has participated in a World Cup at any age group since the country gained independence in 1945.Hasani Abdulgani, a member of the PSSI Executive Committee, believes that Indonesian football is currently improving after the Kanjuruhan Tragedy.""First, I again apologize to the victim's families,"" he told DW. ""Of course, we wouldn't want there to be victims first to make Indonesian football better. However, we feel that the Kanjuruhan Tragedy was a very important wake-up call for Indonesian football to become better.""""We're improving. Especially in terms of security and standardization across stadiums. Security protocols are now in the hands of the stewards in the stadium, which is according to FIFA regulations, and no longer to the police as before.""Under the direct supervision of FIFA, infrastructure to support the tournament continues to be prepared and efforts are being finalizing in how security will be handled.FIFA has further agreed to oversee a change to the management structure within the PSSI, approving an Extraordinary Congress for the association on February 16.Current chairman Mochamad Iriawan told a press conference in January that, although he was not resigning, he would not be running for the General Chair of the PSSI for the 2023-2027 period.Erick Thohir, the former president of Italian club Inter Milan and Indonesia's current Minister of State Owned Enterprises is in the running for the position while former Indonesian players Bambang Pamungkas and Ponaryo Astaman are seeking to be named the vice-chairman.Local journalist Idris believes this will be an important step in ensuring real change following Kanjuruhan Tragedy.""Whoever the chairperson will be, their main priority is to put pressure on the government,"" he explained. ""And on the judicial system to uphold a judicial process that is as transparent and fair as possible for the victims of Kanjuruhan.""After that, then we can discuss and fix other things such as development, chaotic competition, and an underachieving national team.""For the families that lost loved ones in October, the wheels of justice continue to turn far too slowly.Additional reporting by Bergas Brillianto.Edited by: Matthew Ford",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799453,Ukraine updates: Germany approves export of Leopard 1 tanks,"The German government has granted an export license for delivery of older Leopard 1 main  battle tanks to Ukraine, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit confirmed in Berlin on Friday, without giving any further details.The Süddeutsche Zeitung was the first to report the news in its Friday edition. Deliveries of the tanks from the industrial stocks could be made as soon as the tanks are repaired, the newspaper said.However, according to the report, there are still problems in obtaining the required 105-millimeter ammunition. Although Brazil has large stocks of the ammunition, the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has so far refused to pass it on to Ukraine.The German government had already decided to send 14 more modern Leopard 2 main battle tanks from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine.Here are other updates on the war in Ukraine on Friday, February 3:The European Union sent 35 million energy-saving LED lamps to Ukraine, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on Twitter from the sidelines of a summit meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Ukrainians could exchange their old bulbs for LED bulbs ""at the post office,"" according to von der Leyen. ""Every kilowatt of energy saved is precious to counter Russia's energy war,"" she added.The EU had previously supplied the Ukrainian government with generators to protect against power outages caused by Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.Russia plans to attend the assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Vienna exactly one year after it launched its invasion of Ukraine.""We are now dealing with obtaining the visa and preparing for the trip. I think everything will be normal,"" the deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in Russia's upper house of parliament, Vladimir Dzhabarov, said.The Russian delegation had to be prepared for serious verbal attacks during the debate, Dzhabarov said: ""We understand that all 30 NATO countries, which are also members of the OSCE, will speak out against our country.""He also added that Austria had given assurances that it would grant visas to all Russian deputies.Russia last participated in an OSCE meeting in 2021. At the last two gatherings, host countries Britain and Poland denied visas to the Russian delegation. Many Russian delegates are now on Western sanctions lists.The Austrian Foreign Ministry, however, has defended issuing entry permits to the Russians for the February 23-24 meeting as an obligation under international law.The Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine brought war crimes charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Russian Wagner mercenary group.""The head of the Wagner private military company has been charged with encroaching on the territorial integrity and inviolability of Ukraine and waging a war of aggression,"" the Prosecutor General's Office wrote on Telegram.According to the Ukrainian prosecutors, Prigozhin is directly responsible for thousands of war crimes. He openly admits his role in the war against Ukraine and, with the permission of the Kremlin, recruits tens of thousands of prisoners.The General Prosecutor's Office also warned that Wagner's rank-and-file mercenaries, even those who fled abroad, would not escape responsibility for any crimes they committed.""Prosecutors have already interrogated two such fighters who are in the EU. An investigation into the involvement in war crimes of another Wagner member, who is in Norway, is also underway,"" it said.Russian-installed authorities in Crimea said they had nationalized around 500 properties in the peninsula, including some belonging to senior Ukrainian politicians and business figures.In a statement on Telegram, Vladimir Konstantinov, speaker of the Crimean parliament, said the decree targeted ""accomplices of the Kyiv regime"" and that the nationalized properties included banks and tourist and sport infrastructure.According to a document published on a Crimean government website, properties belonging to former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and businessmen Igor Kolomoisky, Rinat Akhmetov and Serhiy Taruta were among those confiscated.Crimea, which is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, has been controlled by Moscow since 2014, when Russia unilaterally annexed the peninsula.European Council President Charles Michel arrived in Kyiv to join an EU-Ukraine summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and vowed support for Ukraine's bid to join the bloc.""Back in Kyiv for the EU-Ukraine summit with Zelensky (European Commission chief) Ursula von der Leyen and (EU senior diplomat) Josep Borrell. There will be no let up in our resolve. We will also support you every step of the way on your journey to the EU,"" Michel said on Twitter.Von der Leyen and Borrell arrived in the Ukrainian capital on Thursday and held talks with Ukrainian officials there.Ukraine's allies are pushing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to finalize plans for a multibillion-dollar lending program, the Financial Times reported.IMF representatives are planning to meet Ukrainian officials in mid-February to advance discussions over a loan that could range from $14 billion (€12.9 billion) to $16 billion, the report said, citing officials familiar with the talks.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has condemned Ukraine's threat to boycott the Paris 2024 Summer Games. According to the IOC, the threat violates the fundamentals of the Olympic Movement.""It is extremely unfortunate to escalate this discussion at this early stage with a boycott threat,"" the IOC said. The participation of individual neutral athletes with a Russian or Belarusian passport in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games has not yet been discussed and decided, it added.The Baltic nations and Poland on Thursday called on international sports bodies to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the Olympics and other events while the war in Ukraine continues.Poland believes it will be possible to build a coalition of some 40 countries, including the US, Britain and Canada, supporting the call to block Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympics, a Polish minister said.The recruitment of prisoners by the Russian mercenary Wagner group has recently decreased, UK Defense Ministry said in its daily intelligence update.A power struggle between different groups in the Russian ruling elite is at least partly responsible for the decline.""Significant tensions between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defense are playing out in public; competition between factions in the Russian elite is likely to be partially responsible for the reduced supply of convicte,"" the update said.Both data from the Russian law enforcement agency and reports from Ukrainian soldiers suggest that the number of Wagner mercenaries recruited in the prisons has fallen, the British ministry added.Kyiv is hosting a key summit with the European Union as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he wants to start talks on his war-torn country's accession ""this year.""dh/sms (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799454,Chinese tourists slow to return to Europe,"After almost three years of travel interruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese citizens can gradually start traveling again without having to spend weeks in quarantine on their return. But so far, the tourism boom in Europe hasn't materialized.There have been only a few ""isolated bookings"" from groups wanting a guided tour of the historic Neuschwanstein Castle in Mandarin, according to the Bavarian Palace Department.Neuschwanstein has typically been a must-see sight for many Chinese tourists in Germany. Before the pandemic, about 20% of the guided tours offered were given in Mandarin.For the time being, it's unlikely that there will be a major wave of travel from China, despite the relaxation of pandemic-related restrictions in China, says Wolfgang Arlt, managing director of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute (COTRI) in Hamburg. This will not change until Easter, he predicts. The hurdles are still too high. For one thing, COVID-19 is still rampant in China and infection rates are high.As a result, in the beginning of January, EU member states agreed to introduce mandatory testing for all passengers arriving on flights from China. In addition, German authorities in China currently only issue visas if the applicant has a compelling reason to travel — and tourism is not considered one of them.Airlines, too, must first gradually ramp up their flight offerings again. Nevertheless, the entire industry is already ""electrified,"" and getting prepared, says Arlt.The excitement at the prospect of Chinese tourists returning to Europe is not necessarily obvious at first glance. Only Italy makes it into the top 10 most popular destinations for Chinese tourists — with just under 3.2 million vacationers from China in 2019.Asian destinations, such as Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore are at the top of the travel bucket list for most Chinese vacationers.Meanwhile, France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland are among the top 20 most sought-after vacation spots for Chinese tourists.In fact, in purely numerical terms, Chinese tourists in Europe are a marginal tourist group. In 2019, for example, there were only just under three million overnight stays by Chinese tourists in Germany out of a total of 500 million overnight stays.The numbers are similar in Switzerland, where the statistics for 2019 show exactly 1.85 million overnight stays by Chinese tourists out of a total of 40 million.In Spain in 2019, meanwhile, just about 700,750 out of 83 million vacationers came from China. Nevertheless, Turespaña, the official agency of the Government of Spain responsible for the marketing of the country, is also closely following the developments there. ""Expectations are great,"" says a spokeswoman for the Spanish tourism board.Expectations are high in part because Chinese tourists tend to be big spenders when they come to Europe. In Spain, according to Turespaña, tourists from China spend around €308 ($336) a day — that's more than twice as much as German tourists.In Switzerland, Chinese tourists spend an average of 380 francs a day ($413, €379); almost three times as much as German travelers.But that's not all, as Wolfgang Arlt explains. ""Chinese tourists don't come to simply take a vacation, but to experience and see as much as possible in a short time,"" he says. This presents a great opportunity for destinations that want to reduce their seasonality and broaden their appeal.Spain's tourism experts, for example, have been trying unsuccessfully for years to teach German tourists that there's more to do than lie on a beach all summer. ""Chinese tourists are much more open to different things, in that regard."" With a smart strategy, you could create the kind of tourism here that you've always wanted. At Turespaña, this strategy is called ""diversification of travel motives.""If things go well, Chinese vacationers would come primarily for culture and gastronomy and not primarily for the sunny climate, like many other tourists.At the same time, however, many tourism entities, including the German National Tourist Board, mention the ""strong potential"" of tourism from China — the largest tourism source market in the world.In 2019, 170 million international trips were made from China. In 2023, an estimated 110 million trips will be made, according to the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute's Wolfgang Arlt.In 2030, that number is projected to increase to 228 million trips. Many of such trips will be made to Germany — and Neuschwanstein Castle is likely to be on the sightseeing bucket list.This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/03,,

""Only together a strong Ukraine and a strong European Union can protect the life we value.""However, while the EU supports Ukraine and reforms there, it has declined to offer a fast track to membership while Ukraine is at war. EU officials have listed several entry requirements, from political and economic stability to passing various EU laws.The process could take years. The last country to have joined the EU was Croatia in 2013, a decade after formally applying.The EU has called for more anti-corruption measures from Ukraine, saying it must build a credible track record over time. To this end, Zelenskyy recently announced investigations and the dismissal of some officials.Von der Leyen tweeted that Ukraine was ""taking notable steps forward to meet our recommendations, while at the same time fighting an invasion.""""We have never been closer,"" she said, noting that the EU was ""working on extending tariff-free access to our market.""The EU will decide on further steps once Ukraine fulfils the conditions outlined in the European Commission's opinion on its EU membership application.

Psycho-oncology can help,"""The worst thing for me was not the actual diagnosis, but that I recently learned that doctors still found cancer cells in my body,"" Kurt Schröder said [name changed by the editors for privacy reasons]. ""That's not great news when it comes to pancreatic cancer. They took the cancer out in surgery, there are only residual cells left. I would prefer, of course, that there was nothing left at all. But I'm a boundless optimist.""Schröder is 61 years old, has always been healthy, and is passionate about his hobbies, natural history and photography. After receiving his cancerdiagnosis in August 2022, his first surgery followed in October. The so-called ""head"" of the pancreas and the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) were removed. Chemotherapywas next, with corresponding side effects such as nausea, vomiting and changes in taste.""Bread tasted like sandpaper,"" Schröder said. ""Bananas were flaming sweet, I couldn't eat them at all.""Early on, he turned to Gudrun Bruns, the head of a cancer counseling center in Münster.Bruns has decades of experience in the field of psycho-oncology, a scientific discipline that developed in the 1970s.""Psycho-oncology deals with the psychological and social changes that result from cancer,"" Bruns said.Studies have shown that around 25 to 30% of all people who receive a cancer diagnosis develop psychological disorders or psychosocial impairments over the course of the disease.Psycho-oncology counselors provide guidance to patients in order to accompany them on their difficult path back into everyday life. They also provide practical help and information about the next possible steps.""Mrs. Bruns knows an enormous number of people and institutions. She has connections that you didn't even think of yourself,"" says Schröder. ""Of course, that's immediately a tremendous psychological help, too, when you know that you can turn to different places for support.""Paying more attention to the emotional and psychological aspects of cancer, integrating them into cancer treatment and improving conditions worldwide are some of the goals of IPOS, the International Psycho-Oncology Society.Founded in 1984 and based in Toronto and New York, the organization works to make psycho-oncology an integral part of cancer therapies worldwide. To reach that goal, IPOS works with international partners and various interest groups and is pushing for more intensive research.In 2020, more than 19 million people were newly diagnosed with cancer worldwide, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC. And the number will grow. IARC estimates that cancer deaths will nearly double from 9.96 million worldwide in 2020 to about 16.3 million worldwide by 2040.This makes it all the more important to offer psycho-oncological counseling and therapy. The worries and fears that cancer patients have to contend with are similar, regardless of whether they are getting treatment in Africa, Asiaor Europe, and regardless of the type of cancer involved.A cancer diagnosis not only turns the life of the patient upside down, but also the lives of family members. Studies show that they, too, are exposed to severe psychological stress.""Relatives often have the feeling that they have to support the sick person to the maximum, and then they lose track of their own life. If they give in to their own wishes and needs, they often have moral misgivings and a guilty conscience, even if it's simply a visit to the cinema or other leisure activities,"" Bruns said.Such behavior, however, helps no one, she said.""It is absolutely necessary that relatives find ways for themselves to recharge their own energy.""Schröder has experienced himself what overly selfless commitment can do to relatives of cancer patients. His partner, Simone Burmann [name changed by editor for privacy reasons], was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010.""When I accompanied my partner back then, I noticed how tremendously exhausting it was,"" Schröder said. ""Then when I got my own cancer diagnosis, I kept admonishing her not to come to the hospital every day. In my opinion, she visited me far too often. At some point, she reached her limits and broke down emotionally.""Burmann struggled with her cancer diagnosis. ""It was a fast-growing tumor, and I had three operations,"" she said. ""My uterus was removed and parts of my vagina.""Since then, the now 55-year-old has been cancer-free. She experienced her hospital stay very differently from her partner. ""For me, it was very important to have frequent visits, to have support and just to know there was someone there.""For most, the full spectrum of emotions shows up shortly after diagnosis. It's not just anxiety, anger and irritability, Bruns said.""It's also the grief of losing the health people had before they got sick.""Before their diagnosis, Bruns said, most people took their health for granted. Today, cancers are much more treatable, and many cancers are curable.""But what remains is the associations with infirmity and dying. And of course, many patients are afraid that their disease cannot be cured, that it may come back, and that it will lead to death,"" Bruns said.That's why, she said, giving cancer patients constant encouragement is one of the most important tasks in psycho-oncology: ""It's often simply about not leaving people alone, and just listening to them.""There is no set routine for this, says Schröder. ""The conversations just happened from day to day. They've started, for example, with Mrs. Bruns asking, 'How are you today? What's up?' And then you just start talking.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799458,Pressure on London to restitute artworks grows,"In 1897, British soldiers bloodily raided the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin, located in present-day Nigeria. The invaders looted thousands of ornately crafted sculptures made of ivory, brass and bronze, and then sold the looted works throughout Europe.Even today, the Benin Bronzes — evidence of an ancient and powerful civilization — are scattered throughout museums and private collections around the globe.One question is receiving more attention than ever before: Is Europe serious about decolonizing its museums? If so, why is it having such a hard time returning African cultural heritage looted during the colonial era?""The Benin Bronzes are a touchstone here,"" Göttingen-based historian Rebekka Habermas tells DW. ""The restitution debate is all about reassessing European history.""The British Museum in particular, which holds the lion's share of artworks from Benin — some 900 pieces — has so far rejected any claims of restitution. The issue goes far beyond the Benin Bronzes.For example, another prominent case is the dispute over the so-called Parthenon Marbles, a part of a Parthenon frieze that is the centerpiece of London's British Museum. Britain's 1983 National Heritage Act is consistently used as the main reason why the ancient sculptures cannot be returned to Greece. The law stipulates that objects considered part of the country's national heritage may not be taken out of the country.This line of thought meets with little understanding outside the kingdom, especially in Athens, where Greek authorities have been calling for the return of the Parthenon Marbles for decades.The British position seems to be behind the times. In the view of restitution expert Habermas, it is merely a ""fall-back position"" — in other words, an excuse to not return the sculptures and other items acquired from various countries under murky circumstances. ""Laws are there to be changed,"" points out the historian.Quite unlike France, Spain, Germany or the Netherlands, for example, the British have not come to terms with their colonial past to this day, she adds. ""Britain's identity is still based to a large extent on the Empire,"" says the historian. ""That's tremendously irritating, especially if you're German and have a somewhat fractured relationship with your own past.""Why is it so important to return looted cultural property in the first place? ""There is simply no moral justification for the confiscation of African artifacts in Western museums,"" Cameroonian philosopher Achille Mbembe declared in 2021. ""It will take the time it takes, but the movement cannot be stopped,"" he said.Rebekka Habermas also believes a ""symbolic end to the colonial era"" is necessary — for the sake of the former colonial empires, as well as the formerly colonized territories. ""After all, these relationships live on at an economic, as well as a cultural level.""The restitution debate gained momentum in the 1960s, when the first African states became independent in the wake of World War II.However, demands for restitution from Benin to the British Museum and France were not followed by action.The situation began to change in 2017 when French President Emmanuel Macron spoke about the permanent return of artifacts taken from sub-Saharan Africa in a speech in the African nation of Burkina Faso.Since then, the debate has gained momentum.In Germany, for example, it became a hot issue during the planning and construction phases of the recently opened Humboldt Forum in Berlin — the centerpiece of which were Benin Bronzes.Meanwhile, in Belgium, the AfricaMuseum in Tervuren handed over 84,000 artifacts in its inventory to the Democratic Republic of Congo in February 2022.Similar restitution debates are taking place in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain.A few weeks ago, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Commissioner for Culture and the Media Claudia Roth called for the return of 20 Benin bronzes to Nigeria to be understood as a ""turning point in international cultural policy.""For years, the artifacts had belonged to museums in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Stuttgart and Dresden.The return, Baerbock said during the handover ceremony, shows a ""willingness to critically evaluate one's own actions"" with an ""open ear for the concerns of those who were victims of colonial atrocities."" Nigeria's request for restitution had long been ignored, she said.In Great Britain, the German approach — giving the items back to the countries they were plundered from — is likely to have been viewed critically, as the restitution debate is making little headway.The British Museum, headed by German art historian Hartwig Fischer, has said in the past: ""The devastation and looting wrought in Benin City in the course of the British military expedition of 1897 is fully acknowledged by the museum, and the circumstances of the acquisition of the Benin objects are explained in the museum's gallery boards and website."" A page on the museum's website is dedicated to explaining the tragedy and how the items came into the museum's possession.Nevertheless, as historian Rebekka Habermas points out, as more museums around the world restitute items in their collections, ""the pressure on the British Museum is likely to have increased significantly.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/03,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799459,Jailed leader of Greek far-right party faces election ban,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s government is seeking to ban a far-right political party led by a jailed former lawmaker from participating in a general election later this year, with a legislative initiative that has gained cross-party support. 

            Ilias Kasidiaris, 42, founded the Greek National Party two years ago. He is currently serving a sentence of 13 years and six months in prison for membership in a criminal organization as a former leading member of Golden Dawn, a political party of neo-Nazi origins linked to multiple violent street attacks. 

            Parliament on Friday published a proposed legal amendment that would disqualify Kasidiaris’ party from election participation on the grounds that its leader has been convicted of serious offences and that the party wouldn't “serve the free functioning of (Greece’s) democratic constitution.” 











            Lawmakers are due to vote on the amendment on Tuesday. 

            Opposition parties are supportive of the ban, but the Greek Communist Party described the criteria in the amendment as being too broad and open to abuse for political purposes.

            Golden Dawn was represented in parliament between 2012 and 2019 following four consecutive elections held during a major financial crisis.

            In 2020, a court jailed Kasidiaris and other members of the party’s leadership for heading a criminal organization that waged a campaign of violence against migrants and ideological opponents.

            “Democracies have a moral obligation to guard against their enemies,” center-right Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told members of his Cabinet on Thursday.

            “They cannot legitimize and certainly cannot fund organizations that openly work to undermine them.” 

            Before a general election expected in April, opinion polls suggest the Greek National Party would cross the 3% threshold of the national vote needed to gain parliamentary representation. 

            In a phone message from a prison in central Greece that was posted online, Kasidiaris called the legal amendment “undemocratic.”ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s government is seeking to ban a far-right political party led by a jailed former lawmaker from participating in a general election later this year, with a legislative initiative that has gained cross-party support.Ilias Kasidiaris, 42, founded the Greek National Party two years ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799460,"Sorry, not sorry: Some 1/6 rioters change tune after apology","WASHINGTON (AP) — Appearing before a federal judge after pleading guilty to a felony charge in the deadly Capitol riot, former West Virginia lawmaker Derrick Evans expressed remorse for letting down his family and his community, saying he made a “crucial mistake."" 

            Less than a year later, Evans is portraying himself as a victim of a politically motivated prosecution as he runs to serve in the same building he stormed on Jan. 6, 2021. Evans is now calling the Justice Department's Jan. 6 prosecutions a “miscarriage of justice"" and describes himself on twitter as a “J6 Patriot."" 

            ""Some ppl have said I need to apologize and condemn #J6 if I want to win my election as the media will attack me,"" he tweeted recently after announcing his bid for a U.S. House seat in 2024. “I will not compromise my values or beliefs. That’s what politicians do. We need Patriots not politicians.” 











            Evans joins a series of Jan. 6 defendants who — when up against possible prison time in court — have expressed regret for joining the pro-Trump mob that rattled the foundations of American democracy only to strike a different tone or downplay the riot after receiving their punishment. 

            The very first Jan. 6 defendant to be sentenced apologized in court and then went on Fox News Channel shortly after and seemed to minimize the riot. Another defendant who called Jan. 6 “horrifying and disgusting” later donned an orange jumpsuit to play the part of a distraught prisoner in a bizarre tribute to imprisoned Capitol rioters during a conservative conference.

            Some defendants have drawn ire from judges or the Justice Department for their inconsistent comments. But there’s not much the legal system can do for an adjudicated defendant. And because some conservatives hold up Jan. 6 defendants as martyrs, there's a political and possibly financial incentive for them to change their tune.

            It could push judges to impose stronger punishments for rioters who haven’t yet made it to the end of their criminal cases. Even before Evans' sentencing, the judge who heard his case began questioning the sincerity of rioters' apologies after he felt duped by another defendant, saying he was “all too familiar with crocodile tears."" 

            In some cases, judges have questioned whether they should undo defendants' convictions or plea deals after they made statements in public that appeared to go against what they said in court. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ordered an Illinois man convicted this week to explain why the judge shouldn't vacate his conviction after he agreed in court that he participated in the riot and then told a newspaper he didn't actually think he committed the crimes with which he was charged.

            Before being sentenced last June to three months behind bars for a civil disorder charge, Evans said he regrets his actions every day and told Senior Judge Royce Lamberth he is a “good person who unfortunately was caught up in a moment.” 

            Shortly after, prosecutors wrote to the judge about several statements Evans made on a radio show and that were “inconsistent with the contrition” he showed at sentencing. When asked whether he regretted his actions, Evans said on the show that he regretted the “situation” he was in. But he said he was “never going to have regrets when it comes to standing up and doing what’s right.” 

            Evans said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that he still stands behind what he said in court. 

            ""That was my message to the judge. This is my message to the media. It’s time to tell the real story of what happened personally to me that day,"" he said. 

            Evans said he lost “almost everything” — including his job as a state delegate and time with his kids — because of his decision on Jan. 6. “How could I not regret that?” he asked. But he said he is “done being portrayed as a villain” when he is not, noting that he didn't overrun any officers and was inside the Capitol for only 10 minutes. 

            When determining an appropriate sentence, judges generally take into account whether defendants have taken responsibility for their actions and appear genuinely sorry. In some Jan. 6 cases, judges have faulted defendants for not appearing to show true remorse even before their punishment has been handed down. 

            A lawyer for Trennis Evans III, who took a swig of whiskey in a congressional conference room during the riot, told the judge in court papers that Evans was “sincerely remorseful, and duly contrite."" But after Evans suggested at his November sentencing that Jan. 6 defendants were being treated unfairly — even though he said he condemned what happened that day — the judge said she didn't believe he showed ""full and genuine remorse."" 

            Months after he was ordered to serve 20 days in jail, the Texas man traveled to South Dakota to urge state lawmakers to support a resolution encouraging “the humane and fair treatment"" of Jan. 6 defendants. The resolution failed by unanimous vote. 

            The first Jan. 6 defendant to get her punishment, Anna Morgan-Lloyd, told Lamberth that she was ashamed of the “savage display of violence” at the Capitol before he sentenced her to probation. Shortly after, however, the Indiana woman told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that people were “very polite” during the riot and that she saw “relaxed” police officers chatting with rioters. 

            Lamberth apparently hasn't forgotten about it. The judge wrote in court papers that he hoped another defendant's “change of heart” was sincere because his hopes were “dashed” in her case. In another case, he wrote that he ""often finds it difficult to ascertain the sincerity” of Jan. 6 defendants' remorse. 

            “Many defendants appear sincere at sentencing, boasting of their purportedly deep shame, regret, and desire to change and be law-abiding citizens,” Lamberth wrote. “But this Court is all too familiar with crocodile tears.” 

            Morgan-Lloyd's attorney has said that she believes her client was genuinely remorseful, was “played"" by Ingraham and sent the judge a letter after her TV interview. When contacted by The Associated Press, Morgan-Lloyd's attorney said the woman would not comment. 

            After he dodged prison time in his Jan. 6 case, right-wing activist Brandon Straka donned an orange jumpsuit and red MAGA cap, sat in a fake jail cell and performatively wept for a procession of attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas last August. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, entered the cage and embraced Straka before they appeared to pray together.

            Months earlier, with a possible jail term hanging over his head, Straka referred to Jan. 6 as “nothing more than an incredibly shameful day that had absolutely no positive attributes whatsoever.” 

            “I’m sorry that I was present in any way at an event that led people to feel afraid, that caused shame and embarrassment on our country, and that served absolutely no purpose other than to further tear away at the already heartbreaking divide in this country,” he wrote in a letter to U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who sentenced him to 36 months of probation.

            An email seeking comment was sent to Straka, from Nebraska. He has said that the CPAC performance was meant “to provoke a reaction about political division, human rights abuses & more"" and accused critics of trying to “criminalize art.” 

            Since his sentencing, the judge questioned whether he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea and said he could be opening himself up to prosecution for making false statements because of public comments she said seemed to contradict things he said in court. 

            A written statement of offense that Straka agreed was correct under his plea deal says that he yelled “Take it! Take it!” while filming others trying to take a police officer's shield. Straka later told Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he told his lawyer that he never made that comment. He suggested he admitted doing so because he was under pressure to take a deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799469,4th down coaching decisions could prove key in Super Bowl,"If the Super Bowl comes down to a key fourth-down decision, that might bode well for the the Philadelphia Eagles.

            The analytically inclined Eagles have long been one of the NFL's most aggressive organizations when it comes to the crucial fourth-down calls. 

            Those decisions helped fuel the team's first Super Bowl title five years ago under coach Doug Pederson and have helped Philadelphia get back to the title game this season under his successor Nick Sirianni thanks to two key fourth-down conversions in the first half of the NFC title game against San Francisco.











            The Eagles have converted more fourth downs than any other team in the regular season and playoffs combined, despite playing from ahead more than any other team this season.

            “We have confidence,” Sirianni said. “When you go for it on fourth down, you put yourself in those scenarios all week. We have so many meetings about that, of what we’re going to do in these scenarios, calls we might call, what we would call if we’ve already called that and everything like that. You put yourself through those calls, but at the end of the day, you make the decision because you trust the people that are out there doing the job.”

            Sirianni ranked No. 1 this season the Football Outsiders' Critical Call Index, while his Kansas City counterpart Andy Reid ranked 28th.

            The analytics company has one of the best models for determining when NFL teams should go and when they should kick on fourth downs, using its win probability model that relies on historical play-by-play data adjusted for variables such as the strength and weaknesses of both teams, injuries and other factors.

            The Eagles have converted a league-best 25 fourth-down tries and an impressive clip of 71.4%. While much of that success has come in short-yardage situations where quarterback Jalen Hurts has thrived on sneaks that feature teammates giving him a legal push from behind — converting 27 of 31 runs on third or fourth-and-1 — the Eagles also have had success with more traditional plays.

            Hurts converted a fourth-and-3 on a deep pass to DeVonta Smith on the opening drive last week against San Francisco to set up a touchdown — even though the play might have been overturned had the 49ers challenged it.

            “I’d say the biggest part about it is the trust the coaches have in the players and the players have in the coach,"" tight end Dallas Goedert said. ""If we get on the other side of the field, we know it’s four-down territory. If we get into third-and-manageable, fourth-and-manageable, it’s just trusting the play call. ... The faith and the trust the coaches have in the players is pretty special.”

            Later in the first half, Sirianni made a riskier call when he went for it on fourth-and-1 from his own 34 midway through the second quarter in a tie game.

            While a stop there could have given San Francisco the ball in scoring position with a chance to take the lead before the half, Hurts converted the sneak. That led to another TD drive and Philadelphia never trailed the rest of the way.

            “That aggressive style is what we like,” running back Boston Scott said. “That’s kind of been the mindset here for a while. It’s always been an aggressive style and trusting the players.”

            The Eagles willingness to trust the numbers and be aggressive on fourth downs pre-dates Sirianni's arrival as head coach in 2021.

            Pederson helped fuel the league-wide shift in decision making with the success he had going for it on fourth downs in Philadelphia's Super Bowl-winning 2017 season.

            That proved crucial in the final game when Pederson's famous “Philly Special” call at the end of the first half led to a trick play TD pass from Trey Burton to quarterback Nick Foles and a fourth-and-1 conversion in Eagles territory helped spark the game-winning drive in the fourth quarter.

            Reid has typically had a more old-school approach on fourth downs but has shown a willingness at times to trust his offense. He attempted a league-low one fourth down from his own territory all season — a successful fourth-and-1 from his 45 late in a tie game against Tennessee in Week 9.

            While the Chiefs did convert a key fourth-and-1 late in the first half last Sunday against the Bengals when Patrick Mahomes threw a 14-yard TD pass to Travis Kelce, that's been more of the exception than the rule as Kansas City's 12 fourth-down tries were tied for the second fewest in the NFL in the regular season.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLIf the Super Bowl comes down to a key fourth-down decision, that might bode well for the the Philadelphia Eagles.The analytically inclined Eagles have long been one of the NFL's most aggressive organizations when it comes to the crucial fourth-down calls.Those decisions helped fuel the team's first Super Bowl title five years ago under coach Doug Pederson and have helped Philadelphia get back to the title game this season under his successor Nick Sirianni thanks to two key fourth-down conversions in the first half of the NFC title game against San Francisco.The Eagles have converted more fourth downs than any other team in the regular season and playoffs combined, despite playing from ahead more than any other team this season.“We have confidence,” Sirianni said. “When you go for it on fourth down, you put yourself in those scenarios all week. We have so many meetings about that, of what we’re going to do in these scenarios, calls we might call, what we would call if we’ve already called that and everything like that. You put yourself through those calls, but at the end of the day, you make the decision because you trust the people that are out there doing the job.”Sirianni ranked No. 1 this season the Football Outsiders' Critical Call Index, while his Kansas City counterpart Andy Reid ranked 28th.The analytics company has one of the best models for determining when NFL teams should go and when they should kick on fourth downs, using its win probability model that relies on historical play-by-play data adjusted for variables such as the strength and weaknesses of both teams, injuries and other factors.The Eagles have converted a league-best 25 fourth-down tries and an impressive clip of 71.4%. While much of that success has come in short-yardage situations where quarterback Jalen Hurts has thrived on sneaks that feature teammates giving him a legal push from behind — converting 27 of 31 runs on third or fourth-and-1 — the Eagles also have had success with more traditional plays.Hurts converted a fourth-and-3 on a deep pass to DeVonta Smith on the opening drive last week against San Francisco to set up a touchdown — even though the play might have been overturned had the 49ers challenged it.“I’d say the biggest part about it is the trust the coaches have in the players and the players have in the coach,"" tight end Dallas Goedert said. ""If we get on the other side of the field, we know it’s four-down territory. If we get into third-and-manageable, fourth-and-manageable, it’s just trusting the play call. ... The faith and the trust the coaches have in the players is pretty special.”Later in the first half, Sirianni made a riskier call when he went for it on fourth-and-1 from his own 34 midway through the second quarter in a tie game.While a stop there could have given San Francisco the ball in scoring position with a chance to take the lead before the half, Hurts converted the sneak. That led to another TD drive and Philadelphia never trailed the rest of the way.“That aggressive style is what we like,” running back Boston Scott said. “That’s kind of been the mindset here for a while. It’s always been an aggressive style and trusting the players.”The Eagles willingness to trust the numbers and be aggressive on fourth downs pre-dates Sirianni's arrival as head coach in 2021.Pederson helped fuel the league-wide shift in decision making with the success he had going for it on fourth downs in Philadelphia's Super Bowl-winning 2017 season.That proved crucial in the final game when Pederson's famous “Philly Special” call at the end of the first half led to a trick play TD pass from Trey Burton to quarterback Nick Foles and a fourth-and-1 conversion in Eagles territory helped spark the game-winning drive in the fourth quarter.Reid has typically had a more old-school approach on fourth downs but has shown a willingness at times to trust his offense.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799470,China confirms offer to Sri Lanka of debt moratorium,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s government on Friday confirmed it is offering Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on loan repayments as the Indian Ocean island nation struggles to restructure $51 billion in foreign debt that pushed it into a financial crisis.

            China lent to Sri Lanka as part of Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative to increase trade by building ports and other infrastructure across Asia and Africa. The International Monetary Fund offered a $2.9 billion emergency loan but wants other creditors to cut debts, which Beijing had resisted, possibly for fear other borrowers would want the same relief.

            China presented a plan to “provide an extension on debt service due in 2022 and 2023,” said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning. “During that period, Sri Lanka would not have to pay the principal and interest due on bank loans.”











            China is Sri Lanka's third-biggest creditor after Japan and the Asian Development Bank, accounting for about 10% of its debt. But its lack of agreement blocked a final settlement.

            Sri Lanka used Chinese loans to build an airport and other projects that failed to pay for themselves.

            India, which China sees as a strategic rival, announced last month it gave the IMF assurances to facilitate a bailout plan. India has given Sri Lanka $4.4 billion in emergency credit.

            Sri Lanka ran out of foreign currency last April, leading to food shortages, power cuts and protests that forced a prime minister to resign and a president to flee the country. Debt repayment to China, Japan and other foreign lenders was suspended.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799472,Austin mayor apologizes as city struggles to restore power,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Widespread power outages in the Texas capital stretched into a third day Friday for thousands of residents following a winter storm that was spiraling into a management crisis as city leaders remained unable to say when all the lights would come back on. 

            Impatience among frazzled, freezing and fed-up families in Austin escalated even as milder weather returned. On Friday, the newly elected mayor stood before cameras and apologized after a week of slow repairs, failed technology and lacking communication with the public. 

            “The city let its citizens down. The situation is unacceptable to the community, and it’s unacceptable to me,” said Mayor Kirk Watson, a Democrat who took office in January. “And I’m sorry.”











            While New England began shivering and closed schools under an Arctic blast expected to bring the coldest weather in a generation, temperatures finally started to moderate Friday and bring some relief to Austin, where at any given time about 30% of customers in the nation's 11th-largest city have been without electricity since the ice storm swept into Texas late Monday. 

            City officials said Friday that significant progress was finally being made as frozen equipment and roads thawed. About 117,000 customers still lacked power, according to Austin Energy, the city's utility. That’s down from a peak of around 170,000 people, nearly a third of all customers.

            But frustration was not melting away for residents who still had no assurances or sense of when their power would return.

            “I just honestly think they were not prepared for any of this,” said Edward Kim, 43, whose home had been without power or heat since Wednesday. He was using a generator to keep his house “on life support,” while his wife took her 7-year-old daughter to her office to get a shower. 

            Steve Spencer, 63, had also been without power since Wednesday — despite the city's utility calling him twice to tell him his power was on, he said. “I don't know what's going on down there,” he said. 

            Will Rison didn’t lose power, but his parents, who are in their 70s, have been without electricity since Wednesday. They’ve been coming to his home to charge their phones and take showers.

            “You can only wrap yourself in so many blankets and wait it out,” Rison said.

            For many, the outages stirred unpleasant memories of the 2021 blackouts in Texas, when hundreds of people died after the state’s power grid was pushed to the brink of total failure because of a lack of generation. That was not the case this week, as the grid maintained sufficient reserves.

            Energy experts said Austin's dense tree canopy made the outages caused by fallen trees and iced-over power lines more widespread. Most power lines are overhead, and Austin officials said burying existing lines would be expensive and more difficult to repair.

            Austin Energy at one point said power would be fully restored by Friday evening but then backtracked, saying the damage was worse than originally calculated. The utility's online system for reporting outages also temporarily crashed this week, and city leaders did not hold a news conference to publicly answer questions until Thursday. 

            “This was a reminder you can have plenty of power plants but still have an unreliable grid,” said Michael Webber, professor of energy resources at the University of Texas at Austin. “The wires and poles are the weak point of the system.” 

            There have been no reports of deaths from this week's power outages, though the storm and freeze have been blamed for at least 12 traffic fatalities on slick roads in Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma.

            Two fatal crashes occurred in Fort Worth as streets refroze overnight. Lows on Friday night could reach freezing and potentially glaze over the streets again.

            In New England, temperatures began plunging Friday morning, and forecasters said wind chills — the combined effect of wind and cold air on exposed skin — in some higher elevations could punch below minus 50 (minus 45 Celsius). Winds in some of those spots have already topped 80 mph (130 kph).

            Wind gusts began cutting power Friday to some homes in New England, and many communities opened warming shelters, including in Maine and Connecticut.

            Schools closed Friday in Boston and in Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city. “This is simply too cold for students who walk home,” read an announcement on the Manchester district's website.

            Some ski areas in the two states scaled back operations, eliminating night skiing or reducing lift operations. 

            In Maine, the National Toboggan Championship pushed Saturday’s races back by a day, just two weeks after relocating the competition because a pond wasn’t yet frozen due to warm weather.

            The irony of delaying competition because of frigid conditions wasn’t lost on Holly Anderson, one of the organizers.

            “We’ve done subzero competitions before. But the wind totally changes the environment. It just makes it untenable to be outside,” Anderson said.

            Some of the most extreme weather was expected atop New Hampshire’s Mount Washington, the Northeast’s highest peak and home to a weather observatory, where winds gusted to nearly 100 mph (160 kph) and wind chills could reach minus 100 (minus 73 Celsius).

            The system is expected to move out of the region Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799475,US Open champ Ogilvy back from Down Under and back to golf,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — No matter what golf course design Geoff Ogilvy had in his head or on paper, he spent the better part of three years staring into a computer screen for video calls on those projects until he realized what he had been missing.

            “Golf is still the best job I've ever had,” Ogilvy said Thursday. “I'd prefer to do it while I still can — if I still can. I don't know. I feel like I can.”

            To that job he has returned, filled with more anticipation than expectations. 











            Ogilvy, the former U.S. Open champion at Winged Foot and a three-time winner of World Golf Championships, is at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am this week, the first of what he hopes is enough tournaments to give him a reasonable chance to get back into the game.

            He opened with a 2-under 70 at Pebble Beach, with some magic on the final hole. 

            A cold, raging wind off the ocean pushed his second shot well right of the green and blocked by a tall Monterey Cypress tree. He had a 10-foot window to carry a bunker and avoid going into more sand along the sea wall. The pitch came out to 3 feet for a birdie. 

            It wasn't as memorable as his pitch up the hill to the 18th at Winged Foot for a par that turned into a winner at the 2006 U.S. Open. At this moment, it was pleasing.

            “There's some pretty good stuff in there,” he said.

            The odds are not in his favor. Ogilvy turned 45 last year — one reminder of that was one of his PGA Tour pension plans kicked in because he stopped playing a full schedule five years ago — and this is increasingly a young man's game. Eight of the top 10 players in the world are in their 20s. The oldest is top-ranked Rory McIlroy at 33.

            Ogilvy moved his family to his native Australia in 2019. He wanted his three children to experience the joy he had growing up in Melbourne, to broaden their experience, and that part was a big hit. So was living Down Under, where his OCM Golf Course Design thrived.

            Ogilvy has three projects in the United States, the most notable the No. 3 course at Medinah in the Chicago suburbs, which has hosted the U.S. Open, the PGA Championship and the 2012 Ryder Cup. Next up for Medinah is the Presidents Cup in 2026.

            He says there isn't one factor that made him itch for competition, though eventually he stopped in mid-sentence and cut to the heart of it.

            “I missed it, to be honest. I missed the tour,” he said. “You undervalue it when you've had it for 20 years, or whatever I had it for. It's a pretty nice thing to play out here.""

            He returns at a chaotic time in golf with the entrance of Saudi-funded LIV Golf and the PGA Tour's response by creating more tournaments for the top players with $20 million purses and bonus programs to make the PGA Tour as attractive as ever.

            He was effectively retired from competition after 2018, when he missed 14 of 16 cuts and was increasingly jaded by tour life and the quality of his play. He has mostly played in Australia, most recently the TPS Victoria, a winter event he hosts.

            He never had to face the temptation of LIV, though without retirement, Ogilvy might have fit the profile. He didn't pursue it and no one pursued him.

            “I was probably a bit invisible from golf at that point,” he said. 

            He was at the Masters last year to meet people for his design work, right about the time LIV Golf was placing tempting offers in front of players.

            “It was like, 'Wow, I’m glad I'm not there because that's a tough decision.' Both were right decisions and both were wrong decisions,” Ogilvy said. “It was almost like win-win, lose-lose all at the same time. It's awkward what they put everyone in. So I'm sort of glad I didn't have to deal with all that.""

            And then after a brief pause he added with a laugh, “But I'm glad I've come back now and the prize money has doubled.”

            His only status is as a past champion, though Ogilvy is likely to get a few exemptions and other tournaments will have room for him. For now, it's about getting his legs back and, in runners' terms, logging the miles.

            Staying active and keeping busy are not the same. Ogilvy did a lot of sitting — a product of all those video calls on OCM projects — and it took a toll. He need a break from golf, for sure, but with the lockdown in Australia from the COVID-19 pandemic, it was too much.

            “I was just sort of sitting in Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting and thinking, ‘What am I doing? Why don’t just go play golf?'” he said. “It's not the easiest thing to get back out here, so I have no real expectations. I just wanted to come over and have a crack.”

So I'm sort of glad I didn't have to deal with all that.""And then after a brief pause he added with a laugh, “But I'm glad I've come back now and the prize money has doubled.”His only status is as a past champion, though Ogilvy is likely to get a few exemptions and other tournaments will have room for him. For now, it's about getting his legs back and, in runners' terms, logging the miles.Staying active and keeping busy are not the same. Ogilvy did a lot of sitting — a product of all those video calls on OCM projects — and it took a toll. He need a break from golf, for sure, but with the lockdown in Australia from the COVID-19 pandemic, it was too much.“I was just sort of sitting in Zoom meeting after Zoom meeting and thinking, ‘What am I doing? Why don’t just go play golf?'” he said. “It's not the easiest thing to get back out here, so I have no real expectations. I just wanted to come over and have a crack.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/04,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799480,Taiwan to ban disposable food utensils made of biodegradable plastic,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Friday (Feb. 3) that it plans to ban disposable food utensils made of biodegradable plastic.The EPA plans to implement the policy starting Aug. 1, with the goal of lessening the impact of biodegradable plastics on Taiwan’s existing recycling mechanisms. Additionally, it is an attempt to reduce the amount of disposable food containers and cutlery.The policy will affect the public sector, public and private schools, department stores and malls, wholesale stores, supermarkets, convenience store chains, fast food chains, and physical food service providers.According to the EPA, after it banned plastic disposable food containers and cutlery, many food service providers turned to biodegradable options. However, as the material only decomposes quickly in specific environments and Taiwan lacks proper reuse means as well as compost facilities, it has expanded its definition to include biodegradable plastics into its list of banned materials.Details of the policy can be found on the EPA’s website. Those who have suggestions about the policy may contact the EPA within 60 days of its announcement.",2023/02/03,4451,Environment

The commuter version might also include trains, with the existing pass for Taipei and New Taipei to include Keelung and Taoyuan as well.Central Taiwan would have its own monthly pass covering Taichung City, Nantou County, and Changhua County, while a third version could be used in Kaohsiung City, Tainan City, and Pingtung County, according to Wang.The separate tourism version would apply to bus routes linking train and high-speed rail stations with popular sightseeing locations, though the minister said the existing Taiwan Tourism Shuttle (台灣好行) network would still need adjustments.",2023/02/03,2169,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799518,UK man admits treason over crossbow plot against queen,"LONDON (AP) — A man who was arrested on the grounds of Windsor Castle with a loaded crossbow pleaded guilty to treason on Friday for planning to attack Queen Elizabeth II.

            Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, admitted to a charge under the Treason Act of intending to “injure the person of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, or to alarm her Majesty.” He also pleaded guilty to making threats to kill and possessing an offensive weapon.

            Chail appeared at London’s Central Criminal Court by video link from Broadmoor, a secure psychiatric hospital where he is detained. He is due to be sentenced on March 31 after the judge assesses psychiatric reports.











            Chail was arrested at the royal residence west of London on Dec. 25, 2021, when the queen was staying there. The monarch died in September 2022 at age 96.

            Prosecutors say the former supermarket worker from the southern English city of Southampton scaled a wall with a rope ladder and entered the castle grounds, wearing a metal mask and carrying a loaded crossbow with the safety catch off.

            They say he told a police officer “I am here to kill the queen,” before he was handcuffed and arrested.

            Police say Chail wanted revenge on the British establishment for its treatment of Indians and sent a video to a group of contacts “stating his desire to harm the late queen.”

            He had previously tried to join the British Army and the Ministry of Defense Police to get close to the royal family, prosecutors allege.

            Commander Richard Smith of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command said “this was an extremely serious incident."" 

            He said officers patrolling the castle grounds “showed tremendous bravery to confront a masked man who was armed with a loaded crossbow, and then detain him without anyone coming to harm.”

            Charges under the Treason Act of 1842 are rare. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was charged under the act after firing blank shots at the queen as she rode on horseback in the Trooping the Color parade in London. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

            The last person to be convicted under the separate and more serious Treason Act of 1351 was William Joyce, a World War II Nazi propaganda broadcaster known as Lord Haw-Haw. He was hanged for high treason in 1946.LONDON (AP) — A man who was arrested on the grounds of Windsor Castle with a loaded crossbow pleaded guilty to treason on Friday for planning to attack Queen Elizabeth II.Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, admitted to a charge under the Treason Act of intending to “injure the person of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, or to alarm her Majesty.” He also pleaded guilty to making threats to kill and possessing an offensive weapon.Chail appeared at London’s Central Criminal Court by video link from Broadmoor, a secure psychiatric hospital where he is detained.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799519,Officials: 13-year-old killed by landmine in Yemen port city,"SANAA, Yemen (AP) — A landmine killed a 13-year-old boy in the contested Yemeni city of Hodeida, medical and security officials said Friday, the latest in a string of similar incidents in the war-torn country. 

            It came a day after three children and one woman were critically injured in a landmine explosion, according an aid group. 

            The explosion Friday happened on a city street and also seriously injured a teenager, said officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media. 











            Thursday's blast happened when a child began playing with a landmine. The explosion injured that child and the three others nearby, Doctors Without Borders said. It said the four casualties arrived at a hospital in the besieged city of Taiz and were transferred to other health facilities. 

            Landmines have been laid in Yemen since the 1960s. However, since the outbreak of war in 2014, both sides have planted more. According to Yemeni Landmine Records, a group that documents landmine casualties, 32 people in Yemen were killed by landmines and other unexploded ordinance last month. 

            Yemen's ruinous civil war began after Iranian backed-Houthi rebels swept down from the northern mountains and seized the capital, Sanaa, along with much of the north of the country, ousting the internationally recognized government. Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015 on the side of Yemen’s exiled government.

            Houthi rebels have widely used landmines. The U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project said Houthi landmines killed at least 122 people between 2016 and 2018. 

            “Due to the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates, these figures are likely to make up a fraction of all mine detonations involving civilians in Yemen,” ACLED said in a 2018 report.

            Waves of Saudi-led airstrikes have also been accused of killing thousands of civilians, striking markets, hospitals and weddings during the eight-year conflict. 

            Now entering its ninth year, the conflict has since turned into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and killed over 150,000 people, according to the database project.SANAA, Yemen (AP) — A landmine killed a 13-year-old boy in the contested Yemeni city of Hodeida, medical and security officials said Friday, the latest in a string of similar incidents in the war-torn country.It came a day after three children and one woman were critically injured in a landmine explosion, according an aid group.The explosion Friday happened on a city street and also seriously injured a teenager, said officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.Thursday's blast happened when a child began playing with a landmine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799520,8 dead migrants recovered off Italian island of Lampedusa,"MILAN (AP) — The bodies of eight migrants have been recovered by Italy's coast guard during an operation overnight that also rescued 42 survivors in the central Mediterranean off the island of Lampedusa, authorities said Friday.

            Another two people, a newborn and a man, fell into the sea during the crossing and were presumed dead, the coast guard said in a statement, citing survivor accounts. 

            Survivors reported that the infant died of exposure and that the distraught mother threw the newborn into the sea, according to the news agency ANSA. The man then jumped in attempting to retrieve the body, disappearing in the waves. 











            Video of the rescue shows the survivors packed in a small open fishing boat, which was adrift with a nonfunctioning motor. Rescuers warned them to sit down and not move before throwing a line to pull them to safety. 

            All on board were soaking wet, cold and dehydrated, and the deceased were believed to have perished from hypothermia, ANSA reported. 

            Survivors said they had departed the Tunisian port of Sfax before dawn on Saturday, ANSA said. They were among some 200 migrants, mostly from sub-Saharan African nations, who arrived at Lampedusa on three boats overnight. 

            Lampedusa's mayor, Filippo Mannino, appealed to Premier Giorgia Meloni, asking that “the government not leave us alone to manage this enormous tragedy. Help us. We are no longer able to manage.”

            Charity boats operating in the deadly central Mediterranean have complained that a new Italian decree forcing them to port after each rescue endangers the lives of migrants departing from North Africa by leaving the search and rescue area uncovered. That is compounded by a new practice of assigning ports in northern Italy, requiring days of navigation to reach. 

            The Council of Europe this week urged the Italian government to consider withdrawing the decree, saying it could hamper search and rescue operations by nongovernmental agencies, “depriving people in distress of life-saving assistance from NGOs on the deadliest migration route in the Mediterranean.” 

            In a letter to Italy's interior minister, the Council of Europe's human rights commissioner, Dunja Mijatović, also repeated a call for Italy to suspend its cooperation with the Libyan government on interceptions at sea, because of the likelihood that migrants returned to Libya face torture, rape, slavery, exploitation and detention. 

            The latest call comes after Italy agreed over the weekend to supply Libya with five new coast guard boats to help stem the movement of migrants to Europe. The deal was announced during a visit by Meloni that secured an $8 billion gas deal.

            The central Mediterranean Sea is a perilous crossing that has claimed 20,285 lives since the U.N. migration office began tracking figures in 2014, compared with 5,000 in the eastern and western Mediterranean combined. Many of the victims are missing at sea and presumed dead, based on survivor accounts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799582,NATO urges Russia to respect nuclear pact with the US,"BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO called Friday on Russia to respect the only treaty it has with the United States aimed at keeping a lid on nuclear weapons expansion and urged Moscow to allow on-the-ground inspections of military sites to resume.

            The so-called New START Treaty was signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010. It caps at 1,550 the number of long-range nuclear warheads they can deploy and limits the use of missiles that can carry atomic weapons. It allows short-notice inspections of each other’s nuclear bases and support facilities.

            “We note with concern that Russia has failed to comply with legally-binding obligations under the New START Treaty,” NATO ambassadors said in a statement. The 30-nation U.S.-led military alliance supports the treaty and believes that it helps to limit the expansion of nuclear forces.











            The envoys said that Russia’s refusal to hold consultations or to allow U.S. inspections since last August “prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the Treaty, and undermines the United States’ ability to adequately verify Russian compliance with the Treaty’s central limits.”

            “We call on Russia to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty by facilitating New START inspections on Russian territory, and by returning to participation in the Treaty’s implementation body,” the forum in which the two sides could consult, NATO said.

            President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ramped up his nuclear rhetoric since he ordered Russian troops into Ukraine almost a year ago, raising concern among Western allies and the public over whether he might actually use such weapons.

            The U.S.-Russia committee formed under the treaty last met in October 2021, but Russia unilaterally suspended its cooperation with the pact’s inspection provisions in August 2022 to protest U.S. support for Ukraine.

            Inspections of U.S. and Russian military sites under the New START treaty were paused by both sides because of the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020.

            The U.S. State Department warned Tuesday that “Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control.”BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO called Friday on Russia to respect the only treaty it has with the United States aimed at keeping a lid on nuclear weapons expansion and urged Moscow to allow on-the-ground inspections of military sites to resume.The so-called New START Treaty was signed by Russia and the U.S. in 2010.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799583,Galthie: 6N champ France 'not finished' with wins and titles,"French rugby is tidying up its house.

            A new interim president of the federation was chosen on Friday and Alexandre Martinez, the former treasurer, said he wanted to reduce the infighting in the administration.

            “It's time to come together, to unite and support our France XV with pride,” Martinez said.











            Former president Bernard Laporte's denials and designs to cling to power dragged French rugby through the mud for the past five years, even after he was convicted in court of corruption charges in mid-December. 

            He self-suspended as World Rugby vice-chairman but refused to give up the FFR presidency for six more days. Only then he suspended himself. When the clubs rejected his plan to place a surrogate in the presidency, Laporte finally resigned last week.

            But old allegiances die hard.

            The disgraced Laporte accepted an invite to France's training camp at Marcoussis on Thursday, five years after it was raided by police who were investigating him. France coach Fabien Galthie and manager Raphael Ibanez played under Laporte, who coached France to four Six Nations titles in the noughties.

            “Our mission is a purely sporting one. We invited Bernard because France is organizing the World Cup thanks to him,” Ibanez said.

            For all the turmoil Laporte's law-breaking had on the FFR's business, it hasn't rippled on the field. The Top 14 has produced the last two European club champions and France launches on Sunday its bid to win successive Six Nations for the first time since 2007, Laporte's last year as the national coach.

            After its Grand Slam, France's mindset sharpened as it transformed from hunter to hunted last year. The Tricolors won five more tests — including narrow home wins over South Africa and Australia — to go through a calendar year with a first perfect record.

            Also, they extended their winning streak to a national-record 13 tests. After a decade of mediocrity, they are keen to put down more markers en route to their target of a first World Cup triumph.

            “Our journey has not finished,” Galthie stressed. “We are going to get better because our team has not yet reached the age of maturity.”

            The Tricolors have an ideal tournament opener against Italy in Rome, where they haven’t lost in 10 years.

            And injuries to key players have been redressed.

            Lock Cameron Woki, out with a broken wrist, was replaced by Paul Willemse. Center Jonathan Danty, sidelined by a knee injury, was covered by Yoram Moefana. Gabin Villiere, who scored a hat trick of tries against Italy a year ago, did his ankle in training and his wing was filled by uncapped Ethan Dumortier, the Top 14's leading try-scorer from Lyon who has earned enthusiastic reviews.

            Thomas Ramos keeping out Melvyn Jaminet at fullback suggested France — already disciplined and well-drilled — wants more attacking options. Galthie said they are prepared for chaos at Stadio Olimpico.

            But Italy's encouraging signs of a developing identity, coach Kieran Crowley said, don't include chaos.

            Star flyhalf Paolo Garbisi was still recovering from a knee ligament injury so Tommaso Allan and Stephen Varney were the halves for a third straight test. Seven of the pack play for Benetton, which has more wins than losses in the top half of the United Rugby Championship.

            Their backstop is Ange Capuozzo, the breakout player of 2022. Capuozzo was born in Grenoble and plays at Toulouse. He takes weekly Italian language lessons but finds more fluency in camp. He faces his country of birth for the first time.

            “It's an important moment for me, not only as a player but also as a person,” he said. “My whole story is in this match.”

            Crowley just hopes they're competitive with France.

            “Let's face it, these are the favorites to win the Rugby World Cup,” Crowley said. “Compete with them, stay in the game, play the rugby we want . . . if it's enough to win the game, great. If it won't be but we have respected our objectives, we will be satisfied, because we are still a growing team and they are among the best in the world.”

            More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsFrench rugby is tidying up its house.A new interim president of the federation was chosen on Friday and Alexandre Martinez, the former treasurer, said he wanted to reduce the infighting in the administration.“It's time to come together, to unite and support our France XV with pride,” Martinez said.Former president Bernard Laporte's denials and designs to cling to power dragged French rugby through the mud for the past five years, even after he was convicted in court of corruption charges in mid-December.He self-suspended as World Rugby vice-chairman but refused to give up the FFR presidency for six more days. Only then he suspended himself. When the clubs rejected his plan to place a surrogate in the presidency, Laporte finally resigned last week.But old allegiances die hard.The disgraced Laporte accepted an invite to France's training camp at Marcoussis on Thursday, five years after it was raided by police who were investigating him. France coach Fabien Galthie and manager Raphael Ibanez played under Laporte, who coached France to four Six Nations titles in the noughties.“Our mission is a purely sporting one. We invited Bernard because France is organizing the World Cup thanks to him,” Ibanez said.For all the turmoil Laporte's law-breaking had on the FFR's business, it hasn't rippled on the field. The Top 14 has produced the last two European club champions and France launches on Sunday its bid to win successive Six Nations for the first time since 2007, Laporte's last year as the national coach.After its Grand Slam, France's mindset sharpened as it transformed from hunter to hunted last year. The Tricolors won five more tests — including narrow home wins over South Africa and Australia — to go through a calendar year with a first perfect record.Also, they extended their winning streak to a national-record 13 tests. After a decade of mediocrity, they are keen to put down more markers en route to their target of a first World Cup triumph.“Our journey has not finished,” Galthie stressed. “We are going to get better because our team has not yet reached the age of maturity.”The Tricolors have an ideal tournament opener against Italy in Rome, where they haven’t lost in 10 years.And injuries to key players have been redressed.Lock Cameron Woki, out with a broken wrist, was replaced by Paul Willemse. Center Jonathan Danty, sidelined by a knee injury, was covered by Yoram Moefana. Gabin Villiere, who scored a hat trick of tries against Italy a year ago, did his ankle in training and his wing was filled by uncapped Ethan Dumortier, the Top 14's leading try-scorer from Lyon who has earned enthusiastic reviews.Thomas Ramos keeping out Melvyn Jaminet at fullback suggested France — already disciplined and well-drilled — wants more attacking options. Galthie said they are prepared for chaos at Stadio Olimpico.But Italy's encouraging signs of a developing identity, coach Kieran Crowley said, don't include chaos.Star flyhalf Paolo Garbisi was still recovering from a knee ligament injury so Tommaso Allan and Stephen Varney were the halves for a third straight test.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799589,French Rugby Federation picks Martinez as interim president,"PARIS (AP) — The French Rugby Federation chose Alexandre Martinez as its interim president on Friday, one week after Bernard Laporte resigned.

            The 70-year-old Martinez is a former treasurer at the federation.

            “I thank all the members of the (federation) executive committee for their trust. As interim president I will seek inspiration from my past as a No. 10 (flyhalf), where the notion of being open is essential,"" Martinez said. 











            ""I will deal with the current affairs with a clear objective: to reduce the division and fracture currently affecting French rugby. It's time to come together, to unite and to support our France XV with pride."" 

            A Paris court in December found Laporte guilty of passive corruption, influence peddling, illegal interest taking and misuse of corporate assets.

            Laporte was suspended from federation duties while he fought his suspended two-year sentence on the corruption charges. But his nominee as interim president, Patrick Buisson, was rejected by French rugby clubs in a close vote a day before he resigned.

            Sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra has recommended the entire executive committee resign in order to hold new general elections.

As interim president I will seek inspiration from my past as a No. 10 (flyhalf), where the notion of being open is essential,"" Martinez said.""I will deal with the current affairs with a clear objective: to reduce the division and fracture currently affecting French rugby. It's time to come together, to unite and to support our France XV with pride.""A Paris court in December found Laporte guilty of passive corruption, influence peddling, illegal interest taking and misuse of corporate assets.Laporte was suspended from federation duties while he fought his suspended two-year sentence on the corruption charges. But his nominee as interim president, Patrick Buisson, was rejected by French rugby clubs in a close vote a day before he resigned.Sports minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra has recommended the entire executive committee resign in order to hold new general elections.Laporte was France coach from 1999-2007, winning the Six Nations four times.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799592,Ukraine may also get old Leopard 1 tanks from German stocks,"BERLIN (AP) — Ukraine could add old Leopard 1 battle tanks from German defense industry stocks to deliveries of modern tanks that Berlin and other governments pledged last week to counter Russian forces in the war.

            German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit confirmed Friday that “export authorization has been granted” but declined to give numbers or other details, saying that they may become more concrete “in the coming days and weeks.” He told reporters in Berlin that the application from industry to permit delivery of Leopard 1 tanks had been made “some time” ago.

            Hebestreit's comments came after the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that the government had cleared the export of the tanks and that they could be sent as soon as the defense industry gets them in working order. 











            It said that two companies, Rheinmetall and FFG, want to prepare dozens of Leopard 1 tanks that could be delivered to Ukraine if it is interested. But it also said that there are issues so far with securing sufficient ammunition for the vehicles. It wasn't immediately clear when any deliveries might be possible, but it appeared unlikely to be a quick process.

            The Leopard 1, manufactured between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s, was the first battle tank built for West Germany's Bundeswehr. The German military hasn't had any of the tanks since 2003, Defense Ministry spokesman Arne Collatz said.

            Germany last week agreed to send 14 modern Leopard 2 A6 tanks from its military's current stocks. Several other European countries have equipped their armies with Leopard 2 tanks, and Germany’s move — which followed weeks of mounting pressure to supply battle tanks — meant that they also can give some of their stocks to Ukraine.

            The United States has said it will send 31 M1 Abrams tanks.

            Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Oleksii Makeiev, welcomed Friday's announcement from Berlin.

            “After the historic decision last week on the Leopard 2, it is an important signal that the tank coalition has not just been formed by the Western partners, but is increasing and becoming stronger,” he told German news agency dpa. He added that “we have no time to lose.""

            Paul beat Khumoyun Sultanov 6-1, 7-6 (6) after McDonald’s Davis Cup debut produced a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Sergey Fomin on an indoor hard court in Tashkent.

            The best-of-five-match series finishes Saturday with one match in doubles followed by two in singles. The Americans can clinch a spot in the group stage of the Davis Cup Finals if Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek defeat Fomin and Sanjar Fayziev in doubles.











            “A sweep would be nice,” Paul said. “Bring out the broomsticks.”

            Paul moved into the top 20 in the ATP rankings for the first time this week by reaching his first Grand Slam semifinal in Australia, where he lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic. McDonald eliminated 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal in the second round at the year's first Grand Slam tournament.

            
                David Nainkin is serving as interim captain for the United States, replacing Mardy Fish.

            There are 12 qualifiers being held this weekend — six on Friday-Saturday, six on Saturday-Sunday — with the winners of each advancing to the Davis Cup Finals group stage in September, along with reigning champion Canada, 2022 runner-up Australia and wild-card recipients Italy and Spain.

            — Serbia 2, Norway 0: On indoor hard courts in Oslo, the visitors were without 22-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic after his recent Australian Open triumph but they grabbed a lead heading into Saturday thanks to wins by Laslo Djere against Viktor Durasovic 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (8) and by Miomir Kecmanovic against Andreja Petrovic 6-1, 6-3.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799603,Judge hears 8 witnesses in Dani Alves sexual assault case,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — The judge overseeing the investigation into the Dani Alves sexual assault case took testimony from eight witnesses at a closed hearing in Barcelona on Friday.

            The Brazilian soccer player is accused of sexually assaulting a young woman in a Barcelona nightclub on Dec. 30. The 39-year-old Alves has spent the last two weeks in pre-trial detention at a prison outside Barcelona after he was denied bail.

            The judicial investigation is now in the hands of judge Concepción Cantón, who will determine if the case should go to trial. The investigation could continue for weeks.











            The plaintiff is represented by Ester García, a specialist in sex crimes. Alves’ defense lawyer, Cristóbal Martell, is a specialist in financial cases and represented the player's former Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi in his tax fraud case. Neither spoke to the media after the judge took testimony for more than two hours at Barcelona’s City of Justice complex.

            Alves has denied any wrongdoing. At first he denied having ever seen the woman before his arrest. He then later admitted to what he called a consented sexual encounter.

            Earlier this week, Alves’ defense filed an appeal to seek his release on bail, offering to turn in his passport and wear a tracking device if he is set free pending the investigation. The judge had denied Alves bail in part because he was deemed a flight risk.

            The appeal is being handled by a higher court.

            Under Spain’s sexual consent law passed last year, sexual assault takes in a wide array of crimes from online abuse and groping to rape, each with different possible punishments. A case of violent rape can receive a maximum sentence of 15 years.

            Alves won 42 soccer titles, including three Champions Leagues with Barcelona and two Copa Americas with Brazil. He played in his third World Cup last year in Qatar.

            Alves had his contract with Mexican club Pumas terminated after his arrest. He was detained after returning from Brazil to Spain and agreeing to talk to authorities about the case.

            Frederick Leliman and three others were convicted of carrying out the murders in 2016, in one of a series of cases of alleged police brutality and extrajudicial killings in Kenya.

            Lawyer Willie Kimani was representing a motorcycle taxi operator who was suing Leliman for shooting him at a traffic roadblock. Leliman later started threatening and intimidating the man.











            The bodies of Kimani, his client Josephat Mwendwa and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri were discovered in the Ol-Donyo Sabuk River, in the east of the country, days after they were reported missing.

            Evidence produced in court showed that the three were abducted after a court session on June 22, 2016, were briefly locked up and then were taken out and murdered in an open field. Their bodies were discovered on July 1.

            Leliman was given a death sentence, while former officers Stephen Cheburet and Sylvia Wanjiku received sentences of 30 and 24 years, respectively, and police informer Peter Ngugi was jailed for 20 years. A fourth former police officer, Leonard Mwangi, was acquitted. 

            Those sentenced to death in Kenyan courts serve a life sentence. Kenya’s last execution was in 1987.

            The four have 14 days to file an appeal.

            While no group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the fact that he was released means it's likely he was not taken by the Islamic State group, which is active in the area, say conflict analysts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799626,NFL will offer free CPR training during Super Bowl week,"Inspired by the lifesaving medical attention Damar Hamlin received on the field during a game last month, the NFL and American Heart Association will provide free CPR education in Arizona throughout Super Bowl week as part of the NFL Experience at the Phoenix Convention Center. 

            Hamlin, the 24-year-old Buffalo Bills defensive back, needed to be resuscitated after making a tackle in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. Bills assistant athletic trainer Denny Kellington performed CPR on Hamlin on the field.

            “Being able to deliver care in emergency situations is not just important at sporting events, but in all walks of life,” NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.











            People who visit the mobile training unit will receive hands-only CPR training from experts and receive CPR information that can be shared in their communities. Also, the American Heart Association is working with Hamlin and his #3forHeart CPR Challenge, a social media initiative that encourages people to learn CPR, donate money to support CPR research, education and training, and share the word with others.

            “Coming out of the events from last month with Damar Hamlin on the field and the remarkable work that the emergency responders performed, we thought about what opportunities existed for us to share some of the learnings that came from that experience more broadly, which is part of our responsibility throughout the world of football and maybe the world of sports,” NFL executive Jeff Miller told The Associated Press.

            “There’s a long history of the NFL trying to share learnings on the health and safety side from what we experienced at the NFL level, whether that be about concussions, concussion education or about emergency action plans. We take as an obligation to share what we’ve learned and highlight some of the best health and safety approaches that we can with other levels of sport,” Miller added.

            Anna Isaacson, the NFL’s vice president of social responsibility, said the league approached the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross with a simple question: “What can we do here? We saw one life saved. How can we save many more?”

            “The world was watching,” Isaacson told The AP. “I think that while we face challenges, we use these moments to try to make a positive impact.”

            In addition to free CPR training in Arizona, the league throughout February is raising money to support CPR education and youth sports safety efforts across the country. 

            These include a Super Bowl 50/50 raffle open to Arizona residents and fans attending the game at State Farm Stadium. The winner of the raffle will receive half of the jackpot total from raffle ticket sales; the other half will benefit the NFL Foundation to support CPR-related initiatives, including through the American Heart Association, the Red Cross and their local affiliates.

            “Only one out of three high schools has full-time access to an athletic trainer and only about another third even have part-time access to one,” Miller said. “That’s a huge gap in sports and in sports medicine that the league, over a period of time with partners like AHA and others, is going to hopefully try to rectify or address at least a little bit.”

The winner of the raffle will receive half of the jackpot total from raffle ticket sales; the other half will benefit the NFL Foundation to support CPR-related initiatives, including through the American Heart Association, the Red Cross and their local affiliates.“Only one out of three high schools has full-time access to an athletic trainer and only about another third even have part-time access to one,” Miller said. “That’s a huge gap in sports and in sports medicine that the league, over a period of time with partners like AHA and others, is going to hopefully try to rectify or address at least a little bit.”___Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/robmaaddi___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/03,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799628,Ex-pop star Gary Glitter freed from UK prison,"LONDON (AP) — Former pop star Gary Glitter was released from prison in England on Friday after serving half of a 16-year prison sentence for sexually abusing three young girls in the 1970s.

            The 79-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was freed from a prison in Dorset, in southwest England. It is common for offenders in the U.K. to be freed halfway through their sentences and then be placed on probation.

            “Sex offenders like Paul Gadd are closely monitored by the police and Probation Service and face some of the strictest license conditions, including being fitted with a GPS tag,’’ the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. “If the offender breaches these conditions at any point, they can go back behind bars.”











            The singer was found guilty of one count of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13.

            Glitter was arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, the national investigation launched in the wake of the child abuse scandal surrounding the late BBC entertainer Jimmy Savile.

            Glitter is best known for the hit “Rock & Roll (Part 2),” released in 1972, but he fell into disgrace after being convicted on child abuse charges in Vietnam.LONDON (AP) — Former pop star Gary Glitter was released from prison in England on Friday after serving half of a 16-year prison sentence for sexually abusing three young girls in the 1970s.The 79-year-old singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was freed from a prison in Dorset, in southwest England.

            Foden will be in contention to play Sunday when second-place City travels to Tottenham.

            “Yes, I think so,” Guardiola said when he was asked about the 22-year-old playmaker's availability for this weekend. “He has trained well these last two days.”











            The England international sustained the injury during City's 2-1 loss at Manchester United on Jan. 14.

            City is trying to chase down Arsenal in defense of its Premier League title and will have to manage for the next few weeks without Stones.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799684,Ford returns to Formula One in partnership with Red Bull,"Formula One's booming popularity in the United States has lured another American brand to the series as Ford said Friday it would return to the globe-trotting series as the engine provider for Red Bull Racing.

            The partnership begins with immediate technical support this season, but Ford engines in 2026 when F1 adopts new hybrid regulations that lured Ford back after a 24-year absence.

            Red Bull powertrains and Ford will partner on the development of a hybrid power unit that will supply engines to both Red Bull and AlphaTauri when new F1 regulations begin in 2026. The partnership — which is for at least eight years — was announced in New York as Red Bull unveiled the car design it will use in 2023. Red Bull won the constructors title last season, and Max Verstappen is the two-time defending world champion.











            “Red Bull is committed to winning and they’ve demonstrated that they are capable of winning,” Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford Performance, told The Associated Press. “We want to be in motorsports for the technology and for the marketing, but we want to do it winning and with the right partner. They’re committed to that, they have a winning culture.”

            Ford dominated F1 in the late 1960s and 1970s as an engine manufacturer with Cosworth and the American automaker is the third most successful engine maker in F1 history with 10 constructors’ championships and 13 drivers’ championships. Ford won 176 races and owned and ran the Jaguar F1 team until 2004 when Jaguar was sold and became Red Bull Racing.

            Ford was lured back to F1, where it competed for 38 years until it pulled out in 2004, by F1′s focus on sustainable racing and explosion in popularity throughout North America.

            “To have the ability to draw on Ford's experience, EV knowledge and depth of resource is tremendously exciting,"" said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. “From the first moment we met and spoke, it was clear there was a natural synergy between the two companies. an easy deal to put together because the desire was there from both sides.”

            Ford is the first American engine supplier to commit to F1 and its impending regulations as the series is set to race five times this year in North America, with three of those races in the United States. General Motors has announced a partnership with Andretti Global to be its engine supplier if Andretti gets an F1 team.

            “The numbers globally are enormous for Formula One,” Rushbrook told The AP. ""Especially in the United States, where the growth and diversity of the fans is enormous. That's important for us. We don't want to just race and learn technology. We need to do that. We must do that. But we also must be able to connect with fans. 

            “With Red Bull and AlphaTauri, that's exactly what we will be able to do.”

            Ford chairman Jim Farley and F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali appeared on Fox early Friday to announce Ford's return and discuss the push toward electric technology. The partnership with Red Bull was not announced until Red Bull's launch an hour later.

            “Ford is a global brand with an incredible heritage in racing and the automotive world and they see the huge value that our platform provides with over half a billion fans around the world,"" Domenicali said. ""Our commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 and to introduce sustainable fuels in the F1 cars from 2026 is also an important reason for their decision to enter F1.

            “We believe that our sport provides the opportunity and reach unlike any other and we cannot wait for the Ford logo to be racing round F1′s iconic circuits from 2026.”

            And Mohammed Ben Sulayem, head of F1 ruling body FIA, said Ford's return to the series is validation of the 2026 engine rules.

            “There are few manufacturers who have such a celebrated motorsport history as Ford, so to see them coming back to the FIA Formula 1 world championship is excellent news,” Sulayem said. ""It further underlines the success of the 2026 Power Unit Regulations that have at their heart a commitment to both sustainability and spectacle, and of course having more interest from the United States is important for the continued growth of the world’s top motorsport category.”

            The F1 2026 rule changes call for the current twin-turbo V6 engines to run on sustainable fuel and be fitted with hybrid components. 

            Red Bull will continue to race with unbranded Honda power units until 2026. Honda withdrew from F1 at the end of the 2021 season and Red Bull used its own-badged engines to win both championships in 2022. Honda still owns the intellectual property of the engines and agreed to maintain and support the powerplants until 2026.

            Porsche was set to replace Honda with Red Bull and when that deal collapsed, Ford jumped in. Ford will begin with immediate technical assistance and then supply Ford engines when the new regulations begin.

            Ford has split itself into two divisions, one to focus solely on electric vehicles and the other to handle internal combustion engines. Last year Ford laid off about 3,000 white-collar workers to help fund the multi-billion dollar transition to EVs. The company is acquiring battery minerals and setting up partnerships to build EV batteries. 

            It has announced three new battery factories in Kentucky and Tennessee. Ford expects to be able to produce electric vehicles at a rate of 600,000 per year by late this year, and hit a manufacturing rate of over 2 million per year by the end of 2026. 

            “This is the start of a thrilling new chapter in Ford’s motorsports story that began when my great-grandfather won a race that helped launch our company,” said Bill Ford, executive chair. “Ford, alongside world champions, Oracle Red Bull Racing, is returning to the pinnacle of the sport, bringing Ford’s long tradition of innovation, sustainability and electrification to one of the world’s most visible stages.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799685,Lauded rebel fashion designer Paco Rabanne dies at age 88,"PARIS (AP) — Paco Rabanne, the Spanish-born designer known for perfumes sold worldwide but who made his name with metallic space-age fashions that put a bold, new edge on catwalks, has died, the group that owns his fashion house announced Friday. 

            ""The House of Paco Rabanne wishes to honor our visionary designer and founder who passed away today at the age of 88. Among the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th century, his legacy will remain,” the statement from beauty and fashion company Puig said.

            The newspaper Le Telegramme quoted the mayor of Vannes, David Robo, as saying that Rabanne died at his home in the Brittany region town of Portsall.











            Rabanne’s fashion house shows its collections in Paris and is scheduled to unveil the brand’s latest ready-to-wear designs during the upcoming Feb. 27-March 3 fashion week.

            Rabanne was known as a rebel designer in a career that blossomed with his collaboration with the family-owned Puig, a Spanish company that now also owns other design houses, including Nina Ricci, Jean Paul Gaultier, Carolina Herrera and Dries Van Noten. The company also owns the fragrance brands Byredo and Penhaligon’s. 

            “Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic. Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women (to) clamor for dresses made of plastic and metal? Who but Paco Rabanne could imagine a fragrance called Calandre — the word means ‘automobile grill,’ you know — and turn it into an icon of modern femininity?"" the group's statement said.

            Calandre perfume was launched in 1969, the first product by Puig in Spain, France and the United States, according to the company.

            Born Francisco Rabaneda y Cuervo in 1934, the future designer fled the Spanish Basque country at age 5 during the Spanish Civil War and took the name of Paco Rabanne. 

            He studied architecture at Paris' Beaux Arts Academie before moving to couture, following in the steps of his mother, a couturier in Spain. He said she was jailed at one point for being dressed in a “scandalous” fashion.

            Rabanne sold accessories to well-known designers before launching his own collection.

            He titled the first collection presented under his own name “12 unwearable dresses in contemporary materials.” His innovative outfits were made of various kinds of metal, including his famous use of mail, the chain-like material associated with Medieval knights.

            Coco Chanel reportedly called Rabanne “the metallurgist of fashion.”

            French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, saluted “an uncommon artist who blew the wind of renewal into the world of haute couture,” his office said.

            Paco Rabanne was among the first designers to put Black mannequins on the runway, and in 1983 opened Centre 57, devoted to the Black African and Caribbean diaspora. Artists, musicians, film-makers and hip-hop dancers frequented the center for several years, the statement from Macron's office noted.

            ""My colleagues tell me I am not a couturier but an artisan, and it's true that I'm an artisan. ... I work with my hands,” he said in an interview in the 1970s.

            In the interview given when he was 43 years old and now held in France’s National Audiovisual Institute, Rabanne explained his radical fashion philosophy, revealing a dark side of his complex character.

            “I think fashion is prophetic. Fashion announces the future,” he said at the time, adding that “the future for me is catastrophic.”

            Sure enough, the designer predicted a major catastrophe on Aug. 11, 1999, claiming that the Russian MIR space station would fall on France. Instead, a crowd opened champagne at his Left Bank headquarters for a “survivors’ party.”

            Paco Rabanne retired in 2000, and the house didn’t field a runway show for five years, from 2006 until the spring-summer 2012 show. 

            But the creator has also said that women are harbingers of what lies on the horizon. 

            The president of the Association of Fashion Designers of Spain, Modesto Lomba, said Rabanne ""left an absolute mark on the passage of time. Let’s not forget that he was Spanish and that he triumphed inside and outside Spain.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799687,Analysis: Eagles weren't afraid to make difficult decisions,"The Philadelphia Eagles are playing for another Super Bowl title because they weren’t afraid to make difficult decisions following a disastrous 2020 season. 

            Just three years after hoisting the Lombardi Trophy for the first time in franchise history, the organization was at a crossroads following a 4-11-1 finish in the pandemic-altered season. Philadelphia had gone from winning it all to winning one playoff game to losing in the wild-card round to last place.

            Coach Doug Pederson and the front office didn’t see eye-to-eye. Franchise quarterback Carson Wentz was debating his future after being benched for a terrible performance in the first season of a lucrative contract extension he’d received two years earlier.











            Pederson was fired and Wentz was traded three years after finishing third in NFL MVP voting and helping put the Eagles in position to win that Super Bowl by going 11-2 before he was injured.

            Those moves laid the foundation for a rebuild that only ended up being a quick retool.

            Pederson was an excellent coach in Philadelphia, turning Chip Kelly’s mess into a championship team in just two years. He led the Eagles to a pair of division titles and three playoff appearances in five seasons.

            He took his aggressive coaching style, strong leadership skills and sharp mind to Jacksonville this season and transformed the Jaguars from doormat to AFC South champions.

            But Pederson had to go in Philadelphia because he disagreed with management on some issues, including his assistant coaches. His loyalty ended up costing him his job.

            Owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman were criticized for meddling and interfering with game plans and play-calling.

            Nick Sirianni came to Philadelphia with no fanfare after three seasons as an offensive coordinator in Indianapolis. The perception in Philly was Lurie and Roseman wanted a young coach they could mold and compel to follow their plans.

            If that was the case, it’s hard to argue with their success.

            After a rough start in 2021, Sirianni led the Eagles to a playoff berth in his first season with Jalen Hurts as the starting quarterback.

            Hurts and the rest of the team took a giant leap this season and here they are at 16-3, one win away from another parade on Broad Street.

            “This is not a time for reflection,” Hurts said after the Eagles dominated the 49ers in the NFC championship game. “It’s really hard for me to do that. I try to enjoy the moment, but my joy comes in winning. I know the job isn’t done. I never knew how far we would come, I never knew how far we’d go, but I never said it couldn’t be done.”

            The first step for management was deciding to make tough decisions. Trading Wentz meant absorbing a $33.8 million cap hit. Their next moves had to pay off for it to work out.

            Hurts came to Philly as a surprise second-round pick to provide insurance for the oft-injured Wentz and play a utility role somewhat similar to New Orleans' Taysom Hill. Now, he’s a finalist for AP MVP and Offensive Player of the Year.

            “He is a great young leader. He is a terrific young quarterback,” Lurie said. “When we drafted him it was the upside we were banking on. We thought he had a huge upside. It takes a couple years. And somebody so dedicated as Jalen and such a great teammate. Inevitably he is going to maximize everything he has and that’s what he’s done. And he’s got great teammates and great coaches.

            “I can’t understate it takes everybody. Talk about the owner, talk about the head coach, talk about the quarterback, talk about the GM. We’re only as good as the staff that we have and in a way that is the secret sauce — the culture, and the staff.”

            During Lurie’s 29 years as owner, the Eagles have reached the playoffs 17 times, advanced to the NFC title game seven times and are 1-1 in the Super Bowl going into next Sunday’s game against former coach Andy Reid and the Kansas City Chiefs.

            Lurie once proclaimed he wanted the Eagles to be the “gold standard” for NFL teams. His hometown New England Patriots filled that role for two decades with Bill Belichick and Tom Brady.

            Silver isn’t bad, though, especially in the form of a Lombardi.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4799688,"Dr Dre, Missy Elliott, Lil Wayne honored at pre-Grammy event","LOS ANGELES (AP) — As Lil Wayne was honored for his musical achievements, the rapper opened up about the little he has been recognized previously in his career during a pre-Grammy event that also paid homage to Dr. Dre and Missy Elliott. 

            “I don’t get honored,” Wayne remarked Thursday night at the Recording Academy’s Black Music Collective event in Los Angeles, where he, Dre and Elliott were given the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award. The honorees received the renamed award for their personal and professional achievements in the music industry.

            DJ Khaled presented Wayne with the award and a hug, while Drake and Deion Sanders paid tribute to him through video messages. Swizz Beatz, 2 Chainz and Tyga performed some of Wayne’s hits as well.











            During his acceptance speech, Wayne explained how the responsibility of making adult decisions was first placed on his shoulders at age 12, when he signed his first record deal with Cash Money. The 40-year-old rapper thanked his mother, the mothers of his children and his kids. 

            “Where I’m from, New Orleans, you’re not supposed to do this,” the five-time Grammy winner continued as many in the audience at the Hollywood Palladium cheered him on. “Where I’m from, I walked into my momma room when I was 14, she asked me for a kid, because my dad was killed and her son had just blew up and went on his first tour. When I came home, she said, ‘Son, I can’t live in this house by myself. We’re going to have to figure something out.'” 

            Dre talked about starting his musical journey with the initial thought of making enough money to “buy a decent pair of shoes” to wear to school. The producer-rapper recalled when he first heard hip-hop for the first time in junior high school, and spoke about his knack for collaborating. 

            “One of my passions is collaborations,” the seven-time Grammy winner said. “I never in my entire career done anything alone. I don’t even know if I want to be in the studio alone. It sounds boring.” 

            Dre was honored with performances by Snoop Dogg, Kurupt and Ty Dolla Sign. Dogg performed “Nuthin’ but a ‘G’ Thang” and “Deep Cover” before the threesome joined together to perform “Ain’t No Fun (If the Homies Can’t Have None),” which was produced by Dre. 

            Some in the audience were moved to tears by Elliott's heartfelt speech praising music executive Sylvia Rhone, who also received the impact award. 

            “She saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself,” the four-time Grammy winner said of Rhone, the Epic Records CEO who is regarded as one of the most influential executives in the industry. Rhone made history in 1994 when she was named chairman and CEO of Elektra Entertainment Group. At the time, the promotion made her the only African American and first-ever woman to hold the titles. 

            “She never told us ‘no,’” continued Elliott, who recently became the first female rapper to receive a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination. “She never told me, ‘You need to lose weight.’ She never told me, ‘You need to change your records.’”

            Chloe Bailey performed Elliott’s “One Minute Man” and sang a rendition of Aaliyah’s “One In a Million,” a song Elliott produced with Timbaland. Ciara and Tweet hit the stage to perform Elliott’s hits, while Busta Rhymes also performed in honor of Rhone.

            The event marked a celebratory night for the Black Music Collective, a group of prominent industry leaders that formed in 2020 to find ways to drive Black representation and inclusion. Some of the honorary chairs include Jimmy Jam, Quincy Jones and John Legend, who was honored with the impact award along with MC Lyte and D-Nice last year.LOS ANGELES (AP) — As Lil Wayne was honored for his musical achievements, the rapper opened up about the little he has been recognized previously in his career during a pre-Grammy event that also paid homage to Dr. Dre and Missy Elliott.“I don’t get honored,” Wayne remarked Thursday night at the Recording Academy’s Black Music Collective event in Los Angeles, where he, Dre and Elliott were given the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award.
