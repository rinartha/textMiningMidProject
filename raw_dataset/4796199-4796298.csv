https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796228,"Unprecedented profit for Exxon as travel, and war, heated up","NEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil posted record annual profits in 2022 as consumers globally struggled with high prices for gasoline, home heating and consumer goods.

            The energy giant brought in $55.7 billion in annual profits, exceeding its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008, when a barrel of oil soared close to $150. 

            Exxon's bounty came as Americans shelled out $4 per gallon for gasoline throughout most of the spring and summer with millions hitting the road. At one point gasoline topped $5 a gallon. Supplies grew tight and prices rose globally after Russia invaded Ukraine and reduced energy supplies to Europe. 











            The year marked a dramatic turnaround from 2020 when travel ground to a halt during the coronavirus pandemic and demand for fuel evaporated. That year, the price for future oil contracts plummeted below zero at one point, dozens of oil and gas companies filed for bankruptcy protection and thousands of industry workers lost their jobs. Exxon, for the first time in decades, lost money in 2020. 

            Two years later, Exxon booked $12.75 billion in profits and $95.43 billion in revenue in just its final quarter. 

            “While our results clearly benefited from a favorable market, the counter-cyclical investments we made before and during the pandemic provided the energy and products people needed as economies began recovering and supplies became tight,” said CEO Darren Woods. “We leaned in when others leaned out.”

            Exxon achieved its best-ever annual refining output in North America and the highest globally since 2012, the company said. It completed the expansion of its Beaumont Refinery in Texas and expects to be able to process 250,000 barrels per day of crude oil there in first quarter of this year.

            Much of the nation's refining capacity taken offline during the pandemic has yet to return, Woods said during a conference call with investors, which drove refining margins higher. 

            “We’ve continued to strengthen our industry-leading portfolio and increased production from high-return, advantaged assets in Guyana and the Permian, at a time when the world needed it most,” Woods said. 

            Exxon earned $3.09 per share in the quarter. That was lower than the expectations of analysts polled by Factset, who were anticipating $3.29 per share.

            The price of oil ranged between $70 to $90 for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude during the quarter. Domestic natural gas prices, which affect the cost of home energy and electricity, ranged from $6 to $7 per million British thermal units during the quarter, according to FactSet, which was a higher price than most Americans have paid in recent years.

            Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Russia’s decreased its supply of natural gas to Europe, which resulted in higher prices of natural gas and its liquid counterpart, LNG, on the global market.

            President Joe Biden has accused oil companies of profiting from the war Russia is waging on Ukraine, and has previously raised the possibility of a war profit tax on oil companies. Exxon said it incurred $1.3 billion during the quarter associated with European taxes on the energy sector and asset impairments.

            “A windfall tax on oil and gas profits is needed more than ever, to free up money that’s desperately needed to help those struggling with the cost of energy, and as economies around the world face recession,"" said Jonathan Noronha-Gant, senior campaigner with Global Witness, a nonprofit organization that advocates for environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility.

            The European Union imposed a windfall tax on energy companies last fall, and Exxon filed a lawsuit challenging the tax in December. 

            “We looked at what happened in the EU and said it both is not legal and it’s the opposite of what is needed,” Woods said Tuesday. “So what’s needed right now is more supply. And instead, what’s been put in place is a penalty on the broad energy sector.”

            Exxon also announced progress on sustainability aims, saying it achieved its goal of eliminating routine flaring in the Permian Basin during the fourth quarter, which is part of its effort to reduce emissions. Flaring is a practice where oil and gas companies burn off excess natural gas instead of capturing it.

            Exxon’s Low Carbon Solutions business recently signed a contract to capture and permanently store up to 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, Woods said. The recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which incentivizes carbon capture and storage, reinforces those plans and Exxon is planning to invest $17 billion in lower-emissions opportunities from 2022 through 2027, up from $15 billion in its prior plan, he said.

            Exxon closed 2022 on a strong note, but softer oil and natural gas prices in the fourth quarter — compared to earlier in the year — had an impact, said Peter McNally, global sector lead at Third Bridge. “The big picture here for Exxon Mobil is that the company has financial flexibility and plenty of investment options,"" McNally added.NEW YORK (AP) — Exxon Mobil posted record annual profits in 2022 as consumers globally struggled with high prices for gasoline, home heating and consumer goods.The energy giant brought in $55.7 billion in annual profits, exceeding its previous record of $45.22 billion in 2008, when a barrel of oil soared close to $150.Exxon's bounty came as Americans shelled out $4 per gallon for gasoline throughout most of the spring and summer with millions hitting the road.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796229,23 arrested in match-fixing probe in Spanish soccer,"MADRID (AP) — Nearly two-dozen people, including players, have been arrested as part of an investigation into match-fixing in lower-division soccer matches in Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar, authorities said Tuesday.

            The European Union police agency Europol said those arrested are alleged members of a betting syndicate where “several footballers are suspected of having used their position to steer the outcome of games in which they participated in.”

            Authorities said 30 games are under investigation, with profits from the betting estimated at more than 500,000 euros ($542,000).











            The arrests were made in a joint operation by Europol, Interpol and Spanish police.

            Europol said the arrests were made in November in several Spanish provinces and followed 21 arrests of members of the same organization in 2021.

            Authorities said the organization had two leaders with close connections with players and team staff.

            “The intermediaries were responsible for the coordination of the match-fixing schemes, while the corrupted athletes would provide confidential information in order to influence matches,” Europol said. “This organized crime group also relied on mules who would place sports bets at bookmakers and collect the prize money, and a network of procurers responsible for providing identities for online betting on rigged matches.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796230,Transfer deadline day: Chelsea dominates January window,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — The spending power of the Premier League was underlined as English clubs dominated the January transfer window. 

            
                No team was more active than Chelsea, which continued its record-breaking business right up until the deadline by making Enzo Fernandez the most expensive player in British soccer history in a deal worth $131 million. 

            In total the London club spent around $357 million during the midseason window as American owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital continue to make their presence felt in the transfer market. 











            Their January outlay follows on from $305 million-worth of signings in the summer after buying the club for $2.5 billion last May. 

            Chelsea spent more than top-flight teams in France, Spain, Italy and Germany combined as Europe’s other major leagues were modest in their dealings this window. 

            According to soccer data website Transfermarkt, English teams paid out around $831 million, not including loan payments, while the other four leading leagues spent around $263 million. 

            January is traditionally a difficult month to get major deals done, with prices inflated as desperation grows for teams in the hunt for trophies, European qualification or survival.

            Chelsea’s business was evidence of its determination to secure a place in next season’s Champions League after a troubled campaign so far has left it in 10th place in the standings and 10 points behind the top four.

            Even an influx of new players, including Mykhailo Mudryk, who signed from Shakhtar Donetsk in a deal worth $108 million, might not be enough to see Graham Potter’s team make up the ground. 

            The move for Fernandez came after the midfielder’s outstanding performances in Argentina’s World Cup triumph in Qatar and represents a significant increase in his valuation after moving from River Plate to Benfica last summer.

            Just how well teams have invested will become clearer in the remaining months of the season. 

            Premier League leader Arsenal strengthened its title bid with Brighton forward Leandro Trossard and a surprise deadline day move for Chelsea midfielder Jorginho. 

            Despite links with Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo, Arsenal will have to wait at least until the summer to complete that deal. 

            While the majority of the money was paid out by English clubs, one of the most intriguing signings of the window was completed by Bayern Munich with the deadline day loan capture of Manchester City fullback Joao Cancelo. 

            The German league champion’s interest only emerged on Monday, with the deal including an option to buy the Portugal international for $76 million. 

            Bayern also secured the signing of former Manchester United and Ajax defender Daley Blind on a free transfer earlier in the month as it shrewdly worked the market. 

            German clubs paid around $74 million in January.

            Barcelona - a traditional powerhouse of European soccer - was left to concentrate on keeping hold of one of its most exciting talents, rather than bringing in any major signings. 

            The Spanish league leader managed to sign Gavi up to a first team contract, which will prevent him from being able to leave for free in the summer. 

            Teams in Spain spent $30 million during the window, with Italian clubs paying out $30.89 million. 

            France's total was $128 million, which was the next highest after the Premier League.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796231,Blinken Mideast visit highlights US limitations in region,"JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank with no visible signs of progress toward halting one of the deadliest outbreaks of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years.

            The anemic outcome highlighted what appears to be the limited influence the Biden administration has over Israel’s new government, which is dominated by hard-line nationalists who oppose concessions toward the Palestinians. But it also reflected a years-long process that has turned the U.S. into little more than a conflict manager — drawing Palestinian accusations that Washington is a dishonest broker with a bias toward Israel.

            Blinken arrived in the region at a particularly tense time — ending a month in which 35 Palestinians and seven Israelis were killed.











            The bloodshed overshadowed what was meant to be a mission to establish working relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his new far-right government. Instead, Blinken spent much of his time trying to defuse tensions.

            Speaking to reporters before returning to the U.S., Blinken said both sides had voiced their readiness to restore calm and that he had instructed two senior officials to remain in the region.

            He also reiterated the long-term U.S. goal of working toward a two-state solution that would establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel under a final peace settlement. 

            “Restoring calm is our immediate task. But over the longer term, we have to do more than just lower tensions,” he said. 

            It was a familiar message expressed by a string of U.S. administrations — but based on the bitter experiences of his predecessors — one that is unlikely to bear fruit. Blinken gave no details on what steps he has in mind to promote his short-term goals or his long-term vision.

            In the short run, Blinken must contend with Israel’s most right-wing government ever — a collection of religious and ultra-nationalist politicians who oppose concessions to the Palestinians and rule out Palestinian independence.

            On the eve of Blinken’s arrival, Netanyahu’s Cabinet approved a series of punitive steps against the Palestinians in response to a pair of shootings in east Jerusalem last weekend — including an attack that killed seven people outside a synagogue in a Jewish settlement.

            These include plans to step up West Bank settlement construction, demolitions of the homes of attackers’ families as well as dozens of Palestinian homes constructed without building permits. Palestinians say such permits are almost impossible to get.

            Blinken said the U.S. would oppose “anything” that undermines hopes of a two-state solution, including settlement construction built on occupied lands sought by the Palestinians. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers now live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in 1967 and claimed by the Palestinians.

            But he gave no indication on how the U.S. might respond if Israel presses ahead with such moves, and reiterated longstanding lines about the U.S. commitment to Israel’s security and “shared values” between the countries.

            Yara Hawari, a senior analyst at Al-Shabaka, a Palestinian think tank, said Palestinian expectations for Blinken’s visit were low to begin with, and that Blinken had delivered a worn message coddling Israel.

            “It’s a textbook visit,” she said. “The U.S. is not an honest broker in this situation, so I don’t understand how it could bring anything to the table that would actually lead us toward achieving Palestinian fundamental rights.”

            In a sign of what could lie ahead if the U.S. pushes the new government, Israeli Cabinet Minister Orit Strock, a member of a religious ultra-nationalist party, lashed out at Blinken’s call for a commitment to human rights and rule of law. 

            The comments were widely seen as criticism of the government’s plans to overhaul Israel’s judicial system and weaken its Supreme Court. Critics in Israel say the plan will severely damage Israel’s democratic system of checks and balances.

            “Blinken needed to respect Israeli sovereignty. We’re not the 51st or 52nd state of the U.S.,” Strock said. 

            Blinken played down the criticism, saying he would focus on Israel’s policies, not individual personalities.

            Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington, said the blame for failed peacemaking lies with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who at 87 is seen as weak, corrupt and increasingly authoritarian after nearly 20 years in office.

            “I think this administration understands there is no one really to work with on the Palestinian side,” he said. “They have other issues to deal with.”

            The mutual lack of trust is just one of the many reasons for repeated U.S. failures in the region since the historic interim Oslo accords 30 years ago. Over the decades, the Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump administrations have all tried their hands at Mideast peace plans — with little to show beyond sporadic interventions to halt outbreaks of violence. 

            Preoccupied with the war in Ukraine and the U.S. rivalry with China, the Biden administration appears to have little desire or bandwidth to wade into a mission doomed to fail.

            Aaron David Miller, who served as an adviser to a string of Democratic and Republic administrations for over two decades, said he believes U.S. diplomats have reached the conclusion that the best they can do is damage control. “It’s trying to prevent an explosion, but they haven’t figured out how to do that,” said Miller, who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

            For the Palestinians, there has been one constant throughout all of the failed peace efforts —a U.S. unwillingness to put pressure on Israel. They say that without this pressure, Israel, as the occupier, holds all the cards and has no incentive to make concessions.

            The U.S. has confronted Israel a few times, including over a short-lived settlement construction slowdown under President Barack Obama. These instances achieved little and ended up in bitter public spats. And when the Palestinians turned to the United Nations and other international organizations, the U.S. blocked them.

            In his meeting with Blinken, Abbas appealed for more U.S. involvement, saying Israel was being given a pass ""without deterrence or accountability.” 

            “Our people will not accept the continuation of the occupation forever, and regional security will not be strengthened by violating the sanctity of the holy sites, trampling on the dignity of the Palestinian people and ignoring their legitimate rights to freedom, dignity and independence,” he said.

            AP correspondents Tia Goldenberg and Laurie Kellman contributed reporting.JERUSALEM (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel and the occupied West Bank with no visible signs of progress toward halting one of the deadliest outbreaks of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years.The anemic outcome highlighted what appears to be the limited influence the Biden administration has over Israel’s new government, which is dominated by hard-line nationalists who oppose concessions toward the Palestinians. But it also reflected a years-long process that has turned the U.S. into little more than a conflict manager — drawing Palestinian accusations that Washington is a dishonest broker with a bias toward Israel.Blinken arrived in the region at a particularly tense time — ending a month in which 35 Palestinians and seven Israelis were killed.The bloodshed overshadowed what was meant to be a mission to establish working relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his new far-right government.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796232,Millennial Money: 6 ways to move out of your parents’ house,"Nearly a quarter of millennials (22%) are living with their parents, and more than half of those living with them (55%) made the move in 2022, according to a December survey from PropertyManagement.com.

            Many said they’re back home due to high rent, money concerns or job losses — and 9 in 10 say they would move out if they made more money. 

            “It can be very frustrating for the parents and the young adult to be in a more dependent position than what their age dictates,” says Mariana Martinez, senior family dynamics consultant and vice president for Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management. “It is useful to keep in mind that there were extraordinary circumstances that led them to their current situation.”











            Here are some steps to help you find your feet again — on your own.

            1. GET CLEAR ON WHAT YOU WANT

            “I ask every client I work with, ‘What are your goals, what are you trying to accomplish?’” says Angela Moore , a financial literacy educator and coach with Modern Money Education. “And most people do not know. They’re trying to wing it.”

            Write down your intentions. Do you want to get an apartment? Buy a house? Do you want to stay in the same city? Do you want a better-paying job? 

            “When you write your goals down, it forces you to really think through them and be intentional about what you want to do,” Moore says. 

            2. MAKE A SPENDING PLAN

            Use whatever tool you like — an app, spreadsheet, etc. — to design a budget. How much do you have in savings versus debt? What are your monthly expenses? What needs to change to help you achieve your goals?

            “Find out what you need to do and how much you’re going to need in savings or money or income to make the changes needed,” Moore says.

            Use your circumstances to your advantage — but that doesn’t mean endless shopping sprees.

            “I have a client who is in this situation and the allure to still live ‘the successful’ lifestyle is strong,” says Kyle Newell , a financial adviser in Winter Garden, Florida. “Saying no to going out or finding alternatives to still have fun is key.” 

            Saving is key: Automate the process by having money transferred into savings on paydays. Be aggressive, as you’re going to need a security deposit or down payment — at the very least — to take the next step.

            3. BUILD AN EMERGENCY FUND

            Before you fly the coop, save up a cushion of three to 12 months of living expenses. If the numbers feel overwhelming, start with one month and aim to build up to three months. This might feel like overkill, but it’s a crucial safety net.

            “For most people, the reason why they’re in this situation in the first place is because they didn’t have that emergency fund,” Moore says. “You need to have that in case something happens financially, that you can still pay your mortgage, you can still pay your rent, you can still live.”

            4. BRAINSTORM WAYS TO INCREASE INCOME, IF NEEDED

            If money is an issue, you’ll have to take steps to bump up your numbers, whether that’s asking for a raise, looking for a new position or taking on a side hustle.

            Not sure where to start? A financial coach might be a good investment; many specialize in job-related advice, in addition to creating financial strategies. If you’re not in a position to hire someone, check your local nonprofits. The Financial Empowerment Center, for instance, offers free financial counseling and has more than two dozen partner locations across the country.

            5. CONSIDER HOUSING ALTERNATIVES

            In some cities, soaring rent paired with a competitive market have made it hard to find an affordable place to live. You may need to think outside the luxury condo or consider a roommate to make it easier for you to pay the rent on an apartment or house.

            “We’re seeing more and more people that are partnering up with same-age people,” says Dennis Nolte , a certified financial planner in Winter Park, Florida. “My 26-year-old stepson, who moved back to central Florida — he’s got four roommates from his church and they’re all about his age and they all have jobs.”

            With the pandemic boost to remote work, you may also be able to move somewhere cheaper to set up shop.

            Nolte recalls an acquaintance who told him she was moving to Denver with her roommate because Orlando had gotten too expensive. “I was stunned by that,” he says. “But it does make sense.”

            6. COMMUNICATE

            Even if you have the world’s best parents, moving back in with them might not have been the ideal living situation you — or they — envisioned for yourself. The arrangement can be stressful, so it’s key to keep them updated on your goals and your progress.

            “Keeping open and honest communication between the two parties is super important,” Martinez says. “The more transparent you are, the less frustration there is, because you know the person is doing what they can to change the situation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796233,Kenyan runner Rono banned 4 years for evading doping test,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Kenyan runner Georgina Rono, who was third at the Boston Marathon in 2012, was banned for four years on Tuesday for evading a doping test.

            Rono, who also has podium finishes at the Eindhoven and Frankfurt Marathons, was banned until Jan. 25, 2027. She had all her results since May 27 stripped from her record in a ruling by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya.

            Kenyan authorities are battling a doping crisis, with more than 50 athletes from the East African country currently suspended.











            The extensive problems raised fears of an all-out ban for the Kenyan athletics federation late last year but the governing body of track stopped short of that strict sanction after the Kenyan government gave guarantees to devote more funding to its anti-doping effort.

            Kenya has won the second-most Olympic medals behind the United States since 2000 but has had serious problems policing its athletes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796234,"Adult Happy Meals, McRib, feed McDonald's sales in Q4","Adult Happy Meals and other limited-time promotions boosted traffic at McDonald’s restaurants during the fourth quarter despite higher prices. But the company warned that inflation __ particularly in Europe __ will continue to weigh on its operations this year.

            Global same-store sales __ or sales at stores open at least a year __ rose 12.6% in the October-December period, the Chicago company said Tuesday. That beat Wall Street expectations for an 8.8% increase, according to analysts polled by FactSet. 

            U.S. same-store sales rose 10.3%. Sales soared in October after McDonald’s launched adult Happy Meals featuring limited-edition toys designed by the streetwear brand Cactus Plant Flea Market. Half of the toys for those meals were gone in the first four days of the promotion. 











            A “farewell tour” for the cult favorite McRib sandwich drew in more U.S. customers in November and World Cup promotions fueled double-digit increases in delivery sales in McDonald's ten largest markets.

            “Our brand is clearly in the strongest position it’s been in years, attributable in part to our best-in-class marketing engine,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said Tuesday during a conference call with investors.

            Strong sales at home helped overcome weakness in China due to government COVID-19 restrictions, yet McDonald's still opened 700 restaurants in the country last year.

            McDonald's raised prices in the fourth quarter as its costs for food, wages and energy continued to climb. But that had little impact on customer demand. Kempczinski said some lower-income consumers are ordering cheaper items or including less in each order, but they are coming more often. 

            “Overall, the consumer __ whether it’s in Europe or the U.S. __ is actually holding up better than what I would have expected a year ago or six months ago,"" Kempczinski said. But he said the company will have to remain disciplined about pricing this year to keep customers coming in.

            Ian Borden, McDonald's chief financial officer, said inflation in the U.S. appears to have peaked, but the company still expects higher-than-usual prices for food and paper this year. He doesn't expect inflation to ease in Europe until the middle of this year. 

            As a result, Borden said McDonald's expects to spend between $100 million and $150 million on temporary financial support for franchisees this year. That will result in a lower-than-expected operating margin in the 45% range, Borden said.

            McDonald's shares fell 2% on that news Tuesday morning.

            McDonald's will also be spending more heavily on store development. Kempczinski said McDonald's plans to open 1,900 restaurants globally, including 900 in China. Asked whether an influx of new restaurants will lower McDonald's same-store sales figures as it has in the past, Kempczkinsi said the company is trying to ensure that that doesn't happen.

            “I think sometimes in the past, we were looking at an absolute number and not maybe looking at the quality of the site. So that’s why we want to take some time this year to make sure we feel confident about the exact number, the pacing, the quality of the site,"" he said. 

            Kempczinski is also trying to increase McDonald's speed and efficiency with a corporate restructuring announced in January. The plan will likely include layoffs; McDonald's told employees it would share more details by April 3.

            “We have historically been very decentralized in some areas where we reinvent the wheel way too often,"" Kempczinski said. “And I think the other thing I’ve seen is we haven’t been as sharp around our global priorities, and so there’s been proliferation of priorities.""

            In one market, Kempczinski said, the company recently discovered a list of 300 priorities.

            Fourth quarter revenue fell 1% to $5.9 billion, but that still beat analysts expectations for $5.7 billion. Overseas revenue was weaker because of the strong dollar; 60% of McDonald’s sales come from outside the U.S.

            Net income rose 16% to $1.9 billion, or $2.59 per share, topping profit projections by 13 cents.Adult Happy Meals and other limited-time promotions boosted traffic at McDonald’s restaurants during the fourth quarter despite higher prices.

Kempczinski said some lower-income consumers are ordering cheaper items or including less in each order, but they are coming more often.“Overall, the consumer __ whether it’s in Europe or the U.S. __ is actually holding up better than what I would have expected a year ago or six months ago,"" Kempczinski said. But he said the company will have to remain disciplined about pricing this year to keep customers coming in.Ian Borden, McDonald's chief financial officer, said inflation in the U.S. appears to have peaked, but the company still expects higher-than-usual prices for food and paper this year. He doesn't expect inflation to ease in Europe until the middle of this year.As a result, Borden said McDonald's expects to spend between $100 million and $150 million on temporary financial support for franchisees this year. That will result in a lower-than-expected operating margin in the 45% range, Borden said.McDonald's shares fell 2% on that news Tuesday morning.McDonald's will also be spending more heavily on store development. Kempczinski said McDonald's plans to open 1,900 restaurants globally, including 900 in China. Asked whether an influx of new restaurants will lower McDonald's same-store sales figures as it has in the past, Kempczkinsi said the company is trying to ensure that that doesn't happen.“I think sometimes in the past, we were looking at an absolute number and not maybe looking at the quality of the site. So that’s why we want to take some time this year to make sure we feel confident about the exact number, the pacing, the quality of the site,"" he said.Kempczinski is also trying to increase McDonald's speed and efficiency with a corporate restructuring announced in January. The plan will likely include layoffs; McDonald's told employees it would share more details by April 3.“We have historically been very decentralized in some areas where we reinvent the wheel way too often,"" Kempczinski said. “And I think the other thing I’ve seen is we haven’t been as sharp around our global priorities, and so there’s been proliferation of priorities.""In one market, Kempczinski said, the company recently discovered a list of 300 priorities.Fourth quarter revenue fell 1% to $5.9 billion, but that still beat analysts expectations for $5.7 billion. Overseas revenue was weaker because of the strong dollar; 60% of McDonald’s sales come from outside the U.S.Net income rose 16% to $1.9 billion, or $2.59 per share, topping profit projections by 13 cents.",2023/02/01,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796235,Drugmaker Pfizer starts low with 2023 earnings forecast,"Pfizer surprised Wall Street by predicting a bigger-than-expected sales drop this year for two key products: its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment.

            The drugmaker also released on Tuesday an earnings forecast that starts off below analyst expectations as Pfizer begins what company leaders call a transition year for sales tied to the ongoing pandemic.

            Pfizer expects revenue from both the vaccine Comirnaty and the treatment Paxlovid to tumble next year before starting to rebound. That drop was anticipated by analysts as the drugmaker moves from supplying governments through big contracts to selling both products on the commercial market. 











            Pfizer said Tuesday that it expects Comirnaty sales to tumble 64% to about $13.5 billion this year. It predicts a 58% drop for Paxlovid to about $8 billion.

            That combined total of $21.5 billion falls about $3 billion short of what Wall Street expects from both products.

            Commercial sales of the vaccine and treatment are expected to start later this year in the U.S. While revenue from both will fall in 2023, analysts still expect the vaccine and treatment to each contribute billions of dollars in annual sales for the next several years.

            Overall, Pfizer predicts that adjusted earnings will range between $3.25 and $3.45 per share in the new year, when it also expects research and development expenses to jump.

            Analysts forecast earnings of $4.34 per share, according to FactSet.

            In the recently completed fourth quarter, Pfizer booked nearly half of its $24.29 billion in revenue from the top-selling COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty. The company brought in another $1.8 billion from Paxlovid.

            Outside Comirnaty and Paxlovid, Pfizer also makes several primary care drugs and cancer treatments. But vaccines have quickly become a key element of its business.

            Sales of Pfizer’s Prevnar vaccines for preventing pneumonia and related bacterial diseases also climbed 33% in the quarter to about $1.7 billion.

            The drugmaker posted overall adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share in the quarter.

            Analysts forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.05 per share on $24.38 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.

            For 2022, Comirnaty brought in $37.8 billion in worldwide sales. The company said it topped $100 billion in total revenue for the first time, even as a strong dollar hurt sales recorded outside the U.S.

            Pfizer had 10 products surpass $1 billion in sales.

            All that helped Pfizer’s full-year profit swell 43% last year to $31.4 billion.

            Shares of Pfizer Inc. climbed 14 cents to $43.69 Tuesday in midday trading while broader indexes also rose slightly.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796236,"Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia do little to solve waste problem","PRIBOJ, Serbia (AP) — In southwest Serbia, construction machines are being repurposed to clear tons of waste clogging the Potpec lake. 

            Year after year during the winter months, the lake near the southwest Serbian town of Priboj fills with tons of garbage such as plastic bottles, rusty barrels, dead animals and even furniture or home appliances. 

            That's because the Lim river feeding into the lake swells during the winter months and sweeps up trash from dozens of illegal landfills along its banks, as it flows from Montenegro to Serbia. 











            It's much the same in neighboring Bosnia's Drina river into which the Lim eventually flows. The problem spans decades and stems from poor waste management and a general lack of environmental protection safeguards across the Balkans. 

            Workers clearing the garbage with small cranes at the Potpec lake this week said the machines often break down because there is simply too much trash. Moreover, the cranes just weren't designed to pick up large chunks of wood or heavy washing machines from the water. 

             “You would not believe the things people throw into the river,” said Milan Visic, a tugboat pilot. “It is in fact much better now than it was before because we cleaned up a lot.""

            The workers say they have collected some 10,000 cubic meters (more than 353,000 cubic feet) of waste since early December. But their job is far from over as much more garbage remains piled up in the lake. . 

            Officials from Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro have on several occasions pledged to work together to solve the problem affecting their shared rivers but little has been done in reality. 

            All three countries are aspiring to join the European Union and are expected to do more for to protect their environment if their accession bids are to move forward. Another pressing issue is the extremely high level of air pollution affecting a number of cities in the region.

            The garbage problem is evident everywhere - piles of waste dot hills and valleys, trash lines roads and plastic bags twist from tree branches. Compounding the problem is that collected trash is simply dumped in a landfill and recyclables are hardly ever seperated.

            Environmental activists say tough action is needed now.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796237,China lobbies Dutch to defend trade after chip curbs,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s foreign minister appealed to his Dutch counterpart to defend free trade after the Netherlands and Japan agreed to cooperate with U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to advanced processor chip technology due to security concerns.

            The foreign ministry gave no indication Tuesday whether Qin Gang directly addressed the controls in the phone call with Wopke Hoekstra. But a ministry spokeswoman repeated complaints made earlier against the United States that other governments were trying to hurt Chinese companies.

            Qin said the Netherlands and China “should jointly maintain the stability of the international industrial chain and supply chain,” said Mao Ning. 











            Hoekstra said on Twitter he talked with Qin on Monday but gave no details.

            The United States is trying to block China from acquiring the most powerful chips and technology to help its fledgling industry make them. Washington says they can be used in weapons and to facilitate the ruling Communist Party’s surveillance and human rights abuses.

            Without naming the United States, Mao said other goverments have “deliberately blockaded and hobbled Chinese companies.” She made a similar complaint against Washington on Monday.

            “Such bullying and hegemonic practices seriously violate market principles and international trade order,” Mao said. She appealed to other governments to “make independent decisions based on their own interests.”

            A person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press on Sunday that Japan and the Netherlands agreed to join in U.S. controls.

            The Communist Party has invested billions of dollars to develop chip producers, buy they still need foreign manufacturing equipment, raw materials and other technology.

            The Netherlands is the home of ASML, the leader in extreme-ultraviolet, or EUV, technology that allows manufacturers to pack more circuits onto a chip.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796239,Adani $2.5B share sale pushes through amid fraud claims,"NEW DELHI (AP) — The closely watched $2.5 billion share sale launched by Asia’s richest man, Gautam Adani, was fully subscribed on Tuesday, bucking expectations after a turbulent week in which the conglomerate’s shares plunged in a tussle with a U.S. short-seller. 

            Before trading closed on Tuesday, over 100% of shares in the Indian group’s flagship Adani Enterprises was subscribed, according to Bombay Stock Exchange. While some Adani-linked shares went up, three were still down between 5% to 10%. 

            The share sale and its success were seen as a crucial test of investor confidence in Adani, whose sprawling empire shed tens of billions of dollars within a week after Hindenburg Research accused the conglomerate of stock market manipulation and fraud. 











            Adani, 60, has since slid on Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index from being the world’s third richest person to the 11th, as his net worth shrank more than $30 billion to an estimated $84 billion. 

            Hindenburg, which said it was betting against the Adani Group, accused it of “pulling the largest con in corporate history”. It said it judged the seven key Adani listed companies to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.” 

            The short-selling firm said its report followed a two-year investigation. Most of the allegations involved concerns about the group’s debt levels, activities of top executives, use of offshore shell companies to artificially boost share prices and past investigations into fraud. It listed 88 questions for the group to answer. 

            On Sunday, the Adani Group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations and issued a 413-page report that rejected its questions, saying none of them were “based on independent or journalistic fact finding.” Adani’s response included documents and data tables and said the group has made all necessary regulatory disclosures and has abided by local laws.

            Hindenburg responded by saying Adani had answered only 26 of its 88 questions and failed to address many of the issues it raised.

            The share sale, which began Friday, had seen mostly poor demand until Tuesday. Other Adani stocks were still down, so “it’s a mixed reaction,” said Brian Freitas, a New Zealand-based analyst with Periscope Analytics who has researched the Adani Group. The share price of Adani Enterprises, which stood at 2,948 rupees ($36) on Tuesday evening, was still below the initial price band of 3,112 rupees to 3,279 rupees. 

            Freitas said the report was unlikely to have a long-term effect on the Indian market, but could continue to cast a shadow over Adani stocks until the matter is put to rest. “Indian investors are well versed with their market - foreign investors look at global markets, so if there is an issue of corporate governance in a country, they might look at it more closely,” Freitas added. 

            Late on Monday, Abu Dhabi-based conglomerated International Holding Co. said it will make a $381 million investment into Adani Enterprises. The company, whose chairman is the United Arab Emirates' national security adviser, had invested $2 billion last year in some of Adani's subsidiaries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796249,Man United signs Sabitzer to cover for injured Eriksen,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester United completed the loan signing of midfielder Marcel Sabitzer from Bayern Munich as cover for the injured Christian Eriksen on Tuesday. 

            Eriksen could miss most of the remainder of the season because of an ankle injury, sustained during United’s 3-1 win against Reading in the FA Cup on Saturday.

            That prompted the Premier League club to look for midfield reinforcements before the January window closed, with Sabitzer flying in from Germany to sign a deal until the end of the season. 











            “Sometimes in life you have to make quick and important decisions,"" Sabitzer said. “From the moment I heard about this opportunity I knew it was right for me. I am a competitive player; I want to win and help the club achieve its aims this season.”

            Sabitzer has won 68 international caps for Austria and played 24 times for Munich this season. 

            United said Eriksen will be sidelined for “an extended period” — likely until late April or early May.

            The Denmark international has become a key figure under United manager Erik ten Hag, making 31 appearances this season.

            The former Tottenham and Inter Milan player suffered a cardiac arrest on the field at the European Championship in 2021 and needed to be resuscitated with a defibrillator. He had a cardioverter-defibrillator fitted and made his return to top flight soccer a year ago when he joined Premier League club Brentford.

            His performances for the London club led to a move to United last summer.

            Ten Hag on Tuesday said it would be difficult for United to replace Eriksen's influence.

            “Another player will always fill it in a different way but that doesn’t mean you have to be less successful,"" he said. ""It’s quite clear that Christian Eriksen brings top quality to our squad and especially he has some specifics that are hard to replace.

            “For instance, his impact in the final third with the final ball.”

            The deal for Sabitzer gives Ten Hag more options for the remainder of the campaign, with United still aiming to qualify for the Champions League as well as competing in the League Cup, FA Cup and Europa League.

            “Marcel is a player that we have watched for a long time. The opportunity arose quickly, and we knew that he was someone with the ability and character to make an impact,"" United football director John Murtough said. ""He adds further quality to our squad and experience to the dressing room.”

            United plays Nottingham Forest in the second leg of the League Cup semifinals on Wednesday, leading 3-0 after the first game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796251,"Joao Cancelo leads transfers in Germany, Isco deal off","DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Portugal left back João Cancelo’s switch to Bayern Munich brought excitement to the last day of the winter transfer period in Germany, while a surprise deal for five-time Champions League winner Isco Alarcón to join Union Berlin collapsed.

            After seeing its Bundesliga lead shrink to just a point, Bayern reacted Tuesday by signing Cancelo, who had lost his starting place at Manchester City, on a loan deal to the end of the season with a 70-million euro ($76 million) option to buy. The deal was put together in just the past few days, Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said.

            Union was on the verge of tying up an unexpected deal for the former Real Madrid star Isco, now a free agent after leaving Sevilla, but the transfer collapsed Tuesday afternoon. Union general manager Oliver Ruhnert said there had been a late attempt to change the terms of the deal.











            The deal would have been a surprise given that Union has never qualified for the Champions League and only became a top-division team in 2019, though it is second in the Bundesliga standings.

            Also Tuesday, Eintracht Frankfurt signed left back Philipp Max, a former Germany international, from PSV Eindhoven on loan with an option to buy.

            Thorgan Hazard later joined PSV on loan from Borussia Dortmund till the end of the season.

            Relegation-threatened Hertha Berlin was linked with a host of names but its search for reinforcements yielded only the return of midfielder Tolga Ciğerci.

            Otherwise it was another relatively quiet transfer window in Germany. Last season’s winter window passed without any new players joining Bayern, Dortmund or Leipzig.

            Injuries played a role this time.

            Swiss goalkeeper Yann Sommer joined Bayern after starter Manuel Neuer broke his leg skiing on vacation after the World Cup. Lucas Hernández’s severe knee injury meant Bayern needed a new defender, too. At Dortmund, the search was on for a right back after Thomas Meunier was hurt in winter training.

            Bayern spent much of January hammering out a deal to sign Sommer, whose contract at Borussia Mönchengladbach was expiring soon anyway, and snapped up free agent Dutch defender Daley Blind too — though Blind has yet to play a minute. The solution to Dortmund’s injury problem turned out to be Union Berlin’s Norwegian right back Julian Ryerson, who delighted his new team with a goal against Mainz in his second game for Dortmund.

            Bayern and Dortmund’s injury cover signings sent ripples through the league. Gladbach had another Swiss goalkeeper, Jonas Omlin, lined up immediately to replace Sommer. Union, still a contender for Champions League qualification, sprung a surprise by replacing Ryerson with Celtic’s Josip Juranović, a fullback who helped Croatia reach the World Cup semifinals.

            It wasn't the end of Union's shopping spree. Tunisia midfielder Aïssa Laïdouni from Ferencvaros and French defender Jerome Roussillon from Wolfsburg also joined.

            As usual, Dortmund had an eye on the future by signing 16-year-old Julien Duranville, who had already made his professional debut for Anderlecht, and Eintracht Frankfurt brought in 19-year-old American midfielder Paxten Aaronson. A more experienced American, defender John Brooks, returned to the Bundesliga with Hoffenheim after making little impact at Benfica in Portugal.

            There were big sales as well as signings.

            Leeds bought 20-year-old French striker Georginio Rutter from Hoffenheim in a deal that German media reported could reach 40 million euros ($43.5 million) including conditional fees. Mid-table EPL club Brentford signed speedy forward Kevin Schade from Champions League-chasing Freiburg, initially on loan but with a future transfer fee reportedly set at about 25 million euros ($27 million).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796265,American Express launches products for small businesses,"NEW YORK (AP) — American Express is launching a suite of financial service products for small businesses as it aims build up its presence in the small business sector.

            The services, called Business Blueprint, stem from the credit card giant's acquisition of fintech Kabbage in 2020. American Express had been offering small business lines of credit and other services under the Kabbage moniker, but now it will replace those with a suite of products — from a cash flow management hub to business checking accounts and lines of credit — under the name American Express Business Blueprint.

            Small businesses often have difficulty securing loans since they lack established credit scores and often don’t have a lot of capital on hand. Some fintech providers have stepped in to offer loans to small businesses, but often at steeper rates compared to traditional banks. Rates on AmEx Business Blueprint line of credit loans vary widely — from from 2% to 9% for a six-month loan to 15.75% to 27% for an 18-month loan. 











            AmEx said Business Blueprint is about more than just loans, however. It is designed to let small businesses conduct a wide range of tasks they might otherwise do separately — taking out loans, paying bills and vendors, and accepting card payments — all in one place.

            AmEx aims to be a “digital one-stop shop for small businesses financial needs,” said Anna Marrs, group president of global commercial services and credit & fraud risk at American Express. “It really marks a new chapter for American Express, the chapter on which small businesses can not only do business with American Express, but also run their businesses with Amex.”

            It’s free to sign up for Business Blueprint, and its digital financial products are available at varying rates. The service launches Tuesday.

            Alenka Grealish, principal analyst, emerging tech at research firm Celent, said the effort is part of a broader effort by financial service companies to move away from product-based offerings like one-off loans toward offering a more holistic suite of services.

            AmEx has been trying to broaden its business beyond its traditional revenue sources: fees charged to merchants that accept its card and fees paid when a customer doesn't pay off their entire charge card balance each month. On Friday, American Express reported fourth-quarter profit fell 9%, as the credit card giant had to set aside more money to cover potentially bad loans.NEW YORK (AP) — American Express is launching a suite of financial service products for small businesses as it aims build up its presence in the small business sector.The services, called Business Blueprint, stem from the credit card giant's acquisition of fintech Kabbage in 2020.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796266,"Alaska gold, copper mine blocked over environmental worries","JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took an unusually strong step Tuesday and blocked a proposed mine heralded by backers as the most significant undeveloped copper and gold resource in the world because of concerns about its environmental impact on a rich Alaska aquatic ecosystem that supports the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery.

            The move, cheered by Alaska Native tribes and environmentalists and condemned by some state officials and mining interests, deals a heavy blow to the proposed Pebble Mine. The intended site is in a remote area of southwest Alaska's Bristol Bay region, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) southwest of Anchorage. 

            The mine site is accessible only by helicopter and snowmobile in winter, developer Pebble Limited Partnership said in a permit application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. As proposed, the project called for a mining rate of up to 73 million tons a year.











            An appeal by the Pebble partnership of a separate rejection of a key federal permit is unresolved.

            In a statement, Pebble Limited Partnership CEO John Shively called the EPA's action “unlawful” and political and said litigation was likely. Shively has cast the project as key to the Biden administration's push to reach green energy goals and make the U.S. less dependent on foreign nations for such minerals.

            The Pebble Limited Partnership is owned Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. 

            The Pebble deposit is near the headwaters of the Bristol Bay watershed, which supports a bounty of salmon “unrivaled anywhere in North America,” according to the EPA.

            Tuesday's announcement marks only the 14th time in the roughly 50-year history of the federal Clean Water Act that the EPA has flexed its powers to bar or restrict activities over their potential impact on waters, including fisheries. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said his agency's use of its so-called veto authority in this case “underscores the true irreplaceable and invaluable natural wonder that is Bristol Bay.”

            The veto is a victory for the environment, economy and tribes of Alaska's Bristol Bay region, which have fought the proposal for more than a decade, said Joel Reynolds, western director and senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

            The mine would have jeopardized the region’s salmon fishery, which brings 15,000 jobs to the area and supplies about half the world’s sockeye salmon, Reynolds said. The 2022 harvest was more than 60 million fish, state officials reported last year.

            “It’s a victory for science over politics. For biodiversity over extinction. For democracy over corporate power,"" Reynolds said.

            The EPA, citing an analysis by the Army Corps of Engineers, said discharges of dredged or fill material to build and operate the proposed mine site would result in a loss of about 100 miles (160 kilometers) of stream habitat, as well as wetlands.

            The Pebble partnership has maintained that the project can coexist with salmon. The partnership's website says the deposit is at the upper reaches of three “very small tributaries” and expresses confidence any impacts on the fishery “in the unlikely event of an incident” would be “minimal.” 

            Republican Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the EPA's veto was a dangerous precedent that could affect future development in the state, while state Attorney General Treg Taylor called the agency's action “legally indefensible.""

            ""Alarmingly, it lays the foundation to stop any development project, mining or non-mining, in any area of Alaska with wetlands and fish-bearing streams,” Dunleavy said.

            Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she opposed the mine but that the EPA's veto shouldn't be allowed to jeopardize future mining operations in the state.

            “This determination must not serve as precedent to target any other project in our state and must be the only time EPA ever uses its veto authority under the Clean Water Act in Alaska,"" Murkowski said in a statement.

            Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell called the EPA's action “the final nail in the coffin for the Pebble Mine"" and the culmination of a hard fought battle.

            “Now, we will have a thriving Bristol Bay salmon run for generations to come,” she said.

            Tribes in the Bristol Bay region in 2010 petitioned the EPA to protect the area under the federal Clean Water Act. Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, said that to call the EPA announcement “welcome news is an understatement.”

            Tim Bristol, executive director with the group SalmonState, lauded the EPA’s decision, saying it “may be the most popular thing the federal government has ever done for Alaska.”

            The EPA's decision is the latest in a yearslong back-and-forth over the project that has spanned administrations.

            Leila Kimbrell, executive director for the Resource Development Council for Alaska Inc., called the decision “a dangerous abuse of power and federal overreach.” The National Mining Association, citing high demand for minerals and fragile global supply chains, said domestic mining has “never been more important.” It said EPA's decision is “in stark contrast to national and global realities.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796268,UK police chiefs apologize to Hillsborough disaster families,"LONDON (AP) — Britain's police chiefs promised a “cultural change” on Tuesday as they apologized to families of the victims in the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, the U.K.'s worst sports disaster which saw 97 people killed during a crush of soccer fans at an overcrowded stadium. 

            “For what happened, as a senior policing leader, I profoundly apologize. Policing got it badly wrong,"" said Chief Constable Andy Marsh, the College of Policing’s chief executive officer, said as the body published a response to a 2017 report into the experiences of victims' families. 

            A crush in the lower tier of Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, a city in northern England, at an FA Cup semifinal match led to the deaths of 97 Liverpool supporters on April 15, 1989. Many victims were smashed against metal fences, trampled on or suffocated in the crush.











            Authorities spent years blaming fans for the disaster, and an initial inquest ruled the deaths an accident. But a campaign by survivors and victims’ families succeeded in getting the verdicts overturned in 2012, after a far-reaching investigation that examined previously secret documents and found wrongdoing and mistakes by authorities.

            A second inquest concluded in 2016 that the victims were unlawfully killed as a result of failings by police, the ambulance service and the Sheffield Wednesday soccer team, which plays at Hillsborough Stadium. The report found that the behavior of fans didn't contribute to the deaths.

            Several former police officers and a lawyer were charged years after the disaster with attempting to pervert the course of justice, but none has been convicted.

            The National Police Chiefs Council and College of Policing said Tuesday that the code of ethics used by police forces will be reviewed. They also said there will be a new code of practice on police information and records management to prevent the problems faced after the Hillsborough disaster, when records were lost or destroyed.LONDON (AP) — Britain's police chiefs promised a “cultural change” on Tuesday as they apologized to families of the victims in the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, the U.K.'s worst sports disaster which saw 97 people killed during a crush of soccer fans at an overcrowded stadium.“For what happened, as a senior policing leader, I profoundly apologize.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796293,Broken baby Jesus statues flood restorers ahead of feast day,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — It is Maximinio Vertiz’ busy season. Dozens of beloved but worn and broken baby Jesus figurines will pass through this 49-year-old craftsman’s hands, restoring them in time for their annual pilgrimage to church for a Candlemas blessing. 

            Holding a putty knife with a steady hand, Vertiz went about this meticulous task on a day earlier this month. He touched up the sacred statue’s eyes as he tuned out the bustling downtown Mexico City street market where he worked. More than 20 other figurines lay on his worktable awaiting his repairs. 

            Similar scenes were playing out in the booths all around him as rows of busy craftsman used paint and tools to give new life to these beloved infant figurines. Some of their owners stood nearby eagerly waiting to take them back home where they will be dressed up in special-made saint costumes for Candlemas. Marking the end of Christmas celebrations, the Catholic feast day falls on Feb. 2 and commemorates the Virgin Mary’s purification and Jesus’ presentation at the temple.











            Most of the figurines – often passed down from generation to generation – spend the Christmas season in Nativity scenes displayed in homes. They are placed in creches at midnight on Christmas Day and families celebrate the occasion by swaddling the statue and rocking it while singing a lullaby. 

            They are typically handled with care, but accidents happen. Some are dropped or cracked while being dressed up. Others need their paint touched up or their missing fingers replaced. Many more come wrapped in cloths, broken into pieces. 

            “I call them puzzles,” said Vertiz, who assesses the shattered icons, determining how to make them whole again. 

            On that day earlier this month, a woman cradling a blanket approached Vertiz as he worked. Visibly sad, she opened her bundle to reveal a statue that had cracked at the neck, losing its head. Already overwhelmed with repair work and a few impatient clients, he had to turn her away. 

            The larger the figure, the easier it is to repair. It can take Vertiz anywhere from 30 minutes to fix a busted 16-inch-tall (41 centimeters) statue or up to 3 hours for a tiny one. The cost ranges from $5 to $12 per piece. 

            Vertiz, who struck out on his own in 2019, has decades of repair experience, having learned the profession from his father who also restores religious statues in the same street market.

            Catholic devotees prioritize keeping their statues of the Christ child in top condition. They believe the figures are representations of God, and form spiritual and emotional attachments with them through their annual interactions, anthropologist and restorer Katia Perdigón explains in her book, “My Baby Jesus.""

            “It is necessary to keep the effigy in good condition, taking care of it so that it does not break, or repairing it when necessary, thus reinforcing its symbolic effectiveness,” Perdigón writes. “The sculpture ... represents the presence of God at home as he becomes part of the family. He is a son in the hands of the adoptive mother.”

            Watching Vertiz work, María Concepción Sánchez, 65, hoped the repairman would finish with the three baby Jesus figures she entrusted in his care soon. One is hers and the others belong to her grandchildren.

            “The blond one he’s working on is 50 years old,” said Sánchez, whose mother used to display it at home. 

            Sánchez, whose family keeps about a dozen of these figures on their home altars, opted to have her grandchildren’s statues restored instead of buying new ones so they could preserve their tradition of passing them down through the generations. One figure had lost an arm when its clothes were changed and the other broke into pieces after being dropped on the floor. 

            Once repaired and dressed up for their Candlemas blessing, Sánchez and her family will ask their baby Jesus’ for good health, having lost several of her 18 brothers and sisters, including three who died in 2022 alone. 

            “We will dress them up like doctors and surgeons,” Sánchez said of the figures. “When one is old, you never know what might happen.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796295,Nordic unions leaving international media body over Russia,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A group of Nordic journalists' unions said Tuesday they have left the International Federation of Journalists, which the Norwegian association accused of failing to react to the existence of a Russian media union in occupied areas of Ukraine.

            For years, the unions in Norway, Denmark and Finland have been accusing the IFJ of alleged bias, corruption, undemocratic practices and lack of funding transparency. The Icelandic union also pulled out Tuesday, according to the Danish organization, while its Swedish counterpart said it has not yet made a decision to leave but could do at a later stage.

            Dag Idar Tryggestad, head of the Norwegian Union of Journalists, said in a statement that matters came to a head when the IFJ ""passively accepted that the Russian union established itself in several occupied areas in Ukraine.”











            Tryggestad claimed that the IFJ has displayed a similar approach to the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia, where Russia set up military bases after its 2008 war with Georgia. Moscow has recognized Abkhazia as an independent state, while most of the world considers it still part of Georgia.

            “It has been pointed out, but no action has been taken. We cannot be part of such an organization,” Tryggestad said.

            The Danish union leader, Tine Johansen, accused the IFJ of having “allowed the Russian member federation to pursue an aggressive course in Ukraine.”

            “We have reached a point where we say that we can no longer participate,"" she said. ""It is not an easy decision, but we cannot be a member of an international journalists’ union, which does not explicitly state freedom of the press, and whose elections and decision-making processes do not at all live up to our demands for transparency.”

            Tryggestad and Johansen also took issue with the IFJ picking Oman to hold its congress last year, arguing that freedom of the press is extremely limited in the Gulf state.

            The Nordic bodies have set up a working group to ensure their members can still receive international press cards in the future, the Danish union said.

            The Finnish Journalists' Union said it was leaving IFJ on July 31.

            “We hope our withdrawal will wake up IFJ’s other member organizations to demand changes,” said FJU head Hanne Aho.

            The Swedish Union of Journalists said that it “does not rule out an exit later this year.”

            The move by the other Nordic countries’ federations “needs to be analyzed before a decision can be made, it said.

            There was no immediate reaction from IFJ, which is the world’s largest organization of journalists, and represents 600,000 media professionals from 187 unions and associations in more than 140 countries, according to its website.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A group of Nordic journalists' unions said Tuesday they have left the International Federation of Journalists, which the Norwegian association accused of failing to react to the existence of a Russian media union in occupied areas of Ukraine.For years, the unions in Norway, Denmark and Finland have been accusing the IFJ of alleged bias, corruption, undemocratic practices and lack of funding transparency.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796296,How Myanmar is faring 2 years after army ousted Suu Kyi,"BANGKOK (AP) — Two years after Myanmar’s generals ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, thousands of people have died in civil conflict and many more have been forced from their homes in a dire humanitarian crisis. 

            Myanmar's economy, once one of the fastest growing in Southeast Asia, now lags behind where it stood before the Feb. 1, 2021, military takeover compounded the country’s struggles with the pandemic.

            Ten years earlier, Myanmar had emerged from decades of military rule, gradually transitioning to a civilian government, opening its economy to more foreign investment and entrepreneurship and relaxing censorship of the media. 











            A modern consumer culture took hold, with glitzy shopping malls in the biggest city, Yangon, and use of Facebook and cellphones the new normal. The army takeover brought thousands into the streets in peaceful protests that were suppressed with lethal force. 

            WHAT HAPPENED ON FEB. 1, 2021?

            The army arrested Suu Kyi and top members of her governing National League for Democracy party, which had won a landslide victory for a second term in a November 2020 general election. The army said it acted because there had been massive voting fraud, but independent election observers did not find any major irregularities. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, best known for his role in a 2007 crackdown on pro-democracy protests, now leads the government.

            The ouster of the civilian government provoked widespread demonstrations and civil disobedience. As weeks dragged on, security forces crushed shows of opposition with violence. So far, nearly 3,000 civilians have been killed and tens of thousands forced from their homes by fighting between security forces and civilians who took up arms, sometimes allying themselves with ethnic armed groups that have been fighting for autonomy for decades. 

            The military's seizure of power drew international condemnation. Many governments have shunned the army-led leadership and imposed sanctions, cutting off some financial flows. But neighboring countries in Southeast Asia and Myanmar's most powerful ally, China, have balked at taking such actions. 

            WHERE IS AUNG SAN SUU KYI?

            Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi, 77, was the de facto head of government, holding the title of state counsellor, when the army arrested her and took power. In December a court sentenced her to seven years in prison for corruption in the last of a string of politically tinged criminal cases against her, leaving her with a total of 33 years to serve in prison.

            Suu Kyi’s supporters and independent analysts say the numerous charges against her and her allies were an attempt to legitimize the military’s seizure of power while eliminating her from politics before an election promised for later this year.

            Suu Kyi, the daughter of Myanmar’s martyred independence hero Gen. Aung San, spent almost 15 years as a political prisoner under house arrest between 1989 and 2010. She is being held in a newly constructed separate building in the prison in the capital, Naypyitaw, near the courthouse where her trial was held. 

            WHAT IS LIFE LIKE UNDER MILITARY RULE? 

            Two years after the army seized power, life in Yangon and other big cities has inched back toward normality but fighting in much of the countryside has left the country deeply mired in civil conflict. 

            Rights advocates say the military and security forces have carried out arbitrary arrests, torture and other abuses to quash dissent. Human rights monitoring groups said Tuesday that Myanmar’s military is increasingly turning to airstrikes with deadly results to try to crush stiff armed resistance, 

            While the military is responsible for massive use of violence throughout the country, militants in the opposition have carried out bombings and assassinations of military officials and their supporters. Min Aung Hlaing on Tuesday accused opponents of army rule of trying to take power with “wrongful forcible means.” 

            The World Bank forecasts the economy will grow a meager 3% this year, with some strength in agriculture and industries such as garment making. But it remains smaller than it was in 2019, before the pandemic and then the military takeover. 

            The military's return to power has stymied a decade of reforms and left 40% of the population living in poverty. 

            Despite stringent foreign exchange controls and uncertainty over rules and regulations under army rule, some businesses are finding ways to operate by using informal payments and trade channels. The reopening of Myanmar’s trade routes with China also has helped.

            But risks have been heightened by security issues due to the civil conflict. 

            WHAT LIES AHEAD?

            The way out of the crisis remains unclear. The military-controlled government enacted a law on registration of political parties that will make it difficult for opposition groups to mount a serious challenge to army-backed candidates in the general election set to take place later this year.

            Critics have already said the military-planned election will be neither free nor fair because there is no free media and most of the leaders of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party have been arrested. 

            The party has declared it will not accept or recognize the election, which it has described as “fake” and a ploy by the military to gain political legitimacy and international recognition. The vote is also opposed by the National Unity Government, which was established by elected lawmakers who were prevented from taking their seats when the army seized power and serves as an underground parallel national administration.

            Units of the People’s Defense Force, the armed wing of the banned pro-democracy movement, have been attempting to disrupt preparations for the election by attacking personnel of the military government who are conducting a population survey that could be used to assemble voter rolls.BANGKOK (AP) — Two years after Myanmar’s generals ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, thousands of people have died in civil conflict and many more have been forced from their homes in a dire humanitarian crisis.Myanmar's economy, once one of the fastest growing in Southeast Asia, now lags behind where it stood before the Feb. 1, 2021, military takeover compounded the country’s struggles with the pandemic.Ten years earlier, Myanmar had emerged from decades of military rule, gradually transitioning to a civilian government, opening its economy to more foreign investment and entrepreneurship and relaxing censorship of the media.A modern consumer culture took hold, with glitzy shopping malls in the biggest city, Yangon, and use of Facebook and cellphones the new normal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796297,Ex-Indiana Gov. Daniels won’t seek state’s open Senate seat,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels announced Tuesday that he wouldn’t seek his state’s open U.S. Senate seat next year, ending weeks of speculation about whether he would enter a vicious Republican primary fight against a combative defender of former President Donald Trump.

            The decision by the 73-year-old Daniels comes two weeks after U.S. Rep. Jim Banks announced he was running for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Mike Braun as he makes a 2024 run for governor.

            “With full credit and respect for the institution and those serving in it, I conclude that it’s just not the job for me, not the town for me, and not the life I want to live at this point,” Daniels said in a statement released by a longtime adviser.











            The Washington-based anti-tax Club for Growth had already endorsed Banks and criticized Daniels as an insufficiently conservative “old guard Republican,” signaling a line of attack for a nasty intraparty race in the GOP-dominated state.

            Daniels, who was considered a 2012 presidential contender with a conservative fiscal reputation, ended eight years as governor in early 2013 with high approval ratings. He stayed in the public eye for the past decade as the high-profile president of Purdue University before stepping down at the end of December.

            His decision leaves Banks as the only declared candidate some 15 months ahead of Indiana’s 2024 primary.

            Banks, 43, was first elected to Congress from a heavily Republican district in northeastern Indiana in 2016, the year after he returned from an eight-month military deployment to Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve.

            He has since become a frequent Fox News Channel guest and Trump ally who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s presidential election victory after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, then the House speaker, months later rejected Republican leader Kevin McCarthy’s pick of Banks as the top GOP member on the committee investigating the deadly Capitol insurrection, citing the need to protect the review’s “integrity.”

            Rep. Victoria Spartz, in her second term from a central Indiana district, is another Republican who has stated interest in the Senate race. The Ukrainian-born Spartz has been critical at times of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began last February.

            Banks has been eager to pull at political divides. His campaign video announcement invoked disputes over transgender girls’ sports, blamed China for COVID-19 and claimed that “anti-Americanism” is being pushed in schools and the military, criticizing both “the radical Democrats and the spineless Republicans.”

            Daniels, who was President George W. Bush’s budget director and a senior executive at Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly & Co. before becoming governor, caused a stir among cultural conservatives while considering a 2012 White House run by saying the next president facing economic crisis “would have to call a truce on the so-called social issues.”

            Daniels said Tuesday that he didn’t believe he “would be well-suited to legislative office, particularly where seniority remains a significant factor in one’s effectiveness.”

            Daniels said the country faces critical problems with its national debt, the stability of safety-net programs, aggression from China and the need “to secure our borders without depriving the nation of the talent and energy that grateful immigrants can bring.”

            “I would have tried to work on these matters in a way that might soften the harshness and personal vitriol that has infected our public square, rendering it not only repulsive to millions of Americans, but also less capable of effective action to meet our threats and seize our opportunities,” Daniels said.

            Not waiting for Daniels’ decision, Donald Trump Jr. had likened Daniels to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney as a “weak RINO,” or Republican in name only. The deep-pocketed Club for Growth recently released an ad reaching back to Daniels' time as President George W. Bush’s budget director to criticize him for increasing the federal debt and calling him an “old guard Republican clinging to the old ways of the bad old days.”

            A longtime Daniels adviser knocked the Club for Growth for helping to push failed Republican candidates as the party fell short of recapturing the Senate in last year’s election.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels announced Tuesday that he wouldn’t seek his state’s open U.S. Senate seat next year, ending weeks of speculation about whether he would enter a vicious Republican primary fight against a combative defender of former President Donald Trump.The decision by the 73-year-old Daniels comes two weeks after U.S. Rep. Jim Banks announced he was running for the seat being vacated by GOP Sen. Mike Braun as he makes a 2024 run for governor.“With full credit and respect for the institution and those serving in it, I conclude that it’s just not the job for me, not the town for me, and not the life I want to live at this point,” Daniels said in a statement released by a longtime adviser.The Washington-based anti-tax Club for Growth had already endorsed Banks and criticized Daniels as an insufficiently conservative “old guard Republican,” signaling a line of attack for a nasty intraparty race in the GOP-dominated state.Daniels, who was considered a 2012 presidential contender with a conservative fiscal reputation, ended eight years as governor in early 2013 with high approval ratings. He stayed in the public eye for the past decade as the high-profile president of Purdue University before stepping down at the end of December.His decision leaves Banks as the only declared candidate some 15 months ahead of Indiana’s 2024 primary.Banks, 43, was first elected to Congress from a heavily Republican district in northeastern Indiana in 2016, the year after he returned from an eight-month military deployment to Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve.He has since become a frequent Fox News Channel guest and Trump ally who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s presidential election victory after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, then the House speaker, months later rejected Republican leader Kevin McCarthy’s pick of Banks as the top GOP member on the committee investigating the deadly Capitol insurrection, citing the need to protect the review’s “integrity.”Rep. Victoria Spartz, in her second term from a central Indiana district, is another Republican who has stated interest in the Senate race. The Ukrainian-born Spartz has been critical at times of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began last February.Banks has been eager to pull at political divides. His campaign video announcement invoked disputes over transgender girls’ sports, blamed China for COVID-19 and claimed that “anti-Americanism” is being pushed in schools and the military, criticizing both “the radical Democrats and the spineless Republicans.”Daniels, who was President George W.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796298,Justice Department seeks Tesla automated driving documents,"The U.S. Justice Department has requested documents from Tesla related to its Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” features, according to a regulatory filing.

            “To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,” Tesla said in the filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker cautioned that if the government decides to pursue an enforcement action, it could possibly have a material adverse impact on its business. 











            Messages were left Tuesday seeking comment from the Justice Department and from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department. 

            Tesla Inc. is already facing multiple investigations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for problems with its two driver-assist systems, Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving.” 

            Despite their names, Tesla still says on its website that the cars can’t drive themselves. Teslas using “Full Self-Driving” can navigate roads in many cases, but experts say the system can make mistakes, which even CEO Elon Musk acknowledges. “We’re not saying it’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel,” CEO Musk said in October.

            Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the Justice Department could be looking at safety issues with the systems, or it could be investigating Tesla claims that the cars can drive themselves when they can't.

            “When you get the car, it really can't do everything that's been promised,” Brooks said. “Tesla is putting a vehicle out on the road that is unable to perform to the capabilities claimed. Yet we have drivers relying on those promises and esentially not paying attention to the drive because they think it is more capable than it is.”

            The systems have been under investigation by NHTSA since June of 2016 when a driver using Autopilot was killed after his Tesla went under a tractor-trailer crossing its path in Florida. A separate probe into Teslas that were using Autopilot when they crashed into emergency vehicles started in August 2021. At least 14 Teslas that have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the Autopilot system. 

            Including the Florida crash, NHTSA has sent investigators to 35 Tesla crashes in which automated systems are suspected of being used. Nineteen people have died in those crashes, including two motorcyclists.

            The agency also is investigating complaints that Teslas can brake suddenly for no reason.

            “Full Self-Driving” went on sale late in 2015, and Musk has used the name ever since. It currently costs $15,000 to activate the system. Tsl

            In 2019 he promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis by 2020, and he said in early 2022 that the cars would be autonomous that year. 

            Since 2021, Tesla has been beta-testing “Full Self-Driving” using owners who haven’t been trained on the system but are actively monitored by the company. Tesla said this month that 400,000 owners are participating.

            Auto safety advocates and government investigators have long criticized Tesla’s monitoring system as inadequate. Three years ago the National Transportation Safety Board listed poor monitoring as a contributing factor in a 2018 fatal Tesla crash in California. The board recommended a better system, but said Tesla has not responded.

            NHTSA has noted in documents that numerous Tesla crashes have occurred in which drivers had their hands on the wheel but still weren’t paying attention. The agency has said that Autopilot is being used in areas where its capabilities are limited and that many drivers aren’t taking action to avoid crashes despite warnings from the vehicle.

            In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board determined in 2020 that Tesla’s system to make sure drivers are paying attention is not adequate, and it should be limited to areas where it can safely operate.
