https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835706,Why US troops remain in Iraq 20 years after 'shock and awe',"WASHINGTON (AP) — Twenty years after the U.S. invaded Iraq — in blinding explosions of shock and awe — American forces remain in the country in what has become a small but consistent presence to ensure an ongoing relationship with a key military and diplomatic partner in the Middle East.The roughly 2,500 U.S. troops are scattered around the country, largely in military installations in Baghdad and in the north. And while it is a far cry from the more than 170,000 U.S. forces in Iraq at the peak of the war in 2007, U.S. officials say the limited — but continued — troop level is critical as a show of commitment to the region and a hedge against Iranian influence and weapons trafficking.A look at America's evolving role in Iraq:HOW DID IT START?The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 in what it called a massive “shock and awe” bombing campaign that lit up the skies, laid waste to large sections of the country and paved the way for American ground troops to converge on Baghdad. The invasion was based on what turned out to be faulty claims that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized.Saddam was toppled from power, and America's war shifted the country’s governing base from minority Arab Sunnis to majority Shiites, with Kurds gaining their own autonomous region. While many Iraqis welcomed Saddam's ouster, they were disappointed when the government failed to restore basic services and the ongoing battles instead brought vast humanitarian suffering.Resentment and power struggles between the Shiites and the Sunnis fueled civil war, leading ultimately to America's complete withdrawal in December 2011. The divide was a key factor in the collapse of the nation's police and military forces when faced with the Islamic State insurgency that swept across Iraq and Syria in 2014.THE U.S. RETURNSThe rise of the Islamic State group — its roots were in al-Qaida affiliates — and its expanding threat to the U.S. and allies across Europe sent the U.S. back into Iraq at the invitation of the Baghdad government in 2014. Over that summer and fall, the U.S.-led coalition launched airstrike campaigns in Iraq and then Syria, and restarted a broad effort to train and advise Iraq's military.The coalition's train and advise mission has continued, bolstered by a NATO contingent, even after the Islamic State group's campaign to create a caliphate was ended in March 2019.The roughly 2,500 troops deployed to Iraq live on joint bases with Iraqi troops, where they provide training and equipment. That troop total, however, fluctuates a bit, and the Pentagon does not reveal the number of U.S. special operations forces that routinely move in and out of the country to assist Iraqi forces or travel into Syria for counterterrorism operations.“Iraq is still under pressure from ISIS,” said retired Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, who led U.S. Central Command and served as the top U.S. commander for the Middle East from 2019 to 2022. “We still help them continue that fight. We’ve done a lot of things to help them improve the control of their own sovereignty, which is of very high importance to the Iraqis.”WHY THE U.S. PRESENCE CONTINUESThe much-stated reason for the continued U.S. troop presence is to help Iraq battle the remnants of the Islamic State insurgency and prevent any resurgence.But a key reason is Iran.Iran's political influence and militia strength in Iraq and throughout the region has been a recurring security concern for the U.S. over the years. And the presence of American forces in Iraq makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons across Iraq and Syria into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel.The same is true for the U.S. troop presence around the al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, which is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon — and Israel’s doorstep. In both Iraq and Syria, U.S. troops disrupt what could be an uncontested land bridge for Iran to the eastern Mediterranean.U.S. troops in Iraq also provide critical logistical and other support for American forces in Syria, who partner with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces battling the Islamic State group. The U.S. conducts airstrikes and other missions targeting IS leaders, and also supports the SDF in guarding thousands of captured IS fighters and family members imprisoned in Syria.Military leaders successfully beat back efforts by then-President Donald Trump to pull all troops out of both Syria and Iraq. They argued that if anything were to happen in Syria that endangered U.S. forces, they would need to be able to quickly send troops, equipment and other support from Iraq.In a recent visit to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi leaders, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said U.S. forces are ready to remain in Iraq, in a noncombat role, at the invitation of the government.“We’re deeply committed to ensuring that the Iraqi people can live in peace and dignity, with safety and security and with economic opportunity for all,” he said.IRAQ BY THE NUMBERSBy the time Washington withdrew its last combat troops in December 2011, tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians were dead, along with 4,487 American troops.More than 3,500 troops were killed in hostile action and nearly 1,000 died in noncombat deaths from 2003 to 2011. More than 32,000 troops were wounded in action; tens of thousands more have also reported illnesses to the Department of Veterans Affairs that are believed to be linked to toxic exposure from the burn pits in Iraq. Legislation signed into law by the Biden administration has expanded the number of those veterans who will qualify for lifetime care or benefits due to that exposure.From 2003 through 2012, the United States provided $60.64 billion to fund Iraq's security forces and civilian reconstruction, according to the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Of that total, $20 billion went to funding, equipping, providing uniforms for and training Iraq's security forces.There were roughly 100,000 contractors each year in Iraq supporting U.S. forces and the U.S. mission from 2007 until 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service. As of late last year, there were about 6,500 contractors supporting U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. Central Command.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835707,Here's how an AI tool may flag parents with disabilities,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — For the two weeks that the Hackneys’ baby girl lay in a Pittsburgh hospital bed weak from dehydration, her parents rarely left her side, sometimes sleeping on the fold-out sofa in the room.They stayed with their daughter around the clock when she was moved to a rehab center to regain her strength. Finally, the 8-month-old stopped batting away her bottles and started putting on weight again.“She was doing well and we started to ask when can she go home,” Lauren Hackney said. “And then from that moment on, at the time, they completely stonewalled us and never said anything.”The couple was stunned when child welfare officials showed up, told them they were negligent and took their daughter away.“They had custody papers and they took her right there and then,” Lauren Hackney recalled. “And we started crying.”More than a year later, their daughter, now 2, remains in foster care. The Hackneys, who have developmental disabilities, are struggling to understand how taking their daughter to the hospital when she refused to eat could be seen as so neglectful that she’d need to be taken from her home.They wonder if an artificial intelligence tool that the Allegheny County Department of Human Services uses to predict which children could be at risk of harm singled them out because of their disabilities.The U.S. Justice Department is asking the same question. The agency is investigating the county’s child welfare system to determine whether its use of the influential algorithm discriminates against people with disabilities or other protected groups, The Associated Press has learned. Later this month, federal civil rights attorneys will interview the Hackneys and Andrew Hackney’s mother, Cynde Hackney-Fierro, the grandmother said.Lauren Hackney has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that affects her memory, and her husband, Andrew, has a comprehension disorder and nerve damage from a stroke suffered in his 20s. Their baby girl was just 7 months old when she began refusing to drink her bottles. Facing a nationwide shortage of formula, they traveled from Pennsylvania to West Virginia looking for some and were forced to change brands. The baby didn’t seem to like it.Her pediatrician first reassured them that babies sometimes can be fickle with feeding and offered ideas to help her get back her appetite, they said.When she grew lethargic days later, they said, the same doctor told them to take her to the emergency room. The Hackneys believe medical staff alerted child protective services after they showed up with a baby who was dehydrated and malnourished.That’s when they believe their information was fed into the Allegheny Family Screening Tool, which county officials say is standard procedure for neglect allegations. Soon, a social worker appeared to question them, and their daughter was sent to foster care.Over the past six years, Allegheny County has served as a real-world laboratory for testing AI-driven child welfare tools that crunch reams of data about local families to try to predict which children are likely to face danger in their homes. Today, child welfare agencies in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C., have considered using algorithmic tools, and jurisdictions in at least 11 have deployed them, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.The Hackneys’ story — based on interviews, internal emails and legal documents — illustrates the opacity surrounding these algorithms. Even as they fight to regain custody of their daughter, they can’t question the “risk score” Allegheny County’s tool may have assigned to her case because officials won’t disclose it to them. And neither the county nor the people who built the tool have ever explained which variables may have been used to measure the Hackneys’ abilities as parents.“It’s like you have an issue with someone who has a disability,” Andrew Hackney said in an interview from their apartment in suburban Pittsburgh. “In that case … you probably end up going after everyone who has kids and has a disability.”As part of a yearlong investigation, the AP obtained the fields of data underpinning several algorithms deployed by child welfare agencies, including some marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” offering rare insight into the mechanics driving these emerging technologies. Among the factors they have used to calculate a family’s risk, whether outright or by proxy: race, poverty rates, disability status and family size. They include whether a mother smoked before she was pregnant and whether a family had previous child abuse or neglect complaints.What they measure matters. A recent analysis by ACLU researchers found that when Allegheny's algorithm flagged people who accessed county services for mental health and other behavioral health programs, that could add up to three points to a child’s risk score, a significant increase on a scale of 20.Allegheny County spokesman Mark Bertolet declined to address the Hackney case and did not answer detailed questions about the status of the federal probe or critiques of the data powering the tool, including by the ACLU.“As a matter of policy, we do not comment on lawsuits or legal matters,” Bertolet said in an email.Justice Department spokeswoman Aryele Bradford declined to comment.NOT MAGICChild welfare algorithms plug vast amounts of public data about local families into complex statistical models to calculate what they call a risk score. The number that’s generated is then used to advise social workers as they decide which families should be investigated, or which families need additional attention — a weighty decision that can sometimes mean life or death.A number of local leaders have tapped into AI technology while under pressure to make systemic changes, such as in Oregon during a foster care crisis and in Los Angeles County after a series of high-profile child deaths in one of the nation’s largest county child welfare systems.LA County’s Department of Children and Family Services Director Brandon Nichols says algorithms can help identify high-risk families and improve outcomes in a deeply strained system. Yet he could not explain how the screening tool his agency uses works.“We’re sort of the social work side of the house, not the IT side of the house,” Nichols said in an interview. “How the algorithm functions, in some ways is, I don’t want to say is magic to us, but it’s beyond our expertise and experience.”Nichols and officials at two other child welfare agencies referred detailed questions about their AI tools to the outside developers who created them.In Larimer County, Colorado, one official acknowledged she didn’t know what variables were used to assess local families.“The variables and weights used by the Larimer Decision Aide Tool are part of the code developed by Auckland and thus we do not have this level of detail,” Jill Maasch, a Larimer County Human Services spokeswoman, said in an email, referring to the developers.In Pennsylvania, California and Colorado, county officials have opened up their data systems to the two academic developers who select data points to build their algorithms. Rhema Vaithianathan, a professor of health economics at New Zealand’s Auckland University of Technology, and Emily Putnam-Hornstein, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s School of Social Work, said in an email that their work is transparent and that they make their computer models public.“In each jurisdiction in which a model has been fully implemented we have released a description of fields that were used to build the tool, along with information as to the methods used,” they said by email.A 241-page report on the Allegheny County website includes pages of coded variables and statistical calculations.Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein’s work has been hailed in reports published by UNICEF and the Biden administration alike for devising computer models that promise to lighten caseworkers’ loads by drawing from a set of simple factors. They have described using such tools as a moral imperative, insisting that child welfare officials should draw from all data at their disposal to make sure children aren’t maltreated.Through tracking their work across the country, however, the AP found their tools can set families up for separation by rating their risk based on personal characteristics they cannot change or control, such as race or disability, rather than just their actions as parents.In Allegheny County, a sprawling county of 1.2 million near the Ohio border, the algorithm has accessed an array of external data, including jail, juvenile probation, Medicaid, welfare, health and birth records, all held in a vast countywide “data warehouse.” The tool uses that information to predict the risk that a child will be placed in foster care two years after a family is first investigated.County officials have told the AP they’re proud of their cutting-edge approach, and even expanded their work to build another algorithm focused on newborns. They have said they monitor their risk scoring tool closely and update it over time, including removing variables such as welfare benefits and birth records.Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein declined the AP’s repeated interview requests to discuss how they choose the specific data that powers their models. But in a 2017 report, they detailed the methods used to build the first version of Allegheny’s tool, including a footnote that described a statistical cutoff as “rather arbitrary but based on trial and error.”“This footnote refers to our exploration of more than 800 features from Allegheny’s data warehouse more than five years ago,” the developers said by email.That approach is borne out in their design choices, which differ from county to county.In the same 2017 report, the developers acknowledged that using race data didn’t substantively improve the model’s accuracy, but they continued to study it in Douglas County, Colorado, though they ultimately opted against including it in that model. To address community concerns that a tool could harden racial bias in Los Angeles County, the developers excluded people’s criminal history, ZIP code and geographic indicators, but have continued to use those data points in the Pittsburgh area.When asked about the inconsistencies, the developers pointed to their published methodology documents.“We detail various metrics used to assess accuracy — while also detailing ‘external validations,’” the developers said via email.When Oregon’s Department of Human Services built an algorithm inspired by Allegheny’s, it factored in a child’s race as it predicted a family’s risk, and also applied a “fairness correction” to mitigate racial bias. Last June, the tool was dropped entirely due to equity concerns after an AP investigation in April revealed potential racial bias in such tools.Justice Department attorneys cited the same AP story last fall when federal civil rights attorneys started inquiring about additional discrimination concerns in Allegheny’s tool, three sources told the AP. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the Justice Department asked them not to discuss the confidential conversations. Two said they also feared professional retaliation.IQ TESTS, PARENTING CLASSWith no answers on when they could get their daughter home, the Hackneys’ lawyer in October filed a federal civil rights complaint on their behalf that questioned how the screening tool was used in their case.Over time, Allegheny’s tool has tracked if members of the family have diagnoses for schizophrenia or mood disorders. It’s also measured if parents or other children in the household have disabilities, by noting whether any family members received Supplemental Security Income, a federal benefit for people with disabilities. The county said that it factors in SSI payments in part because children with disabilities are more likely to be abused or neglected.The county also said disabilities-aligned data can be “predictive of the outcomes” and it “should come as no surprise that parents with disabilities … may also have a need for additional supports and services.” In an emailed statement, the county added that elsewhere in the country, social workers also draw on data about mental health and other conditions that may affect a parent’s ability to safely care for a child.The Hackneys have been ordered to take parenting classes and say they have been taxed by all of the child welfare system’s demands, including IQ tests and downtown court hearings.People with disabilities are overrepresented in the child welfare system, yet there’s no evidence that they harm their children at higher rates, said Traci LaLiberte, a University of Minnesota expert on child welfare and disabilities.Including data points related to disabilities in an algorithm is problematic because it perpetuates historic biases in the system and it focuses on people’s physiological traits rather than behavior that social workers are brought in to address, LaLiberte said.The Los Angeles tool weighs if any children in the family have ever gotten special education services, have had prior developmental or mental health referrals or used drugs to treat mental health.“This is not unique to caseworkers who use this tool; it is common for caseworkers to consider these factors when determining possible supports and services,” the developers said by email.Before algorithms were in use, the child welfare system had long distrusted parents with disabilities. Into the 1970s, they were regularly sterilized and institutionalized, LaLiberte said. A landmark federal report in 2012 noted parents with psychiatric or intellectual disabilities lost custody of their children as much as 80 percent of the time.Across the U.S., it’s extremely rare for any child welfare agencies to require disabilities training for social workers, LaLiberte’s research has found. The result: Parents with disabilities are often judged by a system that doesn’t understand how to assess their capacity as caregivers, she said.The Hackneys experienced this firsthand. When a social worker asked Andrew Hackney how often he fed the baby, he answered literally: two times a day. The worker seemed appalled, he said, and scolded him, saying babies must eat more frequently. He struggled to explain that the girl’s mother, grandmother and aunt also took turns feeding her each day.FOREVER FLAGGEDOfficials in Allegheny County have said that building AI into their processes helps them “make decisions based on as much information as possible,” and noted that the algorithm merely harnesses data social workers can already access.That can include decades-old records. The Pittsburgh-area tool has tracked whether parents were ever on public benefits or had a history with the criminal justice system — even if they were minors at the time, or if it never resulted in charges or convictions.The AP found those design choices can stack the deck against people who grew up in poverty, hardening historical inequities that persist in the data, or against people with records in the juvenile or criminal justice systems, long after society has granted redemption. And critics say that algorithms can create a self-fulfilling prophecy by influencing which families are targeted in the first place.Allegheny County provided researchers at the ACLU and the nonprofit Human Rights Data Analysis Group three months of data from 2021, when the tool was live, allowing the team to audit how the algorithm had actually affected families’ scores.“These predictors have the effect of casting permanent suspicion and offer no means of recourse for families marked by these indicators,” the researchers found. “They are forever seen as riskier to their children.”As child welfare algorithms become more common, parents who have experienced social workers’ scrutiny fear the models won’t let them escape their pasts, no matter how old or irrelevant their previous scrapes with the system may have been.Charity Chandler-Cole, who serves on the Los Angeles County Commission for Children and Families, is one of them. She landed in foster care as a teen after being arrested for shoplifting underwear for her younger sister. Then as an adult, she said, social workers once showed up at her apartment after someone spuriously reported that a grand piano was thrown at her nephew who was living at her home — even though they didn’t own such an instrument.The local algorithm could tag her for her prior experiences in foster care and juvenile probation, as well as the unfounded child abuse allegation, Chandler-Cole says. She wonders if AI could also properly assess that she was quickly cleared of any maltreatment concerns, or that her nonviolent offense as a teen was legally expunged.“A lot of these reports lack common sense,” said Chandler-Cole, now the mother of four and CEO of an organization that works with the court system to help children in foster care. “You are automatically putting us in these spaces to be judged with these labels. It just perpetuates additional harm.”Chandler-Cole’s fellow commissioner Wendy Garen, by contrast, argues “more is better” and that by drawing on all available data, risk scoring tools can help make the agency’s work more thorough and effective.GLOBAL INFLUENCEEven as their models have come under scrutiny for their accuracy and fairness, the developers have started new projects with child welfare agencies in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, and Arapahoe County, Colorado. The states of California and Pennsylvania, as well as New Zealand and Chile, have also asked them to do preliminary work.And as word of their methods has spread in recent years, Vaithianathan has given lectures highlighting screening tools in Colombia and Australia. She also recently advised researchers in Denmark and officials in the United Arab Emirates on how to use technology to target child services.“Rhema is one of the world leaders and her research can help to shape the debate in Denmark,” a Danish researcher said on LinkedIn last year, regarding Vaithianathan’s advisory role related to a local child welfare tool that was being piloted.Last year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services funded a national study, co-authored by Vaithianathan and Putnam-Hornstein, that concluded that their overall approach in Allegheny could be a model for other places.HHS’ Administration for Children and Families spokeswoman Debra Johnson declined to say whether the Justice Department’s probe would influence her agency’s future support for an AI-driven approach to child welfare.Especially as budgets tighten, cash-strapped agencies are desperate to find more efficient ways for social workers to focus on children who truly need protection. At a 2021 panel, Putnam-Hornstein acknowledged that “the overall screen-in rate remained totally flat” in Allegheny since their tool had been implemented.Meanwhile, foster care and the separation of families can have lifelong developmental consequences for the child.A 2012 HHS study found 95% of babies who are reported to child welfare agencies go through more than one caregiver and household change during their time in foster care, instability that researchers noted can itself be a form of trauma.The Hackneys’ daughter already has been placed in two foster homes and has now spent more than half of her short life away from her parents as they try to convince social workers they are worthy.Meanwhile, they say they're running out of money in the fight for their daughter. With barely enough left for food from Andrew Hackney’s wages at a local grocery store, he had to shut off his monthly cell phone service. They’re struggling to pay for the legal fees and gas money needed to attend appointments required of them.In February, their daughter was diagnosed with a disorder that can disrupt her sense of taste, according to Andrew Hackney’s lawyer, Robin Frank, who added that the girl has continued to struggle to eat, even in foster care.All they have for now are twice-weekly visits that last a few hours before she’s taken away again. Lauren Hackney’s voice breaks as she worries her daughter may be adopted and soon forget her own family. They say they yearn to do what many parents take for granted — put their child to sleep at night in her own bed.“I really want to get my kid back. I miss her, and especially holding her. And of course, I miss that little giggly laugh,” Andrew Hackney said, as his daughter sprang toward him with excitement during a recent visit. “It hurts a lot. You have no idea how bad.”___Burke reported from San Francisco.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835708,Taiwan now importing eggs from 8 countries,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Wednesday (March 15) said Taiwan is importing eggs from eight countries and as both imported and domestic supplies increase, the long lines for eggs should be greatly reduced by April and the shortage should come to an end by May or June.Prior to a meeting of the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday, COA Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) fielded questions from the media about the egg situation. When asked when the shortage will be alleviated, Chen listed several reasons why he believes it will improve significantly by April.Chen said that an increase in breeding and incubation has been implemented, the weather has begun to warm up, the bird flu has been properly controlled, and domestic production capacity has been increased, alleviating the egg shortage, reported UDN. He added that more eggs will be imported this week and next week to make up for the gap in domestic production.During the Legislative Yuan session, Kuomintang Legislator Tseng Ming-chung (曾銘宗) asked Chen when the egg shortage would be completely eliminated. Chen said that domestic production capacity is recovering, the demand for laying hens is very strong, and feed consumption is increasing this month and predicted that domestic production should stabilize by May or June.Chen said in the short term, from this week until the end of March, more than five million eggs will enter the market, with even more becoming available in April.He said that due to the impact of the bird flu, Taiwan had reduced its imports of eggs, but after international producers adjusted their practices in accordance with World Organisation for Animal Health standards for avian influenza, imports rose. On March 10, Taiwan began importing eggs from eight countries, including the U.S., Australia, Japan, Brazil, Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia, according to Chen.Chen said that the industry is anticipating that the short-term shortage can be made up through imports until domestic production recovers.",2023/3/15,4242,Society

D.J. Jeffries' tip-in attempt was off target just before the buzzer.Nelly Cummings led Pitt with 15 points. Greg Elliott scored 13 and Blake Hinson added 12 as the Panthers (23-11) won an NCAA Tournament game for the first time since 2014.They slotted into the Midwest Region bracket as the 11th seed and advanced to face No. 6 seed Iowa State on Friday in Greensboro, North Carolina.""We showed toughness, resiliency,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We were who we’ve been all year, and it wasn’t pretty — but it was beautiful.”A layup by Tolu Smith gave Mississippi State a 59-58 advantage with 32 seconds left, but Pitt — after a three-minute scoring drought — grabbed the lead back on Burton's short jumper.Guillermo Diaz Graham blocked Smith’s driving layup attempt out of bounds with 2.7 seconds left, setting up the final sequence.“I did a block — I don’t even know how — with my left hand,"" the exhausted 6-foot-11 freshman said. ""I usually don’t use my left hand. And I blocked it, and I knew it was a big play, so I just let the energy go out.”Dashawn Davis had 15 points for the Bulldogs (21-13), and Moore scored 13.Burton, who spent nearly seven minutes on the bench after picking up his fourth foul, said he knew his last shot was going in.“When I had the ball in my hands the last 30 seconds or so, I just told myself I was built for it,” said Burton, who finished with six points. “And I just got to a spot and let it go, and I had complete confidence in myself. That was pretty much everything that went down.”FROM DEEPThe 3-pointers were being launched right away as the teams combined for 13 in the first half.Mississippi State, not a good outside shooting team, hit four in the first five minutes but cooled off after that. The Panthers went 8 for 13 from beyond the arc in the opening period.The teams hit just one each from long range in the second half.""Every team is going to make adjustments at halftime, so I think we had to make the same type of adjustments and realize what type of game we were in and take what the defense was giving us,” Cummings said.A GOOD LOOKMississippi State coach Chris Jans said he couldn't quarrel with the choices his players made in the last few seconds.“It was a heck of a look,” Jans said of Moore's missed 3. ""Fortunately we got it off quick enough where we had at least one tap at it. I don’t think the second one was probably in time, but at that point it’s all you can ask for, a chance — the ball is in the air — to win an NCAA Tournament game and still have enough time to get a putback.""BIG PICTUREMississippi State: Came out firing from long range, but in the second half returned to the inside game that got the Bulldogs this far. They scored 30 points in the paint.“When you outright rebound someone 49-28, you usually expect to win,"" Jans said. ""But you've got to give Pitt a lot of credit, they obviously played well enough to win. We struggled in the first half to guard them. We just couldn’t contain the 3, and it was still a one-point game.”Pitt: Were better from outside and finally managed to open a lead against Mississippi State’s solid perimeter defense.""The attention to detail we had to have to maintain that throughout the game was something that we talked about as soon as we found out who we were playing,"" Cummings said.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/15,,World

New York stretched the lead to 108-92 on former Blazer Josh Hart's layup with 7:32 left in the game.The Knicks led by as many as 19 points in the fourth.“This team was trending upwards when I got here, and I was able to just kind of fit right in and continue to help this team grow,” said Hart, who was traded to the Knicks at the deadline last month. “I think that's the biggest thing. It feels great that we're getting the wins.”Hart finished with 16 points, nine rebounds and eight assists off the bench.Damian Lillard was questionable before the game with a calf injury, but he started for Portland and led all scorers with 38 points.Jerami Grant also missed the game because of a hip contusion and Trendon Watford started for the Blazers instead.“The (Blazers) backcourt is so dynamic and puts so much pressure on you constantly. They don't go away, so very pleased overall with our defense,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. ""The rebounding was really good, and in the second half we took care of the ball.”The Knicks entered the game having lost three of their last four after a nine-game winning streak.

But, a cluster of teams vying for playoff spots in the conference meant that Portland still had a chance with 13 games to go after the loss to the Knicks.Portland led by as many as 16 points in the first half and headed into halftime up 55-49 after Lillard's 3 pointer. Lillard had 18 points at the break.Midway through the third quarter, Quickley tied it at 68 with a 3-pointer, but Lillard answered with a 3 of his own.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835719,"Honduras will seek ties with China, spurning Taiwan","TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — Honduras President Xiomara Castro announced Tuesday that her government will seek to establish diplomatic relations with China, which would imply severing relations with Taiwan. The switch would leave Taiwan recognized by only 13 countries as China spends billions to win recognition for its “One China” policy.Castro said on her Twitter account that she instructed Honduran Foreign Affairs Minister Eduardo Reina to start negotiations with China and that her intention is to “expand frontiers freely in concert with the nations of the world.”Castro said during her presidential campaign in 2021 that she would look for ties with China if elected, but once in power, her government backtracked on those comments. In January 2022, the foreign affairs minister told The Associated Press that Honduras would continue strengthening ties with Taiwan and that establishing a diplomatic relationship with China was not a priority for Castro.Reina, the foreign affairs minister, had said the government weighed up the benefits that Honduras had received from a good relationship with Taiwan and decided that there was no reason to change at that moment.In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had “expressed serious concerns to the Honduran government. Our country has made it clear to Honduras many times that Taiwan is a sincere and reliable cooperative partner to our allies. Honduras is requested to consider carefully and not fall into China’s trap or make wrong decisions that damage the long-term friendship between Taiwan and Honduras.""Taiwanese media reported that the Foreign Ministry had summoned Honduras’ Ambassador Harold Burgos for discussions. Burgos told reporters he is currently awaiting orders from his government.At a daily briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Beijing welcomed the statement from Honduras.“The fact that 181 countries in the world have established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle fully proves that establishing diplomatic relations with China is a correct choice in line with the general trend of historical development and the trend of the times,” Wang said.China claims self-ruled, democratic Taiwan is part of its territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and refuses most contacts with countries that maintain formal ties with Taiwan, and threatens retaliation against countries merely for increasing contacts.China expelled Lithuania’s ambassador, downgraded diplomatic ties and blocked trade with the Baltic country of 2.7 million people after it boosted relations with Taipei in October 2021. Lithuania has since closed its embassy in Beijing and opened a trade office in Taiwan.It's not clear what made Honduras' government change its mind. However, China, which is building a massive dam in Honduras, generally uses trade and investment as incentives for switching ties, as it has done successfully with Costa Rica, Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua and, most recently, South Pacific nations including the Solomon Islands.Taiwan supplies its dwindling number of formal diplomatic partners with agricultural experts, vocational training programs and other forms of economic aid.However, budgetary restraints imposed by the democratically elected legislature prevent it from splashing out on sports stadiums, conference halls and government buildings as China does.China's multi-billion dollar “Belt and Road"" initiative has also offered developing nations ports, railways, power plants and other infrastructure, funded by loans provided at market rates.The loss of Honduras would leave Taiwan with formal diplomatic ties just 13 sovereign states, including Vatican City. In Latin America, it also has relations with Belize and Paraguay, with most of its remaining partners being small, poor island nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific.Taiwan's sole remaining African ally is Eswanti, formerly known as Swaziland, whose Prime Minister Cleopas Sipho Dlamini visited Taiwan this month and expressed support for the island's re-admission to the United Nations and its agencies.Honduras would become the ninth diplomatic ally that Taipei has lost to Beijing since pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in May 2016. She is due to step down next year at the end of her second term.Despite China's campaign of isolation, Taiwan retains robust informal ties with more than 100 other countries, most importantly the U.S.Earlier this month, Micronesian President David Panuelo accused China of “political warfare” in a letter to other national leaders and discussed switching diplomatic allegiance from China to Taiwan in exchange for $50 million to recharge the tiny Pacific island nation's trust fund.Panuelo said China had been spying on Micronesia, offering bribes and acting in a threatening manner in an effort to ensure that if it goes to war with Taiwan, Micronesia would be aligned with China, or at least abstain from taking sides.Panuelo said Micronesia would also receive an annual $15 million assistance package and Taiwan would take over various projects that China had begun, including a national convention center, two state government complexes, and two gymnasiums.China denied the allegations, calling them a “smear.”China's diplomatic offensive has begun raising concerns in the U.S. as its rivalry with Beijing rivalry sharpens.China won over former Taiwanese Pacific allies Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in 2019, signing a security pact with the latter that would permit Chinese navy ships and security forces to maintain a presence in the country. The move drew concern from the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, as well as opposition politicians within the country.Alarmed by such Chinese gains, the Biden administration is proposing to spend billions to keep three Pacific countries in the U.S. orbit.President Joe Biden’s proposed federal budget released on Thursday includes more than $7.1 billion in funding for the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau. The money is included in the $63.1 billion request for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.The money, to be paid out over 20 years, would extend agreements with the three states under which the U.S. provides them with essential services and economic support in exchange for military basing rights and other preferential treatment. Those deals were due to expire later this year and next, and U.S. officials say China has been trying to exploit extension negotiations for its own advantage.The White House said the payments are part of its strategy to “out-compete China” and strengthen America’s alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835731,Long-used US abortion pill under threat in Texas lawsuit,"AMARILLO, Texas (AP) — A federal judge in Texas raised questions Wednesday about a Christian group's effort to overturn the decades-old U.S. approval of a leading abortion drug, in a case that could threaten the country's most common method for ending pregnancies.Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk heard more than four hours of debate over the Alliance Defending Freedom's request to revoke or suspend the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone. Such a step would be an unprecedented challenge to the FDA and its authority in deciding which drugs to permit on the market.Kacsmaryk said he would rule “as soon as possible,” without giving any clear indication of how he might decide and leaving open the possibility that the standard regimen for medication abortions might soon be curtailed throughout the country.Mifepristone, when combined with a second pill, was approved in 2000 and is used to end pregnancies until their 10th week. It has been increasingly prescribed since last summer’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.The Texas lawsuit has become the latest high-stakes legal battle over access to abortion since the question of its legality was returned to the states.Kacsmaryk, who was appointed by former president Donald Trump, saved some of his most pointed questions for attorneys representing the conservative group, which filed its lawsuit in Amarillo in anticipation of receiving a favorable ruling.“Explain to me why this court has that sweeping authority?” Kacsmaryk asked, in reference to the group's request for a preliminary order pulling mifepristone from the market.The judge also questioned whether the group had the legal standing to obtain a pretrial ruling on the drug, grilling both sides on U.S. Supreme Court cases that set out when such extraordinary relief is allowed.Still, the judge also posed questions suggesting he was considering how he might draft a preliminary injunction in the plaintiffs' favor, at one point asking the alliance's lawyers if the issue of standing had been addressed by appellate courts. At another point, he told them that their outline for the order of their arguments “tracks the elements for an injunction nicely.”Lawyers representing the FDA argued that pulling mifepristone would upend reproductive care for women across the U.S.“An injunction here would interfere with the interests of every state in the country” said Julie Straus Harris of the U.S. Justice Department, which represented the FDA.Straus Harris and her colleagues also questioned whether the alliance — which filed its case on behalf of several anti-abortion doctors — had standing to bring the lawsuit, given that none of the plaintiffs could show the type of harm typically needed for such a legal action.One of the chief arguments leveled against the FDA in the case is that the agency misused its authority when it originally approved mifepristone.The FDA reviewed the pill under its so-called accelerated approval program, which was created in the early 1990s to speed access to the first HIV drugs. Since then, it has been used to expedite drugs for cancer and other “serious or life-threatening diseases.""“The plain text is clear it applies to illnesses,” argued Erik Baptist, the alliance's lead attorney. “Mifepristone is used to end pregnancies, and pregnancy isn’t an illness.”The FDA rejected the group’s argument on multiple accounts. First, attorneys said FDA regulations make clear that pregnancy is considered a “medical condition” that can be serious and life-threatening in some cases.Second, government attorneys said the terms of mifepristone’s use were replaced more than a decade ago by subsequent FDA programs created by Congress, rendering the argument irrelevant.Finally, while the FDA reviewed the drug under its accelerated approval regime, it didn’t expedite the drug’s review. In fact, approval only came after four years of deliberation. Instead, the FDA used regulatory powers under the accelerated program to add extra safety restrictions to mifepristone.Legal experts have been deeply skeptical of many of the arguments made by the alliance. And there is essentially no precedent for a lone judge overruling an FDA drug approval decision.At one point, Kacsmaryk asked the alliance's attorneys about the possibility of suspending mifepristone's approval, without withdrawing it completely.“Any relief you grant must be complete” and apply nationwide, Baptist said. “The harms of these abortion drugs know no bounds.”Kacsmaryk gave each side two hours to make their arguments — with time for rebuttal — in the high-stakes case. Mifepristone’s manufacturer, Danco Laboratories, joined the FDA in arguing to keep the pill available.A ruling could come at any time. A decision against the drug would be swiftly appealed by the Justice Department, which would also likely seek an emergency stay to stop it from taking effect while the case proceeds.Members of the Women’s March advocacy group rallied outside the courthouse, including one person dressed as a kangaroo to decry the proceedings as a “kangaroo court.”Ultimately, courthouse officials allowed 20 members of the media and 20 members of the general public to attend the hearing.If Kacsmaryk rules against the FDA, it’s unclear how quickly access to mifepristone could be curtailed or how the process would work. The FDA has its own procedures for revoking drug approvals that involve public hearings and scientific deliberations, which can take months or years.If mifepristone is sidelined, clinics and doctors that prescribe the combination say they would switch to using only misoprostol, the other drug used in the two-drug combination. That single-drug approach has a slightly lower rate of effectiveness in ending pregnancies but is widely used in countries where mifepristone is illegal or unavailable.In addition to challenging mifepristone's approval process, the lawsuit takes aim at several later FDA decisions that loosened restrictions on the pill, including eliminating a requirement that women pick it up in person.___This story was updated to correct that the name of the plaintiff group is the Alliance Defending Freedom, not the Alliance for Defending Freedom.___Perrone reported from Washington.

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.The green technology market in India is dominated by green energy. The electric vehicles, and water and wastewater treatment are the other important market segments. The installed capacity of the green energy sector stood at 94.43 GW in FY 2021, with a target to reach 275 GW by FY 2027. In terms of sales volumes, the electric vehicles market in India reached 148,430 units in FY 2021, expanding at a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.80% during the FY 2017 and FY 2021 period. In terms of revenue, the market for water and wastewater treatment in India is estimated to reach INR 2,413.70 Bn by 2026, expanding at a CAGR of 12.03% during the 2021 2026 period.Segment insights:The green energy sector in India is dominated by solar energy, followed by wind, biomass, and small hydro. Several initiatives to promote solar parks, solar cities, and solar pumps, as well as the National Solar Mission are responsible for the remarkable increase in Indias solar capacity. In FY 2021, Indias installed capacity for solar and wind energy stood at 40.09 GW and 39.25 GW, respectively. Wind energy projects in India are concentrated in Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. The countrys aim is to attain green energy capacities of 175 GW by FY 2022 and 275 GW by FY 2027. However, factors such as supply chain disruptions because of the pandemic is likely to hinder installation targets.In FY 2021, electric two-wheelers was the largest segment in the electric vehicles market in India, accounting for ~96.91% of the total sales volume. The electric four-wheelers has gained traction owing to the gradual adoption of electric vehicles for public transport. Moreover, the growing popularity of hybrid e-cars is expected to propel the electric four-wheeler market.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-green-technology-market-in-india-2021/QI042Market influencers:The enormous potential for green energy in India, coupled with the approval of 100% FDI, has made the country an attractive destination for capital influx. During the first quarter of FY 2021, India witnessed investments worth USD 6.6 Bn. Supportive policies such as the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP) and Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME) have fostered the penetration of electric vehicles in India. In addition, investments through public-private partnerships (PPP), tax reductions, and exemptions from basic customs duty are estimated to boost the sale of electric vehicles during the forecast period.The green technology market in India is constrained by the lack of an integrated and unified policy structure and difficulties in accessing finance. There are numerous policies catering to various sub-segments of the green technology sector, which also lack in terms coordination at the state and central levels. On the other hand, green technology start-ups face challenges in acquiring early-stage funding. The stringent eligibility criteria prevent green tech entrepreneurs from availing the benefits of government schemes. Moreover, challenges in the form of grid integration, scheduling, forecasting, and power purchase agreements (PPA) impede the realization of Indias green energy potential.Impact of COVID-19:With COVID-19 infections increasing again in the first quarter of FY 2022, there were delays in the commissioning of green energy projects and halting of capacity addition programs. The sales and registration of EVs also slumped in FY 2021. The registration of new EVs dropped by 20% in FY 2021 as compared to the previous year. The negative impact of the pandemic on pulp and paper, food and beverages, power, and electronics, which are the major end-user industries, slowed down the water and wastewater treatment market.In the long term, the pandemic is anticipated to bring in several positive changes in the green technology market. Growing penetration of EVs in public transportation and increased participation of green energy sources in the energy mix are a few of them. EVs havethe potential to play a key role in lessening the economic impact of the pandemic by lowering oil import bills. On the other hand, electric mobility is projected to be the key facilitator of a sustainable growth plan of the transportation sector in a post-pandemic India.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-green-technology-market-in-india-2021/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

It provides detailed information about the structure and prospects for global and regional industries. In addition, the report includes data on research & development, new product launches, product responses from the global and local markets by leading players.

Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Market insights:In 2020, India was the third-largest consumer of oil, accounting for ~5.3% of the global oil consumption. Oil and gas jointly accounted for ~35% of the country’s overall energy mix in 2020. Oil consumption in India stood at 4,669 thousand barrels per day in 2020 and is projected to reach 6,132.28 thousand barrels by 2026, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4% during the 2021 2026 period.Production insights:As of 2020, there were 4.5 Bn barrels of proven oil reserves and 1.33 Trn cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves in India. In 2020, India accounted for ~0.9% of the global oil production and ~0.6% of the global natural gas production. The production of oil and natural gas has fallen since 2018. The low productivity of aging oilfields and falling prices have led to a decline in production volumes. Production slumped further in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unavailability of workers, restrictions on mobility, low offtake from key consumers, and closure of offshore gas fields had a massive impact on production in 2020. However, the governments impetus to increase the share of natural gas in the energy mix and to reduce import bills is expected to foster the production of natural gas during the forecast period.Consumption insights:A rapidly growing population, industrialization, and urbanization contributed to the steady increase in oil and natural gas consumption. India is heavily reliant on imports to meet its demand for oil and gas ~80% of oil demand and ~50% of natural gas demand are met through imports. In 2020, mainly in the second quarter of CY 2020, stringent lockdowns because of the pandemic impacted the demand for oil and gas in the transportation and industrial sectors.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-oil-and-gas-market/QI042Market influencers:The growth of the Indian oil and gas industry has been driven by an increasing population, rise in per capita income, and rapid urbanization. A significant developments in infrastructure, coupled with the ease of doing business, has motivated the entry of key foreign players such as BP plc, Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), and Total SA. The positive outlook of the Indian transportation sector played an instrumental role in supporting the growth of the oil and gas industry. Light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles are the leading consumers of oil and gas, followed by aircraft, marine, and rail. Exploration of novel and unconventional sources using frontier oil-producing technologies will boost production. However, factors such as reductions in domestic production, heavy reliance on imports, dominance of state-owned companies, and limited infrastructure investments are impeding market growth.Impact of COVID-19:The oil and gas industry has been experiencing massive difficulties because of the international price war on one side, and the pandemic on the other. These will have a substantial impact on the domestic market, both in the short and long term. The nationwide and state-wise lockdowns led to a sharp dip in mobility, transportation, and industrial activities, resulting in a slump in oil consumption. Low demand for oil, gas, and refined products will result in a supply-demand imbalance and a consequent price drop in the near future.
In the long run, the market is predicted to gain momentum. However, excess supply is likely to be predominant in the global market. Laying off of workers because of the pandemic is likely to result in labor shortages during the revival phase. The focus of the industry is expected to shift towards low-cost and short-cycle sources over the forecast period. Expansion of innovative segments like shale oil and shale gas, adoption of new business models, and market consolidation are projected to be the long-term trends in the market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-oil-and-gas-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Cement consumption is projected to reach about 419.92 million tons in FY 2027.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth.

The structured analysis offers a graphical representation and a diagrammatic breakdown of the India Non-alcoholic Beverages Market by region.The non-alcoholic beverages market in India was valued at INR 336.50 Bn in FY 2020. It is expected to reach INR 1,131.52 Bn by FY 2027, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~18.69% during the forecast period.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-non-alcoholic-beverages-market/QI042The product portfolio, future growth strategies, and cutting-edge developments are all included in the study. Market report information is presented in this report for the given past time frame. The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Major Market Players such as Dabur Limited have introduced their offering of immunity-boosting vegan-friendly drinks such as Dabur Giloy Neem Juice, Dabur Amla Juice, and Daburs ImuDab Syrup.Segment insights:The non-alcoholic beverages market is categorized into two segments carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. The carbonated beverages market segment was valued at INR 134.60 Bn in FY 2020 and is expected to reach a value of INR 349.64 Bn by FY 2027, expanding at a CAGR of ~15.12% during the FY 2022 FY 2027 period. The non-carbonated beverages segment in India was valued at INR 153.33 Bn in FY 2020. It is expected to reach INR 781.88 Bn by FY 2027, expanding at a CAGR of ~20.52% during the FY 2022 FY 2027 period.The carbonated beverages segment is anticipated to lose its market share during the forecast period because of the massive expansion of the non-carbonated beverages segment. Over the past few years, non-cola aerated drinks have gained popularity, especially fruit drinks. Leading manufacturers are reshaping their corporate strategies to suit consumers’ concerns regarding health. The non-carbonated beverages segment has grown exponentially due to improved health consciousness among consumers and increased affordability.Impact of COVID-19:With the onset of the second wave of the pandemic in April 2021, the non-alcoholic beverages industry faced the immediate challenges due to the closing of all outlets that hampered their supply chain. Key industry players introduced new drinks and increased door-to-door deliveries to drive sales. Due to the disruptions in global supply chains, the government introduced significant policies by imposing the strict FSSAI guidelines for quality assurance and management of food products. Indian manufacturers of carbonated beverages witnessed their worst quarter between April and June 2021. However, during the second wave of COVID-19, there was a steep rise in the sale of non-carbonated beverages, especially in segments such as packaged drinking water, primarily because of improved health awareness. The disrupted supply chains of prominent brands during the nationwide lockdown paved the way for regional players to increase their shares in local markets though having small supply channels, and direct-to-trade incentives marketing.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-non-alcoholic-beverages-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Yellow Brass Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

After more than two years of pandemic, global economy began to recover, entering 2022, the Russian Federations invasion of Ukraine and its global effects on commodity markets, supply chains, inflation, and financial conditions have steepened the slowdown in global growth. In particular, the war in Ukraine is leading to soaring prices and volatility in energy markets, with improvements in activity in energy exporters more than offset by headwinds to activity in most other economies. The invasion of Ukraine has also led to a significant increase in agricultural commodity prices, which is exacerbating food insecurity and extreme poverty in many emerging market and developing economies.Numerous risks could further derail what is now a precarious recovery. Among them is, in particular, the possibility of stubbornly high global inflation accompanied by tepid growth, reminiscent of the stagflation of the 1970s. This could eventually result in a sharp tightening of monetary policy in advanced economies to rein in inflation, lead to surging borrowing costs, and possibly culminate in financial stress in some emerging market and developing economies. A forceful and wide-ranging policy response is required by policy makers in these economies and the global community to boost growth, bolster macroeconomic frameworks, reduce financial vulnerabilities, provide support to vulnerable population groups, and attenuate the long-term impacts of the global shocks of recent years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bis347623In this complex international situation, Report Ocean published Tobacco Warning Package Market Status, Trends and COVID-19 Impact Report 2022, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the global market , This Report covers the manufacturer data, including: sales volume, price, revenue, gross margin, business distribution etc., these data help the consumer know about the competitors better.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835837,Plug in and you’re ready to stream: Sennheiser Profile USB microphone provides ease of use and best-in-class audio,"WEDEMARK, GERMANY -  Media OutReach - 15 March 2023 -   Today, Sennheiser is launching the Profile USB microphone, a cardioid condenser microphone that presents an easy and stylish solution for streaming and podcasting. It combines professional sound with direct accessibility of all functions, allowing streamers, podcasters and gamers to fully focus on their content. The side-address microphone is available as a table stand version (HKD 1150, MSRP) and as the Profile Streaming Set with a 3-point self-locking boom arm (HKD 1800, MSRP). Both models are shipping from today.            Putting audio quality and ease of use first   At the heart of the Profile USB microphone is an award-winning Sennheiser condenser capsule, the KE 10. Its cardioid pick-up pattern provides the typical attenuation of sound coming from the rear, making sure that the streamer's voice is in focus.   In designing the Profile, product managers Benny Franke and Dennis Stegemerten also put an emphasis on ease of use. ""When you are recording your podcast or doing a live stream, you already have to worry about the content, perhaps room treatment, the camera set-up, interaction with your audience – the last thing you need in this situation is a complex audio set-up"", explains Franke. ""So we tried to create tech that gets out of the way of your creative process.""   Stegemerten continues, ""The design is simple and efficient and does not overwhelm you. Profile is simply plugged into the USB-C port of your computer or tablet – your device will automatically recognize the microphone, and it's ready to capture your voice. There is no need for an interface or any software, no additional window to keep open so that you can control the mic settings. One intuitive touch of a control directly on the mic – that's all that is needed.""   At its front, the Profile USB Mic features a soft-touch, no-noise mute button, a gain control for the microphone volume, a mix control to set the balance between your voice and the computer/tablet audio, plus a volume control for headphone monitoring. Headphones or earphones can be connected via a 3.5 mm socket at the back of the Profile USB microphone.   LED rings on the Profile conveniently signal the operating status. When the LED ring around the gain control is green, the mic is ready to go. When the same light ring turns yellow at times or all of the time, the mic is clipping and you need to reduce the mic volume. When the microphone has been muted, light rings around the mute button and the gain control light up red.       LED rings on the Profile USB microphone immediately show users the operating status     Mic placement made easy  ""Right out of the box, the Profile delivers a natural, warm sound that accentuates the body and presence of your voice. Interestingly enough, you can even hear this difference on platforms that compress the audio,"" explains Franke. ""Having a great capsule is essential for this – but placing the microphone correctly is just as important. It should be positioned within 15 cm (6 in) from your mouth or the sound source to ensure both clarity and warmth.""   The Profile can be tilted for optimum positioning, the self-locking joint will ensure that the mic stays in position. 3/8"" and 5/8"" connectors at the bottom allow the mic to be used with third-party table stands. Users who are looking for more sophisticated placement possibilities should opt for the Profile Streaming Set, which comes with a 3-point self-locking boom arm. With its sleek and modern design, including integrated cable management, the boom arm is ideal for any on-camera applications.   Stegemerten concludes: ""To round things off, Profile is made from metal, so it will be a rugged audio companion throughout – no matter whether you're just getting started or are a seasoned pro and looking to simplify your set-up.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835845,Second US congressional delegation in two months arrives in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A six-member U.S. congressional delegation arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday (March 15) for a two-day visit.

            Led by Representative Ken Calvert, the group also consists of Representatives Tom Cole, Steve Womack, David Joyce, Ed Case, and Mike Garcia. They are scheduled to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) and National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo (顧立雄) to discuss ways to bolster Taiwan-U.S. security, economic, and trade cooperation.

            The delegation will also be treated to a banquet by Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮).

            The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said the six representatives are important friends of Taiwan and have strengthened Taiwan-U.S. security cooperation and supported Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. They also have pushed for a bilateral trade agreement, the ministry said.











            Their visit demonstrates strong backing from congress for Taiwan regardless of party affiliation, MOFA said. It pledged to continue working closely with congress and the White House to “steadily deepen the Taiwan-U.S. partnership in various fields.”

            The delegation will depart on March 16.

            Last month, a bipartisan delegation of four U.S. congressmen, Ro Khanna, Tony Gonzales, Jake Auchincloss, and Jonathan Jackson, traveled to Taiwan to discuss boosting links between Taiwan and the U.S. tech industries.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A six-member U.S. congressional delegation arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday (March 15) for a two-day visit.Led by Representative Ken Calvert, the group also consists of Representatives Tom Cole, Steve Womack, David Joyce, Ed Case, and Mike Garcia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835846,"Taiwan exports to India break records in 2021, 2022","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s exports to India broke records for two consecutive years, with electronic parts taking the top spot, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday (March 15).Exports to India reached a total value of US$4.52 billion (NT$138.32 billion) in 2021, growing 74.3% from the previous year. Growth continued by 17.6% to reach US$5.32 billion in 2022.Both figures were records for the period since 1981, when data began to be stored for trade between Taiwan and India, per CNA. The rising trend also did not stop at the end of 2022, as exports for Jan.-Feb. 2023 showed a 43.5% surge from the same period last year to US$1.03 billion.Apart from increasing, the nature of the export products has also changed, according to the MOEA. Products from the chemical and plastics industries once took up the majority of exports to India, but now, parts for the electronics sector amounted to 34.2% for the first two months of 2023, almost double the amount from 2022.During 2022, India’s imports rose by 26.2% overall, with products from Taiwan surging by 35.2%, compared to 17.1% for imports from China, 21.3% for South Korea, and 9.1% for Japan.",2023/3/15,1102,Business
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835847,Kings get boost from power play in 5-2 win over Islanders,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Drew Doughty and Alex Iafallo scored on the power play as part of a four-goal outburst in the second period, and the Los Angeles Kings defeated the New York Islanders 5-2 on Tuesday night.Blake Lizotte, Trevor Moore and Quinton Byfield also scored for Los Angeles. Joonas Korpisalo made 26 saves, and the Kings improved to 6-0-1 in their past seven games.“They’re more committed, they’re more calculated with the risk that they’re willing to take on the ice. And lo and behold, they’re scoring more, so it’s working well that way right now,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said.Pierre Engvall and Jean-Gabriel Pageau each had a goal, but the Islanders have dropped their past two games following three straight wins as part of a five-game point streak. Ilya Sorokin allowed four goals on 36 shots.“We've just got to bounce back,” Engvall said. “I think we had some really good periods in the game.”The Kings took charge on special teams after the Islanders lost their composure early in the second when Matt Martin was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after throwing a helmet during a scrum. Following a subsequent kneeing call against Zach Parise, Doughty buried a one-timer set up by Anze Kopitar during the 5-on-3 power play for a 2-1 lead.Iafallo made it 3-1 one minute later, tapping in the rebound after Viktor Arvidsson hit the post for his 10th goal of the season.“We just got a little sharper, a little faster,” McLellan said of the 2-for-2 showing with the man advantage.That was enough for Los Angeles to continue its home-ice dominance, posting a 10-3-1 record since the start of 2023. In their past eight outings at Crypto.com Arena, the lone blemish for the Kings was a shootout loss to Nashville on Saturday.“It didn’t go as planned there in the second,” Engvall said. “Obviously, it’s something we want to do better.”With a top-10 power play giving them an extra lift they lacked last season, operating at 27.6% efficiency at home (34 for 123), Moore isn’t surprised the Kings are in mix for the Pacific Division title and best record in the Western Conference .“We still have to be the better 5-on-5 team, but now we have the added boost of having really good special teams, and I think it shows,” Moore said.STABILITY IN NETKorpisalo has won all three starts since he was traded to the Kings from Columbus on Feb. 28, allowing two goals in each of those outings.“There’s a calmness to him,” McLellan said. “He’s a veteran. ‘I’ve been here before. Let me do my job.’ And I think it rubs off on the players, and the players have played well around our goaltenders.”BACK AT ITPageau, who cut it to 4-2 late in the second, had missed the past 12 games because of an upper-body injury. He played 13:39, centering the third line and getting extensive work on the power play and penalty kill, but was disappointed in his return after being at fault on Iafallo's winning goal.“I looked myself in the mirror and I think I have better, so I'll be better tomorrow,” he said.NOTES: Lizotte tied his career high with his 10th goal and reached the 30-point mark for the first time in four seasons. … Engvall has scored in consecutive games, his first two points in five games since being acquired from Toronto. … Islanders D Ryan Pulock had two assists.UP NEXTIslanders: At Anaheim on Wednesday night.Kings: Host Columbus on Thursday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835850,Watchdog pledges 'demanding' oversight of nuclear sub deal,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the global nuclear regulatory agency pledged Wednesday to be “very demanding” in overseeing the United States' planned transfer of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, amid complaints that the U.S. move could clear the way for bad actors to escape nuclear oversight in the future.Rafael Grossi, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, spoke to reporters during a Washington visit. Grossi was also meeting with senior National Security Council officials to discuss matters including the newly announced deal among the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom on nuclear-powered submarines.President Joe Biden and the leaders of Australia and the United Kingdom announced Monday in San Diego that Australia would purchase nuclear-powered attack submarines from the U.S. to modernize its fleet amid growing concern about China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific. It would be the first transfer by a nuclear-weapon state of nuclear-powered submarines to a non-nuclear state.Nuclear-powered submarines move more quietly and for longer than conventionally powered ones. While strengthening the military position of the U.S. and its allies in that region, the deal has raised concern as the first in the decades-long span of nuclear non-proliferation accords to take advantage of a loophole that allows narrow use of nuclear material outside of set safeguards. Critics express concern that bad actors could use the loophole as cover, pointing to the U.S.-Australia deal as precedent, to divert nuclear material into a weapons program.China renewed its objections to the deal on Wednesday, accusing the three countries of “coercing” the IAEA into endorsing the arrangement. All member states of the IAEA should work to find a solution to the “safeguards issues” and “maintain international peace and security,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily briefing.Grossi rejected China’s accusation. “Nobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA,” he told reporters. AUKUS — the name used by the three-country grouping of the U.S., Australian and the United Kingdom — had “committed to the highest standard of transparency” in the deal, he said.“We are going to be very demanding on what they are planning to do,” Grossi said. “So the process starts now.”The architects of nuclear nonproliferation accords left open a loophole for use of nuclear material for some non-explosive military purposes, with nuclear naval propulsion in mind. Prior to withdrawing nuclear material from safeguards for that loophole, states are required to strike a separate agreement with the IAEA.Biden said Monday, “we have set the highest standards with the IAEA for verification and transparency, and we will honor each of our countries’ international obligations.""James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he had no doubt that Australia would be scrupulous in its management of the nuclear material transferred to it in the deal with the United States. But there was no guarantee other states would be as transparent, he said.“I do worry that a future state, a nefarious state, may announce that it’s removing nuclear materials and safeguards for naval reactors and then use it to develop nuclear weapons,” Acton said.U.S. objections in the past helped dissuade Canada when it considered nuclear-powered submarines.Iran has repeatedly expressed interest to the IAEA in developing nuclear naval propulsion.Iran's claims that its fast-accelerating nuclear program is for civilian purposes are widely discounted. U.N. experts say Iran has enriched uranium to 84% purity, just short of weapons grade, though they say Iran is still months away from the ability to build a weapon.Separately, the IAEA says Iran pledged this month to restore cameras and other monitoring equipment at its nuclear sites and to allow more inspections at a facility where particles of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade were recently detected.Grossi said Wednesday he was sending a technical team for the work and that the process of stepping up monitoring and inspections would start within days.Meanwhile, in Australia on Wednesday, former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating launched a blistering attack on his nation’s plan to buy nuclear-powered submarines from the United States, saying “it must be the worst deal in all history.”Speaking at a National Press Club event in Australia, Keating said the submarines wouldn't serve a useful military purpose.""The only way the Chinese could threaten Australia or attack it is on land. That is, they bring an armada of troop ships with a massive army to occupy us,” Keating said. “This is not possible for the Chinese to do.”He added that Australia would sink any such Chinese armada with planes and missiles.“The idea that we need American submarines to protect us,” Keating said. “If we buy eight, three are at sea. Three are going to protect us from the might of China. Really? I mean, the rubbish of it. The rubbish.”___Associated Press writer Chris Megerian contributed to this report.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835852,'Nazi' references: BBC sportscaster's tweet revives debate,"NEW YORK (AP) — The references seem endless, and they can come from anywhere. In recent days, Pope Francis compared Nicaragua's repression of Catholics to Adolf Hitler's rule in Germany. In Britain, a BBC sportscaster likened the nation's asylum policy to 1930s Germany, resulting in his brief suspension and a national uproar.For Holocaust and anti-Nazi scholars and organizations, the two sentiments were understandable — but concerning. Invoking Hitler and Nazi Germany, they warn, often serves to revive a familiar and unwelcome line of argument.“We have to be aware of, and confront, contemporary instances of discrimination, hate speech and human rights abuses across the world,” says Rafal Pankowski, a Polish sociologist who heads the anti-Nazi NEVER AGAIN Association. But he added: “Of course, the historical analogies must not be overused and devalued. The label `Nazi' should not be trivialized and reduced to a term of abuse against anybody we don’t like.”Last week, Pope Francis was quoted as criticizing the government in Nicaragua, where religious leaders have been arrested or fled, for acting as “if it were a communist dictatorship in 1917 or a Hitlerian one in 1935.” Nicaragua responded by proposing to suspend Vatican ties.Around the same time, the BBC's Gary Lineker tweeted that a new asylum policy announced by Britain's Conservative government was “immeasurably cruel” and included language ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s.”The bill, intended to stop tens of thousands of migrants a year from reaching the country in small boats across the English Channel, would bar asylum claims by anyone who reaches the United Kingdom by unauthorized means and compel the government to detain and deport them “to their home country or a safe third country.”At first, the broadcaster suspended Lineker, its highest paid TV commentator. But it reversed itself on Monday and praised Lineker as a “valued part of the BBC.”ALTERNATIVE WORDINGPeter Fritzsche, author of “An Iron Wind: Europe Under Hitler,” among other books, calls Lineker's comments poorly expressed and misguided, given that ""Nazi Germany had no immigration policy""."" Rather than comparisons to the Nazis, Fritzsche believes Lineker would have been better off describing the policy with the words ""racist” or “inhumane.”“Great Britain, in its rhetoric about immigrants and its policies regarding asylum-seekers ... generates quite rightly enormous outrage, because we believe Great Britain is in the family of democratic humane nations,” says Fritzsche, a history professor at the University of Illinois. “The sportscaster’s sentence is inaccurate. The spirit is laudable.”Sometimes, scholars and activists say, events do call for Nazi comparisons, whether it's the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 or the annual Independence Day march in Warsaw, Poland, organized by extreme-right groups. But Nazi references have also been used to criticize fiscal policy (anti-tax activist Grover Nordquist once invoked the Holocaust when criticizing estate taxes) or insult rival heads of state (Saudi Arabia and Iran recently re-established diplomatic ties, six years after Prince Mohammed bin Salman referred to Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the “new Hitler”).On the internet, Nazis have been mentioned so often, and for so long, that in 1990 author-attorney Mike Godwin formulated “Godwin's Law” for them: “As an online discussion continues, the probability of a reference or comparison to Hitler or Nazis approaches 1.” They come up so often that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C., has crafted a standard response, which it cited when contacted this week by The Associated Press.""Nazism represented a singular evil that resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews and the persecution and deaths of millions of others for racial and political reasons,"" the statement reads.“Comparing contemporary situations to Nazism is not only offensive to its victims, but it is also inaccurate and misrepresents both Holocaust history and the present,"" the statement says. ""The Holocaust should be remembered, studied, and understood so that we can learn its lessons; it should not be exploited for opportunistic purposes.”A RANGE OF REFERENCESNazi references can be outlandish (actress Megan Fox once compared “Transformers” director Michael Bay to Hitler); self-evident (Kanye West, who years ago complained of being looked at like “he was Hitler,” declared in 2022 that there were “good things about Hitler""); and strategic (Russian President Vladimir Putin listed “denazification” of Ukraine as one of the main goals of his “special military operation,” falsely alleging that there are Nazis in Ukraine’s leadership).The Putin accusation isn’t new. It has been part of the Kremlin’s propaganda effort for years, used to justify a Moscow-backed insurgency in Ukraine’s east and bash Kyiv’s pro-Western government, which took over after a popular uprising ousted a pro-Russian president in 2014.Analysts say the narrative appears to play well in Russia, where the Soviet army’s defense against Nazi Germany forces in World War II is still a fundamental part of the national identity. Officials and state media routinely use the term “Nazi” to describe the Ukrainian government and its army.Moscow’s rhetoric has prompted some international backlash. Asked in an interview with an Italian news channel about Russian claims that it invaded Ukraine to “denazify” the country, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Ukraine could still have Nazi elements even if some figures, including the country’s president, were Jewish.“So when they say, ‘How can Nazification exist if we’re Jewish?’ In my opinion, Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it doesn’t mean absolutely anything. For some time we have heard from the Jewish people that the biggest antisemites were Jewish,” Lavrov said, speaking to the station in Russian, dubbed over by an Italian translation.Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid called Lavrov’s statement “unforgivable and scandalous and a horrible historical error,” adding that “the government of Russia needs to apologize.”In Israel, the Holocaust is seen as unique, and comparisons to the Nazis or Nazi Germany in the modern context are typically dismissed as cheapening the victims' memory. But comparisons do happen. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has likened Iran to Nazi Germany, and ultra-Orthodox protesters call the police in Israel “Nazis” when they arrest people.Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, says Lineker’s comparison is flawed. The Conservatives’ proposal, he says, is more like the British policy toward Holocaust survivors who tried to enter British Mandate-era Palestine after 1945 on boats such as the Exodus — and were turned back.The larger issue, Zuroff says, is that people like Lineker cite the Holocaust to draw attention to their own issues. Perhaps, Zuroff says, the BBC figure “should be punished by being put in a library and forced to read 10 accurate history books.”_____AP journalists Vanessa Gera, Daria Litvinova and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835857,"Wall Street falls on new bank fears, bond yields plunge","NEW YORK (AP) — Markets shuddered Wednesday on worries about a spreading banking crisis and how badly it will hit the economy, and stocks and bond yields fell on both sides of the Atlantic.The S&P 500 sank as much as 2.1% before ending the day with a loss of 0.7%, while markets in Europe fell more sharply as shares of Switzerland’s Credit Suisse dropped to a record low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 280 points, or 0.9%, after dropping as much as 725 points. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.1% after erasing a steep decline.Markets trimmed their losses toward the end of the day as the Swiss National Bank said it could provide some assistance to Credit Suisse “if needed.”But that came only after a steep drop for Credit Suisse rattled investors worldwide. Its shares in Switzerland sank 24.2% following reports that its top shareholder won’t pump more money into its investment. The bank has been fighting troubles for years, including losses it took related to the 2021 collapse of investment firm Archegos Capital.“They've had issues,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. “It's just coming at a time when there’s more uncertainty and there’s less confidence in the banking system.”Wall Street’s harsh spotlight has intensified across the banking industry recently on worries about what may crack next following the second- and third-largest bank failures in U.S. history over the last week. Stocks of U.S. banks tumbled again Wednesday after enjoying a brief, one-day respite on Tuesday.The heaviest losses were focused on smaller and midsize banks, which are seen as more at risk of having customers try to pull their money out en masse. Larger banks also fell, but not by quite as much.First Republic Bank sank 21.4%, a day after soaring 27%. JPMorgan Chase slid 4.7%.Many analysts are quick to say the current weakness for banks looks nowhere near as bad as the 2008 crisis that torpedoed the global economy. But worries are nevertheless rising that pain spreading through the banking system could spark a downturn.“When you have worries about contagion and a financial crisis, there is increasing risk of a global recession,” Saglimbene said, pointing to the first drop in the price of U.S. crude oil below $70 per barrel since late 2021. A weaker economy would burn less fuel.“The regional banks are so important to small businesses, midsized businesses” by providing loans, he said. ""They're a centerpiece of the economy.""Much of the damage for banks is seen as the result of the Federal Reserve’s fastest barrage of hikes to interest rates in decades. The Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from virtually zero at the start of last year, in hopes of driving down painfully high inflation.Higher rates can tame inflation by slowing the economy, but they raise the risk of a recession later on. They also hurt prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. That latter factor was one of the issues hurting Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed Friday, because high rates forced down the value of its bond investments.The Fed's fusillade of rate hikes over the year have shocked the system following years of historically easy conditions. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pointed to prior eras of rising rates that led to “spectacular financial flameouts,” such as the yearslong savings and loan crisis.“We don’t know yet whether the consequences of easy money and regulatory changes will cascade throughout the U.S. regional banking sector (akin to the S&L Crisis) with more seizures and shutdowns coming,” he wrote.Some of this week’s wildest action has been in the bond market, where traders are rushing to guess what all the chaos will mean for future Fed action. On one hand, stress in the financial system could push the Fed to hold off on hiking rates again at its meeting next week, or at least refrain from the larger rate hike it had been potentially signaling.On the other hand, inflation is still high. While taking it easier on interest rates could give more breathing space to banks and the economy, the fear is such a move by the Fed could also give inflation more oxygen.Weaker-than-expected economic reports released Wednesday may have allayed some of those worries. One showed that inflation at the wholesale level slowed by much more last month than economists expected. It’s still high at a 4.6% level versus a year earlier, but that was better than the 5.4% that was forecast.Other data showed that U.S. spending at retailers fell by more than expected last month. Such data could raise worries about a recession on the horizon, but they may also take some pressure off inflation in the near term.That caused the yield on the two-year Treasury to plummet. It tends to track expectations for the Fed, and it dropped to 3.89% from 4.25% late Tuesday. That’s a massive move for the bond market. The two-year yield was above 5% just a week ago, at its highest level since 2007.In Europe, indexes tumbled on weakness from banks. France’s CAC 40 dropped 3.6%, and Germany’s DAX lost 3.3%. The FTSE 100 in London fell 3.8%.On Wall Street, companies in the oil and gas business had the sharpest stock drops. Helping to cushion the blow were gains for several Big Tech stocks. They've had their own struggles recently, but they tend to benefit from lower interest rates.All told, the S&P 500 fell 27.36 points to 3,891.93. The Dow lost 280.83 to 31,874.57, while the Nasdaq rose 5.90 to 11,434.05.——AP Business Writers Joe McDonald and Matt Ott contributed.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835862,"After clashes, Pakistani police pause siege at ex-PM's home","LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — After clashing with supporters of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan outside his home for a second day Wednesday, police paused their efforts to arrest the ousted premier for failing to appear in court last week on graft charges.Police had besieged the 70-year-old opposition leader’s house in the eastern city of Lahore since Tuesday as his supporters hurled rocks and bricks, and swung batons snatched from officers. Police fired tear gas and clashes went on into the afternoon Wednesday before subsiding.Violence was also reported between Khan's supporters and police in other major cities, including Karachi, Islamabad, the garrison city of Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Quetta and elsewhere in Pakistan. The government sent additional police to Lahore's upscale area of Zaman Park, where Khan lives.Earlier Wednesday, Khan had emerged from his house to meet with supporters, who had faced tear gas and police batons through the night to defend him from arrest. He said he was ready to travel to Islamabad on March 18 under the arrest warrant, but that police did not accept the offer.Khan later posed for cameras seated at a long table, showing off piles of spent tear gas shells he said had been collected from around his home.“What crime did I commit that my house has been attacked like this,” he tweeted. Fawad Chaudhry, a senior party leader from Khan’s party claimed hundreds of Khan’s supporters were injured.At the Islamabad High Court, Khan's lawyer Khawaja Haris petitioned for the suspension of the warrants for the former premier but the court denied the motion.Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament in April, was ordered to appear before a judge in Islamabad on Friday to answer charges of illegally selling state gifts he had received during his term as premier and concealing his assets.The former premier has avoided appearances in court since November, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in eastern Punjab province, claiming he was not medically fit to travel from Lahore to Islamabad to face indictment.Last week, he went to Islamabad to appear before three courts, but failed to appear before the fourth court to face indictment in the graft case, which is a legal process for starting his trial.Khan has claimed that the string of cases against him, which includes terrorism charges, are a plot by the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, to discredit the former cricket star turned Islamist politician.The situation in Lahore calmed in early afternoon and the police stepped back, apparently to ease tensions. This encouraged more Khan supporters to join those outside and inside his home. Many chanted Allahu akbar, the Arabic phrase for “God is great” as Khan, still wearing a gas mask, greeted them.Azhar Siddique, another lawyer for Khan, said the Lahore High Court ordered police to halt the operation outside Khan’s home until Thursday, though they would remain deployed nearby.The Punjab provincial government said Wednesday that more than 100 police officers were injured in clashes with Khan’s supporters. They denied Khan’s allegation that officers were using live bullets.From his home, Khan urged followers on Tuesday to fight on even if he is arrested. “They think this nation will fall asleep when Imran Khan is jailed,” he wrote on Twitter. “You need to prove them wrong.” On Wednesday, he tweeted that there was a plot “to abduct & assassinate” him.Prime Minister Sharif on Wednesday criticized Khan in televised remarks, saying that the ex-premier “considers himself above the law, and he has been defying court orders to avoid arrest.” Sharif insisted he had nothing to do with the arrest warrant, which he said was a court order and the police were only complying with it.In Pakistan’s turbulent political history, at least seven former prime minister have been arrested in various cases and tried by courts since this South Asian country was created in 1947 after gaining independence from British colonial rule.Former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was hanged by the military government in 1979 after his ouster in a coup. His daughter, Benazir Bhutto, served twice as prime minister and was assassinated during an election rally in 2007 in the garrison city of Rawalpindi.Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan’s longest-serving premier and the brother of current prime minister, was in office from 1990 to 1993 and from 1997 to 1999, when was ousted in a military coup by Gen. Pervez Musharraf. He returned as premier in 2013 but was ousted by the country’s Supreme Court in 2017. He was later arrested, tried and convicted in a corruption case, although he has always denied the charges and today lives in exile in Britain.___Ahmed reported from Islamabad.",2023/3/16,,World

But this confluence of fashion, designers, celebrities and buyers is hardly possible without an army of people furiously working behind the scenes to make sure the show goes smoothly.At Lakme Fashion Week x FDCI, India’s premier fashion event's backstage was buzzing as everyone from the hair and makeup artists to the stylists and the designer raced to get that perfect look that would stand out on the catwalk. Clothes and makeup were strewn around as the models went through last-minute fittings of shoes, and their faces and bodies were adorned with jewelry and given finishing touches.Organizing fashion weeks can be intense and chaotic, with months of preparation. Concept, styling, clothes — everything is scrutinized with a critical eye in the fiercely competitive Indian fashion industry.With multiple shows lined up for each day of the production, there were frayed nerves and tense moments as models waited for their turn to go on stage.The elaborately designed runway is where it all came together. Every sway of the garment is caught on the celebrity audience's cellphone cameras and amplified through their social media posts.“Fashion has long served as a window towards social change as it reflects and influences the cultural, economic, and political climate of the society,” Sunil Sethi, chief of the Fashion Design Council of India, said in a press statement.This season’s Lakme Fashion Week x FDCI had a sharper focus on sustainability and circular fashion, with designers focusing on minimal waste generation through reusing and recycling materials during production. Many designers are also trying to bring back traditional Indian fabrics such as Khadi, a hand-woven cotton fabric.Conversations around sustainability have dominated recent discourse in the industry, with growing awareness of environmental concerns within the fashion ecosystem and the need to revive artisanal textiles and craftsmanship techniques.The popular biannual event brings together both established industry names and emerging talent, along with hundreds of brands and stakeholders. Among the fashion designers who presented their creations at the Lakme Fashion Week in March were Manish Malhotra, Namrata Joshipura, Rahul Mishra, Nitin Bal Chauhan, Ranna Gill, Rina Dhaka, JJ Valaya, Tanieya Khanuja and Varun Nidhika.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835864,NRL enforces 11-day stand down for players after concussions,"SYDNEY (AP) — The National Rugby League on Wednesday said any player diagnosed with a concussion will be automatically sidelined for 11 days in one of the biggest changes to its player safety protocols in nearly a decade.The Australian Rugby League Commission, which administers the NRL, met on Tuesday to determine updates to the game’s concussion policy. The rules will come into effect from Thursday’s third-round opener between Manly and Parramatta.Under the new 11-day shutdown rule, players who have sustained a concussion will be guaranteed to miss the following weekend’s match, and potentially a second game depending on the schedule.Players will only be able to return sooner in exceptional circumstances, after being given approval from an NRL-appointed independent neurologist.The rules come into effect as Australian rules football players in the Australian Football League initiated a class-action suit against the league, seeking up to one billion Australian dollars ($670 million) in damages. More than 200 former players are expected to be part of the court action.The NRL said its changes are about player safety rather than legal threats, following advice from experts and after watching worldwide trends.“There is no greater priority for us than player safety. It’s front and center of everything we do,” ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys said. “Our current head injury protocols are exceptionally strong.""Following a review of the data and the expert advice we have received, the commission have enhanced these protocols even further by providing a mandatory 11-day stand down period following a diagnosed concussion.”The updated protocols mark the biggest change to the NRL’s approach to concussions since the introduction of the head injury assessment system in 2014. They bring rugby league into line with the governing body for international rugby union, which last year introduced an 11-day shutdown period.Manly coach Anthony Seibold on Wednesday approved of the move by the NRL, having seen the World Rugby system first-hand in the 15-a-sode code during his time as an assistant coach with England.“I have experienced it before and would have no qualms with it,” Seibold said. “It’s about protecting the players and protecting their health, both in the short-term and long-term.”The changes come days after the latest concussion sustained by Kalyn Ponga of the Newcastle Knights. Ponga has had four concussion in 10 months.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World

Taiwanese legislators expressed concerns that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) deliberately timed the diplomatic defection to interfere with Tsai's trip to the U.S.Castro claimed that this move was ""a sign of my determination to comply with the Government Plan and expand the borders freely in concert with the nations of the world."" On Wednesday morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a press release saying it had received information on the matter and had expressed ""serious concerns"" to the Honduran government and warned it to ""not fall into China's trap.""That same morning, the Foreign and National Defense Committee, Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng (邱国正), and Lieutenant General of the National Security Bureau (NSB) Chen Chin-kuang (陳進廣) fielded questions from legislators. Kuomintang Legislator Chen I-shin (陳以信) asked whether there was any ongoing military cooperation between Taiwan and Honduras, given that it has only been a year since Taiwan Vice President Lai Ching-te (賴清德) attended Castro's inauguration.Chiu responded that there are not any current military cooperation projects involving the two countries. However, he said there are Honduran military cadets in Taiwan, and Taiwan also has a military attachment stationed in Honduras.As Tsai prepares to make a stopover in the U.S. on her way to Central and South America, Chen asked whether the MND and NSB believed that the CCP is attempting to sabotage her trip. Chiu responded by saying that the MND has not studied and assessed the CCP's measures in depth, but it ""does not rule out the possibility, and the enemy should not be underestimated.""Chen Chin-kuang said the CCP has never stopped wooing countries that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan and also could not rule out that the timing was intentional.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4835899,First major US railroad merger in 2 decades will go forward,"The first major railroad merger in more than two decades, one that would link the United States, Canada and Mexico, was approved by federal regulators Wednesday.Canadian Pacific’s $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern will combine the two smallest of the nations seven major railroads after an arduous two-year review from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.The bar for railroad mergers in the U.S. was raised substantially at the start of the century after a disastrous combination of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific in 1996 that snarled rail traffic for an extended period, followed by the 1999 split of Conrail between Norfolk Southern and CSX, which created backups in the East.Railroads and safety have become a national political fight this year following a fiery derailment that forced evacuations in Ohio last month, and the safety track record of both Canadian Pacific and Kansas City Southern were poured over throughout the extended review process.The Transportation Board said that the new railroad ""will facilitate the flow of grain from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast and Mexico, the movement of intermodal goods between Dallas and Chicago and the trade in automotive parts, finished vehicles, and other containerized mixed goods between the United States and Mexico.""The combined company will have little to no track redundancies or overlapping routes, and is also expected to add more than 800 new union jobs in the U.S., according to the board.The new single-line service is expected to ""foster the growth of rail traffic, shifting approximately 64,000 truckloads annually from North America’s roads to rail, and will support investment in infrastructure, service quality, and safety,"" the board said.“The Board is well cognizant of the recent elevated level of public concern stemming from the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and as always, the Board has carefully analyzed the proposed merger from a safety perspective.""It said that Canada Pacific has the best safety record of any Class I railroad over the past 15 years and that the combined record for both railroads of preventing hazardous material releases on average exceeds any record affiliated with using trucks or any other railroad.“Any rail traffic diverted to (Canadian Pacific-Kansas City Southern) from other railroads will mean traffic likely moving to a railroad with a better safety record,” the board said.Canadian Pacific outmaneuvered Canadian National railroad in 2021 to complete the deal even though Canadian National offered $33.6 billion for Kansas City Southern. Canadian National lost out in the bidding war because the Surface Transportation Board rejected part of its plan to acquire Kansas City Southern.Regulators said in a report earlier this year that the only major impact of the deal would be an increase in noise in places where train traffic is expected to increase significantly. The Surface Transportation Board essentially rejected concerns that the deal would create problems in towns along the tracks by blocking crossings for extended periods of time or clog the already busy rail network around Chicago and create problems for commuter trains.A coalition of several suburban Chicago cities opposed the merger, fearing that blocked crossings would lead more commuters to drive, rather than using the area's Metra rail network.The biggest traffic increases are expected between Chicago and Laredo, Texas, with some of the rail lines across Iowa predicted to see more than 14 additional trains a day and the tracks between Kansas City, Missouri, and Beaumont, Texas, likely to see about 12 more trains a day.But the Surface Transportation Board determined that the expected increase in train traffic across the new railroad’s network will only add seconds to the average delay when the time a crossing is blocked is averaged out over all the vehicles that pass through a crossing every day, including all the ones that are never stopped.The railroad industry is under pressure to improve safety in the wake of last month’s Norfolk Southern potentially dangerous derailment in Ohio that prompted evacuations and created lingering health concerns. The major freight railroads have announced several steps they plan to take, but that may not be enough to satisfy regulators and members of Congress who are pushing for broad reforms.Even after this merger, the new Canadian Pacific Kansas City railroad will be the smallest of the major freight railroads with about 20,000 miles of track.The rest of the industry is expected to remain stable with two major railroads in the Western United States — Union Pacific and BNSF — two in the Eastern United States — CSX and Norfolk Southern — and Canadian National running trains across Canada and parts of the United States.The only recent deal involving one of the major railroads is the 2010 purchase by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway of BNSF, but that deal faced less scrutiny because it wasn’t a merger of two rivals. A couple years before the Kansas City Southern deal, Canadian Pacific had attempted unsuccessfully to buy both Norfolk Southern and CSX.Shares of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. jumped 5% Wednesday.",2023/3/16,,World

Under the Social Order Maintenance Act, this practice can be penalized with detention of up to three days or a maximum fine of NT$18,000.Lawmakers also demanded changes to the Development of the Cultural and Creative Industries Act in order to more effectively stop ticket scalpers, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. Proposals included the drafting of a separate law, the introduction of real-name registration for ticket buyers, and an increase in fines to between 10 and 100 times the value of the original ticket.Out of 36 cases prosecuted within the past five years, only 18 had resulted in convictions, police said. Legal amendments would result in a more effective fight against ticket scalping.Blackpink is performing at the Kaohsiung National Stadium on March 18-19, 2023.

            Moreover, international alliances support the market growth significantly. For instance, in 2019, Unity Opto Group Co received long-term orders from US-based LED lamp vendors who are changing suppliers to prevent a hike in US customs duty rate on imports from China. Thus, such steps aid the mini LED market growth.

            The high cost of the equipment, coupled with the high number of ICs required to function can hinder the market growth. Although there is a large amount of research in this field, many manufacturers might face a setback to adopt to different manufacturing process to mass produce mini LEDs.

As of 2019, households in India assembled about 25,000 tons of gold, making the country the largest holder of the yellow metal in the world. Rural communities account for ~65% of the total gold demand in the country. Owing to the sentimental value that Indians associate with this indispensable item, people seldom sell it to meet financial emergencies. They prefer to pledge gold as collateral to secure short-term loans. Gold loans enjoy a relatively low interest rate that varies between 9.5% and 24%, and have a flexible tenure (ranging from a few days to 5 years).Segment insights:The Indian gold loan market is segmented into organized gold loan market, also known as formal gold loan market and unorganized gold loan market or the informal gold loan market. The organized gold loan segment includes public banks, private banks, small finance banks, co-operative banks, NBFCs and Nidhi companies. In contrast, the unorganized sector is dominated by money lenders and pawnbrokers.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-gold-loan-market/QI042The unorganized segment accounts for more than 60% of the gold loan market in the country. Nevertheless, the organized sector is anticipated to expand exponentially during the forecast period.NBFCs constitute the largest share of the organized market. Customers residing in rural parts of the country are gradually switching to these NBFCs, owing to quick loan processing, systematic gold valuation, auctioning and safe-keeping. Banks also offer gold loans, but they primarily consider these as their priority sector lending (PSL) requirements. Further, small finance and Nidhi companies represent the co-operative segment in the Indian gold loan industry, and account for ~12.98% of the organized gold loan market. Private sector banks are gradually entering the Indian gold loan market with tech-driven offerings like online gold loan services.Impact of COVID-19:The Indian gold loan market has witnessed a positive impact on business during the nationwide lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Gold loan products have experienced rapid growth than other retail banking products during this period. Due to economic distress and job losses, gold is acting as an insurance policy, as well as a retirement plan across India. People are availing gold loans to fulfill their immediate fund requirements.Moreover, demand for gold loan is further expected to expand as risk profiles of borrowers have depreciated considerably and lenders are becoming risk-averse. Many NBFCs are facing liquidity crisis, which is deteriorating their liquidity capacity. Therefore, gold loans are becoming a fallback plan for borrowers who are denied loan through regular channels.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-gold-loan-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The government has taken several initiatives which play a major role for the growth of the hotel industry.Market insights:The hotel market industry in India is a part of the travel and tourism industry. Business travelers are gradually increasing in number due to the rapid growth of the IT sector and the emergence of several global companies.The key performance indicators (KPIs) used by the industry to measure business expansion and manage hotels are average room rate (ARR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR).

Moreover, the branded/traditional hotel segment, along with the major share in the organized sector, accounts for about 5% of the overall hotel industry in terms of room supply.Government initiatives:The industry is dependent on the tourism sector for business. The Ministry of Tourism, along with the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Civil Aviation, promotes tourism in the country. Therefore, government initiatives play a crucial role in its growth.The Ministry of Tourism has undertaken schemes, such as PRASHAD (National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual, Heritage Augmentation Drive), SWADESH DARSHAN (Integrated Development of Tourist Circuits around Specific Themes), and the promotion of e-visa to encourage tourist inflow.NABH Nirman, UDAN Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik, and Vision 2040 are some of the initiatives undertaken by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to enhance air connectivity, which would bring hotel guests even to the most remote corners of the country.The Ministry of Railways is focused on developing railway infrastructure to ease domestic travel. Domestic travelers constitute the largest share of guest in the hotel industry.Competition analysis:The hotel industry is highly fragmented. It is dominated by several small and unorganized players. It has observed a shift in favor of the mid-market and budget hotel segments.

QSRs have both fast food cuisines and small table services to cater to youngsters’ and working professionals’ requirements. QSR market has been experiencing steady growth over the past few years. QSR has gained popularity due to growing eating-out habits, rising disposable income, changing lifestyle, and the online food delivery system’s growth. Both chain QSR and standalone QSR segments are expected to contribute equally to the market’s development during the forecast period.Impact of Covid-19The pandemic and the prolonged global lockdown severely impacted the foodservice market in India. In the middle of March 2020, the Government of India temporarily closed all hotels, restaurants, and food courts across the country as a precautionary measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. In response to the COVID situation, QSRs have increasingly turned to the food delivery sector. Many foodservice companies have adopted take-away services to deliver safe, hygienic, and customized orders to their customers.Market segment insightsIn FY 2020, chain QSRs held the highest market share (~54.2%) in Indias overall QSR market. An increase in consumers propensity to eat out and a growing number of innovative fast-food chains are the driving factors for chain QSRs segment. Besides, innovative payment systems and point of sales systems are the primary factors for the growth of the chain QSRs segment in the QSR market. Based on the model, the take-away and home delivery segments are expected to expand at a higher growth rate of around ~18.0% and ~17.4%, respectively, between the FY2021 and FY2025 period as compared to dine-in segmentDownload Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-quick-service-restaurant-qsr-market/QI042Key growth drivers of the marketThe increasing trend of eating out in urban cities in India, across all the economic classes, without the need for any special occasion, has boosted the demand for QSRs. People increasingly prefer eating outside as a part of their leisure outings or shopping experience. This trend is mainly visible among the millennial age group of 25 to 40 years. Moreover, with the growing exposure to international lifestyles and culture, people have started developing their tastes and are eating out at restaurants more often to have different cuisines
Rapid urbanization due to the increase in population and economic growth and the rise in disposable income of people have led to the penetration of eating out culture in the country. Per-capita monthly income in India is estimated to have increased by 6.8% to INR 11,254 in FY 2020 from INR 10,534 in FY 2019. Besides, an increasing number of fast-food franchises in untapped areas and expansion of tier II and tier III cities have led to the rise in the number of quick service restaurantsKey deterrents to the growth of the marketSetting up restaurants in India is a very time-consuming and tiresome process since it requires multiple government clearances. Apart from that, the lack of a skilled workforce is another major challenge faced by quick foodservice providers, primarily in small cities and towns.Companies coveredBurger King India Pvt. Ltd.

The frequency of online food ordering declined initially because consumers were concerned about their health and the availability of delivery agents fell due to the scarcity of jobs and migration of labor during.

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Since 2014, the Indian government has undertaken several initiatives to promote indigenization and self-reliance in defense by harnessing the capabilities of public and private sector industries. As of April 2020, India was among the top three global military spender. The US, China, India, Russia, and Saudi Arabia accounted for more than 60% of the global military expenditure in 2019. The military expenditure in India includes the pension bill for 3.3 Mn retired veterans and defense civilians. The military expenditure increased by a massive 259% over 30 years (from 1990 to 2019) and by 37% between 1990 and 2019.The defense budget has been growing marginally year-over-year. It has almost doubled in the last five years. However, it is insufficient to upgrade the weapons. This is because the significant share of the allocated amount for the Ministry of Defense (MoD) goes into paying salaries and pensions of armed forces and civilians.Impact of Covid-19The defense industry in India witnessed a significant downturn on account of global trade restrictions following the outbreak of COVID-19. Defence public sector undertakings had to stop working on most of the projects after the imposition of the lockdown. The sector shifted its focus to manufacturing essential commodities only, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, masks, and ventilator parts, to help the government fight the pandemic. Around 90% of the small private manufacturers that supply essential components to the industry had to halt the production of components till May 30th, 2020.The government had to tighten defense expenditure on account of the global crisis. In the first quarter of FY 2020, it withheld 15% 20% of funds reserved for the defense ministry. In May 2020, it stated to abolish 9,300 posts in the military engineering service (MES).Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-defense-expenditure-market/QI042Market segment insightsThe defense budget has increased at a steady rate in the last five years, from FY 2016 to FY 2020. Though the overall defense budget has been growing, the defense expenditure has declined as a proportion of the GDP. The Indian Army accounts for the highest share of the defense budget, followed by the Air Force, Navy, DRDO (Defense Research and Development Organisation), and ordinance factories.Key challenges of the marketIndian government has not been able to attract significant private sector investments in the defense manufacturing industry. This has resulted from delays in decision-making on the government’s part, placing unsystematic orders, canceling tenders, and placing unreasonable qualitative requirements by the Indian Armed Forces. Several Indian private defense companies had invested in improving their production capabilities to receive government support and orders. However, they have been left disappointed. For example, in May 2020, the private sector defense equipment manufacturing start-up, Tonbo Imaging, wrote an open letter to the prime minister underlining the cancelation of orders and delays in payments.Government initiativesIn May 2001, the defense sector, which was only reserved for the public sector, was allowed 100% participation by the Indian private sector bound by licensing. A total of 460 defense licenses were issued by the government, covering 275 companies, till 31st December 2019. In the Defense Procurement Policy 2020 (DPP), the limit of foreign direct investment (FDI) through the automatic approval route has been increased to 74%. BAE Systems, Pilatus, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Rafael, and Dassault Aviation are some of the major investors in the industry.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-defense-expenditure-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

Together, they occupied around 40.10% of the total PoS terminal market in terms of market revenue.Market insights:The increase in the usage of near-field communicative devices, preference for contactless payment, and demand for e-commerce activities might influence the growth of the India PoS terminal market. Expansion of the market can also be attributed to the initiatives undertaken by the Government of India (GoI) to promote digital payment and thus cashless economy in the country. Some of such policies implemented by the government include demonetization, Jan Dhan Yojana, and the establishment of micro ATMs nationally. Moreover, technological advancements and the increasing adoption of new technologies, such as e-wallets and mobile wallets are also leading to a revolution in the market.

In the short run, the PoS terminal market in India experienced a downfall in its market value. The primary reasons behind market disruption were the closure of retail stores for a considerable duration and the existing financial stress in the market, which led to a fall in peoples purchasing power. Implementing stringent import restrictions caused a shortage in the supply of new PoS machines. They were essential since retail units were shifting to contactless methods of payment. Old and faulty devices were being removed or replaced. However, at present, due to the fear of social contacting and gathering, people are preferring cashless and contactless methods of payment. With the growing market for digital payments over the coming years, the PoS terminal market in India is also likely to expand multifold.Download  Sample of This Strategic Report–https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-point-of-sale-terminal-market/QI042Report Include:Market Behavior/ Level of Risk and Opportunity

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Plasma is a major component of the blood that plays an essential role in regulating bodily functions. It constitutes around 55% of the total volume of blood, and comprises more than 700 proteins and other substances. It is a major component used in the treatment of health problems such as haemophilia and autoimmune disorders. Improved diagnostic facilities and the prevalence of chronic diseases are major factors that have raised the demand for plasma-derived products. The blood plasma products market has been experiencing steady growth over the past few years. The immunoglobulin segment accounted for the major share of the market in 2020 and is projected to maintain its leading position during the forecast period. Major players operating in the market include Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd. (BSV), Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd., PlasmaGen BioSciences Private Ltd., Serum Institute of India Private Ltd., and Zydus Takeda Healthcare Private Ltd.Impact of COVID-19The pandemic in India increased the need for convalescent measures, therapies, and cures for the ailing public. COVID-19 outbreak has pushed scientists to experiment with plasma therapy on infected people with the virus. This COVID-19 crisis highlighted the need for a massive supply of blood plasma for convalescent measures and treatments. Besides, India is heavily dependent on imported plasma products. These products fulfil 90% of the domestic demand, giving rise to a massive gap between demand and supply.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-blood-plasma-products-market/QI042Market segment insightsIn FY 2020, the immunoglobulin segment held the highest share (~46.78%) of the overall market. Immunoglobulin is used to treat various blood disorders such as primary and secondary immune deficiencies, and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Based on end users, the hospital segment dominated the market in FY 2020. Clinics and other end users segments are expected to expand at a growth rate of ~17.90% and ~24.77%, respectively, during the FY 2021 FY 2025 period.Key growth drivers of the marketThe demand for plasma derivative-based therapies has picked up in the wake of the pandemic, propelling market growth. According to a research study published in Blood Medicine Journal in 2016, FIX replacement therapy that comprises plasma-derived protein was found to be successful in reducing bleeding and disability in case of hemophilia B. According to the annual global survey conducted by the World Federation of hemophilia, around 50% of the world’s hemophilia population lives in India. Hemophilia is treated through factor replacement therapy, using clotting factor VIII for hemophilia A and clotting factor IX for hemophilia B
Immunodeficiency can be caused by various chronic illnesses. Immunoglobulin, a crucial part of plasma protein, is used as first-line therapy to treat various immunologic, neurologic, and hematologic conditions. India has shown a remarkable improvement in patient care with Primary Immune Deficiencies (PIDs), and several centers of excellence in PIDs have emerged. Thus, an increase in the demand for immunoglobulin is fueling the growth of the marketKey deterrents to the growth of the marketPlasma derivative-based therapy is a cost-effective solution to develop human plasma products such as antibodies and proteins in the long run. It is an expensive procedure that involves the complicated process of collecting plasma, which requires a large workforce. The cost of plasmapheresis equipment, complex logistics, and donor compensation are very high. Apart from that, low availability of recovered plasma is another major challenge faced by plasma product manufacturers.Companies coveredBharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd. (BSV)

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Alcohol consumption has become a part of social interactions among the young people in India. The beer market is slowly gaining prominence, owing to an increase in disposable income, preference for low-alcohol beverage, and growing social acceptance. Some of the main players that operate in the market are Mohan Meakin Ltd., Arbor Brewing Company India, United Breweries Ltd. (UB Group), and B9 Beverages Pvt. Ltd. (Bira 91).Market insights:Urbanization and change in societal perspective, along with the launch of new low- and no-alcohol variant beer, technological advancements are a few of the significant factors that propel market growth. Introduction of online order and ease of doorstep delivery in certain states are further driving the market. However, low per capita consumption rate, various government regulations, and high taxation policies in most of the states across India deter its growth.Segment insights:On the basis of product type, the market can be segmented into strong, mild, and craft beer.

The sale of alcoholic beverages was discontinued for about 40 days during the first two phases of the lockdown. The World Health Organization (WHO) associated alcohol consumption to weakening of immunity. This further demotivated consumers from buying beer even after the ban was lifted during the third phase of lockdown. Furthermore, introduction of COVID cess (an additional cess to fund extra spending in the wake of the pandemic) on liquor in various states, increased the prices of alcohol including beer by a high margin. This increase in price has led to the increased demand for low-cost inferior-quality beers over premium quality beers. However, one of the most significant positive impact of COVID-19 lockdown is the introduction of online sale of the beer in certain states, such as, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, and Punjab. This has increased the in-home consumption of all alcoholic beverages, including beer thereby increasing the sale.Companies covered:Mohan Meakin Ltd.

The study also includes information on manufacturing that can help consumers understand the competitive environment, such as gross margin, shipping, and trade distribution. The research also includes regional, type, and application-specific breakdowns for the global market.Major players operating in the market include Angel Broking Limited, Geojit Financial Services Limited, ICICI Securities Limited, and Kotak Securities Limited.The financial brokers offers financial advice to the firm or the individual. India’s broking industry is transitioning from a transaction-based to a fee-based model, offering services such as investment advisory and wealth management. Apart from advisory services, emphasis on fund-based activities, including loan against shares and margin funding, is rising, allowing brokers to build sustainable earnings. Financial brokers have developed their marketing ability to support customers in achieving their goals. They offer wide-ranging products and services that strengthen their relationship with clients.Impact of Covid-19The pandemic and prolonged global lockdown severely impacted India’s financial market and liquidity position. A struggling economy in India, coupled with the outbreak of COVID-19, has led to an apprehensions in which capital market investments have become a challenge for investors. While the Indian economy has been experiencing massive pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic, the trading volumes in the domestic capital market started to recover after the lockdown was lifted. It reached an all-time high in July 2020.Market segment insightsIn FY 2020, full-service brokers held the highest market share (~58%) of the overall broking industry based on NSE active clients. The shift of the trading platform from offline to online-offline mode increased the revenues generated by full-service brokers. However, in India, full-service brokers have been experiencing unstable growth as leading companies are losing considerable market share to discount brokers.Download Sample of This Strategic Report: –https://www.quadintel.com/request-sample/india-financial-brokerage-market/QI042Key growth drivers of the marketTechnological innovations is a significant driver for the increasing participation of investors in equity markets. The pandemic resulted in a significant meltdown in the stock market. Improved financial awareness led to a 130% growth in Demat account openings. About 6.3 Mn accounts were opened in the first half of FY 2021. Post demonetization, fintech companies have played a significant role in the growth of the brokerage market, backed by increased smartphone users and high internet speed with low data costs. Retail investors use mobile-based trading as they primarily invest in convenient and user-friendly apps with secure platforms
In India, brokerage houses offer global investment services that permit their customers to own blue-chip stocks in the US. Investors’ demand for portfolio diversification is one of the key drivers that encourage firms to provide these services. Broking firms entered into international partnerships, indicating a good demand for such services. In September 2020, Kuvera, an online platform for investments in India’s mutual funds, partnered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s listed investment adviser, Vested Finance. This partnership permits investors to purchase stocks from the US on its online platform.Key deterrents to the growth of the marketLack of financial knowledge is a significant reason behind the under-penetration of the brokerage market. Several Indians are not aware of shares, stocks, and mutual funds. They do not know how to invest in them to reap high returns compared to traditional investment tools. Most people are also ignorant of the basic financial concepts such as reward (return) to variability (risk) ratio, asset allocation, and diversification benefits.Companies coveredAngel Broking Limited

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836058,Farmers set to shake up Dutch political landscape,"Opinion polls suggest a party started by disgruntled farmers could get significant support in Wednesday's provincial elections in The Netherlands.That is bad news for Prime Minister Mark Rutte as provincial elections also determine the make-up of the Senate.The polls show the BBB or BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Civilian Movement) could win more seats in parliament's upper house than Rutte's conservative VVD party.It will be a severe setback for Rutte's governing coalition, which has not had a Senate majority since the previous provincial elections in 2019 and must negotiate deals with left-wing opponents.The BBB could ally with other parties in the Senate to challenge Rutte's plans to cut nitrogen emission levels.The Dutch prime minister has committed to halving the Netherlands' nitrogen emissions by 2030.To do that that his government announced plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third and possibly the ""expropriation"" of farms. Farmers say the still unfinalized proposals are unfairly targeting them compared to sectors such as industry and transport.""We don't really feel heard,"" Erik Stegink, national president of the BBB said. ""Sometimes we don't even feel welcome in our own country anymore.""It is the issue that prompted the party's formation in 2019. The BBB won a single Dutch House of Representatives seat in 2021, but its popularity has since surged partly to Rutte's environmental policies.More than 10,000 Dutch farmers protested in The Hague on Saturday against the government's plans.Rutte, who has been in power since 2010, says he has ""hope"" his governing coalition could solve problems, including the farm plans.lo/rc (AFP, AP, dpa)",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836059,Muslims experience Islamophobia every day in Germany,"The sky over the eastern city of Erfurt was bright blue; the windy air was cold. The day, in early March, was a day of celebration for Suleman Malik. The new Ahmadiyya mosque in Erfurt-Marbach finally had a minaret. It towers 9 meters (30 feet) high. It is part of what will be the first new building of a Muslim place of worship on the territory of the former socialist GDR.A crane was necessary to piece together the five round elements that make up the minaret. Every one of them weighs several tons and they had to be fitted together with utmost precision.Malik said it took months to contract a crane for such heavy lifting on such muddy ground. He said construction companies that were ready to do the job then backed out again, intimidated by racism, right-wing radicalism, and Islamophobia. The company that finally agreed to take it on, Malik said, contacted him at midnight before work was set to start, asking for cash payment, and insisting that no one film or photograph the building procedure.Malik is 34 years old. He has lived in Germany for 18 years. A Muslim born in Pakistan, he now speaks fluent German, works as a personnel consultant, and is the deputy mayor of the district of Erfurt-Rieth. But the building process for the small mosque in a small industrial park was hampered not only by the many building regulations.Malik has found pig carcasses that had been thrown onto the property. He said often cars drive by with their drivers shouting abuse out of the window. ""Protesters"" regularly gather on the other side of the street from the building site, for ""Catholic prayer services."" The premier of the state of Thuringia, where Erfurt is located, Bodo Ramelow, has often been derided on social media for backing the construction project.On March 15, 2019, a white supremacist killed 51 people and injured about 50 others in two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The United Nations has declared March 15 the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.Germany guarantees freedom of religion in its constitution, the Basic Law. However, according to a survey by the German Council of Experts on Integration and Migration presented in the fall of 2022, one-third to one-half of the 15,000 respondents to the survey expressed anti-Muslim and anti-Islamic attitudes.Almost every week, damage to property or graffiti at a mosque is reported somewhere in Germany. In February 2020, a 43-year-old white man killed nine people at a shisha bar, a bar and a kiosk and then his other and then himself in the city of Hanau, in the central state of Hesse.Islamophobia ""is a form of misanthropy that has entered the mainstream,"" Abdassamad El Yazidi, the secretary general of Germany's Central Council of Muslims, told DW. ""It has become acceptable and can be expressed openly.""The 47-year-old El Yazidi said Islamophobia was ""common in the Bundestag, as well as the state parliaments, for fascists, but increasingly also for representatives of the so-called established democratic parties who are fishing in murky waters aiming to catch votes on the right-wing fringe.""El Yazidi, a native of Hesse, has long been involved in interfaith dialogue. He said Muslims in Germany were ""stigmatized."" The Central Council, he said, has asked the federal government several times to appoint a commissioner for Muslim life, just as there is a commissioner for Jewish life and a commissioner against antiziganism. ""There are very many commissioners, about 35, who fulfill very important functions,"" El Yazidi said. ""But this is being denied to Muslims, with hypocritical arguments."" He said people don't want to admit that there is a problem with anti-Muslim racism, ""and Muslims feel that.""Such officials exist in other countries and institutions. Canada's head of government, Justin Trudeau, appointed the first commissioner to combat Islamophobia in January. The EU created the post of a coordinator for combating anti-Muslim hostility in 2015.Malik said he was aware that some Muslims had perpetrated hate crimes in Germany. Eighteen years ago, his father, an established merchant, fled with his family from Pakistan to Germany. The Maliks are Ahmadis, members of the Ahmadiyya, a persecuted Islamic community. Tens of thousands of community members live in Germany; this year they are celebrating ""100 years of Ahmadiyya in Germany.""It will take a while to finish the mosque building in Erfurt, especially to design the exterior. ""October 3 is Open Mosque Day in Germany,"" Malik said. ""We already want to invite people here then.""There are no plans to have a muezzin call from the minaret, but it will be something like a lighthouse, which should point to the Islamic house of worship.This article was originally written in German.",2023/3/15,,

The personal needs allowance, created in 1972, was meant to cover anything a resident might need that its facility didn’t provide, from a phone to clothes to a birthday gift for a grandchild.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836067,"Sri Lankan state workers strike, protesting high taxes","COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan health, railway, port and other state workers were on a daylong strike Wednesday to protest against sharp increases in income taxes and electricity charges, as the island nation awaits approval of an International Monetary Fund package to aid its bankrupt economy.Most government hospitals around the country suspended their outpatient clinics because doctors, nurses and pharmacists were on strike. The railways operated fewer trains and armed soldiers guarded carriages and train stations fearing sabotage.Trade unions say the increase in taxes and electricity charges have hit them hard amid difficulties from the country's worst economic crisis. They have threatened to extend the strike indefinitely if the government fails to address their demands.The government says it was compelled to raise taxes to strengthen state revenue and electricity charges to cover production costs, key prerequisites to unlocking the proposed $2.9 billion IMF package. Authorities say they managed to operate some trains and most state banks despite the strike.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said last week the fund's board will meet on March 20 to consider the final approval of Sri Lanka's bailout package after China gave crucial debt restructuring assurances.Sri Lanka announced last year it was suspending repayment of its foreign loans amid a severe foreign currency crisis that resulted in shortages of fuel, food, medicines and cooking gas, along with long power cuts. The crisis led to street protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.President Ranil Wickremesinghe, since taking over last July, has managed to end the power cuts and reduce shortages.The Central Bank has said the country's reserves have improved and Sri Lanka's rupee has started to strengthen after crashing last year. The Central Bank has wrested back control of foreign currency trade from the black market, the monetary authority says.However, critics say the strengthening of the currency might be linked to import controls and that it is bound to weaken once the country reopens for imports.Wickremesinghe told Parliament last week that difficult reforms are needed to remain on course with the IMF program. Sidestepping them, as the country has done on 16 previous occasions, could spell danger, he added, noting that any breakdown would compel Sri Lanka to repay $6-7 billion of foreign debt every year until 2029.However, he found no support from the opposition parties and the public, who say he is shielding the ousted Rajapaksa family from allegations of corruption, which they say caused the economic crisis, in return for their support for his presidency.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836068,German arms industry seeks clarity on Ukraine weapons orders,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s defense industry says it stands ready to ramp up its output, including the kinds of arms and ammunition needed by Ukraine, but needs clarity about what governments want before investing in further production capacity.Ukraine became the world’s third-largest importer of arms in 2022 after Russia’s invasion triggered a big flow of military aid to Kyiv from the United States and Europe, according to Swedish think tank SIPRI.Some of those arms were transferred from Western military stocks to Ukraine, while Kyiv also has purchased equipment with its own money or funds provided by allies. But the rate at which Ukraine is using ammunition has raised concerns about strains on the capacity of Western defense companies as they try to keep both the Ukrainian military and their own resupplied.“What’s important for us as an industry is to get predictability,"" Hans Christoph Atzpodien, the head of Germany’s arms manufacturing association, said in an interview this week with The Associated Press.“That means we have to be clearly told which products are needed within which time,” said Atzpodien, managing director of the Federation of German Security and Defense Industries.“And we are prepared,” he added. “The industry is much more flexible than it is given credit for.”The association's members, which include major arms manufacturers such as Rheinmetall, can further boost production, such as by reactivating mothballed facilities and machines, and hiring more staff, he said.“Of course, we also need a firm basis in the form of orders so the investments can be carried out,” Atzpodien said, adding that proposals to bundle purchases at the European Union rather than the national level could help, provided such a process does not slow down procurement.German officials said a meeting of EU foreign and defense ministers on Monday might yield a decision on bundling weapons purchases for Ukraine.Arms manufacturers in Germany are also keen to see European countries harmonize their export rules to avoid being disadvantaged compared with competitors in some neighboring countries, Atzpodien said.After initially hesitating to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, Germany has become one of Kyiv's biggest arms suppliers. The shift led Berlin to provide Ukraine with dozens of self-propelled Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Iris-T missile systems, howitzers and millions of rounds of ammunition, but left some Germans deeply uneasy about the possibility of being dragged into a conflict with nuclear-armed Russia.Still, Atzpodien said the final decision on where German-made arms can go should remain a matter for the government.“As companies, we agree that German weapons must never fall into the wrong hands,"" he said.The German government declined to comment Monday on reports that Rheinmetall was in talks with Ukraine about building a tank factory in the country. The company's Leopard 2 tanks are urgently sought by Ukraine, which was recently promised several dozen from Western stocks, but officials wouldn't say whether having a factory in Ukraine would require government approval.Germany's own arms procurement has come under scrutiny after Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged last year to increase defense spending to NATO’s target of 2% of GDP and create a 100-billion-euro ($107 billion) special fund.On Tuesday, parliament’s commissioner for the military lamented the slow pace of Germany’s drive to modernize its armed forces, the Bundeswehr. She noted that none of the 100 billion-euro special fund was actually spent last year, though some major orders were placed.“It is also important to quickly replace equipment that was given to Ukraine” and to speed up maintenance of existing equipment, Eva Hoegl said as she presented her annual report.“The Bundeswehr has too little of everything, and even less since Feb. 24 (2022),” she said. “We have too few tanks to be able to train sufficiently, to exercise … boats and ships are lacking, aircraft are lacking.”Along with the cash coming its way because of the war in Ukraine — Germany's defense minister is also seeking to raise his budget by 10 billion euros a year — the German arms industry is hoping the conflict will mark a turning point in the way military spending is classified in Europe.Some banks and investors in the European Union won't do business with the defense sector because of concerns that it is engaged in unsustainable activity that does more harm than good in the long run, much like fossil fuel producers.Atzpodien said Russia's attack on Ukraine had shown the industry's value.“Our demand is that products we deliver to the German military or other NATO armed forces, for example, are recognized in such a way by the EU that they support sustainability,” he said. “A signal like that would be important so that actors on the financial markets can adjust to it accordingly.”German arms manufacturers have already come up with a slogan to push their case, he added: “Security is the key to sustainability.”___Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to this report.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836069,Trevor Bauer signing met with little reaction in Japan,"TOKYO (AP) — The signing of Trevor Bauer to a one-year contract by the Yokohama DeNA BayStars generated little reaction Wednesday in the Japanese media.The 2020 NL Cy Young Award winner was released by the Los Angeles Dodgers on Jan. 12, three weeks after an arbitrator reduced his suspension imposed by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred from 324 to 194 games. The penalty followed an investigation into domestic violence, which the pitcher has denied.Since his release, Bauer has been shunned by big league teams in the United States.The Yokohama team announced his acquisition on Tuesday. Japan's mainstream newspapers had small stories in their sports sections Wednesday about Bauer, noting his Cy Young Award and the domestic violence case.RonSpo, a small outlet devoted to sports, began its story by saying: “An astoundingly big-name major league player is coming to Yokohama.”Yokohama opens its season March 31 at Osaka's Hanshin Tigers. The first home game in Yokohama is April 4 against Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants.Many newspapers noted it's been 25 years since Yokohama last won the Japanese title, and Bauer could be the difference-maker.An informal survey of young fans outside the Tokyo Dome buying World Baseball Classic tickets yielded a mix of responses. Several knew Bauer was coming to Japan, but only a few knew about the allegations against him.“Some Japanese baseball fans will know his name, but most don't know anything about him,” said Ichiro Mizutani, an 18-year-old fan of the Tokyo Giants.Mitsuki Akazawa wore a blue Los Angeles Dodgers cap and said he knew all about Bauer.“I know he has some difficult issues,” the 21-year-old said, calling them “domestic problems.”“But he was not found guilty in court. So I'm not sure if he was in the wrong,"" he added.Rentaro Kataoka, an 18-year-old who said he was also a Giants fans, recognized Bauer's name but thought he might be coming to help coach Japanese pitchers. He knew nothing about any legal complications.Several young fans noted that interest in Bauer is sure to build as the season nears, particularly if he is dominant in the Japanese league. They also emphasized that, though many fans follow American baseball, most are focused on play in Japan's league and its stars.Manfred suspended Bauer last April for violating the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy, after a San Diego woman said he beat and sexually abused her in 2021.Bauer has maintained he did nothing wrong, saying everything that happened between him and the woman was consensual. He was never charged with a crime.Bauer joined his hometown Dodgers before the 2021 season and was 8-5 with a 2.59 ERA in 17 starts before being placed on paid leave.He is owed about $22.5 million from the remainder of his $102 million, three-year contract with the Dodgers. The suspension has cost him roughly $37.6 million in salary.In February 2022, Los Angeles prosecutors decided not to charge Bauer for allegedly beating and sexually abusing the San Diego woman because they said they were unable to prove her accusations beyond a reasonable doubt.The woman, who was 27 at the time, said Bauer choked her into unconsciousness, punched her repeatedly and sexually assaulted her during two sexual encounters.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault.Bauer said in a video posted on YouTube after the prosecutor’s decision that he and the woman engaged in rough sex at her suggestion and followed guidelines they agreed to in advance. Each encounter ended with her spending the night at his Pasadena home, he said.“The disturbing acts and conduct that she described simply did not occur,” he said at the time.Other teams in Japan have made similar signing before.Former major league reliever Roberto Osuna — who received a 75-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence policy — signed last season with the Chiba Lotte Marines.He has signed for this season with the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks.In 1987, Dodgers relief pitcher Steve Howe, who had a career plagued with drug problems, tried to sign with the Seibu Lions. But he was barred from playing in the country after the Japanese baseball commissioner disqualified Howe because of his history of drug abuse.Bauer was an All-Star in 2018 and went 83-69 with a 3.79 ERA in 10 seasons for Arizona (2012), Cleveland, (2013-19), Cincinnati (2019-20) and the Dodgers. He won the NL Cy Young Award with Cincinnati during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.___Associated Press writer Yuri Kageyama contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836070,"Thai policeman injured, detained after 24-hour standoff","BANGKOK (AP) — Thai police on Wednesday detained a senior police officer who fired multiple gunshots from his home in Bangkok, ending a standoff of over 24 hours after his colleagues tried to take him to a mental institution.The gunman, identified as police Lt. Col. Kitikarn Sangbun, was taken to a hospital Wednesday for an injury after the ordeal, said police Lt. Gen. Samran Nualma, an assistant to the police chief. He did not specify the nature of Kitikarn's injury and how it was incurred, but said no others were hurt.Video posted on Twitter by the newspaper Khaosod showed the end of the incident as Kitikarn, clad in shorts and a T-shirt and clutching a carving knife in his left hand, smashed through a second-story window and leaped down into a small, cluttered backyard. He lay dazed for several seconds until police in full tactical gear rushed out from the house's back door, seizing him roughly.The incident began Tuesday morning when Kitikarn's superior officer was going to take him to be treated at a mental institution, but was rebuffed, said police Col. Rangsan Sornsing, superintendent of Sai Mai police station in Bangkok. Police gave no further details on why they were picking the man up for treatment.Kitikarn then fired in the direction of police who arrived at the scene. Officers evacuated and cordoned off the surrounding area as they tried several methods to apprehend him.Police fired tear gas Tuesday night and Kitikarn reportedly responded by firing a salvo of bullets. On Wednesday morning, a junior officer sang songs for Kitikarn in an attempt to calm him down, intermittently asking him to turn himself in.A self-described Rishi, a traditional Asian hermit healer, arrived at the scene Tuesday night and declared that the gunman was possessed. He said he would be able to solve the situation if he was allowed to meet the officer, the crime news website Ejan reported, but police did not allow a meeting due to safety concerns. The situation gathered national interest with the hashtag “crazed inspector” trending on Twitter in Thailand.At one point a bullet grazed but failed to penetrate the helmet of one officer at the standoff, the government’s National News Bureau of Thailand said in a Twitter post.Thailand’s deadliest massacre took place last year when a former police officer shot and slashed to death 36 people at a daycare center. The country’s previous worst mass killing involved a disgruntled soldier who opened fire in and around a mall in the northeastern city of Nakhon Ratchasima in 2020, killing 29 people and holding off security forces for some 16 hours before eventually being killed by them.Mass shootings are rare but not unheard of in Thailand, which has one of the highest civilian gun ownership rates in Asia with 15.1 weapons per 100 people compared to only 0.3 in Singapore and 0.25 in Japan. That’s still far lower than the United States rate of 120.5 per 100 people, according to a 2017 survey by Australia’s GunPolicy.org nonprofit organization.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836071,UK Treasury chief predicts no recession in Britain this year,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. is likely to avoid a recession this year, Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said Wednesday, adding a bit of surprise to what had been billed as a boring budget meant to restore confidence and stability in the nation's finances.The announcement came as Hunt delivered his spending plan to a packed House of Commons, drawing repeated cheers from his party’s lawmakers and sustained heckling from the opposition amid the political theater that traditionally accompanies publication of the government’s budget.An improving global economic picture, combined with government plans to stimulate growth, mean the British economy won’t slip into a “technical recession” this year, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, Hunt said, citing analysis from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. As recently as November, the OBR forecast that the economy would shrink throughout 2023.The improved outlook gave Hunt enough financial headroom to offer more than 9 billion pounds ($10.8 billion) of tax incentives for businesses that invest in the economy, as well as programs intended to lure mothers and older people back into work.But there was no money for striking teachers, civil servants and young doctors who staged a noisy protest outside Parliament while Hunt delivered his speech. The strikes are similar to widespread unrest in France about the economic situation and plans to increase the retirement age.As double-digit inflation erodes the incomes of public-sector workers, the U.K. government says big pay increases will only lead to further inflation, so the strikers got nothing.“High inflation is the root cause of the strikes we have seen in recent months,” Hunt said. “We will continue to work hard to settle these disputes, but only in a way that does not fuel inflation.”The budget marks the government’s latest effort to bolster an economy ravaged by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which have helped push inflation to levels last seen in the early 1980s.Consumer prices rose 10.1% in the year through January, the fifth consecutive month of double-digit increases. To combat inflation, the Bank of England has approved 10 interest rate increases over the past 15 months, raising the cost of mortgages, consumer and business loans.But the outlook is improving.The OBR on Wednesday forecast that inflation would slow to 2.9% by the end of 2023. The economy is expected to shrink just 0.2% this year, compared with the 1.4% contraction expected in November, the OBR said.Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, noted the still anemic growth outlook, saying Hunt was “dressing up stagnation as stability” and putting the country on a “path of managed decline.”Even so, Wednesday’s budget marked a stark contrast to the situation in October when Hunt took office following his predecessor’s disastrous “mini-budget, ” which set off a financial catastrophe by promising huge tax cuts without saying how it would pay for them . The value of the pound plunged, mortgage rates soared and the central bank was forced to intervene to protect pension funds.As a result, most analysts expected Hunt to aim for tame this time around.At one point, he even offered funding to fight the “curse″ of potholes, handing over 200 million pounds ($241 million) to local communities to get rid of them.But there were bigger initiatives as well.Even before he got to the Commons, Hunt announced he would spend 3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) to extend the energy price guarantee that has helped shield consumers from high electricity and natural gas prices this winter.Hunt later said the government would provide billions of pounds worth of tax credits for businesses that invest in Britain, with special programs for high-tech and science-based startups that are expected to drive economic growth.That will cut the effective tax rate for most companies, even as the government goes ahead with plans to increase the headline rate of corporation tax by six percentage points to 25%, Hunt said.In keeping with his back to work theme, Hunt also announced increased child care payments to help young mothers return to work and more generous allowances for tax-free pension saving to entice early retirees back into the workforce.But those promises were little consolation to thousands of doctors, nurses and other workers who spent the past days picketing in front of hospitals and other government buildings.The British Medical Association, which represents the fully qualified physicians known in the U.K. as “junior doctors,” says first-year doctors have seen their pay fall by 26% over the past 15 years after accounting for inflation.That means first-year doctors now earn as little as 14.09 pounds an hour, compared with up to 14.10 pounds an hour for baristas at Pret a Manger, a sandwich and coffee shop chain that just gave workers a third raise in less than 12 months, the group said.Outside St. Thomas’ Hospital in central London, Dr. Leah Sugarman, 33, joined other strikers as they chanted, “What do we want? Fair pay! When do we want it? Now!″The emergency medicine doctor, who has been on the job for nine years, said she can’t pay a mortgage and struggles to live a normal life.""We’ve all lived through COVID, that was horrendous. Most of us have come out mentally scarred from that,'' she said. “And every day that I leave work, I pretty much want to cry because I haven’t been able to do the job that I chose to go into this profession for.”She added that she has been forced to drop her hours to less than 40 hours a week, ""because I can’t mentally go to work full time anymore.”“It is just a car crash,'' she said. ""So that’s why I’m here.”___Kwiyeon Ha contributed to this report.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836072,Macron's pension plan advances despite strikes across France,"PARIS (AP) — Thousands of people angered over President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the retirement age joined a national strike on Wednesday as a committee of lawmakers advanced the proposal.It remains to be seen whether Macron can command a parliamentary majority for his plan to raise the age from 62 to 64 so that workers can pay more money into the system. If not, he could risk imposing the unpopular changes unilaterally.The plan also would deny a full pension to anyone who retires at 64 without having worked for 43 years — short of that, they'd have to wait until 67.Macron has promoted the changes as central to his vision for making the French economy more competitive. Unions remained combative late Wednesday, calling on lawmakers to vote against the plan and denouncing the government’s legal shortcuts to move the bill forward as a dangerous “denial of democracy.”Economic challenges have prompted widespread unrest across Western Europe. In Britain on Wednesday, teachers, junior doctors and public transport staff were striking for higher wages to match rising prices. And Spain's left-wing government joined with labor unions to announce a “historic” deal to save its pension system by raising social security costs for higher wage earners.Spain's solution is exactly what French unions would like, but Macron has refused to raise taxes, saying it would make the country’s economy less competitive. Something must be done, the president has argued, to sustain France's current levels of pension payments with the retiree population expected to grow from 16 to 21 million by 2050.In Paris, loud music and huge union balloons kicked off the 8th nationwide round of protests. An array of banners set the tone: “They say capitalism. We say fight,” read one. Others said “Paris enraged,” or “If rights aren’t defended, they’ll be trampled.”“If we don’t speak up now then all our rights that the French have fought for will be lost.” said Nicolas Durand, a 33-year-old actor. “Macron is out of touch, and in bed with the rich. It’s easy for the people in government to say work harder, but their lives have been easy.”Ten days into a sanitation workers' strike, Paris was awash in piles of rancid rubbish, which police ordered cleared out along the march route after troublemakers used garbage to start fires or throw trash at police in recent demonstrations.A heavy security force accompanied the march through the Left Bank and disbursed a group of black-clad troublemakers that attacked two real estate offices, smashing their windows with fence panels. A total of 22 people were detained, Paris police said.Security forces responded to violence with tear gas in other cities, including Nantes in western France and Lyon in the southeast.The committee of seven senators and seven National Assembly lawmakers agreed on the final text Wednesday in a closed-door meeting, and a conservative Senate majority is expected to approve it as early as Thursday.The situation at the National Assembly is much more complicated.Macron’s centrist alliance lost its majority in legislative elections last year, forcing the government to count on conservatives’ votes to pass the bill. Leftists and far-right lawmakers are strongly opposed and conservatives are divided, making the outcome unpredictable.Macron “wishes” to have a vote proceed at the National Assembly, his office said following an evening strategy session with Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and ministers in charge of the bill at the Elysee presidential palace. Yet no firm decision was made and government talks were to continue Thursday morning.Approval in the National Assembly Thursday would give the plan more legitimacy, but rather than face the risk of rejection, Macron could instead use his special constitutional power to force the bill through parliament without a vote.French government spokesperson Olivier Véran said Wednesday that the bill will continue its way through the legislative process, respecting “all the rules that are provided by our Constitution.”Republicans party lawmaker Aurelien Pradié — who opposes the reforms — said Wednesday that if this special power is used, he would lodge a challenge to the constitutional council, a higher French legal body.Train drivers, school teachers, dock workers, oil refinery workers and others joined garbage collectors in walking off their jobs on Wednesday, maneuvering past thousands of tons of garbage piling up on the sidewalks of Paris and other French cities.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin asked Paris City Hall to force some of the garbage workers to return to work, calling it a public health issue.The Paris mayor, Socialist Anne Hidalgo, said she supports the strike. Government spokesperson Véran warned that if she doesn't comply, the Interior Ministry is ready to act instead.Public transport, meanwhile has been disrupted: About 40% of high-speed trains and half the regional trains have been canceled. The Paris Metro has slowed, and France's aviation authority warned of delays, saying 20% of the flights at Paris-Orly airport have been canceled.Paris police said 37,000 participated in the French capital, 11,000 less than Saturday, even as polls show widespread opposition to the pension bill. The leading CGT union said 450,000 participated in Paris and 1.7 million across all of France.“It will be those who work the hardest who will get a bad deal. It’s always like that,"" said Magali Brutel, a 41-year-old nurse. ""Very rich people could pay more in taxes — that’s a good solution to pay for an aging population. Why are we effectively taxing the oldest and the poorest?”___Associated Press contributors include Alex Turnbull, Nico Garriga and Thomas Adamson in Paris.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836073,New populist BBB wins Dutch vote; Rutte coalition down,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A new populist party riding anger among Dutch farmers and rural communities at government policies to rein in agricultural pollution emerged as the big winner in provincial elections Wednesday, according to early exit polls.The elections for the Netherlands' 12 provincial legislatures also indirectly decide the makeup of the country’s national senate — and the win for the Farmer Citizen Movement was seen as a powerful protest vote against Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his four-party center-right governing coalition.An IPSOS exit poll predicting the 75 seats in the senate said the Farmer Citizen Movement, known by its Dutch acronym BBB, would probably emerge with 15 seats, tying it as the biggest bloc with a combination of the center-left Labor Party and Dutch Green Party. Rutte’s coalition, which already did not have a majority in the senate, saw its combined seat holding shrink to 24 from 32. The exit polls have a margin of error of one seat per party.The early results cast Rutte's plans to reduce farm nitrate pollution into doubt as his government has tasked provincial legislatures with developing plans to radically reduce emissions.They also cast a shadow over the remainder of Rutte's term in office as he is likely to face problems getting legislation through the senate, the upper house of the national parliament. The next national elections are scheduled for 2025.“Now is the time to take citizens seriously. I am open to talks with everybody. We are ready,"" said BBB leader Van der Plas.She buried her face in her hands when the first exit poll was broadcast and said: “This is not normal. I never expected this.""Her party was formed in 2019 and is taking part in provincial elections for the first time. It won 1% of the votes in the national election in 2021, with Van der Plas, a former journalist focusing on agriculture, becoming a national lawmaker and growing in popularity with her down-to-earth image.“She looks like a big winner tonight,” Rutte said as he congratulated her. But he added: ""We are still a big party. We take our responsibility.”Full results were expected Thursday.Wednesday's elections underscored how fickle the fortunes of populist parties can be. The far-right Forum for Democracy led firebrand Thierry Baudet saw its fortunes totally reverse, just as the BBB soared. The anti-immigrant Freedom Party led by Geert Wilders failed to capitalize on the decline of Forum.The voting came amid widespread dissatisfaction with Rutte’s government and anger among farmers at plans to rein in nitrate pollution, and the big win for BBB was also seen as a ballot box punishment for Rutte's four-party coalition.As he voted, farmer Niko Blomenkamp said he is unhappy with the way the Netherlands’ lucrative agriculture industry is being treated.“It’s very important for the agricultural sector (that) quality remains and the farmers are supported,” he said. “That’s important, but the way the government is dealing with it now, I think it’s not good for us.”The governing coalition wants to cut emissions of pollutants, predominantly nitrogen oxide and ammonia, by 50% nationwide by 2030. Ministers call the proposal an “unavoidable transition” that aims to improve air, land and water quality.The plans have sparked mass protests by farmers in recent years, including blocking supermarket distribution centers with tractors and torching hay bales alongside highways. At farms across the nation, the Dutch flag hangs upside down as a sign of protest.Dozens of parties take part in the provincial elections in this nation of nearly 18 million people, many of the parties small and local.Voters were also electing members of the country’s 21 local water authorities, key institutions in a nation more than a quarter of which is below sea level and which has endless lines of dikes to protect its heartland.Rutte, who came to power in 2010 and is now the Netherlands’ longest-serving leader, was already under pressure after a parliamentary inquiry into earthquakes caused by natural gas extraction in the northern province of Groningen was critical of him and his government. Rutte’s administration hasn’t yet formally responded to the findings, but he acknowledged that the conclusions were “hard and painful.”As she voted in a tiny village 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Amsterdam, Van der Plas said her party wasn’t just for farmers, but for rural communities across the country where many voters feel alienated from national politicians.“This can also be a game changer for the whole government,” she said.Andre Krouwel, a political scientist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said Van der Plas’ brand of what he described as “folksy nationalism” gives her broad appeal extending beyond farmers and into “suburban and urban voters who have a traditional and conservative right-wing outlook on life.”Arriving on his bicycle to vote in The Hague, Rutte played down the possible effect of a victory for the BBB on his coalition.“I really think it’s elections for the provinces and water authorities,” he told The Associated Press. “And of course also for the senate, so in that sense there is also something of national policy in it, but I would be careful about drawing very big conclusions from such a result.”Meanwhile, on the left, the Dutch Labor and Green parties have said they will join forces in the senate after the elections. Wednesday's exit poll had their combined holding of 15 seats level with BBB in the upper house.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836074,Analysis: Syria rebuilding hopes dim as war enters year 13,"BEIRUT (AP) — The recent deadly earthquake in Turkey and Syria which caused billions of dollars in damage has boosted the prospects of Syria's once widely shunned president return to the Arab fold, but appears unlikely to jump-start large-scale reconstruction in the war-ravaged country.As Syria’s conflict enters its 13th year Wednesday, President Bashar Assad’s government still refuses to make concessions to his domestic opponents, rejecting long-standing demands by the United States and its allies as a political solution remains elusive.Oil-rich Gulf Arab countries have been stepping up efforts to normalize ties with the Assad government, but analysts say the ongoing political paralysis is likely holding them back from pumping billions of dollars for reconstruction into Syria.The Feb. 6, earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria, killing more than 50,000 people, including about 6,000 in Syria, exacerbated the destruction caused by Syria's 12-year conflict which has killed nearly half a million people.The World Bank estimated in an initial post-earthquake assessment that the disaster had caused $5.1 billion worth of physical damage across both government- and rebel-held Syria. It estimated some $226 billion in losses — including economic and physical damage — during the first four years of the war in 2016, about four times Syria’s 2010 gross domestic product.Since the balance of power shifted in Assad’s favor over the past few years, the government has rebuilt small parts of the country with the help of its allies. These include a section of the centuries-old market in the northern city of Aleppo and some historic mosques in Aleppo and the central city of Homs. However, entire cities, towns and villages remain in ruins, while the conflict has caused lasting damage to the country's electric, transportation and health systems.The quake worsened the situation.International medical and humanitarian agencies fear dangerous outbreaks of diseases because the country's battered water and sanitation systems were further damaged by the quake. The Red Cross’ global chief recently said that rebuilding infrastructure ought to be a priority.Still, the quake and recent rapprochement between regional powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia, who since 2011 have supported rival groups in Syria’s conflict, may be a turning point in Damascus’ political fortunes.Assad appears poised to make a political comeback in the Arab world, more than a decade after the 22-member Arab League suspended Syria’s membership over his brutal crackdown on protesters and later on civilians during the war.International sympathy following the quake appears to have sped up the regional rapprochement that had been brewing for years. Before the tragedy, the United Arab Emirates had already reestablished ties with Damascus, while Syria had been increasing its contacts with Turkey, a main backer of the opposition.After the disaster, formerly hostile Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia delivered aid to government-held Syria, along with Assad's traditional backers Russia and Iran. Washington’s key allies began restoring or bolstering diplomatic ties with the Syrian government.Tunisia’s president recently said he hopes to reestablish ties with Syria, while the foreign ministers of Jordan and Egypt met with Assad in Damascus for the first time since 2011. The region’s top parliamentarians agreed in a Baghdad summit last month to work toward ending Syria’s political isolation.Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister acknowledged that there is a growing consensus among Arab countries that dialogue with Damascus is necessary. Riyadh is hosting the next Arab League summit in May, where most states hope to restore Syria’s membership after it was suspended in 2011, the Arab League's Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Tuesday.Syria hopes that such reconciliation will unlock long-awaited funds to rebuild the battered country. However, analysts said it is unlikely to happen at any large scale for now.“Reconstruction and its funding are thorny issues and are not currently on the table,” said prominent Istanbul-based Syrian economist Samir Seifan.One reason is the sheer size of the challenge. Seifan estimated that Syria suffered about $150 billion in physical damage, and said reconstruction could ultimately cost over $400 billion as it includes lost opportunities such as development projects that would otherwise have been carried out.Some Arab nations, such as key Syria opposition backer Qatar, want Assad to make concessions to the opposition in order to reconcile, he said.But perhaps the largest barrier to ending Syria’s international isolation is that Washington has not had a change of heart about Assad.“We have been clear when it comes to our policy on the Assad regime,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity under regulations. “Absent enduring progress toward a political solution to the Syrian conflict, we will not normalize relations with the regime, nor will we support other countries normalizing relations.”Syria has not implemented U.N. Security Council resolution 2254 adopted in December 2015 as a road map to peace in Syria. Acceptance of the road map is a key demand of the U.S and the European Union for normalizing relations with Damascus.The resolution calls for a Syrian-led political process, starting with forming a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections.In recent years, as government forces have taken control of most of the country, internationally mediated negotiations between Damascus and the opposition have stalled.And while Washington and key European states remain hostile towards Assad, they don’t have a strong ally in the opposition, analysts say. Control of northwest Syria is split between the al-Qaida-affiliated rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and Turkish-backed militias that have fought against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.Hayat Tahrir al-Sham “will not be acknowledged as an opposition you can talk to, especially by the U.S. or the Europeans,” Joseph Daher, a Swiss-Syrian researcher and professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, adding that they are still ”portrayed as an extremist group.""U.N. officials hope the earthquake will now push the parties to the conflict back to the table, after its damage compounded the devastation left by the war.“The support provided in the aftermath of these earthquakes must be channeled into renewed energy on the political track, to address the fundamental issues underpinning the Syria conflict,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement marking the 12-year anniversary of the conflict.___Mroue has reported from the wider Middle East, including Syria, since 1992 and Chehayeb since 2014.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836091,DHL Global Connectedness Index: Globalization resilient even as U.S.-China decoupling advances,"Global flows of trade, capital, information stronger than pre-pandemic; people flows recovering         No shift from global to regional trade flows         No compelling evidence of global economy disintegrating into blocs         Share of U.S. flows involving China decreased in 8 out of 11 examined areas, including merchandise exports and imports, and specific capital flows         Netherlands remains the most globalized country, followed by Singapore and Belgium        SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 15 March 2023 - DHL and New York University's Stern School of Business today released the new DHL Global Connectedness Index 2022, an in-depth report on the state of globalization and its prospects. Analyzing data from 171 countries and territories, it reveals how flows of trade, people, capital, and information move around the world.            The report shows that international flows have been remarkably resilient in the face of recent shocks such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. After a slight decline in 2020, the composite DHL Global Connectedness Index rose back to above pre-pandemic levels in 2021. The currently available data points to a further increase in 2022, despite slower growth in some flows. International trade in goods was 10 percent above pre-pandemic levels in mid-2022. International travel remained 37 percent below 2019 levels in 2022, but doubled compared to 2021.   ""The latest DHL Global Connectedness Index data clearly debunks the perception of globalization going into reverse gear,"" John Pearson, CEO of DHL Express, concludes. ""Globalization is not just a buzzword, it's a powerful force that has transformed our world for the better. By breaking down barriers, opening up markets and creating opportunities, it has enabled individuals, businesses and entire nations to flourish and thrive like never before. As we continue to embrace globalization, we can build a brighter future that benefits us all, creating a world that is more interconnected, more prosperous and more peaceful than ever before.""   U.S. and China: Geopolitical rivalry frays connection   The DHL Global Connectedness Index provides evidence that the U.S. and China are decoupling in many fields. Looking at 11 types of trade, capital, information, and people flows (such as merchandise exports, M&A transactions, and scientific research collaboration), the share of U.S. flows with China declined for 8 out of 11 types since 2016. In the same period, the share of China's flows with the U.S. decreased for 7 out of 10 types with data available for China. Several of these were large declines. Nonetheless, the U.S. and China are still linked by far greater flows than any other two countries that do not share a border. Further, the data shows that, so far, the decoupling between these two countries has not led to a broader fragmentation of global flows between rival blocs of countries.   No evidence of trend towards regionalization – average distance of international flows increased   Analyses in the DHL Global Connectedness Index also show that predictions of a shift from globalization to regionalization have not – at least yet – come to fruition. The average distance traversed by trade, capital, information, and people flows has increased over the past two decades, and trade flows even stretched out over longer distances during the Covid-19 pandemic. The only category that displays a clear recent shift toward regionalization is people flows. This is due to the dramatic change in travel patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""It remains an open question whether trade patterns will become significantly more regionalized in the future,"" says Steven Altman, Senior Research Scholar and Director of the DHL Initiative on Globalization at NYU Stern's Center for the Future of Management. ""Many companies and governments are focused on nearshoring to regionalize supply chains, and there are substantial business benefits that can come from regionalization. On the other hand, more than half of all trade already happens within regions, and the benefits of long-distance trade are still important, especially as inflation remains high, economic growth has slowed, and container shipping rates have come back down.""   Ranking of most globally connected countries: Netherlands at the top    In the country ranking of the DHL Global Connectedness Index 2022, the Netherlands was again the most globally connected country. Singapore ranked second overall and first in terms of the size of international relative to domestic flows. The UK has the most globally distributed flows. Among the 55 most globally connected countries, there are representatives from every world region.   The DHL Global Connectedness Index   Published regularly since 2011, the renowned DHL Global Connectedness Index provides reliable findings on globalization trends by analyzing 13 types of international trade, people, capital, and information flows. The 2022 edition is based on over four million data points from 171 countries, accounting for 99.7 percent of the world's gross domestic product and 96 percent of its population. A collection of 171 one-page country profiles provides concise summaries of individual countries' globalization patterns.   The report was commissioned by DHL and authored by Steven A.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836093,Sennheiser Profile USB microphone provides ease of use and best-in-class audio - Plug in and you’re ready to stream,"WEDEMARK, GERMANY -  Media OutReach - 15 March 2023 - Today, Sennheiser is launching the Profile USB microphone, a cardioid condenser microphone that presents an easy and stylish solution for streaming and podcasting. It combines professional sound with direct accessibility of all functions, allowing streamers, podcasters and gamers to fully focus on their content. The side-address microphone is available as a table stand version and as the Profile Streaming Set with a 3-point self-locking boom arm. Both models are shipping from today.             Putting audio quality and ease of use first   At the heart of the Profile USB microphone is an award-winning Sennheiser condenser capsule, the KE 10. Its cardioid pick-up pattern provides the typical attenuation of sound coming from the rear, making sure that the streamer's voice is in focus.   In designing the Profile, product managers Benny Franke and Dennis Stegemerten also put an emphasis on ease of use. ""When you are recording your podcast or doing a live stream, you already have to worry about the content, perhaps room treatment, the camera set-up, interaction with your audience – the last thing you need in this situation is a complex audio set-up"", explains Franke. ""So we tried to create tech that gets out of the way of your creative process.""   Stegemerten continues, ""The design is simple and efficient and does not overwhelm you. Profile is simply plugged into the USB-C port of your computer or tablet – your device will automatically recognize the microphone, and it's ready to capture your voice. There is no need for an interface or any software, no additional window to keep open so that you can control the mic settings. One intuitive touch of a control directly on the mic – that's all that is needed.""   At its front, the Profile USB Mic features a soft-touch, no-noise mute button, a gain control for the microphone volume, a mix control to set the balance between your voice and the computer/tablet audio, plus a volume control for headphone monitoring. Headphones or earphones can be connected via a 3.5 mm socket at the back of the Profile USB microphone.   LED rings on the Profile conveniently signal the operating status. When the LED ring around the gain control is green, the mic is ready to go. When the same light ring turns yellow at times or all of the time, the mic is clipping and you need to reduce the mic volume. When the microphone has been muted, light rings around the mute button and the gain control light up red.       LED rings on the Profile USB microphone immediately show users the operating status               Mic placement made easy  ""Right out of the box, the Profile delivers a natural, warm sound that accentuates the body and presence of your voice. Interestingly enough, you can even hear this difference on platforms that compress the audio,"" explains Franke. ""Having a great capsule is essential for this – but placing the microphone correctly is just as important. It should be positioned within 15 cm (6 in) from your mouth or the sound source to ensure both clarity and warmth.""   The Profile can be tilted for optimum positioning, the self-locking joint will ensure that the mic stays in position. 3/8"" and 5/8"" connectors at the bottom allow the mic to be used with third-party table stands. Users who are looking for more sophisticated placement possibilities should opt for the Profile Streaming Set, which comes with a 3-point self-locking boom arm. With its sleek and modern design, including integrated cable management, the boom arm is ideal for any on-camera applications.   Stegemerten concludes: ""To round things off, Profile is made from metal, so it will be a rugged audio companion throughout – no matter whether you're just getting started or are a seasoned pro and looking to simplify your set-up.""

The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and a delegation headed by Franz Wessig of Austria’s Ministry of Labor and Economy also discussed customs regulations, Industry 4.0, and cooperation on digital issues.MOEA Vice Minister Chen Chern-chyi (陳正祺) pointed out the important role that small and medium enterprises played in both countries, as well as the existence of little-known companies which nevertheless played key parts in their respective sectors. Green energy and low-carbon businesses also held promises of cooperation and investment, the vice minister said.Within the European Union, Austria was Taiwan’s seventh-largest trading partner. Trade between the two countries reached a total value of US$1.7 billion (NT$52.07 billion) in 2022, increasing 6% from the previous year, with cars and semiconductors as key growth sectors.",2023/3/15,438,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836131,Ugandan leader's son unnerves with tweets of ambitions,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — On Twitter, the Ugandan president’s son has mused about invading neighboring Kenya, praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and offered cattle for the Italian prime minister's hand in marriage.While many of his tweets are dismissed as laughable, the ones about succeeding his father in this East African nation are a source of concern for some.Many Ugandans want decisive political change after nearly four decades of the same government, but the son of President Yoweri Museveni is already claiming victory. “I will be President of Uganda after my father,” Muhoozi Kainerugaba tweeted earlier this month. “Those fighting the truth will be very disappointed!!!”Museveni, 78 and in power for 37 years, hasn't said when he will leave office. Kainerugaba is at the peak of his military career as a four-star general who is a linchpin of the security apparatus supporting Museveni.But at 48, Kainerugaba is now six years older than his father was when he became president, underscoring what some see as the root of his increasingly impatient claim to the presidency. With his tweets — which Ugandans try to decode for signs of what's coming — he has injected a measure of intrigue in politics midway through Museveni’s sixth elected term.Does Kainerugaba, described by some Ugandans as the ""standby generator,"" have a legitimate path to the presidency? Or will he take matters into his own hands?""If even the son could no longer bear his father’s endless rule, why should others tolerate it?"" asked columnist Alan Tacca, writing in the Daily Monitor newspaper. “Right now, many of his supporters and professional opportunists seem unsure which way to jump.""Kainerugaba has staged rallies in the past year that he says are to introduce him to youth across the country, even though serving army officers are legally barred from engaging in partisan affairs. He also has attacked the ruling party, led by his father, as a “reactionary” group full of corrupt criminals.The son's verbal attacks have sparked a backlash, with the vice president saying Museveni will run again in 2026 and other officials asserting their faith in the president.But tensions between Kainerugaba and some in the ruling party have promoted him as his own man, said Frank Gashumba, an entrepreneur and political analyst who is one of Kainerugaba’s most prominent supporters.Gashumba spoke of Kainerugaba as an honest leader who would be intolerant of official corruption in the authoritarian style of Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who is often praised by Kainerugaba. “I see another Kagame,” he said, explaining why he believes some in the ruling party are unnerved. “I see he wants to bring in the iron hand.”The president's son could not be reached for an interview.Kainerugaba, who is currently serving as a military adviser to his father, was born in neighboring Tanzania when Museveni was active in the clandestine struggle against Ugandan dictator Idi Amin. He attended boarding school in Uganda before receiving his military education in Britain and the U.S. He has never served in a civilian capacity.His quick rise through the army ranks proved controversial over the years amid allegations of a secret project to groom him for the presidency. A purge in recent years of Museveni’s contemporaries in the military is widely seen as paving the path for Kainerugaba, whose perceived allies now control a wide range of military assets.Museveni has said nothing publicly to disavow or encourage Kainerugaba’s political ambitions. But while celebrating the son’s birthday last year, he warned that while he was patient with corrupt officials, this was not the case with Kainerugaba. “He will fight corruption,"" said Museveni. The comment was seen as a sign that Museveni sees Kainerugaba as Uganda’s future leader.But many have doubts about the president’s son.Those who know him say he is impulsive, citing his comments on Twitter. Museveni once had to apologize to Kenya for a tweet that said Uganda’s forces could take its capital, Nairobi, in two weeks. Museveni then removed Kainerugaba as infantry commander even as he promoted him to the highest military rank. Despite the rare public rebuke of his son, Museveni cited “many other positive contributions the general has made and can still make.”Yet Kainerugaba continues to tweet provocatively. “In the cannibalistic politics of NRM, let me say this, those who fight my father, fight me and those who fight me, fight my father,” he tweeted in January, speaking of the ruling party.Kainerugaba also has faced charges of rights abuses in relation to his previous role as commander of Uganda’s special forces. Opposition figure Bobi Wine has said he and some supporters have been victimized by the special forces, and a satirical writer now exiled in Europe accused Kainerugaba of ordering his torture while in detention. The special forces deny these allegations.Others criticize Kainerugaba for his lack of political charm, saying he is a pure soldier while his father has a folksy style.And while Museveni imbibed Marxism and as a college student sought to verify Frantz Fanon’s theory of violence, Kainerugaba has not outlined his political vision. He sometimes makes a spiritual claim to leadership as a presumed heir to the line of an ancient dynasty of cattle keepers known as the Bacwezi.He is yet to craft a compelling argument for why he should be supported, said Yusuf Serunkuma, a political theorist. And yet Serunkuma has argued that a coup by Kainerugaba would be celebrated by many Ugandans.“Coups are back on the African continent, and they are popular,” he said. “The best chance by far for him is to take power when his dad is still alive.”",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836133,"Cyclone Freddy wanes after battering Malawi, Mozambique","BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) — Cyclone Freddy has dissipated after killing hundreds of people and displacing thousands in Mozambique and Malawi since late last week, although flooding remains a threat in both countries, a regional monitoring center said late Wednesday.The cyclone has killed at least 225 people in Malawi's southern region including Blantyre, the country's financial hub, according to local authorities. Another 88,000 people are displaced. In neighboring Mozambique, officials say at least 20 people have died since the storm made landfall in the port town of Quelimane on Saturday night. Over 45,000 people are still holed up in shelters, with about 1,300 square kilometers (800 square miles) still under water, according to the EU's Copernicus satellite system.“There are many casualties — either wounded, missing, or dead and the numbers will only increase in the coming days,"" said Guilherme Botelho, the emergency project coordinator in Blantyre for Doctors Without Borders. Malawi, which has been battling a cholera outbreak, is at risk of a resurgence of the disease, Botelho said, ""especially since the vaccine coverage in Blantyre is very poor.”The aid organization suspended outreach programs to protect its staff against flash floods and landslides but is supporting cyclone relief efforts at a local hospital.Freddy was initially projected to exit back to the sea on Wednesday but has since waned and is no longer classed as a tropical cyclone, the United Nations’ weather monitoring center in Réunion said.But even with the cyclone having dissipated, “the emergency will not be over for many communities as rain from upland areas continues to flood downstream areas over the coming days,” said Lucy Mwangi, the country director for Malawi at the aid organization Concern Worldwide.“Even rich countries that are advanced democracies would have been no match for the level of destruction this cyclone has brought,"" said Kim Yi Dionne, a political scientist at the University of California Riverside. Freddy accumulated more energy over its journey across the Indian Ocean than an entire U.S. hurricane season.Yi Dionne said that the scale of damage is despite Malawi's disaster agency having prepared and planned “for the challenges that come with our contemporary climate crisis.”Scientists say climate change caused by mostly industrialized nations pumping greenhouse gases into the air has worsened cyclone activity, making them more intense and more frequent. The recently ended La Nina that impacts weather worldwide also increased cyclone activity in the region.African nations, who only contribute about 4% of planet-warming emissions, are “once again paying the steepest price to climate change, including their own lives,” said Lynn Chiripamberi, who leads Oxfam's southern Africa humanitarian program.Cyclone Freddy has caused destruction in southern Africa since late February, pummeling Mozambique as well as the islands of Madagascar and Réunion last month.“Freddy is quite an exceptional weather phenomenon,"" Anne-Claire Fontan, a tropical cyclone scientific officer at the World Meteorological Organization told The Associated Press. Its longevity, distance covered, the number of times it has intensified and the amount of energy it accumulated over time has been extraordinary, she said.She added that its second landfall in Mozambique ""is explained by the presence of two competing steering influences. It is not rare.”Freddy first developed near Australia in early February. The U.N.'s weather agency has convened an expert panel to determine whether it has broken the record for the longest-ever cyclone in recorded history, which was set by 31-day Hurricane John in 1994.___Alexandre Nhampossa and Tom Gould contributed to this report from Maputo, Mozambique.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836134,"Samsung to invest $230 billion to build ""mega"" chip cluster","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Wednesday it expects to invest 300 trillion won ($230 billion) over the next 20 years as part of an ambitious South Korean national project to build the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturing base near the capital, Seoul.The chip-making “mega cluster,” which will be established in Gyeonggi Province by 2042, will be anchored by five new semiconductor plants built by Samsung. It will aim to attract 150 other companies producing materials and components or designing high-tech chips, according to South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.Samsung’s new plants will be located near its existing domestic factories and will produce both computer memory chips used for storing data and higher-margin logic chips designed to perform a broader range of functions, the company said.A giant in the global memory business, Samsung is trying to expand its presence in advanced chips, anticipating that demand will soar in coming years with the adoption of new technologies such as 5G wireless networks, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The semiconductor cluster is part of broader government plans announced Wednesday to promote six key technology industries the country sees as most crucial for its export-dependent economy. Apart from semiconductors, they include rechargeable batteries, electric vehicles, robotics, displays and bio-technology. The government hopes to draw 550 trillion won ($422 million) in corporate investment on those projects through 2026.South Korea's plan comes as other technology powerhouses, including the United States, Japan and China, are building up their domestic chip manufacturing, deploying protectionist measures, tax cuts and sizeable subsidies to lure investments. In a meeting with economic policymakers and business leaders Wednesday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol described technology industries as the country's “key economic growth engines and security and strategic assets that are also directly linked to job creation and livelihoods.""“(South Korea) has world-class manufacturing capabilities and technologies in various high-tech industries such as semiconductors, secondary batteries, and displays, but (government) support and regulatory conditions have been insufficient,” the Trade Ministry said in a statement.Samsung, South Korea's biggest company, has seen its profit plummet in recent months as a weak global economy, rattled by Russia’s war on Ukraine and high inflation, depressed demand for its consumer electronics products and memory chips. The company’s profit for the three months through December fell near 70%, partially because chip prices fell sharply as clients adjusted their inventories to reflect economic uncertainties.SK Hynix, another major South Korean chipmaker, reported an operating loss of 1.7 trillion won ($1.3 billion) for the October-December period, which marked its first quarterly deficit since 2012.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836136,Indonesia arrests 4 foreigners for alleged drug smuggling,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian authorities said Wednesday they have arrested four foreigners for allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into the country, including a Nigerian man who had swallowed dozens of capsules filled with more than a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of methamphetamine.A Brazilian man and three Nigerian men were arrested separately between January and March at Soekarno-Hatta international airport in Jakarta and several apartments in the capital, police spokesperson Trunoyudo Wisnu Andika told a news conference in Jakarta.Indonesia is a major hub for drug trafficking in Southeast Asia and has strict drug laws, with convicted smugglers sometimes executed by firing squad.Gatot Sugeng Wibowo, chief of customs at Soekarno-Hatta, said officers arrested Malachi Onyekachukwu Umanu, a Nigerian who arrived at the airport from Ethiopia on March 5 with no suitcase or bag.His suspicious behavior prompted officers to check his body, and an X-ray turned up some 64 capsules inside his stomach. Authorities managed to force all the capsules, which were filled with a total of 1.07 kilograms (2.3 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine, out of his stomach within three days, Wibowo said.Customs officers at the airport also arrested a Brazilian man, Gustavo Pinto da Silveira, shortly after he arrived from Rio de Janeiro in early January, carrying a backpack, suitcase and surfboard. He initially refused to let officers test the contents of liquids in his luggage.His resistance led officers to further investigate the substance, which was stored in six toiletry bottles and had a strong odor. Lab tests confirmed the fluid was 2 liters (67.6 ounces) of liquid cocaine. Police said it was worth 20 billion rupiah ($1.3 million).Police also arrested two other Nigerian nationals along with an Indonesian man and woman who tried to smuggle 1.04 kilograms (2.2 pounds) of crystal meth from India wrapped in lace fabric through a post office in Jakarta.Mukti Juharsa, the police director of drug investigations in the capital, believes the recent arrests are all linked to an international syndicate that sought to distribute the drugs in Jakarta.“Foreigners shouldn't try to bring drugs to Indonesia. They won’t escape being arrested, as customs at all international airports in Indonesia have been improved,” Juharsa said.He said the suspects would be punished according to Indonesia’s strict narcotics law, with a minimum of five years’ imprisonment and a potential death sentence, as both dealers and distributors of various types of drugs.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says Indonesia is a major smuggling hub in part because international drug syndicates target its young population. There are 5.6 million drug users in the country of 270 million people, Indonesia’s National Narcotics Agency estimates.In May 2022, Indonesian navy officers made Indonesia’s biggest cocaine seizure after finding plastic packages containing 179 kilograms (nearly 400 pounds) of the drug floating at sea near Merak Port on the main island of Java. No one has been arrested.Last July, police secured 48.47 kilograms (106.8 pounds) of cocaine in 43 packages plastered with stickers bearing the Israeli flag and the Eiffel Tower, floating at sea near Anambas island. And last December, eight similar packages containing 8.8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of cocaine were found by firewood seekers on neighboring Batam island, next to Singapore.Most of the more than 150 people on Indonesia’s death row were convicted of drug crimes. About one-third of them are foreigners. The country's last executions were in 2016, when one Indonesian and three foreigners were shot by a firing squad.",2023/3/15,,World

And the median U.S. home price has increased 42% since 2019.A series of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve last year is making matters worse for homebuyers, pushing mortgage rates to their highest level in two decades.The average long-term rate on a 30-year mortgage reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall. Rates eased in December and January, but have been climbing since early February. The average rate hit 6.73% last week, the highest level since early November. A year ago, it averaged 3.85%.That rate translates into a roughly 49% increase in the monthly payment on a median-priced U.S. home than a year ago, said George Ratiu, senior economist at Realtor.com.“For real estate markets, the rise in rates means higher mortgage payments, deepening the affordability challenge just as we move into the crucial spring homebuying season,"" he said.For prospective buyers holding out for a meaningful dip in mortgage rates, they may be in for a long wait. Zillow recently polled 100 economists and real estate experts on their outlook for what the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will be by the end of this year and the median forecast was 6%.Stronger-than-expected reports on the economy this year have fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve may have to keep pushing up its key borrowing rate to tame inflation, deepening the affordability challenge for would-be buyers like Joe Arndt in Reiserstown, Maryland.The 28-year-old athletic trainer has been looking to buy a home in the Baltimore area for over a year, but hasn’t found much he can afford within his $225,000-$250,000 price range. He now feels shut out of the market.“I thought that things would start to cool down a little bit more,” Ardnt said. “Prices are still the same as they were a year ago, if not a little higher.”Another factor that may keep people out of the housing market is the fact that the amount of money a typical homebuyer needs to earn in order to afford a house continues to climb. In the fourth quarter of last year, you had to make at least $80,142 a year to buy a home at the national median price of $325,000, according to an analysis by Attom, a real estate information company. That’s a nearly 36% increase from the same quarter in 2021.The analysis, which was based on data from 581 counties, defines an affordable home purchase as a transaction that includes a 20% down payment and monthly costs for the mortgage payment, property taxes and insurance that don’t exceed 28% of the buyer’s annual income.One market shift that could help make homes more affordable is a significant increase in homes for sale. Nationally, there are more available now than a year ago, and that’s likely to increase in coming weeks as traditionally more homes hit the market in the spring months.The number of homes for sale rose for the first time in five months in January to 980,000, up 15.3% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. That amounts to a 2.9-month supply at the current sales pace — better than in January last year.But it's still far from the 5- to 6-month supply that reflects a more balanced market between buyers and sellers. And the prospects for a bigger spike in supply are slim, given that new construction hasn’t kept up pace with demand after years of underbuilding following the housing crash in 2008. At the same time, most homeowners with a mortgage have locked in ultra-low rates over the years and have less financial incentive to sell.It’s not all bad news for buyers. The bidding wars that led to homes often selling for well above asking prices a year ago are less common as higher mortgage rates have forced some buyers out of the market. And data show sellers are more willing to lower their asking price than they were a year ago.Sobhit Haribhakti, 29, and his fiancée Sierra McNeilly, 26, were worried higher borrowing costs would hamper their bid to become homeowners. But the couple, who live in the Cleveland suburb of Strongsville, were able to find a house they could afford.The couple got a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house for around $230,000, or $15,000 below asking price, and financed the purchase with a 30-year mortgage with a fixed rate of 5.75%. The seller also kicked in $10,000 toward their closing costs.“We’re definitely going to refinance at some point,” Haribhakti said. “But it seems like the way it worked out we got a pretty good amount of seller concessions.”Buyers like Haribhakti and McNeilly who can make the homebuying math work have some trends in their favor. For one, homes are taking longer to sell. On average, homes sold in 33 days of hitting the market in January, up from 19 days a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors.That’s pushing some sellers to lower prices. In January, about 190,000 homes on the market had their price reduced, a nearly threefold increase from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.Many buyers are also increasingly opting for a mortgage rate buydown, which lowers the rate on their home loan for a few years or for the life of the loan and thus reduces the homebuyer’s overall borrowing costs. In exchange, buyers pay fees as part of their closing costs to cover the rate buydown.Some sellers are even offering to cover those closing costs for a buyer to get the deal done.Scott Collett, an account manager in Tampa, Florida, recently negotiated a seller-paid mortgage rate buydown to close the deal on a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house with a pool. The property, which had been on the market for nearly a year, was reduced from $495,000 to $419,000.“I basically offered what they were asking at that point in time, as they paid all the closing costs and inspection fees and everything,” said Collett, 49.The rate on his 30-year loan dropped from 6.25% to 5.26%, an improvement, but still higher than a year ago when rates averaged below 4%.For Collett, it was worth it.“My thought was that if I had a higher interest rate, I’d pay less for the house, but I could also refinance,” he said.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836139,China claims AUKUS sub deal ‘undermines regional and world peace’,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S., U.K., and Australia have “gone further down the wrong and dangerous” path, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday (March 14) in response to a nuclear sub deal announced by AUKUS on Monday (March 13).

            “The latest joint statement issued by the U.S., the U.K., and Australia shows that the three countries, for their own geopolitical interests, have totally disregarded the concerns of the international community,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin (汪文斌) said during a Tuesday press conference.

            “It will only exacerbate the arms race, undermine the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and hurt regional peace and stability,” Wang further claimed. Meanwhile, China at the beginning of March announced it would increase its military spending by 7.2% for 2023 to around US$224.79 billion (NT$6.88 trillion).

            On Monday at a naval base in San Diego, California, U.S. President Joe Biden announced America’s intention to sell five nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, following a meeting with British and Australian prime ministers, according to Politico. Under the AUKUS deal which spans decades, the trio will build a combined fleet of submarines using technology, labor, and funding from all three countries, according to CNN.











            U.S. President Biden rejected China’s claims, saying the submarines would be “nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed,” according to Guardian. Penny Wong, Australia’s foreign minister, said China’s accusations were “not grounded in fact,” Guardian noted.

            The deal is part of the AUKUS alliance, which looks to bolster American, British, and Australian presence in the Indo-Pacific with a particular aim at countering China’s rising military strength in the region, per Politico.

            On Tuesday, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it “welcomes the continued advancement of the AUKUS partnership,” according to Guardian. It added that Taiwan is “at the forefront of the fight against authoritarian expansion.”TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The U.S., U.K., and Australia have “gone further down the wrong and dangerous” path, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday (March 14) in response to a nuclear sub deal announced by AUKUS on Monday (March 13).“The latest joint statement issued by the U.S., the U.K., and Australia shows that the three countries, for their own geopolitical interests, have totally disregarded the concerns of the international community,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin (汪文斌) said during a Tuesday press conference.“It will only exacerbate the arms race, undermine the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and hurt regional peace and stability,” Wang further claimed.

The album cover illustration shows a boy playing guitar on top of the Earth, as a cat stretches and a train puffs along a track.The first single is the cheerful, family friendly “Take the World Apart,” with the lyrics “I'll take the world apart/to find a place for a peaceful heart.”“The source of musical inspiration for this song came from the 50s. The smoochy harmonies and chords have an enchanting effect on the ear. Life was simpler then: lonely hearts yearning for love,"" he said in a statement to The Associated Press.The album reunites Stevens with producer Paul Samwell-Smith, who produced three Stevens albums between 1970-72 — “Tea for the Tillerman,” “Teaser and the Firecat” and “Catch Bull at Four.”Rock & Roll Hall of Fame member Stevens, who also goes by Yusuf, the name he took when he converted to Islam, has been a respected writer since releasing his debut in 1967. He’s had a string of Top 40 hits, from “Peace Train” and “Wild World” to “Morning Has Broken.” He was just named to Glastonbury’s coveted Legends slot this summer.___Mark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/3/15,,World

The research is a buyer’s guide by clearly outlining the comparative study between the top Petroleum-based Wax companies by price, financial status, and product portfolio.A type of wax made from petroleum-based wax is also called mineral wax or paraffin. It is a byproduct from the refinement process of crude oil. It is made up of long-chain hydrocarbons. Many industries use petroleum-based wax, such as candle making, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Because of its affordability, availability, and ease-of-use, it is frequently preferred to other types of wax.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-petroleum-based-wax-market-yhr/1465879/#requestforsamplePetroleum-based wax is an excellent choice for candle making. It has a low melting temperature and can easily be molded into different shapes and sizes. It can also hold scent and color well and has a long-lasting burning time.Petroleum-based wax is used in cosmetics to make lipsticks, balms and lotions. It has a creamy texture and provides smooth application. It can also be used to bind the products together and protect the skin from moisture loss.Although petroleum-based wax is considered safe for these industries, there are concerns over its potential environmental impact and health risks. It can be released into the atmosphere when it is burned. It is also not biodegradable, and can cause pollution if it is not properly disposed. Some companies and consumers are now turning to other waxes such as beeswax and soy wax, which are more eco-friendly.Brenntag

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836205,Purdue's supporting cast helps set table for March Madness,"Purdue stuck to a simple game plan this season: Feed the ball to All-American Zach Edey and let the 7-foot-4 center feast in the post.The old-school philosophy defied today's trendy, small-ball style heavy on the 3-pointer attack but it allowed the Boilermakers to ascend to No. 1 in the AP Top 25 twice this season.Coach Matt Painter's squad needed more than just Edey to claim its first Big Ten Tournament title since 2009. If the East Region's top seed wants to avoid another earlier-than-expected NCAA tourney exit, Purdue's supporting cast must supplement Edey's medley in the middle.“We have a lot of guys who could go to a different team and average a lot of points, be on all-Big Ten teams or whatever, but they’re happy we’re here,"" Edey said Sunday. “We have a lot of guys who love winning. That’s what Purdue is.”The regular-season Big Ten champions are no one-man band. At No. 3 Purdue (29-5), the talent pool runs deep — and everybody has a role.Freshman guards Braden Smith and Fletcher Loyer have started all season after finishing first and second in last year's IndyStar Mr. Basketball Award voting, just like teammates Caleb Furst and Trey Kaufman-Renn did in 2021.Loyer is the smooth, polished shooter, the son of an NBA coach who averages 10.9 points per game. Smith is the confident, gritty guy who basks in driving opponents and their fans bonkers. He's also scores 9.8 per game.“We all can shoot, we knew that coming into the season,” Smith said last weekend. “Early on, we haven’t shot it well but we’re starting to figure it out.”The Boilermakers' rotation has a flavor for everyone.Ethan Morton earned a starting job this year because he's a defensive stopper though he previously seemed comfortable being the high-scoring Pennsylvania prep star who earned the state's Mr. Basketball and Gatorade Player of the Year awards in 2019-20.Guard David Jenkins Jr., a 24-year-old veteran, compiled more than 1,800 points at three schools, earning all-conference honors in two leagues before coming to Purdue. He is 11 points shy of 2,000.Beefy forward Mason Gillis was an Indiana Junior All-Star and one of the state's top baseball players before a knee injury cost him his senior high school season. He helps Purdue play physical, but he's also a skilled shooter as Rutgers discovered when he went 7 of 8 in last week's quarterfinal win and Penn State learned when he made a career-high nine 3-pointers in February.“You've got to do something right?"" perplexed Nittany Lions coach Micah Shrewsberry said after that 20-point loss. “But Zach beat us up in the paint so badly the last time ... it's also about how you construct the team. You have the most dominant player in college basketball, and you put guys around him that fit perfectly.”Few have devised a solution this season and now Purdue has its first No. 1 seed since 1996.Perhaps nobody appreciates the contributions or sacrifices Edey's teammates have made better than Painter, who grew up in Indiana a fan of the rival Hoosiers but was never recruited by Bob Knight even after making the 1989 Indiana All-Star team.Instead, Painter was overshadowed by others at Purdue— Steve Scheffler, Woody Austin and Glenn “Big Dog” Robinson, the focal point of the 1992-93 team many also dubbed a one-man show.Clearly, Painter didn't construct this roster by happenstance.“In recruiting I just tell them, if you become one of our top two or three scorers, here’s how we’ll use you. If you don’t, you’re going to play a role,” Painter said. “But you’ve got to have people that will play roles, and that’s really it’s a tip of the hat to those guys.""Now as Painter and the Boilermakers wait to see who they play Friday in Columbus, Ohio — either Texas Southern (14-20) or Fairleigh Dickinson (19-15) — the hope is that this NCAA trip won't end like some other recent ones.Purdue has been to the Sweet 16 four times in its last five tourney appearances but has only advanced to the Elite Eight once. There have also been three first-round exits since 2015.To achieve their first taste of the Final Four since Joe Barry Carroll took them in 1980, Purdue's complementary players need to produce alonside Edey. Painter knows people will watch to see if the Boilermakers “overdo” their talented big man.“I just think we have good balance,"" Painter said. ""I always talk about everybody’s going to have to sacrifice to be able to win big, and then if you win big collectively, you get individual honors. When you win a championship by three games, I would hope people can kind of open their eyes to it.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836206,Alabama's Miller tops list of NBA prospects at March Madness,"This isn’t the type of NCAA Tournament that will give NBA fans an idea of what they can expect in the upcoming draft.The likely first two picks in the draft – Victor Wembanyama and Scoot Henderson – aren’t playing college basketball. That’s a major change from last year, when the first six picks in the draft all had played in the NCAA Tournament a few months earlier.It’s also worth noting that Villanova freshman Cam Whitmore, generally regarded as one of the top NBA prospects in the college ranks, won’t be playing in this NCAA Tournament because his Wildcats failed to qualify.But there are plenty of guys in this tournament who should have long NBA careers. A look at some of the top NBA prospects in this year’s field (listed alphabetically):ANTHONY BLACK and NICK SMITH JR., ARKANSASThese freshman teammates are regarded as potential lottery picks, though neither was an Associated Press All-Southeastern Conference selection. Black, who is 6-7, averages 12.8 points and 4.2 assists per game, though he also has 3.2 turnovers per game. He’s regarded as a very good defensive player. Smith, a 6-5 guard, hasn’t gotten much of a chance to showcase the skills that made him the nation’s No. 1 prospect in his high school class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports. Smith has played in just 14 games due to a knee injury but scored at least 24 points in three of Arkansas’ last four regular-season contests. First-round game: Thursday vs. Illinois.GRADEY DICK, KANSASDick is a 6-8 freshman with guard skills who earned second-team Associated Press All-Big 12 honors. He’s averaging 14.1 points and 4.9 rebounds, and shooting 39.9% (79 of 198) from 3-point range. He has shown he can play well against top opponents. Some of his games with at least 20 points came against North Carolina State, Indiana, Iowa State, Baylor and Texas. First-round game: Thursday vs. Howard.KEYONTE GEORGE, BAYLORThis 6-4 guard arrived at Baylor as the nation’s No. 9 prospect in his class according to the 247Sports Composite. He’s had an impressive freshman season as a key part of Baylor’s outstanding backcourt. George has averaged 15.8 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists while earning second-team Associated Press All-Big 12 honors. First-round game: Friday vs. UC Santa Barbara.BRANDON MILLER, ALABAMAMiller's off-court situation has been well-documented: Police say he was asked to bring a teammate a gun that was used in a fatal shooting which has resulted in the capital murder case against former teammate Darius Miles and Michael Davis. Miller hasn’t been charged with anything, hasn’t missed any games and has become a star. The 6-foot-9 freshman is the SEC player of the year and has led Alabama to its first No. 1 seed. He averages 19.7 points and 8.3 rebounds and is shooting 39.9% (99 of 248) from 3-point range. First-round game: Thursday vs. Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.JARACE WALKER, HOUSTONAlthough senior guard Marcus Sasser is Houston’s best player, Walker is the Cougars’ top pro prospect. The 6-8 freshman isn’t particularly polished yet, but he has shown flashes of his enormous potential. He scored at least 21 points four times in an eight-game midseason stretch. NBA teams love his versatility. He should develop into a guy who can defend multiple positions, block shots and shoot the 3-pointer. First-round game: Thursday vs. Northern Kentucky.CASON WALLACE, KENTUCKYRated as the nation’s No. 5 prospect in his high school class according to the 247Sports Composite, Wallace averages 11.6 points, 4.2 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game. The 6-4 guard has done that while dealing with some nagging injuries. Wallace has dealt with an ankle injury lately and has shot only 3 of 26 from 3-point range over his last seven games. First-round game: Friday vs. Providence.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836207,Biden says he's focused 'intensely' on lowering drug costs,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — President Joe Biden on Wednesday said his administration was focused “intensely” on lowering health care costs and took aim at “MAGA” Republicans who he said are intent on dialing back Medicare coverage for millions of Americans.Biden used a speech in Las Vegas where he was wrapping a three-day Western swing to make the case there are stark differences in how Democrats are tackling skyrocketing drug prices compared to their Republican counterparts.The president sought to make the contrast as he gears up for an expected reelection announcement. The speech on Wednesday in Las Vegas could serve as an early preview of the campaign ahead as Biden aims to make his efforts at lowering drug costs central to his policy and political agenda.Biden, speaking before a crowd of doctors and nurses at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, vowed to protect Medicare and Social Security, while touting his administration's successful efforts to press pharmaceutical companies to lower the costs of insulin for Americans suffering from diabetes.“MAGA Republicans in Congress don’t think any of this is a good idea,” Biden said. ""They think Big Pharma should be able to make the exorbitant profits at the expense of the American people”The White House thinks it has a winning message in showcasing legislation passed last year that is expected to save taxpayers billions of dollars and lower the cost of drugs for the roughly 84 million Americans who rely on Medicare.Ahead of the speech, White House officials made the case that issue is central to Americans lives and called on Republicans to work with them to lower prescription costs.“These kind of savings will give people a little bit more breathing room, more comfort as they decide to go to the grocery store to buy their food, more ability to pay their rent, or maybe it’s just to do something decent for their families,” Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told reporters on Tuesday as he previewed the Democratic president's remarks.Biden talked up how his administration is rolling out several parts of that law, passed in a Democratic-controlled Congress last year, that cap the price of insulin, make most vaccines free and allow the federal government to negotiate deals on a handful of pharmaceutical drugs for Medicare enrollees.The federal government expects to see significant savings from those negotiations and to make money from a rule that requires drugmakers to send Medicare a check when they raise drug prices higher than inflation.“Let’s finish the job,” Biden said. ""Let’s protect the lower prescription drug costs for everyone”Already, the legislation caps the price of insulin at $35 for disabled and older Americans who rely on Medicare.Biden has proposed extending that cap to all Americans, but that plan faces an uphill battle. Efforts to pass laws capping the price of insulin for uninsured Americans or those with private insurance failed in the Democratic-controlled Congress last year.Biden, however, has still championed last year's bill as a success for the millions of Americans who aren't on Medicare. Drug companies, facing public pressure after tripling their prices for the life-saving drug over the last two decades, have started to voluntarily lower the cost of insulin. Drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced Tuesday it was cutting the cost of insulin to about $72 a vial, on the heels of an announcement from rival Eli Lilly that it would start selling its generic for $25.“This builds on the important progress we made last year when I signed a law to cap insulin at $35 for seniors,” Biden said in a statement on Tuesday on Novo Nordisk's announcement. “I urge all other manufacturers to follow suit and Republicans in Congress to join us and cap insulin at $35 for all Americans.”Another part of the law that the administration hopes will have ripple effects for Americans: the requirement that pharmaceutical companies pay a rebate to Medicare when they raise the cost of drugs faster than inflation.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services won't send a bill to drug companies until 2025, but the federal agency has already started tracking drug prices. The agency on Wednesday identified 27 drugs whose prices were increased too fast, a move that will limit the price that Medicare enrollees have to pay for them. The administration hopes that will motivate drugmakers to lower the cost of those medications.Biden has sought in recent weeks to draw a stark contrast between how his party and Republicans handle health care affordability, repeatedly raising concerns that the GOP will seek to undo the Medicare cost-savings provisions or try to make cuts to the program.Last week, Biden promised to fend off financial challenges facing Medicare by instead raising the Medicare tax rate from 3.8% to 5% on those with annual incomes of $400,000 or more.Republicans leaders — who have publicly disavowed accusations that they'll the cut the program — have yet to coalesce around a plan to address Medicare's impending shortfalls. Last year, the House Republican Study Committee proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters last week that Biden's plan to raise taxes for Medicare “will not see the light of day.”___Seitz reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836209,Floods kill 14 in Turkish earthquake-battered provinces,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Floods caused by torrential rains hit two Turkish provinces that were devastated by last month’s catastrophic earthquake, killing at least 14 people and increasing the misery for thousands who were left homeless, officials said Wednesday.Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said rescue teams were still searching for five people reported missing in three locations, after the flash floods turned streets in Adiyaman and Sanliurfa provinces into rivers, swept away cars, inundated homes and drenched campsites sheltering earthquake survivors.At least 12 people were killed in Sanliurfa, including five Syrian nationals whose bodies were found inside a flooded basement apartment and two other people who died inside a van that was trapped at an underpass.In Adiyaman, two people drowned after surging waters swept away a container home sheltering a family of earthquake survivors.Television footage from Sanliurfa showed flood waters surging along a street and sweeping away cars and debris. Rescuers, using a rope, were seen lifting a man to safety from the inundated underpass. Elsewhere, another person was pulled out of the floodwaters by people who dangled a twisted sheet from the window of a building.“When I woke up, our houses were under water,” Melek Yildirim told the state-run Anadolu Agency after being evacuated from an inundated street in Sanliurfa by boat. “The situation is miserable.”Yildirim said: “We've even forgotten about the earthquake. We've forgotten everything. Household goods, even cars were in the water. May God not allow us to live through this again.”Several people were evacuated from camps where earthquake survivors were sheltering in tents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836210,Austrian police: Possible threat to Vienna places of worship,"VIENNA (AP) — Austrian police warned Wednesday of a possible “Islamist-motivated attack” in Vienna against churches and other houses of worship, citing undisclosed information received by the country's intelligence service.Police in Vienna tweeted that they had heightened security in front of certain buildings and increased the presence of officers in the Austrian capital.“There is a nonspecific threat of an assault against churches,” Vienna police tweeted. “As (a) precautionary measure ... points of interest have been put under increased guard by regular and special operation police forces.”“If there is a concrete danger for the population at a concrete location, Vienna police will warn immediately via all available channels,” police added.Later on Wednesday, Vienna police clarified in another tweet that the threat warning included not just churches but also other houses of worship.“Our precaution measures don’t exclusively affect Christian churches, but also houses of worship of various confessions,” police tweeted. They did not specify which other religious communities could be affected.The police department said it could not predict how long their security measures would be in place.“Police officers are equipped with bulletproof helmets and vests and assault rifles. They will carry out surveillance activities and also carry out checks in road traffic,” police spokesperson Markus Dittrich told local radio station Radio Wien.He did not give further details on the background of the threat but said more police officers would be patrolling in the vicinity of churches. Police asked people not to post images or video of deployed police officers on social media.A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Vienna told The Associated Press that Catholic churches did not appear to be the main target.“We do not appear to be primarily affected,” Michael Prueller said. “While we were informed by police about the general threat, we were also told that there is no imminent danger for Catholics. So we decided to keep out churches open to the public and celebrate all church services as planned for the time being.""Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral was packed with the faithful and tourists on Wednesday.More than half of Austria's population is Roman Catholic, making it the country's biggest religious denomination. There are also smaller communities of Lutheran Christians, immigrant groups that identify as Orthodox Christians, as well as Muslims and Jews.In 2020, a man who had previously tried to join the Islamic State group went on a rampage in Vienna armed with an automatic rifle and a fake explosive vest, shooting dead four people before he was killed by police.___Grieshaber reported from Berlin.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836211,"Texas drove out Chinese firm, not the wind farm it planned","DEL RIO, Texas (AP) — Long before a Chinese spy balloon captivated and spooked the U.S. public, Kyle Bass foresaw what he deemed another foreign danger slated for skies above the Texas-Mexico border: wind turbines.Dozens of them, roughly 700 feet (213 meters) tall — as big as San Antonio's tallest skyscraper — were set to sprout across thousands of scrubby acres near the pristine Devils River. Protests that a wind farm would harm a sensitive ecosystem in Texas flopped, but when attention turned to a Chinese billionaire behind the project, state lawmakers raced to pull the plug.“Drumming up the ire against the national security issues was easier than the environmental issues,” said Bass, whose Monarch Ranch near the Mexico border and the planned wind farm is a flight path for migrating birds and butterflies.U.S.-China ties are strained amid growing tensions over security and trade. In nearly a dozen statehouses and Congress, a decades-old worry about foreign land ownership has spiked since the U.S. military shot down a Chinese spy balloon last month after it traversed the skies from Alaska to South Carolina.Local fears about national security initially yielded a victory for Bass and other Texas landowners in Val Verde County. But in a twist, plans for some of the tallest wind turbines in the country are back on — causing whiplash here in the rural borderlands, hurt feelings and testing of the limits of environmental action against renewable projects proliferating across the country.While President Joe Biden wants more wind and solar power to fight climate change, local resistance is growing in places asked to live with towering turbines. Some East Coast residents pushing back against thousands of them embody the opposition as the U.S. pursues deploying enough wind energy offshore by 2030 to power 10 million homes.In South Texas, worries over the wind farm being developed by GH America Energy, which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Sun Guangxin, fast torpedoed the project in 2021, previewing the wave of states now considering limits on foreign land ownership. Texas lawmakers altogether banned Chinese companies from accessing the state's power grid and other critical infrastructure, forcing the aspiring wind farm developers to sell their interest. The Spanish renewable energy company Greenalia bought it, wiping away national security concerns.ECOLOGICAL WARNINGSAnd with that, state politicians vanished from the fight. Without legislation to protect Devils River, the project could get underway later this year.Landowners say ecological dangers still linger over the prospect of 46 wind turbines suddenly springing up in the county of barely 48,000 residents. Scores of whirring blades could endanger migratory birds that fly through the area seasonally and disrupt the flyways of monarch butterflies and Mexican free-tailed bats, millions of which call the county's Fern Cave home every every year.The Devils River attracts thousands of visitors annually to the pristine white waters that flow for about 40 miles in Val Verde County, creating panoramic canyon views and offering a lens on ancient rock art. On a recent afternoon in February in Dolan Falls, cascading water was the only sound in a hollow of peaceful greenery. Fish swam through the waters, an unexpected sight in the middle of Texas desert.“If you look at the proliferation of wind farms across Texas, we haven’t said a word about 99% of it,” said Jeff Francell, a director of land protection for The Nature Conservancy in Texas, which has come out against the project known as Blue Hills on Carma Ranch.He recalls just one other time his group opposed a wind farm in Texas, where more than 10,000 turbines already spin, more than anywhere in the country. “It really just comes down to sensitive locations,"" he said.But those arguments have struggled to change minds, and even in Del Rio, not everyone opposes the turbines.“They don’t offend me and they don’t bother me,” said Beau Nettleton, an elected Val Verde County commissioner whose own property would be adjacent to the wind farm. “I personally think they look kind of neat.”Elsewhere in Del Rio, the rebooted battle has soured ranchers who found powerful allies just two years ago when the property was under Chinese control. Now those locals feel forgotten. Doug Meyer, who manages Monarch Ranch, said he would feel left behind if the wind farm is built now that national security concerns are resolved.VAL VERDE FORGOTTEN?America's biggest oil and gas state is moving aggressively against wind projects elsewhere while standing by at Carma Ranch. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is backing efforts to box out wind and solar development from economic incentives in Texas, which critics say would undercut renewables and boost fossil fuels.Proposals to create zoning limits for wind energy would not affect projects already under construction and a proposed permitting process would allow ventures underway to advance while companies seek permits.Republicans who railed against the China-backed wind farm never leaned into environmental concerns.“The most compelling part of the previous case I was involved in was the national security implications of the ownership,” said Republican Will Hurd, the former Texas congressman who represented Val Verde County and whose aides say is considering a 2024 presidential run.U.S. officials reviewed concerns about the location being too near Laughlin Air Force Base and determined it wasn't a threat.A person familiar with GH America Energy’s operations confirmed the company sold its interest in the wind farm after the new Texas law prohibited it from developing the project. The person declined to be publicly identified because they weren’t authorized to speak about the company.Greenalia said in a statement the company was “highly committed” to respecting local biodiversity and that it was following existing laws and either obtained or are in the process of obtaining all necessary permits. It did not respond to questions about whether it had completed an environmental impact study, which Texas does not require.Devils River headwaters run up against the property of Alice Ball Strunk, who owns nearly 50 square miles of land split between two parcels. She's also president of the Devils River Conservancy, which has led opposition to wind turbines in Val Verde County for years.Rooms at her Hudspeth River Ranch go for upward of $650 a night and allow vacationers to isolate in the vast, quiet greenery extending to the river's springs.Sitting in her home library surrounded by hunting trophies, Strunk worries light pollution and the sight of turbines would hurt ecotourism.“It doesn’t seem right that someone who isn’t even a citizen here will profit over something that will reduce the neighbors’ values,” she said.Such arguments ring familiar to Erin Baker, a professor of industrial engineering at University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who studies wind farm developments and said environmental concerns are common.“I think there also, unfortunately, is a little bit of — and you are not supposed to say it — but NIMBYism,” said Baker, referring to not-in-my-backyard opposition. “People don’t want change.”___Follow Acacia Coronado on Twitter: https://twitter.com/acacia_coronado___Follow APs full coverage of climate and environment: https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836220,How the last banking tumult fuels today's populist politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Mike Pence and Bernie Sanders are hardly political allies.But in the aftermath of two large bank failures, the conservative former vice president and the democratic socialist senator are striking remarkably similar tones. Pence, a Republican, bemoaned that “we live in a world where certain politically favored businesses are propped up, backstopped and bailed out by government.” Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said ""we cannot continue down the road of more socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for everyone else.”Their sentiment reflects the populism that has coursed through both political parties in the 15 years since shaky financial institutions last spurred anxiety about the broader economy. The 2008 financial crisis unleashed a political realignment that rejected perceived elites and establishment figures, often with unpredictable results for Democrats and Republicans alike.“There is rising discontent with corporate greed, which is less about left versus right than top versus bottom,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which was the first national group to endorse Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's populist-infused 2020 presidential campaign.In the wake of the 2008 crisis, the Republican Party was overtaken by the tea party movement, which clamored for smaller government and limits to federal spending. Donald Trump was eventually elevated at the expense of more established leaders like Jeb Bush, John Boehner and Paul Ryan.Among Democrats, Occupy Wall Street activists drew attention to the party's longstanding ties to big business and went on to help energize Sanders' aggressive challenge to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Warren rose from a Harvard University bankruptcy expert to a national political figure who helped create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That was such a centerpiece of her White House bid that supporters sometimes chanted “CFPB” at her rallies.Meanwhile, a new generation of younger lawmakers aligned with democratic socialists, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined Congress, often toppling longtime incumbents.The result is a deeply fractured political environment in which members of each party are responding to a base of voters who are skeptical of institutions and uninterested in the political niceties that once ruled Washington.At the White House on Monday, President Joe Biden sought to navigate those forces by insisting that taxpayers won't be on the hook for any assistance to failing banks.“This is an important point: No losses will be borne by the taxpayers,” said Biden, whose early days as vice president under Barack Obama were consumed by the response to the financial crisis.The current turmoil is different from that era. While the 2008 crisis centered on souring mortgages held by many banks, this week's trouble seems more narrowly confined to institutions that weren't properly prepared for rising interest rates.And while some of Wall Street's most prominent firms, including Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, collapsed in 2008, there's little concern now about the strength of firms that are considered “too big to fail.” That's because reforms adopted in the wake of the crisis intensified the scrutiny of such institutions, subjecting them to greater regulation, tougher capital requirements and regular stress tests that examine whether they can survive sudden traumas.Some of the most dramatic moments of the 2008 crisis — including a rare White House meeting between then-President George W. Bush, Democratic nominee Obama and GOP nominee John McCain — happened just weeks before the election. This time, the instability is playing out with the presidential campaign in its infancy.But those eyeing the White House in 2024 are nonetheless stoking many now-familiar populist themes.Pence, who has yet to formally declare a presidential campaign, said Biden was “disingenuous” in saying that taxpayers wouldn't ultimately be responsible for the government's response to bank failures.Nikki Haley, Trump's former U.N. ambassador who declared her presidential campaign last month, was more direct: “The era of big government and corporate bailouts must end.”Trump, who is mounting his third presidential campaign, turned to stoking fear, predicting another a 1930s-style depression, in a way similar to how he did amid the 2008 crisis.“WE WILL HAVE A GREAT DEPRESSION FAR BIGGER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN THAT OF 1929,"" he wrote on his social media platform. ""AS PROOF, THE BANKS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO COLLAPSE!!!”Asked about Warren and other top Democrats arguing that banking regulations imposed after the 2008 crisis, which Congress reduced during his administration, helping to prevent current problems, Trump told reporters Tuesday that “rollback was a good thing.”“Otherwise you’d have a lot more banks right now in trouble because they were being eaten alive by regulation,"" said Trump, who also complained that interest rates were too high.Ahead of a widely anticipated presidential campaign, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has pushed the GOP's populist bent into so-called culture wars around race and gender. Without presenting any evidence to support his claim, he said diversity, equity and inclusion requirements at the failed Silicon Valley Bank “diverted from them focusing on their core mission.”Green said that, just as Warren rode outrage over the 2008 crisis to national political prowess, “Donald Trump clearly has a strategy of out-flanking fellow Republicans and neutralizing Joe Biden on economic populist issues, like he did with Hillary Clinton.”If regulators are able to quickly tame the current banking tumult, the longer-term political implications may be limited. But the force of populist politics will endure, especially as Congress must decide later this year whether to raise the debt limit, a once routine ritual that now threatens to become a standoff if Republicans refuse to lift the nation's borrowing authority. Failure to do so would cause a potentially devastating default.James Henry, a global justice fellow at Yale University and managing director at Sag Harbor Group, an information technology consulting firm, blamed Silicon Valley Bank's failure on decades of weakened regulations and a “tiny elite” of venture capitalists and bankers connected to top leaders of both parties.But Henry also said the Biden administration had no choice but to step in, given potentially greater financial threats spreading throughout the tech sector — making the failure fallout difficult to diagnose along ideological lines.“There are no libertarians in the financial crisis,"" Henry said. ""Both sides are trying to be bailed out.”",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836266,"China, Russia, Iran hold joint naval drills in Gulf of Oman","BEIJING (AP) — Naval forces from China, Iran and Russia — countries at odds with the United States — are staging joint drills in the Gulf of Oman this week, China’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday.Other countries are also taking part in the “Security Bond-2023” exercises, the ministry said without giving details. Iran, Pakistan, Oman and the United Arab Emirates all have coastline along the waterbody lying at the mouth of the strategic Persian Gulf.“This exercise will help deepen practical cooperation between the participating countries' navies ... and inject positive energy into regional peace and stability,” the ministry statement said.U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday that the White House was not concerned by the joint training exercise. Kirby said the U.S. and other nations conduct training exercises all the time and this won’t be the first time that the Russians and Chinese have trained together.“We’re going to watch it, we’ll monitor it, obviously, to make sure that there’s no threat resulting from this training exercise to our national security interests or those of our allies and partners in the region,” Kirby said on CNN. “But nations train. We do it all the time. We’ll watch it as best we can.”The exercises scheduled for Wednesday through Sunday come amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China over a range of issues, including China's refusal to criticize Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine and continuing support for the Russian economy.The U.S. and its allies have condemned the invasion, imposed punishing economic sanctions on Russia and supplied Ukraine with defensive arms. Iran and the U.S. have been adversaries since the founding of the Islamic Republic in 1979 and the taking of U.S. diplomats as hostages.China has dispatched the guided missile destroyer Nanning to take part in the drills centered on search and rescue at sea and other non-combat missions. China maintains its only foreign military base, complete with a navy pier, in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti, located just across the Gulf of Oman.The three countries held similar drills last year and in 2019, underscoring China's growing military and political links with nations that have been largely shunned by the U.S. and its partners.Last week, China hosted talks between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival Saudi Arabia that resulted in an agreement between them Friday to restore full diplomatic relations after seven years of tensions.While the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have long-standing military and political ties, relations have frayed over the 2018 killing of U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom’s leadership, and cuts in production by the OPEC+ oil cartel that the administration said was helping Russia.China's hosting of the Iran-Saudi talks placed it in the unusual role of mediator in regional conflicts, one that Beijing appears to be keen to capitalize on under the rubric of President Xi Jinping's “Global Security Initiative.”The country's Special Envoy for the Horn of Africa Affairs Xue Bing on Tuesday “further affirmed China’s readiness to work with countries in the region to contribute to peaceful regional development and build a closer China-Africa community with a shared future by implementing the outlook,” the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying on a visit to Ethiopia.China opposes ""geopolitical competition by external forces (and) has no intention to and will not seek to fill the so-called vacuum or put up exclusive blocs,” Xue was quoted as saying.___Associated Press writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836267,Edmunds Compares: 2023 Toyota Prius vs. 2023 Kia Niro,"The Toyota Prius, which has become synonymous with hybrid cars the past 20 years, is fresh off a full redesign for 2023. The prior generation’s oddball styling, quirky interior and feeble powertrain are now in the rearview mirror. The new Prius now features an attractive look, a sleeker interior and a big increase in power. It’s even more efficient than the previous model. But it’s not the only hybrid car you should consider.The Kia Niro has been on the market since 2016, and like the Prius, it was also redesigned for the 2023 model year. The new Niro sports a stylish bold design, excellent technology and a roomier interior. But is Kia’s hybrid good enough to take on the long-running Prius? Edmunds experts compare them to find out which one is the better buy.FUEL ECONOMY AND POWER The Prius and Niro are two of the most efficient hybrids you can buy, but the Prius sips fuel slower. The front-wheel-drive base model boasts an impressive EPA estimate of 57 mpg in combined city and highway driving, but that dips down to 52 mpg combined in the higher trims. With all-wheel drive, those estimates are 3 mpg lower in combined driving. The front-wheel-drive-only Niro scores an estimated 53 mpg combined in the base trim, but the less efficient higher trims are rated at 49 mpg combined.When Edmunds drove the top-specced versions of both hybrids on its real-world test route, the difference was bigger. The Prius hit its EPA estimate by achieving 52.3 mpg, but the Niro got 47.7 mpg, a bit less than its EPA estimate.Not only is the Prius more efficient, its 194-horsepower hybrid powertrain (196 hp with all-wheel drive) is significantly more powerful than the Niro’s, which produces only 139 hp. That ample amount of power propelled the Prius from 0 to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds, an impressive 2 seconds quicker than the Niro. More power and better fuel efficiency make it an easy win for the Toyota.Winner: Toyota PriusTECHNOLOGY AND INTERIOR SPACE The base trims of both hybrids come equipped with 8-inch touchscreen displays and digital gauge clusters. The Niro provides a larger 10.25-inch touchscreen on all other trims. The Prius offers an even bigger 12.3-inch touchscreen but to get it you have to add it as an option or buy the top trim level.One advantage for the Prius is its standard wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration; you’ll need to use a USB cord to connect in most Niro trims. It also packs tech-forward USB-C ports instead of the Niro’s older USB-A ports.Cargo space behind the rear seats is almost even: 20.3-23.8 cubic feet in the Prius and 22.8 cubic feet in the Niro. That’s a sizable amount and more than you would get in a sedan. Front seat space is similar, but the Niro has more rear passenger room.Winner: tieCOMFORT AND DRIVING Ride comfort is superb in both hybrids, which isn’t always the case in small cars. Their seats are also comfortable, although the Niro’s are on the firm side but have more bolstering to help keep you in place. As with most hybrids, both engines get loud under hard acceleration, but the Niro does a better job keeping out wind and tire noise.Based on our testing, the Prius drives better hands down. Both hybrids are great around town, but the Prius’ quicker acceleration comes in handy on the highway. It also handles much better, making it more fun to drive. The Prius’ superior driving dynamics give it the win here.Winner: Toyota PriusPRICING AND VALUE The Prius’ starting price of $28,545 is a little higher than the Niro’s starting price of $27,915. Both base models come similarly equipped, but for an extra $1,400, you can add all-wheel drive to any Prius trim. The midlevel trims are also closely matched in features, but the Prius is once again a little pricier, although its additional power and mpg justify the extra cost. The Prius’ top trim, which is priced like the Niro’s, offers optional features at an added cost that the Niro doesn’t provide, including a self-parking system, heated rear seats and a surround-view camera system.If warranties are important to you, Kia’s five-year/60,000-mile basic warranty tops Toyota’s three-year/36,000-mile warranty. However, Toyota offers two years or 25,000 miles of free scheduled maintenance.Winner: tieEDMUNDS SAYS: The Toyota Prius and Kia Niro are both highly rated hybrids by Edmunds. But as with any comparison, there’s a winner. The Toyota Prius gets the victory here thanks to its superior power, fuel efficiency and available all-wheel drive._______This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.Michael Cantu is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Instagram.",2023/3/15,,World

Andreas Sander was third, 0.13 back.Kilde finished 0.30 behind in a tie for sixth, though had already retained the season-long World Cup downhill title with six race wins in the discipline. He was presented with his crystal globe trophy after the race.The final downhill of the World Cup season was also a career farewell for veterans Johan Clarey and Travis Ganong of the United States, who placed 12th and 20th, respectively. Both were greeted in the finish area with showers of Champagne from teammates and friends.The 42-year-old Clarey retires as the reigning Olympic silver medalist with six runner-up finishes in World Cup downhills but no wins in 151 starts.The popular Frenchman does, however, hold a World Cup record that might never be beaten when speed is now more controlled on carefully managed courses. Clarey clocked a speed of 162 kph (100.6 mph) in a 2013 race at Wengen, Switzerland.The fastest speed on Wednesday under perfect blue skies in Andorra was close to 131 kph (81 mph) by Otmar Striedinger, who finish eighth.Kriechmayr’s 16th career World Cup race win was his ninth in downhill. The 31-year-old Austrian also took gold at the 2021 world championships.Marco Odermatt, who succeeded Kriechmayr as world champion last month, placed 15th Wednesday. The Swiss star already sealed his second straight overall World Cup title.Kilde will finish runner-up in the overall standings when the season ends Sunday.The women's season-ending World Cup downhill was due to start 30 minutes after the men ended. ___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836269,Musk brought internet to Brazil’s Amazon. Criminals love it.,"ATALAIA DO NORTE, Brazil (AP) — Brazilian federal agents aboard three helicopters descended on an illegal mining site on Tuesday in the Amazon rainforest. They were met with gunfire, and the shooters escaped, leaving behind an increasingly familiar find for authorities: Starlink internet units.Starlink, a division of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has almost 4,000 low-orbit satellites across the skies, connecting people in remote corners of the Amazon and providing a crucial advantage to Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. The lightweight, high-speed internet system has also proved a new and valuable tool for Brazil’s illegal miners, with reliable service for coordinating logistics, receiving advance warning of law enforcement raids and making payments without flying back to the city.Agents from the Brazilian environment agency’s special inspection group and the federal highway police rapid response group on Tuesday found one Starlink terminal up and running next to a pit, an officer who participated in the raid told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition of anonymity over concerns for his personal safety.They also seized mercury, gold and ammunition, and destroyed fuel and other equipment used by miners in an area known as Ouro Mil, controlled by Brazil´s most feared criminal organization, known as the First Command of the Capital, according to federal investigations.Since taking office this year, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has sought to crack down on environmental violations, particularly illegal mining in Yanomami land, Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory. In recent years, an estimated 20,000 prospectors contaminated vital waterways with mercury used to separate gold. They have disrupted traditional Indigenous life, brought disease and caused widespread famine.The environment agency, known as Ibama, has seized seven Starlink terminals in Yanomami land over the past five weeks, the agency’s press office said.Illegal miners have long used satellite internet to communicate and coordinate, but until now that entailed sending a technician, usually by plane, to install a heavy, fixed antenna that cannot be carried off when mining sites move or are raided. And the connection was slow and unstable, especially on rainy days.Starlink – which first became available in Brazil last year and has spread rapidly – solved those problems. Installation is do-it-yourself, the equipment works even on the move, speed is as fast as in Brazil´s large cities and it works during storms.Starlink has long viewed the Amazon as an opportunity. That was underscored by Musk’s visit to Brazil last May, when he met with then-President Jair Bolsonaro.“Super excited to be in Brazil for launch of Starlink for 19,000 unconnected schools in rural areas & environmental monitoring of Amazon,” Musk tweeted at the time.That project with the government hasn't advanced, however. SpaceX and the communications ministry haven’t signed any contract, and only three terminals were installed in Amazon schools for a 12-month trial period, the ministry’s press office said in an emailed response to questions.Nevertheless, Starlink has taken off in the region and begun ushering in change.In Atalaia do Norte, on the western reaches of the Brazilian Amazon near the borders with Peru and Colombia, Rubeney de Castro Alves installed Starlink at his hotel in December. Now, he can make bank transfers and conduct video calls. He even started bingeing Netflix.“There are so many new things to watch that I’m not even sleeping,” Alves said, chuckling.His son once flew all the way to Manaus, the state capital 1,140 kilometers (708 miles) away, just to negotiate with a group of tourists via conference call. Today, internet at his 11-room hotel in Atalaia do Norte is more reliable than in Manaus, and he bought a second terminal for his tour boat to enable communications on its 10-day voyages, Alves said.With high demand for internet, dozens of the riverside town’s 21,000 residents flock to Alves’ hotel each day. Its balcony is a meeting point for teenagers who spend hours playing online games on their phones.“It made a revolution in our city,” Alves said.A world away, in Ukraine, Starlink has yielded advantages on the battlefield in its war with Russia.Ukraine has received some 24,000 Starlink terminals that allow continued internet in the most vulnerable regions of the southeast even amid ongoing Russian shelling. In large Ukrainian cities, authorities have set up “points of resilience” that offer free internet along with hot beverages.The benefits of connectivity were immediately apparent to bad actors in the Amazon, Hugo Loss, operations coordinator for Brazil´s environment agency, told the AP in a phone interview.“This technology is extremely fast and really improves the ability to manage an illegal mine,” Loss said. “You can manage hundreds of mining sites without ever setting foot in one.”Another official with the environment agency told AP it is just beginning to expel miners from the Yanomami territory and the spread of Starlink has complicated that mission. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about personal safety.An unauthorized reseller of Starlink in Boa Vista, the gateway for travel into Yanomami territory, has been marketing the units in a WhatsApp group for illegal miners and promising same-day delivery. Her price for a terminal is $1,600— six times what Alves pays for service at his little hotel in Atalaia do Norte. Others are selling the Starlink terminals on Facebook groups for illegal miners, like one called “Fanatics for Prospecting.”As lawbreakers have gained access to superior internet service, authorities have started using Starlink themselves. Federal agents installed a terminal at a new checkpoint on the Uraricoera River – an important corridor for miners entering Yanomami territory. The official who informed the AP about the Tuesday raid used Starlink to send photos and even heavy video files of their operation.Brazil’s environment agency told the AP via email that it, along with other federal bodies, is studying how to block Starlink’s signal in illegal mining areas, calling it crucial to stopping the activity.The AP emailed James Gleeson, SpaceX’s Communications Director, questions about Starlink’s presence in Brazil and its use by illegal miners in remote areas, but received no response.___AP journalist Yuras Karmanau contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.__Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836280,Expert Insights: Unlocking the Secrets to Successful Guest Posting,"Guest posting has become an effective strategy in the world of digital marketing, offering website owners and guest bloggers alike a way to boost their SEO performance. Guest blogging involves writing and publishing content on someone else’s website or blog; it benefits both parties involved – giving website owners fresh content for their websites while giving guest bloggers an opportunity to promote their brand and build an online reputation.One of the most critical elements for guest posting is finding the appropriate websites. In this article, we’ll cover the advantages of guest posting websites, how to locate them, and their guidelines for submitting guest posts. Furthermore, we’ll demonstrate how to craft an effective guest post using artificial intelligence tools in order to optimize its content for SEO optimization.What Are Guest Posting Websites?Guest posting websites are online platforms that enable bloggers and content creators to publish their articles or blog posts on other websites. These platforms are specifically designed for guest posting, typically having specific guidelines for submissions. There are two primary types of guest posting websites: niche-specific and general.Niche-specific guest posting websites are websites that specialize in a particular industry or topic. These platforms make ideal platforms for guest bloggers with expertise within that particular niche, such as health and wellness blogs, fashion blogs, or technology blogs.General guest posting websites offer a diverse range of topics. They’re perfect for guest bloggers who don’t specialize in one niche or who cover multiple subjects simultaneously. Examples of general guest posting websites include Huffington Post, Forbes, and Entrepreneur.Guest posting websites offer several advantages, such as:Increased Visibility: Guest posting on other websites allows you to reach a wider audience and boost your online visibility. This, in turn, aids in the building of your brand and attracts more visitors to your website.Building Backlinks: Guest posting can also assist in building backlinks to your website. Backlinks are links from other websites pointing directly at yours, which search engines like Google consider a sign of credibility and authority that could potentially improve your rankings on search engines like Google.Enhancing Reputation: Guest posting on established websites can help to build your reputation online. Publishing content on such a renowned platform demonstrates your expertise in your field and credibility as an authoritative source of information.Driving Traffic to Your Website: Guest posting can also help drive traffic to your website. When other sites feature content from you, readers may click the link to learn more about you and your brand.How to Locate Guest Posting Websites?Finding guest posting websites can be a time-consuming endeavor, but it is necessary for finding the ideal sites for your brand. Here are some methods to assist in finding guest posting websites:Google Search: One of the quickest and most efficient methods to locate guest posting websites is via Google search. Simply type in “guest posting websites” or “guest blogging opportunities,” and you’ll be presented with a list of websites that accept guest posts.Social Media Platforms: Searching social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn is an excellent way to find guest posting websites. You can search for keywords related to your niche and follow bloggers and content creators within the industry.Guest Posting Directories: Directories such as MyBlogGuest and PostJoint can be useful in finding guest posting opportunities. These directories list websites that accept guest posts, allowing you to filter results based on your niche or other criteria.Other Methods: Other ways to find guest posting websites include attending industry events, joining online communities, and networking with other bloggers in your sector.Guidelines for Submitting Guest PostsLooking to submit a guest post? Check out these helpful guidelines!Before you submit guest posts, it’s essential to understand the guidelines of each website. Each has its own rules that must be followed in order for your post to be accepted. Here are some general guidelines for submitting guest posts:Understanding Guest Posting Guidelines: Before submitting a guest post, it’s essential to read and comprehend the guest posting guidelines of the website. These typically contain details such as submission procedures, word counts, formatting standards and more.Quality of Content: Your content’s quality is critical when it comes to getting accepted for publication. Make sure it is informative, well-written, and engaging. Use proper grammar and spelling, plus make sure all work is original and not plagiarized.Length of Post: The length of a post depends on the website you submit it to. Some prefer shorter posts, while others require longer pieces. Be sure to adhere to the requirements set forth for that particular website when making your submission.Formatting and Style: Adhere to the formatting and style guidelines set out by the website. This includes using headings, subheadings, and bullet points where applicable. Incorporate images or videos for an engaging post.Linking Policy: Some websites have stringent linking policies, while others allow a certain number of links in an article. Be sure to adhere to the linking policy of the website in question.How to Create a Guest Post with Artificial IntelligenceWriting a guest post using artificial intelligence (AI) tools can help optimize your content for search engine optimization (SEO). Here are some steps to take when using AI tools to craft your guest post:Understand Your Website’s Audience: Utilize AI tools such as Google Analytics and SEMrush to gain insight into who visits your site. Doing this will enable you to craft content that resonates with site visitors.Identification of a Website’s Tone and Style: Utilizing AI tools like BuzzSumo or Ahrefs, use algorithms to detect the website’s tone and style. This will enable you to craft content that complements the overall style and sensibility.Brainstorm Topics for Your Guest Post: Utilize AI tools like Portent’s Content Idea Generator and HubSpot’s Blog Topic Generator to come up with unique, engaging topics for your post. These services can help you come up with engaging posts quickly.Research and Analysis: Utilize AI tools like WordAI or Copyscape for research and content analysis. These applications can help detect any duplicate material and guarantee your material is unique.Writing the Post: Utilize AI tools such as Grammarly and Hemingway Editor to craft your post. These programs will help you refine your writing style and guarantee that all content is free from mistakes.Editing and Proofreading with AI Tools: Utilize AI programs such as ProWritingAid or EditPad to edit and proofread your content. These services can improve the readability and clarity of your writing.ConclusionGuest posting websites are an invaluable asset for building your brand, increasing visibility, and optimizing SEO strategies. By finding the appropriate guest posting websites, adhering to guidelines for submissions, and using artificial intelligence tools to optimize content for search engine optimization (SEO), you can increase the chances of acceptance for your post and drive more traffic to your website.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836303,'Taiwan has a lot to teach other countries': Parliamentary openness forum concludes on second day,"NEW TAIPEI CITY (Taiwan News) — Experts and leaders gathered at the 2023 Parliamentary Openness and Monitoring Forum in New Taipei City on Wednesday (March 15) to sign a joint declaration committing to increasing government transparency and improving parliamentary openness.Kristen Sample, democratic governance lead at the National Democratic Institute, said that by coming to Taiwan, she could see that the networking approach made sense. “From the Asia region and from the Balkans countries, there are some common lessons and practices and standards that are valuable for sharing,"" she said.Sample also spoke about Taiwan’s role in the world as a young democracy. “Taiwan has a lot to teach other countries in terms of its whole of society approach to transparency, but can also learn from other countries who have been in this longer,” she said.When asked about Taiwan’s own issues with government corruption, Sample said developing institutions and strengthening political will is important. She went on to say, “Culture and social norms play a role, but those aren’t static. They’re dynamic and they can be changed.”Ku Chung-hwa (顧忠華), National Policy Advisor to the President and the founder of Taiwan’s Citizen Congress Watch (CCW), stated, “Only through cooperation between parliament and civil society can the democratic system bring happiness to the people.” CCW, Taiwan’s parliamentary oversight group, has a formidable reputation in Taiwan politics. Legislative Speaker You Si-kun (游錫堃) joked about his anxiety about the group in the forum’s opening remarks.CCW chairman Tseng Chien-Yuan（曾建元）, program officer at the Asian Network for Free Elections Lee Chung Lun, the Indonesian Parliamentary Center’s Ahmad Hanafi, Project Manager of the Kosovo Institute for Democracy Violeta Haxholli, Senior Policy Analyst at Democracy Plus Kosovo Albana Rexha, Global Executive Director of Directorio Legislativo Argentina Maria Baron, and Khairil Yusof, co-founder of Sinar Project Malaysia sign the 2023 Parliamentary Openness and Monitoring Forum Joint Statement.Fridon Lala, a Member of the Parliament (MP) of the Republic of Kosovo, spoke about his country’s experience as one of the youngest democracies in the world, having achieved the status in 2008. Since then, Kosovo has passed a declaration that obliges parliament to engage citizens in governance and provide guidelines for ensuring openness, as well as a formal communications strategy, he said.Kosovan MPs regularly hold face-to-face meetings with their constituents so citizens can directly ask questions and discuss problems. Lala said, “I think for us this should just come naturally, but we are also interested in finding institutionalized ways to do it.""He also highlighted his country’s civic education, describing programs targeted at primary and lower secondary age children. He said that Kosovo believes these programs will allow students to see that MPs are citizens too.Kosovan students create drawings of different government institutions, receive classroom visits from MPs, take field trips to parliament, and more senior students hold mock parliament sessions. It’s important to allow children in parliament to sit in the MPs' seats and eliminate the gap between the parliament and the people, “because at the end of the day, all the members of parliament are directly elected by the people,"" Lala said.The 2023 Parliamentary Openness and Monitoring Forum’s second day included speakers from Kosovo, North Macedonia, Japan, Indonesia, the U.S., and Taiwan from diverse backgrounds including academia, governance, media, and non-governmental organizations. The event was organized by Citizen Congress Watch, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, and the National Democratic Institute.",2023/3/15,605,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836323,How Frankfurt became an early techno music hub,"The techno music genre emerged in the 1980s when electronic music pioneers like Kraftwerk inspired young music producers to experiment with synthesizers and turntables. Detroit was way ahead at the time, but Europe was also extremely creative — and one hub of the blossoming techno scene was in Frankfurt am Main.Since 2022, Frankfurt has been home to the Museum of Modern Electronic Music (MOMEM), the first museum of its kind in the world. MOMEM director Alex Azary told DW about how he and other pioneers of the scene, such as Sven Väth and DJ Talla 2XLC, contributed to shaping the movement back then.DW: Why did techno become so big in Frankfurt of all places?Alex Azary: Very early on, this was one of the few cities where you could find such an intact, complete scene. This is where the clubs were, the producers, the musicians, the labels, the record stores. In the early 1980s, perhaps five or six cities worldwide had that status.Another important reason was definitely Dorian Gray, the club at Frankfurt Airport at the time. They always featured the most innovative of all innovative music. It actually started out as more of a continuation of Studio 54 in New York in terms of concept, heavy on the disco. But DJs soon started playing electronic music there.In this location, with its lights and mood, you just felt something changing in the room when electronic music was playing. It inspired people and also motivated them to keep playing cutting-edge music.You were part of that scene?Yes, I was. I clearly remember the first time I went to Dorian Gray. I wasn't 20 yet; I walked into this big club, and when I got to the subwoofer area, I suddenly felt my heart go ""pop-pop,"" racing irregularly — until it suddenly matched the beat.I walked over to the DJ, who was playing a mix of Planet Rock and Kraftwerk, one merging with the other. I had been watching the record that was playing the whole time, and all of a sudden the DJ lifted the turntable's tone arm and removed the record. I was shocked — the music kept playing anyway. That's when I realized he had made a transition that I hadn't heard. I was hooked.I started DJing in 1982. In 1984, my friend Talla founded Technoclub. I was also working as a promoter at Dorian Gray and brought Talla in. From 1987 until the end of 2000, we hosted the Technoclub there, and all the big raves.That club was unique in the world. Many people, including the DJs, would fly in from abroad, party and then fly out again.Frankfurt Airport was an international zone, there was no closing time, so it was possible to open the club around the clock.And of course, the party people that met there were very illustrious and in high spirits, which made it very special because it was really a melting pot. It was a really important place. Unfortunately, it had to be closed for fire safety reasons.These days, Berlin is Germany's techno hot spot. Why is that?There aren't many spaces in Frankfurt. It's difficult for creative people to open clubs and develop a concept of their own. That's why the clubs we have here today are not really about developing the music; they mainly want to sell drinks. And that's a big problem.In Berlin, on the other hand, things really took off after the Wall came down. From old warehouses and factories to gas works, they had spaces that simply matched the music in terms of this industrial look. You can develop something new in such spaces. Unfortunately, we don't have any of that here.For about a year now, techno fans have had a reason to come to Frankfurt once again with your museum. What's the idea behind MOMEM?My partner Talla had the idea for this museum. In 2011, he was traveling in Southern Europe with the Goethe-Institut, giving lectures to young people and students. And he was met with so much interest that he called me at some point and said ""You know what? Actually, there should be a museum for all of this.""Actually, we see ourselves more as an art and cultural center, because this club culture is very vital and still exists today. It's not something closed, but keeps on spreading. It has since become an international phenomenon.But the term museum makes it clear that this is an institution, which I think is important, because we're talking about a culture movement that has inspired people and given important impulses to society for 40 years.Frankfurt's MOMEM currently presents prominent DJs' personal playlists in the exhibition ""Milestones — Favorite Club Tracks 1985-2020,"" along with photographs by international artists.This interview was originally held in German.",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836324,Ukraine: Putin wants to 'expand' conflict by downing drone,"Ukrainian official accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday of trying to widen the conflict in Ukraine.The assertion came after Washington said Russian fighter jets intercepted a US drone over the Black Sea, causing it to crash.The US military said a Russian fighter jet had dumped fuel on an American drone over the Black Sea and then collided with it on Tuesday, causing the drone to crash. The Pentagon slammed the maneuver as ""reckless.""According to US European Command, two Russian Su-27 fighters intercepted the unmanned MQ-9 Reaper over international waters and one clipped its propeller.""The purpose of this all-in tactic is to always be raising the stakes,"" Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary Oleksiy Danilov said on social media.""The incident with the American MQ-9 Reaper UAV — provoked by Russia over the Black Sea — is Putin's way of signaling his readiness to expand the conflict to involve other parties.Moscow has denied causing the crash of the drone. However, Russia's ambassador to the US on Wednesday called on Washington to halt ""hostile"" flights near his country's border after a US drone was intercepted by Russian fighters over the Black Sea.""We assume that the United States will refrain from further speculation in the media and stop flights near Russian borders,"" ambassador Anatoly Antonov wrote on Telegram. ""We consider any action with the use of US weaponry as openly hostile.""Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 and considers it its territory. Ukraine and most countries of the world do not recognize the annexation.The US State Department said it had summoned Russia's ambassador to protest. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, ""obviously, we refute the Russians' denial"" and added that the United States is trying to prevent the fallen drone from getting into the wrong hands.""Without getting into too much detail, what I can say is that we've taken steps to protect our equities with respect to that particular drone,"" Kirby said. ""We obviously don't want to see anybody getting their hands on it beyond us.""Meanwhile, Ukraine's Air Force has defended the deployment of US reconnaissance drones after the incident. ""The Black Sea is not an internal sea of Russia, as they have occupied the Sea of Azov and consider it theirs,"" Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuri Ihnat said.The Black Sea is also bordered by NATO members, including Turkey and Romania, which is why the US drones are operating there on a legal basis, he added.British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged Moscow to respect international airspace. ""The key here is that all parties respect international air space and we urge the Russians to do so,"" Wallace said at the DSEI Japan defence show in Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo.dh/rc (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836325,15-minute cities: What are they and how do they work?,"As recently as a two decades ago, more people lived in the coutryside than in urban areas. But that has since changed. Around 56% of the global population are now at home in cities, and the trend continues to rise. According to the United Nations, two thirds of the roughly 10 billion people that will inhabit planet earth by the year 2050 will live in built-up areas. 

This consistant city spread has revealed serious cracks in their planning, shedding light on issues such as social injustice and exclusion, inadequate public transportation networks and smog-related health issues. One idea that has been gaining traction recently as a way towards more sustainable, livable and healthy futures are 15 minutes cities.The idea behind the concept is to build cities in such a way that most daily necessities and services are located within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. Carlo Moreno, urbanist and professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris first came up with the idea in 2016. He wanted everyone to have easy access to shops, schools, doctors, the gym, parks, restaurants and cultural institutions.Many people who live in cities today can only dream of that, and instead have to deal with traffic jams or poor public transportation to get where they want to go.Benjamin Büttner, mobility expert at the Technical University Munich says that in order to create more sustainable cities, things like green spaces, places to do sport, cinemas and shops need to be moved to where people live, not vice versa.And that doesn't mean they have to be demolished and rebuilt, but that already existing public space needs to be rearranged.The 15-minute city also offers a mobility concept: fewer cars and more space for cyclists and pedestrians, safe paths for children, people with disabilities or the elderly and places for social interaction.""Cars are a problem, at least in urban centers. They take up too much space and they can hamper active mobility,” Büttner said.There are already 16 cities worldwide that have implemented the 15-minute city concept or similar ideas, or are working on doing so. The approaches vary, with some cities looking to implement 20-minute concepts, others 10-minute ones, and yet others focused on either individual urban districts or set on recreating the entire city.Among the pioneers is the French capital. After Carlos Moreno introduced his concept in 2016, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, presented it in her re-election campaign and began implementing it during the pandemic.The core of the Paris concept sees schools as ""capitals”, making them the center of each neighborhood. Schoolyards are being refurbished into parks to make them accessible for other activities after classes and at the weekend.Paris also wants to repurpose half of its 140,000 car parking spaces, turning them into green areas, playgrounds, neighborhood meetups or bike parking spots. Streets right across Paris are due to be bike-friendly by 2026.In 2016, Shanghai announced plans to introduce what it calls ""15-minute community life circles,"" a plan that would ensure all day-to-day activities are within 15-minutes walking distance. Another 50 Chinese cities are looking to implement the concept.An initiative in Great Britain is also aimed at achieving a better quality of life for city dwellers. As part of its countrywide re-naturalization program, the British government announced plans to make it possible for everyone to reach green areas or open water within a 15-minute walk from their home.The Spanish city of Barcelona has been experimenting with so-called ""Superilles” or super districts. The concept takes several housing blocks and puts them into a super block. Only residents or delivery services have access with cars and the maximum speed limit is 10 kilometers (6 miles) an hour.Many streets are blocked for cars and are instead being used in different ways. Former parking lots have been given over to trees, vegetables and flowers, and are now places where children can play and people can while away their time on benches in the shade.""Tactical urbanism” is what Büttner calls this approach. The concept is being tested for two to six months ""in order to see whether the situation has gotten better or worse,” he says. ""In that case you can still say 'let's go back to the way things were before.' But if it's got better then you can make it a lasting measure.”Currently, 60% of public space in Barcelona and 85% of streets are used for traffic. More than half the city's residents are faced with noise and dangerous air pollution, which is considerably higher than World Health Organization limits. The new districts should reduce motorized traffic by 21%.Studies show that more bike and pedestrian traffic in cities saves money, as less is spent in the road maintenance and health sectors.The positive effects of cycling are being estimated at more than €90 billon ($96 billion) in the EU alone. By comparison, mobilized traffic causes more than €800 billion in costs for health, environment and infrastructure every year.Many shop owners are concerned that the 15-minute city idea will cause a collapse in sales since customers can no longer reach them by car. But in the western US city of Portland, the 20% drop in car traffic following the introduction of a 20-minute city concept, also led to an additional $1.2 billion staying in the local economy.In order for as many people as possible to benefit from changing cities, and to avoid any new imbalance and gentrification, experts highlight the need to roll out the concept across different disctricts and ensure those taking part have a good social mix. That also requires rethinking regulations and traditional planning categories, such as city centers, housing districts, suburbs and commercial areas which have led to inequality and exclusion in cities worldwide.According to Büttner, political will and courage of politicians and administrations are vital, as well as the dialogue with citizens and all parties involved. Because there isn't a set solution for all cities.Every place and every social, economic and ecological structure of a city is different, Büttner says. So deciding which measures are best, depends on the context.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836326,EU muscles into gas market with joint buyers' club,"Shoppers have long bought in bulk. It is a way to stock up and save money. Now the EU is using this simple idea and working together to purchase much needed natural gas for the continent. It hopes the ambitious move will help it make up for the loss of Russian gas and guarantee a new stable supply while keeping energy prices down. It is an unprecedented step for the EU and its latest attempt for more energy security.To implement this strategy, the European Commission created an IT platform called EU Energy Platform that facilitates purchases of joint gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen across the continent. The idea for a common purchasing mechanism was established shortly after the invasion of Ukraine in April 2022 and covers the bloc's 27 countries plus three neighboring countries.Following a steering board meeting of the platform earlier this month, EU Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic told reporters that 22 member states so far have expressed their preliminary interest in aggregating a gas demand equaling more than 17 billion cubic metres of gas over the next three years.""I encouraged the remaining five member states to notify their volumes as soon as possible,"" he said, adding that service provider PRISMA will go live with its AggregateEU tool on March 15. ""The service provider will help us implement demand aggregation as a first step towards the joint purchase of gas,"" he said. Companies may then voluntarily conclude purchase contracts with suppliers ""either individually or jointly.""Luckily for the EU, a number of new or retrofitted gas pipelines have already started transporting gas, or will start soon. Additionally, new LNG terminals are being built along the continent's coasts. Energy experts fear, though, that significant additional supplies will not reach the market until 2024. That means what is available will be fought for, possibly turning European allies into competitors for supplies.The platform's website announces it ""will play a key role in pooling demand, coordinating infrastructure use, negotiating with international partners and preparing for joint gas and hydrogen purchases.""To give the platform more weight, EU countries are required to pool at least 15% of their gas reserve obligations. So a minimum amount of business is guaranteed. Then the procurement platform will match sellers and buyers. By pooling demand and leveraging the bloc's big purchasing power, the EU hopes to get the best prices and keep supplies flowing. The increased transparency should especially benefit smaller landlocked countries that could otherwise be left behind.""The coordination mechanism will ensure a better pricing mechanism, because all the demand will be taken into consideration to establish the total volume for tender and matched to the supply,"" said Anna Grosman, a reader in innovation and entrepreneurship at Loughborough University London. To better meet local gas needs, smaller regional groups within Europe will have their own additional coordination mechanisms, she told DW.Besides meeting the gas needs of entire countries, the platform will also be open to businesses like big industrial gas users in the steel, aluminum, ceramics, glass and vehicle production industries. They can buy gas individually or through larger consortia groups to keep their factories going.To keep things efficient, the EU will implement a central buyer scheme, ""under which one gas company will negotiate, on behalf of smaller gas companies and gas consumers, a contract with suppliers for the aggregated demand,"" said Maros Sefcovic. ""We aim to have a number of central buyers, representing different groups of companies, to encourage competition, to the ultimate benefit of European consumers.""The EU is one of the biggest gas consumers in the world. The platform is supposed to help it better leverage its current gas infrastructure more efficiently. It will also assist in the coordination of LNG imports, gas storage and building up more infrastructure.In the runup to this past winter, many feared that a few cold months could deplete Europe's gas reserves. But it was a mild winter and between August 2022 and January 2023, the EU reduced gas consumption by over 19%, according to figures from Eurostat that compared average consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.Now that Europe has made it through its first winter after the invasion of Ukraine with its reserves quite full, attention is focusing on the future. For the EU the most immediate concern is topping up reserves for the winter 2023-2024.Despite dampened demand in 2022 and current high reserves, the numbers are staggering. Last year baseline demand for gas in the EU came in at 360 billion cubic meters. This year the International Energy Agency sees the need for around 395 billion cubic meters of gas, nearly as much as 2021.Yet in the end, Anna Grosman doesn't think the platform will guarantee supply. What it will do is improve the price and options for buyers. ""But this depends on how well the governance mechanism would function, and whether some members end up having more power than others,"" she said. Industry not private consumers will likely profit the most from the joint gas purchasing project.So far, over 50 companies from around the globe have shown interest in using the platform according to Maros Sefcovic. A lot hangs in the balance. If Europe wants to stay warm and keep its businesses competitive industrial-sized solutions are needed, and the EU has to deliver what it promises.Edited by: Uwe Hessler",2023/3/15,,

The situation unfolded as the officials came to arrest Khan a day earlier over his non-appearance in court.The court had summoned Khan over accusations of selling state gifts during his office term.The former premier's followers hurled rocks and stones at the police and paramilitary personnel who used tear gas and sieged his residence. The personnel later withdrew, putting a halt to the riots.Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party also clashed with police in several other cities of Pakistan, including Islamabad, Karachi, Quetta, and Rawalpindi.Early Wednesday morning, Khan also released a video saying that the officials have ""no justification"" to use tear gas.""Water canons, teargas... they shelled inside the house where there were servants and women,"" Khan said.Khan also tweeted that he had signed a ""surety bond"" that ensured that he would appear in court by March 18 but the police officials did not take it into consideration. He also alleged that the officials were using live ammunition.The allegations were denied by the Punjab provincial government which said that more than 100 police officers were injured in the disputes with the PTI supporters in a statement on Wednesday.This was the second attempt by the officials to detain Khan, who failed to appear in court to defend charges against him.He has been accused of illegally selling state gifts given to him by foreign dignitaries while he held office from 2018 to 2022 before being ousted in a no-confidence vote.Since November, Khan has avoided his court appearances, afterhe was shot and wounded in a protest, claiming that he is not able to travel between Lahore and Islamabad due to medical issues.He has accused the current government of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif of plotting the cases against him.Sharif's government, however, has denied these accusations.Marriyum Aurangzeb, the country's information minister said in a statement on Tuesday that ""instead of cooperating with law enforcement officials, Imran Khan is breaking the law, defying court orders and using his party workers... as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest.""aa/rc (ap, afp, Reuters)",2023/3/15,,

The shadow it casts across the capital perfectly matches the mystery that engulfs the country in most minds.After taking power during the Second World War, Enver Hoxha — whose authoritarian rule of Albania lasted from 1944 until his death in 1985 — sealed off the country for four decades, outlawing travel and religion. Over 500,000 concrete bunkers sprang from his paranoia onto the country's beaches, mountains and plains, many remaining to this day.This long and haunted isolation, allied to the vicious wars that stalked the western Balkans in the 1990s, has helped turn Albania into Europe's least known and most enigmatic country.That means that for the uninitiated, the images that spring to mind stem from its grim communist past. But while corruption and criminality can be found, as in all European countries, Albania is still one of the last unspoiled corners of Europe.The Accursed Mountains in the north offer one of the continent's last wildernesses to hikers and climbers. Golden sand beaches run down the Adriatic and Ionian coasts to the city of Saranda, which sits just across the Greek island of Corfu. Across this southern region runs the Vjosa, one of Europe's last wild rivers, soon to be protected within a national park.Albania is now beckoning visitors to discover not only these stunning landscapes, but also the country's Mediterranean-Balkan hybrid cuisine — featuring specialties such as Tave Kosi or Fergese — which can be catered by over 250 ecotourism hosts, a sector the government is keen to promote.A plethora of Greek, Roman and Ottoman ruins and archaeological sites also punctuate the country, such as the UNESCO-listed Butrint National Park, the Ottoman-era city of Berat, or the ancient city of Apollonia.The bonus for visitors, says Gazi Haxhia, CEO of travel agency Landways who has been enthusiastically pushing his country's tourism potential for over two decades, is that all of these treasures can be enjoyed without struggling through crowds.""Albania is still relatively undiscovered,"" Haxhia boasts. ""We've not been overrun with mass tourism, so visitors can still enjoy unspoiled natural beauty, unique culture and authentic experiences.""However, some are starting to wonder just how long that will remain the case, as tourist numbers start to rise.The pandemic gave Albania a leg up. Neighboring tourism stars were hard hit by COVID. Croatia, whose sparkling Adriatic coastline tends to dominate tourist flows heading into this south-eastern corner of Europe, saw visitor numbers drop by 68% in 2020, as restrictions crimped travel. Montenegro fared even worse, as tourist flows dropped by 83%.Softer restrictions saw Albania trim the pullback to 59%, and numbers have quickly rebounded. A record 7.5 million arrived last year.""The recovery has been quicker and stronger than expected,"" Haxhia says. Although developments regarding COVID restrictions in Asia, Russia's war in Ukraine, and the economic downturn in Europe make it hard to gauge, he says and hopes for another record in 2023.On top of the country's natural and historical treasures, the hospitality of Albanians and their eagerness to share their culture and traditions are important selling points, he claims.Tolerance and hospitality are the basis of a tradition called ""Besa."" One of Albania's proudest boasts is that the country — which is Muslim-majority — was the only one in Europe to have a larger Jewish population in 1945 than in 1939.Haxhia notes that his clients, who largely hail from European states such as Germany, the UK and Italy, also appreciate the low costs of a trip to Albania. Increasingly, he adds, travelers from the US and Asia are starting to discover the tiny country sitting just across the Ionian Sea from the heel of the Italian boot.The potential of tourism is so significant that Prime Minister Edi Rama dreams of making the country the region's ""tourist champion"" by the end of the decade.One of Europe's poorest countries, Albania's emerging economy depends heavily on agriculture and mining. But tourism is viewed as a key driver of modern economic development.Pre-pandemic, the $2.3 billion or so the sector brought in annually constituted close to 16% of GDP. Rama hopes that a strong government push will help double that share.Progress is clear to see. The rubbish piles that in past decades blighted towns and roadsides have been cleared. Transport infrastructure is being expanded and upgraded. Encouraged by tax breaks, hotels and resorts are rising.""But there's still more to be done,"" Haxhia points out. ""The quality of services and infrastructure remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas.""Indeed, although Albania's transport infrastructure has undergone significant improvement over the past two decades, crucial gaps remain.While a second international airport opened in 2021 in the northern city of Kukes, with seasonal flights linking it to Germany, Austria and Turkey, getting to the Albanian Riviera in the south requires either a five-hour drive from Tirana or a flight to Corfu and then a ferry.A third airport, being built near the city of Vlore should help. ""Tourists have had a hard time getting to Albania in the past,"" Mirela Kumbaro, minister of tourism and environment minister tells DW, ""but, all infrastructure investments are being made to serve tourism.""The government is also working with investors to build several giant resorts. Announcing a €2-billion deal with the UAE's Eagle Hills development company in January, Rama branded the project to transform the port city of Durres ""a locomotive"" to accelerate economic development and allow Albania to compete on the international tourism market.But at the same time, such schemes come mired in controversy. The sums of money rinsing through the system are seen as a corruption risk, and claims of sleaze and lax control are not uncommon.The threat posed by regulators looking the other way as such behemoths advance on Albania's virgin territories are clear. Europe's Mediterranean coast is plagued by unsympathetic development, environmental damage, and over-tourism.Although an enthusiastic proponent of the need for further development of the tourism sector, Haxhia recognizes the need to tread carefully.""The government must enhance accessibility further, but should also promote sustainable tourism practices and training while it does,"" he suggests. ""We need to preserve the country's natural and cultural assets for future generations.""And despite her government's rush to build motorways, airports and resorts, Kumbaro says that's exactly her remit. It's no coincidence, she insists, that her ministry is responsible for both tourism and the environment.""Last year we had 7.5 million tourists,"" she declares. ""But we don't plan increase the numbers. Instead, we target tourists who spend and who empower the development of sustainable tourism.""Edited by: Elizabeth Grenier",2023/3/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836338,"In nursing homes, impoverished live final days on pennies","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — New pants to replace Alex Morisey’s tattered khakis will have to wait. There’s no cash left for sugar-free cookies either. Even at the month’s start, the budget is so bare that Fixodent is a luxury. Now, halfway through it, things are so tight that even a Diet Pepsi is a stretch.“How many years do I have left?” asks 82-year-old Morisey, who lives in a Philadelphia nursing home. “I want to live those as well as I can. But to some degree, you lose your dignity.”Across the U.S., hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents are locked in a wretched bind: Driven into poverty, forced to hand over all income and left to live on an allowance as low as $30 a month.In a long-term care system that subjects some of society’s frailest to daily indignities, Medicaid’s personal needs allowance, as the stipend is called, is among the most ubiquitous, yet least known.Nearly two-thirds of American nursing home residents have their care paid for by Medicaid and, in exchange, all Social Security, pension and other income is rerouted to go toward their bill. The personal needs allowance is meant to pay for anything not provided by the home, from a phone to clothes to a birthday present for a grandchild.One problem: Congress hasn’t raised the allowance in decades.“It’s really one of the most humiliating things for them,” says Sam Brooks, an attorney for The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, which advocates for nursing home residents and has urged an increase in the allowance. “It can really be a point of shame.”Especially when an individual has no close relatives or no one able to financially help, the allowance can breed striking need. When Marla Carter visits her mother-in-law at a nursing home in Owensboro, Kentucky, the scene feels more 19th-century poorhouse than modern-day America. With just a $40 allowance, residents are dressed in ill-fitting hand-me-downs or hospital gowns that drape open. Some have no socks or shoes. Basic supplies run low. Many don’t even have a pen to write with.“That’s what was so surprising to us,” Carter says, “the poverty.”Medicaid was created in 1965 and a 1972 amendment established the personal needs allowance, set at a minimum of $25 each month. Had it been linked to inflation, it would be about $180 today. But regular cost-of-living increases were not built into the allowance and Congress has raised the minimum rate only once, to $30, in 1987.It has remained there ever since.Some politicians have tried to fix the problem, including Rep. Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat from Virginia who in 2019 introduced a bill to raise the minimum allowance to $60 and cement annual increases tied to those for Social Security. It didn’t even get a hearing.“I was shocked,” Wexton says. “It’s about dignity for these people.”Faced with federal inaction, states have taken it upon themselves to raise allowances. Even so, most remain low. A majority of states – 28 – have allowances of $50 or less, according to a state-by-state survey by the American Council on Aging. Just five states grant residents $100 or more each month, including Alaska, which stands alone in offering $200 monthly, the maximum under federal law. Four states – Alabama, Illinois, North Carolina and South Carolina – remain at the $30 minimum.“As soon as I get it, it’s gone,” says Chris Hackney, a 74-year-old resident of a nursing home in Durham, North Carolina, who spends his $30 monthly allowance on body wash, toothpaste, deodorant and some items his facility used to provide but has cut back on, wipes and diapers.Down the hall, 56-year-old Janine Cox gets an occasional bag of chips from the vending machine and scrimps to add to the collection plate at church. Her neighbors are even worse off. “It’s like a fight for them to survive another day,” she says.With no financial wiggle room, nursing home residents find what little freedom they have evaporates even more, putting out of reach the chance to take a taxi to see a friend, to get lost in a newly purchased book, or to escape the monotony of the cafeteria with some take-out food.Even after two years of institutionalized life, it is a confounding truth for Morisey.With each $45 allowance he receives, a monthly juggling act begins.Can his razors last a bit longer to put off refills? Can he squeeze a bit more out of the Fixodent tube? Has he cut corners enough to get some aftershave or peanut butter crackers?“It’s the little things,” he says. “You don’t think about these things until you no longer have them.”He is a lifelong Quaker, has always cherished living simply, and accepts his situation with a smile.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836339,Singapore Airlines to resume 2 flights per day to Taiwan in late May,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Singapore Airlines (SIA) will operate two flights a day between Singapore and Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport starting in late May, marking a return to pre-COVID levels, reports said on Wednesday (March 15).From March 26, the frequency of flights will increase to 10 per week, with May 31 set as the starting date for 12 flights a week or two per day, according to the airline’s general manager in Taiwan, Chua Kian Hwa (蔡建華).In 2022, SIA flew 20.7 million passengers, or nine times the number in 2021 and 80% of the number the airline transported per year before the COVID-19 pandemic, per UDN. The combination of countries ending COVID travel restrictions with the Christmas and Lunar New Year holidays has fueled demand over the past few months, Chua said.Nevertheless, Chua acknowledged that inflation, high fuel prices, regional political instability, and general global economic uncertainty need to be carefully monitored during the rest of 2023.In January, SIA and its low-cost subsidiary Scoot transported 2.6 million passengers worldwide, down from 2.7 million in December 2022, which marked an increase of 11.7% over November.",2023/3/15,1501,Travel & Cuisine

Many don’t even have a pen to write with.“That’s what was so surprising to us,” Carter says, “the poverty.”She was so horrified that she and her husband started a nonprofit, Faithful Friends Kentucky, to distribute items to area nursing home residents. Among the things most warmly received are Kleenex tissues, because facilities often stock scratchy generics and even those can be hard to come by.“You bring a soda or a toothbrush and they’ll get so excited,” she says. “It’s so sad to me.”Medicaid was created in 1965 as part of the Great Society programs of Lyndon B. Johnson. A 1972 amendment established the personal needs allowance, set at a minimum of $25 monthly.

Just five states grant residents $100 or more each month, including Alaska, which stands alone in offering $200 monthly, the maximum under federal law. Four states – Alabama, Illinois, North Carolina and South Carolina – remain at the $30 minimum.Despite such paltry allotments, some facilities have been cited for not telling residents they were entitled to an allowance at all, for failing to provide the money, or for spending the funds without their permission. And though federal regulations outline a host of items that are to be provided to nursing home residents, many find themselves unable to use the cheap items facilities offer, spending their allowance on replacements for institutional-grade soap that makes them dry and itchy, tissues that feel like something out of a bus terminal bathroom, razors that leave a face nicked and bleeding and denture adhesives that seem incapable of keeping false teeth in place.Some homes skirt the rules, making residents pay for things like diapers or haircuts that are supposed to be included.“As soon as I get it, it’s gone,” says Chris Hackney, a 74-year-old resident of a nursing home in Durham, North Carolina, who spends his $30 monthly allowance on body wash, toothpaste, deodorant and some items his facility used to provide but has cut back on, wipes and diapers. “Think of the prices of everything that tripled and quadrupled. And the money hasn’t gone up any.”Hackney, a retired appliance technician who has used a wheelchair since a motorcycle accident nine years ago, has a daughter who pays his cell phone and a church that sends care packages. But even a modest boost to the allowance, Hackney says, would mean a ton.“It would change so many lives in here,” he says.Down the hall, 56-year-old Janine Cox gets an occasional bag of chips from the vending machine and scrimps to add to the collection plate at church. She says her neighbors are even worse off.“It’s like a fight for them to survive another day,” she says. “The politicians, they need to come inside these nursing homes and look and see how some of us are living.”It leaves many feeling trapped with no chance of normalcy.Before a fall that landed her at a nursing home in Toluca, Illinois, 62-year-old Nancy Yundt felt like life was relatively comfortable. Her house was small and needed work, but it was home. Her SUV was 18 years old with 160,000 miles on the odometer, but she loved it. Her $2,373 monthly disability check left room for a housekeeper and take-out food and plenty of generosity.She paid her son’s cellphone and insurance bills, bought Christmas presents for everyone and doted on her family’s little ones year-round.But when her grandniece’s 2nd birthday came a few months after she arrived in the nursing home last year, she wanted to buy a doll but realized she couldn’t.“The spoiling aunt can’t spoil,” she says. “It just makes me feel a little sad.”Nursing home residents often must cede control of everything from how often they get a shower to what they eat. With no financial wiggle room, even more autonomy evaporates, putting out of reach the chance to take a taxi to see a friend, to get lost in a newly purchased book, or to escape the monotony of the cafeteria with some take-out food.Even after two years of institutionalized life, it is a confounding truth for Morisey.He ended up in a nursing home after a fall and, once here, learned his income would no longer be his. Pennsylvania’s allowance is $45, and after a monthly $20 haircut and $5 tip, a juggling act begins.Can his razors last a bit longer to put off refills? Can he squeeze a bit more out of the Fixodent tube? Has he cut corners enough to get some aftershave or peanut butter crackers?“It’s the little things,” he says. “You don’t think about these things until you no longer have them.”When something pricier needs replacing, it’s even more of a quandary, like when shirts went missing in the laundry or the top broke on his thermos or his little Bluetooth speaker no longer held a charge.His meager savings are nearly gone now. If not for help from his church, he wouldn’t even be able to afford a phone.Living simply is at the heart of Morisey’s Quaker faith and he decided after college, Ivy League diploma in hand, that he wouldn’t use it to chase wealth. He took jobs in nonprofits, putting his skills to the aid of farmworkers, public housing tenants and the mentally ill, and as an aid worker in Central and South America. He has spent each of his 82 years squarely in the middle class.Looking back, Morisey wouldn’t change how he lived his life.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836341,Videos show scattered protests during Iran's fire festival,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranians have held scattered anti-government protests during an annual fire festival with ancient roots, according to videos circulating online.The videos appeared to show protesters in different cities chanting against the country's ruling clerics and hurling firecrackers at security forces during celebrations of Chaharshanbe Soori, which took place on Tuesday. Hard-liners have long condemned the festival, which dates back to 1700 B.C., as un-Islamic.Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests since September, when a 22-year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, died after being detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict Islamic dress code. At their height, the protests saw thousands of people across the country calling for the overthrow of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests have largely died down in over the past few months following a fierce security crackdown. More than 19,700 people were arrested and at least 530 protesters were killed, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the unrest.Earlier this week, Iran announced that 22,000 people arrested in connection to the protests had been pardoned, without saying how many had been released, indicating the government no longer views the protesters as a threat.But there are still signs of widespread anger at the theocracy that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. At night, chanting can be heard from darkened buildings in some areas of the capital, Tehran.Authorities have accused the U.S. and other foreign powers of stirring up the protests, without providing evidence. Ali Reza Fakhari, the governor of Tehran province, denied there were any “special security problems"" during the fire festival, and there were no reports of arrests.Iran has heavily restricted media coverage of the protests and arrested dozens of journalists, making it difficult to determine the scope of the demonstrations.Separately, the state-run IRNA news agency said 26 people were killed and more than 4,000 injured in accidents involving bonfires and fireworks linked to the festival over the past three weeks. Last year, before the latest protests, 19 people were killed and 2,800 injured in the same period.During the fire festival, a ritual linked to the Zoroastrian religion, people light bonfires, set off fireworks and send wish lanterns floating off into the night sky. Others jump over and around fires, chanting “My yellow is yours, your red is mine,” invoking the replacement of ills with warmth and energy.It's one of two holidays with pre-Islamic roots that are still observed each year in the Islamic Republic, the other being a picnic day in early April. Both offer a rare opportunity for Iranians to dance and celebrate in public, something authorities usually frown on.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836342,UN official says world body committed to Cyprus peace deal,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — The United Nations remains committed to helping rival Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots reach an agreement to bridge the island nation’s ethnic rift, a senior U.N. official said Wednesday. The problem has been a source of instability in the east Mediterranean for decades.U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Rosemary DiCarlo said that she reiterated to new Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides the “commitment of the Secretary-General to supporting a resolution on the Cyprus issue.”She is scheduled to speak with Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar later in the day as well as addressing peace activists in the U.N. controlled buffer zone that divides the capital Nicosia.The U.N. has been facilitating numerous failed rounds of talks between the two sides since 1974, when a Turkish invasion triggered by a coup aimed at union with Greece split the island into a breakaway Turkish Cypriot north and a Greek Cypriot south — where the island’s internationally recognized government is seated.A peace deal in Cyprus that is home to a key U.K. air base and a listening post would remove a political thorn vexing the international community for decades, at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has brought instability to the globe.Moreover, a deal could expedite the development of sizable natural gas deposits off Cyprus’ southern shores amid Europe’s energy crunch and help smooth the rocky relationship between NATO allies Greece and Turkey.Christodoulides has said that his new administration's top priority remains a deal reunifying Cyprus as a federation and is keen to get the ball rolling on resuming the process that has been stalemated since the last round of talks in 2017.But one of the main obstacles to getting back to the negotiating table is an about-face by Turkey and the minority Turkish Cypriots regarding the agreed-upon shape of a deal after the most recent failed push for peace at a Swiss resort in the summer of 2017.There had been a long-held understanding that any deal would reunify Cyprus as a federation made up of a Turkish-speaking zone in the north and a Greek speaking zone in the south. But Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots are now seeking a two-state deal that recognizes separate Turkish Cypriot sovereignty, something that Greek Cypriots reject out of hand. It has also been shunned by the European Union, the U.N., the U.S. and other countries.Tatar repeated after meeting DiCarlo that negotiations could begin once Turkish Cypriots' “equal sovereign status” is recognized and that any deal should incorporate military intervention rights ceded to Turkey.It's unlikely that any formal process could resume before Turkey's May 14 election, but Cyprus government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said the Greek Cypriot side is ready for an immediate restart of negotiations “and we expect Mr. Tatar to sit at the negotiating table with a sincere willingness to achieve"" a federation-based agreement.Letymbiotis also reiterated Christodoulides' aim for the EU's more active engagement in peace talks through the appointment of a senior official. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots accuse the EU of not being even-handed because although Cyprus is a bloc member, only the south enjoys full benefits.“We mustn't view this proposal as having a detrimental contribution, but as contributing very positively to cultivating the necessary climate” for a resumption of peace talks, Letymbiotis said.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836344,Nadal aiming to make comeback from injury at Monte Carlo,"MONACO (AP) — Rafael Nadal is aiming to make his comeback from a hip injury at the clay-court Monte Carlo Masters next month, organizers said Wednesday.The 22-time Grand Slam champion has been sidelined with a left hip flexor injury since the Australian Open, and pulled out of hard-court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.The Monte Carlo Masters begins on April 8 and tournament director David Massey is optimistic Nadal will play.“Rafa was the first (player) to be registered,"" Massey said in statement. “He really wants to play at the Monte Carlo Masters and is giving himself every chance to take part in the tournament he's so fond of.”Nadal has won the tournament a record 11 times, including an Open Era record streak of eight consecutive titles from 2005 to 2012.The 36-year-old Spaniard uses the event as a key part of his preparations for the French Open, which takes place May 28-June 11.Nadal has won 14 of his major titles on clay at Roland Garros, including last year while dealing with chronic pain in his left foot.In January, Nadal hurt his hip flexor during a second-round loss to Mackenzie McDonald of the United States at the Australian Open.An MRI exam the next day revealed the extent of the injury.___AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836345,"Putin, Assad discuss rebuilding Syria, regional issues","MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Syrian leader Bashar Assad in the Kremlin on Wednesday for talks that focused on rebuilding Syria after a devastating civil war and efforts to stabilize the region.Welcoming Assad at the start of the meeting, which took place on the anniversary of Syria’s 12-year uprising-turned-civil war, Putin emphasized the Russian military's “decisive contribution” to stabilizing the country.Russia has waged a military campaign in Syria since September 2015, teaming up with Iran to allow Assad’s government to fight armed opposition groups and reclaim control over most of the country. While Russia now concentrates the bulk of its military resources in Ukraine, Moscow has maintained its military foothold in Syria and kept warplanes and troops at its bases there.Assad thanked Putin for backing Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity, noting that the Kremlin's support has remained strong despite the fighting in Ukraine.“Even though Russia now is also conducting the special operation, its position has remained unchanged,"" Assad said, using the Kremlin's “special military operation” term for the Russian action in Ukraine and voicing support for Moscow's effort.The two rounds of talks between the leaders, the first one involving senior officials from both countries and then a one-on-one encounter over lunch, lasted for more than three hours. The Russian and Syrian defense ministers also met separately to discuss military cooperation.Assad's office said on Twitter that the two leaders discussed “joint cooperation in various forms and developments on the regional and international arenas.” It noted that Assad “renewed Syria’s position in support of Russia’s right to defend its national security.”Moscow has provided robust political support to Assad at the United Nations and actively mediated to help repair his government's ties with regional powers.Some Arab countries that had called in the past for the downfall of Assad have sent aid following the catastrophic Feb. 6 earthquake that hit Turkey and Syria killing more than 50,000 including over 6,000 in Syria.International sympathy following the quake appeared to have sped up the regional rapprochement, with some calling for dialogue with Syria and for bringing the country back to the 22-member Arab League more than a decade after its membership was suspended over the crackdown in the early months of the uprising that turned into war.As part of the ongoing rapprochement, the foreign ministers of Egypt and Jordan recently made their first visit to Damascus since the conflict began in March 2011 and met with Assad.On Wednesday, Assad also thanked Putin for sending rescue teams and engaging its military based in Syria to conduct salvage efforts and help deal with the quake's aftermath.Prior to the earthquake, Russia had been mediating talks between Turkey and Syria.Turkey has backed armed opposition groups in Syria that have sought to overturn Assad's government during the civil war, which has killed nearly 500,000 people and displaced half of the country’s prewar population. Syria has demanded that Turkey withdraws from an enclave it controls in northwestern Syria in order for Damascus to normalize its relations with Ankara.In December, Moscow hosted surprise talks between the Syrian and Turkish defense ministers. Arab media reported that one of the main topics that Assad will discuss with Putin during their meeting on Wednesday is reconciliation between Syria and Turkey.Asked before Putin’s talks with Assad if they could play a role in restoring Syria’s ties with Turkey, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that “the issue of the Syrian-Turkish relations will undoubtedly be part of the talks’ agenda.”Even though Turkey has backed Syrian opposition fighters in the north, Ankara and Damascus share dismay over the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Syria’s northeast. Turkey-backed opposition fighters have clashed with the SDF in the past, accusing them of being an arm of Turkey’s outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK. The PKK has for decades waged an insurgency within Turkey against the government in Ankara.Assad’s government has cast the SDF as a secessionist force that has been pilfering the country’s wealth while controlling Syria’s major oil fields.Assad’s office said in a statement after the talks that Putin and Assad talked about “regional initiatives supported by Moscow.” It said Assad emphasized that Syria supports dialogue “if it leads to achieving the interests of the Syrian people and the unity and integrity of the Syrian territory and leads to clear results, the first of which is the continuation of the fight against terrorism and the exit of illegal foreign forces present on its territory.” The statement didn't elaborate.The Syrian, Turkish and Russian deputy foreign ministers and a senior Iranian envoy were expected to hold talks Wednesday and Thursday in Moscow to discuss “counterterrorism efforts” in Syria, although Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Ayman Sousan was quoted by pro-government media as saying that the meeting “is still under discussion.”___Bassem Mroue reported from Beirut.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836346,Ilka Stuhec edges Sofia Goggia for World Cup downhill win,"SOLDEU, Andorra (AP) — One year after almost quitting Alpine skiing in frustration, Ilka Štuhec was back at the peak of her form on Wednesday.The two-time world champion completed her downhill season by beating Sofia Goggia, the season's standout speed racer, for victory at the World Cup Finals.Štuhec raced down the sun-bathed slope to finish 0.51 seconds ahead of Goggia, a five-time downhill winner this season who already secured the discipline title. Lara Gut-Behrami was third, 0.81 seconds back.Štuhec added a second victory in an impressive season when she was also runner-up at two of Goggia’s victories. They were the 32-year-old Slovenian skier’s first podium finishes since retaining her world championship title in downhill in February 2019 in Are, Sweden.“It means really a lot actually because this time last year I was thinking, should I continue? Should I quit? What should I do with my life?"" Štuhec said. “Then I listened to my guts and I was like OK, I will change things and I will go on because I still had a feeling I could do it — and now everyone knows.”Her past three seasons were affected by injuries and last April she split with the coach she worked with since 2019.“It makes it fun again,"" Štuhec said of her 11th career World Cup race win. “I am really enjoying it and I will definitely go on.”Goggia’s season-long downhill title was the fourth in the past five seasons for the 2018 Olympic champion from Italy.Elena Curtoni, one of only four racers to win a World Cup downhill this season, crashed Wednesday, as did Nina Ortlieb. They did not appear to be seriously injured.Mikaela Shiffrin, the overall World Cup champion who won her record 87th career victory last weekend, did not compete in the downhill. She should return for the super-G on Thursday.___More AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/alpine-skiing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836352,"Northeast digs out from winter storm, faces power outages","PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) — Parts of New England and New York were digging out of a nor'easter Wednesday that caused tens of thousands of power outages, numerous school cancellations and whiteout conditions on the roads.The storm began Monday night and lasted throughout Tuesday, dumping as much as 3 feet (91 centimeters) of snow and gusty winds. Others got just a few inches or a wintry mix.Some of the highest snow totals reported were 35 inches (89 centimeters) in Peterborough, New Hampshire, and in Ashby, Massachusetts, about 15 miles away (24 kilometers), the National Weather Service said. At least 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow fell in parts of northern New York and the Catskill Mountains, with Indian Lake in New York’s Adirondack Mountains recording 31 inches (79 centimeters).“It just snowed, and snowed, and snowed,” said Geoff Settles, a supervisor at a manufacturer who lives in Peterborough. “My wife and I were helping some of the neighbors dig out. Literally, we had to shovel five and six different times just to keep it from being basically up to our chest.”Settles, who grew up in Leominster, Massachusetts, remembered blizzards there in the late 1970s. “I would say this is the most snow I've seen all my life,” he said Wednesday.In Pittsfield, Massachusetts, which got at least 18 inches (45 centimeters) of snow, Michael Garvey was using his snow blower to clear his sidewalk and help a neighbor dig out his driveway.“I've lived here my whole life and I've seen some snowstorms in April, so it doesn't surprise me at all,” the 71-year-old retired Berkshire County Sheriff's Office worker said. ""We got teased a couple of weeks ago when the temperature was in the '50s, but back to winter.”About 67,000 customers in the region were remained without power by Wednesday evening, according to the PowerOutage.us tracking site.“We are still expecting this to be a multiday restoration effort,” Unitil spokesperson Alec O'Meara said. Crews from New York and Pennsylvania arrived to help bring back power in parts of Massachusetts and help assess damage from trees and downed lines.In a dramatic overnight rescue, a search team located two hikers stranded in heavy snow in Massachusetts’ Mount Washington State Forest.The two male hikers, ages 47 and 53, had hoped to reach a cabin but called 911 on Tuesday night and said they could no longer see trail markings. Rescuers first attempted to use snowmobiles, but the snow was too deep and the six-person team — including two troopers from the State Police Special Emergency Response Team, three local firefighters, and a park ranger — set out on foot.After trudging through snow for more than two hours, the searchers found the hikers at about 2:30 a.m. Wednesday and led them out of the woods just before dawn.In Maine, game wardens rescued a couple and two children who became stranded on ice Tuesday on Moosehead Lake, according to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.A 31-year-old woman and 32-year-old man were ice fishing with children ages 5 and 2, and their dog, when the weather started to worsen.The woman left first with the older child and dog on a snowmobile. The man picked up their gear, and planned to follow with the toddler. The woman's snowmobile broke down, and because of whiteout conditions, the man couldn't see well enough to drive to her. Both called 911. Maine Advanced Warden School wardens and trainees already in the area found the groups and got everyone to shore in about 45 minutes.There were concerns about roofs weighed down by the snow. An inflatable sports arena dome collapsed in Goffstown, New Hampshire, which received about 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow. It wasn't immediately known whether anyone was inside at the time or if there were any injuries.Several cows were killed when a barn collapsed at a dairy farm in Dracut, Massachusetts. The owners of Shaw Farm said in a statement that they “experienced one of life’s unexpected challenges,” adding that no staff members were hurt.During the worst of the storm on Tuesday, about 2,100 flights traveling to, from or within the U.S. were canceled, with Boston and New York City area airports seeing the highest number of scrubbed flights, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Numerous schools had been closed; many ran on a delayed schedule Wednesday.Some were able to find a bright side to all the snow.On Wednesday a parking lot in the Sterling Valley section of Stowe, Vermont, was filled with vehicles of people enjoying the area known for its network of backcountry ski trails.Amherst College students Allison Lounsbury, of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, and Dan Dachille, of Saddle River, New Jersey, made it to Vermont on Tuesday for spring break during the storm and were enjoying the winter weather Wednesday getting cross country ski lessons from John Beattie of Umiak Outdoors.The three of them were enjoying the deep snow.“People need to remember, winter can be fun,” Beattie said before leading the two students into the snow.As residents in the Northeast dealt with the storm’s aftermath, forecasters warned of more flooding and potentially damaging winds as a new atmospheric river pushed into a swamped California. So far this winter, California has been battered by 10 previous atmospheric rivers, long plumes of moisture from the Pacific Ocean, as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions.___McCormack reported from Concord, New Hampshire.",2023/3/16,,World

It hasn’t rained on the mountain for quite a while, and now Jiaming Lake has become much ""thinner."" In his words, it looks just like a donut or poached egg, though still beautiful.(YouTube, 嘉明湖熊出沒戶外旅遊 video)In addition to Jiaming Lake becoming smaller, the Jiaming Lake mountain house is also short of water. At present, water at the house is provided only for cooking and drinking and not for brushing teeth, washing, or other uses, CNA reported.Taitung Forest District Office official Lin Mung-yi (林孟怡) said that there are two mountain houses along the Jiaming Lake trail: the Xiangyang and Jiaming Lake mountain houses. The Xiangyang mountain house uses stream water, so water is not in short supply, whereas the Jiaming Lake mountain house completely relies on rainwater. He suggested that hikers carry water from the Xiangyang mountain house to the Jiaming Lake mountain house to be used there, per CNA.Chiu also reminded people heading to Jiaming Lake to prepare warm clothes as the temperatures in the mountainous area were still very low on Tuesday.Jiaming Lake is 3,310 meters above sea level. When it is full, the lake is about 120 meters long, 80 meters wide, and 35 meters deep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836388,"Russia offers to host new sports event with China, India","NEW DELHI (AP) — Russia offered Wednesday to host a new multi-sports event for countries such as China and India which are members of a regional grouping known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.Russian President Vladimir Putin previously suggested creating the event at an SCO summit in September. His suggestion came at a time when Russia is excluded from many events in Olympic sports following its invasion of Ukraine last year.Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin offered to host the so-called SCO Games in Russia at a meeting with sports officials from other SCO nations in India on Wednesday, his ministry said in a statement.Moscow and Beijing created the eight-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organization that also includes India, Pakistan and four ex-Soviet nations in Central Asia as a counterweight to U.S. influence. The group has held regular summits and staged joint military drills.Matytsin's comments contained no details of when the event could take place, how large it would be or if it would be intended to rival the Olympics.Russia is already involved in other regional multi-sport events on a relatively modest scale. Russia developed and hosted the inaugural CIS Games in 2021 for nine ex-Soviet countries, a competition largely overshadowed by the Tokyo Olympics held weeks before. There are also the Russia-China Youth Games, a junior event which Matytsin reportedly suggested in December could be expanded to include other SCO countries.___More AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836389,"War, transport weigh on Germany's efforts to curb emissions","BERLIN (AP) — Germany cut its greenhouse gas emissions by almost 2% last year, beating previous estimates but still falling far short of the cuts needed to meet its medium-term climate goals, officials said Wednesday.Data published by the German Environment Agency showed the country released the equivalent of 746 million metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2022, down from 760 million tons the previous year.The figures, which are still preliminary, were better than an independent estimate published in January, largely due to bigger-than-expected cuts in the industrial sector. German factories saw a slump in production due to the war in Ukraine last year, partly due to higher energy costs.But the cut in Russian fossil fuel supplies also prompted the German government to reactivate shuttered coal and oil power plants, pushing up emissions in the energy sector.“The war has thrown a wrench into the works,” the environment agency's head, Dirk Messner, told reporters in Berlin.He noted that Germany now needs to cut emissions by 6% every year until 2030 to achieve a reduction of 65% compared with 1990 levels.A government spokesperson, Christiane Hoffmann, said Germany will “do everything” to achieve its long-term target of reducing emissions to net zero by 2045.The government “has already set in motion a number of measures and planned laws that will help to further reduce CO2 emissions,” she said. “This report shows how necessary that is.""Europe’s biggest economy is among the world’s ten biggest emitters and the center-left government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has put in place ambitious programs to boost clean energy and cut emissions across different sectors.The new data put a renewed spotlight on the transport sector, which saw emissions rise last year. Transport Minister Volker Wissing has recently been at the center of a spat over European Union plans to end the sale of cars with combustion engines, which he opposes.Messner made clear that there is no way around replacing 15 million conventional vehicles with electric models by 2030, if Germany wants to achieve its targets.In the short term, the introduction of a universal speed limit on German highways would help close the emissions gap, he said.Several environmental groups reacted angrily to the new emissions figures and threatened further legal action, arguing that the German government is bound by law to meet specific targets in each sector.Germany's top court ruled two years ago that the previous government had to set clearer targets for the period after 2030 to reduce the burden of curbing climate change on younger generations.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836390,Erdogan hints Turkey may ratify Finland's NATO membership,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan suggested Wednesday that his country may soon ratify Finland’s application to join NATO, allowing for the possibility of the country joining the military alliance separately from Sweden.Alarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a year ago, Finland and Sweden abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied together to join the Western alliance. NATO requires the unanimous approval of its 30 existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary have failed so far to ratify the accession of the Nordic neighbors.Turkey’s government accuses Sweden of being too soft on groups that it deems to be terror organizations, including Kurdish groups, and said it has fewer problems with Finland.Finnish President Sauli Niinisto is scheduled to meet with Erdogan in Istanbul on Friday. Asked by reporters if the Turkish parliament might ratify Finland’s membership after that, Erdogan responded: “God willing, if it is for the best.”“Whatever the process is, the process will function. We will do our part. We will keep our promise. We will meet with the president on Friday and fulfill the promise we made,” he said.Niinisto and Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto are set to arrive in Turkey on Thursday, when the two officials plan to tour areas affected by a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed more than 52,000 people in Turkey and Syria last month.Speaking Wednesday in Helsinki, Niinisto also indicated Wednesday that Turkey was preparing to ratify Finland’s membership. Turkish officials requested his presence to announce Ankara's decision concerning Helsinki's bid, he said.Niinisto said Finland has remained in close contact with both Sweden and Erdogan’s administration.“It’s very important for Finland that both Finland’s and Sweden’s NATO memberships take place as soon as possible. I will continue my work to support Sweden’s NATO membership,” Niinisto said in a statement to Finnish news agency STT.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said there were increasing indications in recent weeks that Turkey was prepared to ratify Finland’s membership before Sweden’s. He said his government was “ prepared for that situation as well.”“We don’t hide at all that we preferred to be ratified together, to make the whole journey hand in hand,” Kristersson said during a visit to Berlin. But “I’ve always also expressed the fact that every … country in NATO makes their own ratification decision,s and we have full respect for that.”A series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm, weden, including a protest by an anti-Islam activist who burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, angered Turkish officials and gave Ankara another reason to look unfavorably on Sweden's NATO accession.Kristersson said his government hoped for “a rapid ratification process” after Turkey's May 14 presidential and parliamentary elections. Erdogan is seeking a third consecutive term.“We do believe … that we are ready for ratification, but we respect that only Turkey can make Turkey’s decisions,” the prime minister said.___Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin and Jari Tanner in Helsinki, Finland, contributed.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836392,"Beloved and debated, French bulldog becomes top US dog breed","NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time in three decades, the U.S. has a new favorite dog breed, according to the American Kennel Club.Adorable in some eyes, deplorable in others, the sturdy, push-faced, perky-eared, world-weary-looking and distinctively droll French bulldog became the nation's most prevalent purebred dog last year, the club announced Wednesday. Frenchies ousted Labrador retrievers from the top spot after a record 31 years.Why?“They’re comical, friendly, loving little dogs,” says French Bull Dog Club of America spokesperson Patty Sosa. City-friendly, with modest grooming and exercise needs, she says, “they offer a lot in a small package.”Yet the Frenchie's dizzying rise — it wasn't even a top-75 breed a quarter-century ago — worries its fans, to say nothing of its critics.The buzzy little bulldogs have been targeted in thefts, including last month's fatal shooting of a 76-year-old South Carolina breeder and the 2021 shooting of a California dog walker who was squiring singer Lady Gaga's pets.There’s concern that demand, plus the premium that some buyers will pay for “exotic” coat colors and textures, is engendering quick-buck breeders and unhealthy dogs. The breed's popularity is sharpening debate over whether there's anything healthy about propagating dogs prone to breathing, spinal, eye, and skin conditions.The British Veterinary Association has urged people not to buy flat-faced breeds, such as Frenchies. The Netherlands has prohibited breeding very short-snouted dogs, and the country's agriculture minister aims to outlaw even owning them.“French bulldogs can be a polarizing topic,” says Dr. Carrie Stefaniak, a Glendale, Wisconsin-based veterinarian who's on the Frenchie club's health committee.She has treated French bulldogs with breathing difficulties, and she stresses that would-be owners need to research breeders and health testing and to recognize that problems can be expensive to treat.But she's no Frenchie foe. She owns two and has conditioned them to run agility courses and take hilly hikes.“These dogs can be very fit, can be very active,” Stefaniak said. “They don’t have to be sedentary dogs that can't breathe.”The AKC's popularity rankings cover about 200 breeds in the nation’s oldest canine registry. The stats are based on nearly 716,500 puppies and other dogs newly registered last year — about 1 in every 7 of them a Frenchie. Registration is voluntary.The most rarely owned? English foxhounds.The rankings don’t count mixed-breeds or, at least for now, Labradoodles, puggles, Morkies and other popular “designer” hybrids. The AKC's top 10 were: French bulldogs, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, German shepherds, poodles, bulldogs, Rottweilers, beagles, dachshunds and German shorthaired pointers.With roots in England and then France, French bulldogs became chic among American elites around the turn of the 20th century, then faded from favor.That changed, rapidly, in this century. Social media and celebrity owners (ranging from Leonardo di Caprio to Megan Thee Stallion to U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) gave the dogs fresh exposure. Still more came last year, when U.S. TV audiences watched a Frenchie named Winston take second place at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and then win the National Dog Show hosted by the Kennel Club of Philadelphia.Last year, about 108,000 newly registered French bulldogs surpassed Labs by over 21,000.As a longtime breeder and a veterinarian, Dr. Lori Hunt sees Frenchies as ideal companions but their popularity as “a curse, not a blessing.”“They're being very exploited” by unscrupulous breeders, she said. The Westlake, Ohio-based vet has seen plenty of Frenchies with problems but rejects arguments that the breed is inherently unhealthy. Some of her own do canine performance sports.Some other breeds are prone to ailments ranging from hip dysplasia to cancers, and mixed-breed dogs also can get sick. But recently published research involving about 24,600 dogs in Britain suggested that Frenchies have “very different, and largely much poorer"" health than do other canines, largely due to the foreshortened, wrinkly face that encapsulates the breed's je ne sais quoi.With such findings in mind, the British Veterinary Association has said it “strongly recommends” against buying flat-faced dogs and has campaigned to scrub them from ads and even greeting cards.The American Veterinary Medical Association is exploring ways to improve flat-faced dogs’ welfare, President Dr. Lori Teller says.To animal rights and welfare activists, the French bulldog frenzy puts a snorting, panting face on problems with dog breeding in general.""A lot of the breed characteristics that are bred into these dogs, they’re for looks, not necessarily health and welfare, and Frenchies are probably one of the most exaggerated examples of that,” said Dr. Lorna Grande of the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association, a professional group affiliated with the Humane Society of the United States.""It is a welfare issue. These dogs are suffering,” she says.The AKC notes that its Canine Health Foundation has donated $67 million since 1990 for research and education on many breeds, and the kennel and Frenchie clubs say there have been advances. A new breathing test made its U.S. debut on Frenchies, bulldogs and pugs at a show in January.Prospective purebred owners should explore breeders' history and health testing, accept waiting for a puppy, and ask themselves whether they're prepared for the responsibility, the AKC says.“Research what goes into owning a dog,"" says spokesperson Brandi Hunter Munden, ""and really take an assessment of your lifestyle to make sure that you’re really making the best decision, not just for you, but for the animal.”",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836397,Retail sales dip 0.4% in February after buying burst in Jan.,"NEW YORK (AP) — America’s consumers trimmed their spending in February after a buying burst in January, underscoring the volatility of the economic environment.The government said Wednesday that retail sales slipped 0.4% after jumping a revised 3.2% in January, helped by an increase in auto sales. Retail sales were down in November and December, the critical holiday period.The February retail sales figure was weighed down by a 1.8% drop in auto sales as well as declines at restaurants and stores selling furniture and clothing. Excluding autos, sales slipped 0.1% from January, according to the Commerce Department.Sales at furniture stores fell 2.5%, while business at restaurants declined 2.2% in February from January. Sales at department stores slid 4%. But shoppers spent more online and at electronics stores, health and beauty stores and food retailers, according to the report.Shoppers remain relatively resilient, getting a boost from a strong job market. America’s employers added a solid 311,000 jobs in February, fewer than January’s huge gain. But they are grappling with still high prices on almost everything.The government reported on Tuesday that U.S. consumer price increases eased slightly from January to February but still pointed to an elevated inflation rate that's presenting a challenge for the Federal Reserve at a delicate moment for the financial system. Prices increased 0.4% last month, just below January’s 0.5% rise. Yet excluding volatile food and energy costs, so-called core prices rose 0.5% in February, slightly above January’s 0.4% gain.With the collapse of two large banks since Friday fueling anxiety about other regional banks, the Fed, for now, may concentrate more on boosting confidence in the financial system than on its long-term drive to tame inflation.Still, it remains to be seen whether news coverage of bank failures and stock market gyrations will hurt consumer sentiment this month, writes Capital Economics' Deputy Chief U.S Economist Andrew Hunter in a report issued Wednesday.The first reading will come with the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey released Friday. The bigger impact on consumers will probably come through a further tightening in credit conditions, economists said.“As the labor market softens in response to restrictive monetary policy, consumer attitudes are likely to turn more cautious over time,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a forecasting firm.The retail sales report comes as many retailers of all types including Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Macy's issued already cautious annual outlooks last month that pointed to a slowdown in consumer spending, particularly in clothing and furniture, as shoppers contend with higher prices as well as rising interest rates that boost borrowing costs.""While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer,” said Walmart's Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey on the call last month.Claire Tassin, retail and e-commerce analyst at Morning Consult, a survey research technology company, noted the longer-term trend shows that retail growth is bolstered by inflation, and shoppers are pulling back on discretionary spending with the strongest impacts on department stores and home furnishings retailers.“Essentials take priority in consumers’ budgets,” she added.The retail report released Wednesday covers only about a third of overall consumer spending and doesn’t include services such as hotel stays and plane tickets, which have rebounded as the threat of COVID-19 eases._____Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio____AP Economics Writer Chris Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836398,Boat carrying migrants from Madagascar sinks; 34 drown,"ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — Officials in Madagascar have recovered 34 bodies from the Indian Ocean after the sinking of a boat that was carrying migrants hoping to get to Mayotte.The boat carrying 58 passengers sailed clandestinely without going through official immigration or customs controls and sank late Saturday night off the northwest coast of Madagascar, according to Malagasy maritime authorities. Customs and Navy patrol boats recovered the bodies near the island of Nosy Faly, Director General of the Port, Maritime and Fluvial Agency Jean Edmond Randrianantenaina said. The victims mainly come from Ambilobe and also Tamatave, Majunga and Nosy Be, according to preliminary investigations, he said. “The entire state apparatus is angry at this tragedy. Also, we are implementing all possible means to speed up the investigations,” Randrianantenaina said. On the night of the sinking local fishermen in canoes rescued 24 survivors, he said. All but one of the survivors “fled as soon as they arrived on the bank, before the arrival of the authorities, no doubt for fear of being arrested,” said Lt. Col. Jules Tovoson Andriatsiriniaina, commander of the Diana region gendarmerie group. “Only a young woman, pregnant, was found,” he said. She was treated at Ambilobe hospital and is being interviewed as a key witness, he said.Officials are looking for two people, a man and a woman, suspected of being the smugglers or accomplices in illegally transporting migrants. They are wanted for “illegal boarding and clandestine transport, involuntary homicide of passengers to Mayotte,” he said.“It’s yet another shipwreck,” said Roger Charles Evina, representative of the International Organization for Migration for Madagascar and the Comoros.“Unfortunately, there are no official national statistics on these tragedies at sea. But we see that these are really recurring departures, carried out clandestinely and the final destination is very often Mayotte,"" he said.Although Mayotte is a poor archipelago of small islands, it is a French territory which may make it an attractive destination for migrants from Madagascar. The IOM has been developing a program for several months to fight against this illegal immigration from Madagascar, he said.“One of the actions of our project is to offer income-generating activities to potential migrants, in order to stabilize them in the communities of origin,"" said Evina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836399,Award-winning South African jazz singer Gloria Bosman dies,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — Smooth-voiced South African jazz musician Gloria Bosman has been lauded for her contribution to the country’s music industry in a career spanning more than two decades.Bosman died on Tuesday following a short illness, her family announced.“After a short illness, she transcended peacefully at her home, surrounded by family,"" the family said in a statement. ""Gloria had devoted her life, not just to her family, but to her music, she was loved and adored by many here in South Africa and beyond its borders.”The Soweto-born Bosman was praised for her soothing, silky vocals and versatility in crossing over to various music genres.South Africa’s ruling African National Congress party paid tribute to Bosman, saying the country's music industry will be poorer without her.“Gloria Bosman belongs to a generation of female musical greats who refused to submit to patriarchal stereotypes in a male dominated industry. She was a fiery and militant revolutionary in the creative sector,” the ANC said in a statement.South African jazz legend Sipho “Hotstix” Mabuse was among the first to express sadness at her passing, tweeting that he was “sad, gutted and shattered.”Bosman started singing in church and theaters, but a scholarship to study opera at the then-Pretoria Technikon (now Tshwane University of Technology) was crucial in her development as an artist.She returned to perform at the educational institution later in her career.The award-winning musician’s first album “Tranquility” was released in 1999 to critical acclaim, winning her the Best Newcomer award at the South African Music Awards.Her career took off and later she won a second Sama awards and 11 nominations, won two Africa-wide Kora awards and performed on many stages across the world.Bosman performed and recorded with some of South Africa's prominent musicians including the late Hugh Masekela, Sibongile Khumalo and Moses Molelekwa, as well as Zimbabwe's Oliver Mutukudzi.In December last year she was appointed to the board of the South African Music Rights Organization, a body set up to protect the intellectual property of music creators by collecting licensing fees and distributing royalties.“As a composer and a performing artist, in the short period that Ms. Bosman was a member of the board, she added a perspective that comprised of a rich blend of insights on member aspirations as well as the direction that our organization should continue to march towards,” said Samro board chairman Nicholas Maweni.Details for her memorial services and funeral have not been announced.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836400,Experts say attacks on free speech are rising across the US,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — In Idaho, an art exhibit was censored and teens were told they couldn't testify in some legislative hearings. In Washington state, a lawmaker proposed a hotline so the government could track offensively biased statements, as well as hate crimes. In Florida, bloggers are fighting a bill that would force them to register with the state if they write posts criticizing public officials.Meanwhile, bans on books and drag performances are growing increasingly common nationwide.“We are seeing tremendous attacks on First Amendment freedoms across the country right now, at all levels of government. Censorship is proliferating, and it’s deeply troubling,” said Joe Cohn, legislative and policy director with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.“This year, we’re seeing a wave of bills targeting drag performances, where simply being gender nonconforming is enough to trigger the penalty. We’re also seeing a wave of bills regulating what can be in public or K-12 school libraries,” Cohn said. “On college campuses, we have been tracking data about attempts to get faculty members punished or even fired for speech or expression and the numbers are startling — it’s the highest rate that we’ve seen in our 20 years of existence.”First Amendment rights had been stable in America for decades, said Ken Paulson, director of the Free Speech Center at Middle Tennessee State University, but in recent years many states have reverted to the anti-speech tactics employed by people like Sen. Joe McCarthy during the “Red Scare” of the early 1950s.McCarthy and others tried to silence political opponents by accusing them of being communists or socialists, using fear and public accusations to suppress basic free speech rights. The term “McCarthyism” became synonymous with baseless attacks on free expression, and the U.S. Supreme Court has referred to the phenomena in several First Amendment-related rulings.“We are seeing a concerted wave that we have not seen in decades,” said Paulson, highlighting states like Florida where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has pushed for legislation that would criminalize drag shows, limit what pronouns teachers can use for students, allow parents to determine what books can be in libraries and block some history classes entirely.“It's pretty mind-boggling that so many politicians are waving the flag of freedom while doing anything they possibly can to infringe on the free speech rights of Americans,” Paulson said.Still, no one political group has a monopoly on censorship — aggression is increasing across the spectrum, Cohn said.Washington state's bias hotline bill, which died in committee earlier this year, was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Javier Valdez and backed by several groups including the Anti-Defamation League, Urban League, Council on American-Islamic Relations and others. It aimed to help the state collect information about hate crimes and bias incidents and to provide support and compensation to victims at a time when hate crime reports are rising.Opponents, including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said they feared it would chill protected speech because it encompasses both criminal behavior and offensively biased statements.Hate speech can be damaging and repugnant, but is still generally protected by the First Amendment. The Department of Homeland Security and experts who study extremism have warned that hateful rhetoric can be seen as a call to action by extremists groups.Oregon created a similar bias hotline in 2019. It received nearly 1,700 calls in 2021, with nearly 60% of the reported incidents falling short of criminal standards, according to an annual report from Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum’s office.“People in power target their political adversaries, so who is being silenced really depends on where you are on the map and its individual context,” Cohn said.Artist Katrina Majkut experienced that first-hand last week, when artworks she had shown in more than two dozen states over the past decade were unexpectedly censored at a small state school in Lewiston, Idaho.Majkut uses embroidery to highlight and subvert historically narrow ideas of wifedom and motherhood. She was hired to curate an exhibit at Lewis-Clark State College focusing on health care issues like chronic illness, pregnancy and gun violence.But March 2, a day before the show's opening, Majkut and two other artists were told some of their work would be removed over administrator fears about running afoul of Idaho's “No Public Funds for Abortion Act.”The 2021 law bars state-funded entities from promoting abortion or taking other measures that could be seen as training or counseling someone in favor of abortion.Majkut's cross-stitch depicting misoprostol and mifepristone tablets — which can be used together to induce abortion early in pregnancy — was removed from the exhibit along with a wall plaque detailing Idaho's abortion laws.Four documentary video and audio works by artist Lydia Nobles that showed women talking about their own experiences with abortion were also removed. And part of artist Michelle Harney's series of 1920s-era letters written to Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger were stricken from the show.“To be censored like that is shocking and surreal,” said Majkut, who designs her art to be educational rather than confrontational. “If the most even-keeled, bipartisan artwork around this topic is censored, then everything is going to be censored.”Logan Fowler, the spokesman for LCSC, said the school made the decision after consulting with attorneys about whether showing the art could violate the law. Republican Rep. Bruce Skaug, the author of the law, said Tuesday that it was not intended to “prevent open discussion” of abortion — only to prevent tax dollars from being used to promote it.The art exhibit censorship comes just two months after another controversial decision by Skaug. As chairman of the Idaho House Judiciary and Rules Committee, Skaug announced in January that people under age 18 would not be allowed to testify in his committee. Another Republican committee chair soon followed suit.Lawmakers have the ability to limit committee testimony, and often use those limits to keep the legislature's work focused and timely. Still, the age-based speech restriction appeared to be a first for the state.A group of teens took action, launching phone and email campaigns staging protests.“There is a clear lack of foresight in politicians who seek to eliminate the voices of those who will one day elect and eventually supersede them,” a group of 32 high school student leaders wrote in a joint opinion piece sent to news outlets across the state. “We ask Idaho’s Republican leaders, what are you so afraid of?”The lawmakers eventually modified their rules, allowing youth to testify as long as they have signed permission slips from a parent or guardian.Skaug said the rule was necessary to ensure parents are aware if their kids are leaving school to testify at the Statehouse. He still intends to give priority to older residents when testimony time is limited, but said he's not aware of any youth actually being denied the chance to testify so far this year.For Cohn, the efforts in Idaho and elsewhere reflect the danger of trying to restrict the expression of people who hold opposing views.""We have to be ever-vigilant if we want our culture of individual freedoms to prevail,” he said. “Bad ideas are better dealt with through debate and dialogue than government censorship.”",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836437,"Bank fears spread to Europe, drag down shares of big lenders","GENEVA (AP) — Fears about the world banking system spread to Europe on Wednesday as shares in the globally connected Swiss bank Credit Suisse plunged and dragged down other major European lenders in the wake of bank failures in the United States.At one point, Credit Suisse shares lost more than a quarter of their value, hitting a record low after the bank's biggest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — told news outlets that it would not put more money into the Swiss lender, which was beset by problems long before the U.S. banks collapsed.The turmoil prompted an automatic pause in trading of Credit Suisse shares on the Swiss market and sent shares of other European banks tumbling, some by double digits. That fanned new fears about the health of financial institutions following the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in the U.S.Speaking Wednesday at a financial conference in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann defended the bank, saying, “We already took the medicine” to reduce risks.When asked if he would rule out government assistance in the future, he said: “That’s not a topic. ... We are regulated. We have strong capital ratios, very strong balance sheet. We are all hands on deck, so that’s not a topic whatsoever.”But Switzerland’s central bank announced late Wednesday that it was prepared to act, saying it would support Credit Suisse if needed. A statement from the bank did not specify whether the support would come in the form of cash or loans or other assistance. At the moment, regulators said, they believe the bank has enough money to meet its obligations.Credit Suisse then said early Thursday that it is taking measures to shore up its finances, including exercising an option to borrow up to 50 billion francs ($53.7 billion) from the central bank.“This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse’s core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,” the bank said.A day earlier, Credit Suisse reported that managers had identified “material weaknesses” in the bank’s internal controls on financial reporting as of the end of last year. That fanned new doubts about the bank’s ability to weather the storm.Credit Suisse stock dropped about 30%, to about 1.6 Swiss francs ($1.73), before clawing back to a 24% loss at 1.70 francs ($1.83) at the close of trading on the SIX stock exchange. At its lowest, the price was down more than 85% from February 2021.After the joint announcement from the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss financial markets regulator, the shares also made up some ground on Wall Street.The stock has suffered a long, sustained decline: In 2007, the bank's shares traded at more than 80 francs ($86.71) each.With concerns about the possibility of more hidden trouble in the banking system, investors were quick to sell bank stocks.France’s Societe Generale SA dropped 12% at one point. France’s BNP Paribas fell more than 10%. Germany's Deutsche Bank tumbled 8%, and Britain's Barclays Bank was down nearly 8%. Trading in the two French banks was briefly suspended.The STOXX Banks index of 21 leading European lenders sagged 8.4% following relative calm in the markets Tuesday.The turbulence came a day ahead of a meeting by the European Central Bank. President Christine Lagarde said last week, before the U.S. failures, that the bank would “very likely” increase interest rates by a half percentage point to fight against inflation. Markets were watching closely to see if the bank carries through despite the latest turmoil.Credit Suisse is “a much bigger concern for the global economy” than the midsize U.S. banks that collapsed, said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist for Capital Economics.It has multiple subsidiaries outside Switzerland and handles trading for hedge funds.“Credit Suisse is not just a Swiss problem but a global one,” he said.He noted, however, that the bank's “problems were well known so do not come as a complete shock to either investors or policymakers.”The troubles ""once more raise the question about whether this is the beginning of a global crisis or just another ‘idiosyncratic’ case,” Kenningham said in a note. ”Credit Suisse was widely seen as the weakest link among Europe’s large banks, but it is not the only bank which has struggled with weak profitability in recent years.”Leaving a Credit Suisse branch in Geneva, Fady Rachid said he and his wife are worried about the bank’s health. He planned to transfer some money to UBS.“I find it hard to believe that Credit Suisse is going to be able to get rid of these problems and get through it,"" said Rachid, a 56-year-old doctor.The Swiss National Bank declined to comment. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority did not immediately respond to calls and emails seeking comment.Investors responded to “a broader structural problem"" in banking following a long period of low interest rates and ""very, very loose monetary policy,” said Sascha Steffen, professor of finance at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.In order to earn some yield, banks ""needed to take more risks, and some banks did this more prudently than others.""Now investors are worried that banks ""have risks on their balance sheet that they don’t know about and therefore have accumulated significant losses that haven’t been yet realized.”European finance ministers said this week that their banking system has no direct exposure to the U.S. bank failures.Europe strengthened its banking safeguards after the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008 by transferring supervision of the biggest banks to the central bank, analysts said. The central bank is considered less likely than national supervisors to look the other way at developing problems.The Credit Suisse parent bank is not part of EU supervision, but it has entities in several European countries that are. Credit Suisse is subject to international rules requiring it to maintain financial buffers against losses as one of 30 so-called globally systemically important banks, or G-SIBs.Share prices plunged after Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy told Bloomberg and Reuters that the bank has ruled out further investments in Credit Suisse to avoid regulations that kick in with a stake above 10%.The Saudi National Bank has invested some 1.5 billion Swiss francs to acquire a holding just under that threshold.The Swiss bank has been pushing to raise money from investors and roll out a new strategy to overcome an array of troubles, including bad bets on hedge funds, repeated shake-ups of its top management and a spying scandal involving Zurich rival UBS.In an annual report released Tuesday, Credit Suisse said customer deposits fell 41%, or by 159.6 billion francs ($172.1 billion), at the end of last year compared with a year earlier.___McHugh reported from Frankfurt, Germany.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836438,"Justice Dept, SEC probing collapse of Silicon Valley Bank","The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations into the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.The investigations – which are separate inquiries – are in the early stages and will also examine the actions of the bank’s senior executives, the people said.The Justice Department’s investigation involves federal prosecutors in California, along with prosecutors involved in fraud cases, the people said.They were not authorized to publicly discuss the specific details of the ongoing investigations and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday — the largest bank failure since the financial crisis of 2008 — and Signature Bank two days later have rattled markets as investors seek the safety of bonds amid renewed concerns about problems in the banking sector. On Wednesday, Credit Suisse, which has been beset by problems long before Silicon Valley Bank's demise, saw its shares hit their lowest level ever as the bank's largest shareholder declined to offer further support.The Federal Reserve is facing criticism for missing what observers say were clear signs that Silicon Valley Bank was at a high risk of default.And a class action lawsuit was filed against the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, its CEO and its chief financial officer, saying that the bank didn’t disclose the risks that future interest rate increases would have on its business.As part of its investigation, the SEC has begun the process of seeking documents by sending out hold notices, said one of the people familiar with the matter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836440,When will Medicare cover medical marijuana?,"Many older adults are using medical marijuana to treat a variety of conditions, but experts say that conflicting laws, unclear safety standards and complicated rulemaking processes mean it could be years before Medicare may cover the drug.One in five Medicare recipients currently uses medical marijuana, according to an April 2022 poll by the Medicare Plans Patient Resource Center, an organization that provides Medicare guidance and information. And nearly a quarter have used it in the past. Two-thirds of Medicare recipients think Medicare should cover it, the poll found.But Medicare doesn’t cover medical marijuana because it’s not federally legal and not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Here’s where the situation stands.WHY COVER MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR OLDER ADULTS?In one analysis of data from a large cannabis dispensary in New York, 60% of patients were 50 or older, according to an April 2022 paper in the journal, Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research. The patients used cannabis for severe or chronic pain, cancer, Parkinson’s disease and neuropathy, among other things.And marijuana isn’t cheap: Patients might pay as much as $5 per dose for edible products or $5 to $20 per gram for plant buds, according to New York Cancer & Blood Specialists, which provides care to patients with cancer and blood disorders . (That’s about $142 to $567 per ounce.) Even in states where medical marijuana can be legally prescribed, patients might not be able to afford the prescription.“This medicine is so expensive,” says Debbie Churgai, executive director of Americans for Safe Access, a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research. “There are some states now where insurance will cover the cost of the doctor visit or the cost of the marijuana card, but no insurance will cover the cost of the actual products.”WHAT ARE THE FEDERAL ROADBLOCKS?Two significant issues stand between medical marijuana and Medicare coverage. The first is that the government classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category of drugs with “no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse” in the United States, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.“There is no way the federal government is going to reimburse people through a federal program for a substance they deem as illegal,” says Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, the National Association for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.The second issue is that Medicare requires that the FDA approve a covered drug as safe and effective. Although the FDA has approved one cannabis-derived drug product and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products for prescription use, the agency hasn’t approved the marketing of cannabis for medical treatment.WHAT ABOUT IN STATES WHERE IT’S LEGAL?Sure, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, but medical marijuana is now legal in 37 states and Washington D.C. Could private insurers — companies that offer Medicare Advantage, for instance — decide to cover it?Not likely, says Kyle Jaeger, a cannabis policy reporter and senior editor at Marijuana Moment, a cannabis news site. Like banking institutions that have hesitated to offer services to marijuana businesses, major health insurers will likely decline to cover cannabis as long as it remains a Schedule I drug under federal law.Also, private insurers rely on the FDA to guide them on which drugs to cover. Consider that the FDA released a statement in January saying that current regulatory pathways are insufficient to allow the agency to classify CBD as a dietary supplement.“It’s incredibly frustrating for consumers, because all they want is a safe, consistent product,” Jaeger says.HOW HIGH IS THE BAR FOR CANNABIS COVERAGE?Among other things, the marketplace needs more data on the medicinal use of cannabis. “(Insurers) need data to show that the outcomes from cannabis care are equivalent to, if not better than, existing options that they do cover,” says Dr. Benjamin Caplan, founder and chief medical officer of CED Clinic, which provides services to people seeking cannabis treatment.This is partly complicated by the free-market dispensary system in which patients are free to buy any product. “The system has to be tweaked,” Caplan says. “Patients can’t just have carte blanche to buy whatever they want and the insurance companies are on the hook to cover that.”Considering the breadth of legal and regulatory obstacles facing the process, plus an overhaul of the dispensary system, the road to cannabis coverage is lengthy, says Jaeger. “I’d say we are many years from having that conversation and rulemaking for something like Medicare.”_________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance site NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836441,EU eyes more naval visits in disputed South China Sea,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The European Union wants to step up its naval visits and possibly engage in joint military training exercises to promote freedom of navigation and respect for international law in the disputed South China Sea, an EU official said Wednesday.EU special envoy to the Indo-Pacific region Richard Tibbels said the 27-nation bloc is also ready to provide satellite surveillance to help countries like the Philippines respond to natural disasters and protect their interests, as tensions pitting China against its smaller neighbors escalate in the disputed waterway.The outreach is part of an EU strategy, unveiled in 2021, to focus its actions in the Indo-Pacific to contribute to regional security amid more intense geo-political competition. The long-term engagement would be grounded on shared values, including a commitment to respect democracy, human rights and the rule of law, Tibbels said.“We really have a strong interest in making sure that freedom of navigation and overflight continues and that the global trading system is not affected by increasing tensions in the region,” Tibbels told The Associated Press in an interview in Manila, where he met Philippine foreign, defense and coast guard officials.About 40% of the EU's foreign trade transits through the South China Sea, making stability a key concern.""We will be trying to step up our naval presence,"" Tibbels said, when asked what steps the EU was prepared to take to help uphold freedom of mobility and international law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, in the disputed waters.Some European countries, including Germany, have deployed warships in the region in recent years.“We will be trying to encourage and coordinate our member states to continue such naval visits even joint exercises should that be possible,” he said. Such deployments would be “relatively modest” but could be done regularly given the capabilities of the bloc's member states, he said.The U.S. military has deployed aircraft carriers, warships and fighter jets for regular patrols that challenge China's expansive territorial claims, provoking angry reactions from Beijing.A similar coordinated EU naval presence in the northwestern Indian Ocean has been organized to promote freedom of navigation and repel pirate attacks on commercial shipping. The effort could expand eastward in the future, nearer to Asia “as member states' naval capacities allow,” Tibbels said.Tibbels reiterated EU support for efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to negotiate “an acceptable code of conduct” with China to prevent the long-simmering territorial conflicts from escalating into armed confrontations.ASEAN members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei, along with China and Taiwan, have long been locked in a tense territorial standoff in the South China Sea, which straddles some of the world's busiest sea lanes and is believed to be sitting atop considerable undersea oil and gas deposits.Tibbels also addressed concerns over tensions between China and Taiwan, saying the EU has continuously warned about the massive disruption to the global trading system, including to China, if the situation spirals out of control in the Taiwan Strait.China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Top U.S. officers have called for heightened preparations, saying in memos and congressional testimony that China sees a shrinking window for action and may move on Taiwan within a few years.“We're talking to our like-minded partners. We want to be prepared. We want to work out what would need to be done in case of increasing tensions and that's quite a work going on behind the scenes,” Tibbels said.“But I think you can obviously count on the reaction of like-minded partners being robust should untoward developments happen,” Tibbels said, without elaborating.___Associated Press journalist Aaron Favila contributed to this report.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836442,Italian court deliberates appeal of 2 US men in cop killing,"ROME (AP) — Italy’s highest court started deliberations Wednesday in what should be the final appeal of two U.S. citizens convicted in the stabbing death of a police officer during a plainclothes operation in Rome in the summer of 2019.Finnegan Lee Elder, now 23, and Gabriel Natale-Hjorth, now 22, were convicted in May 2021 of slaying the 35-year-old officer, as well as of attempted extortion, resisting a public official and carrying an attack-style knife without just cause.The two men, who were friends in northern California before they traveled to Italy together, initially received life sentences, Italy’s most severe penalty. An appeals court last year upheld their convictions, but reduced the sentences to 24 years for Elder and 22 years for Natale-Hjorth.The Italian legal system allows defendants another appeal to Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation, which heard some seven hours of arguments before going into deliberations Wednesday evening. The court can either uphold the convictions or send the case back for a retrial if it finds errors in the rules of law.Natale-Hjorth and Elder's lawyers argued that there were flaws in the prosecution’s reconstruction of events from the night Carabinieri Vice Brigadier Mario Cerceillo Rega was stabbed 11 times near the hotel where the two American tourists were staying.The defense also claims Cerceillo Rega’s partner lied when he said the two officers showed the young men their badges to identify themselves as law enforcement.During the original trial, the defendants testified that neither officer identified himself as a police officer and they that thought the Italians dressed in casual summer clothes were thugs.Elder testified that he pulled out a knife he carried for his own protection as Cerciello Rega tried to strangle him and repeatedly stabbed the officer to break free.Natale-Hjorth testified that he grappled with Cerciello Rega’s partner and was unaware of the stabbing when he ran back to the hotel.In Italy, an accomplice can be charged with murder without directly taking part in a slaying.The plainclothes officers were responding to a reported extortion attempt allegedly concocted by the Americans after they made a botched attempt to buy cocaine a few hours earlier in Rome's Trastevere nightlife district.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836443,"Like it or not, building in Italy means mastering concrete","CONTRADA PETRARO, Sicily (AP) — Everywhere you look in Italy, it’s there: It can be hulking and gray but also colorful and fun. Ominous but also beautiful.Masonry using concrete and its old ingredient, cement, are inescapable here. It's a crucial difference between construction in North America and in Europe: the carpenter versus the stone worker.That was the difficult reality I faced when I moved from the U.S. with my family into a long-abandoned farm property 3 kilometers (a couple of miles) outside a town called Castelbuono in the Madonie Mountains in north-central Sicily.I had a whole bunch of ugly and crumbling concrete to deal with. Or that’s how I saw it at first.Coming from a background in American carpentry, the art of masonry was entirely new to me. But here, in a land where laborers have long excelled with trowels, chisels, mortar mixes, stones and bricks, I realized I’d have to become familiar with them too.Masonry is especially legendary in Italy, home to many of the world’s most spectacular examples of stone and mortar work. The country also boasts the largest un-reinforced concrete dome still in existence: the Pantheon of ancient Rome.As I began experimenting with concrete work and got a little better at it, I also came to appreciate more all those concrete buildings around me in Sicily — from the ancient beauties to the clunkier, Brutalist-style versions that went up in a post-World War II building boom.The farm’s main part consists of two barns: an old stone structure, and a newer, tower-like one made of concrete blocks. Nearly five years went by before I finally attempted to turn the barns into a house.During those years, my family had been living comfortably in a tiny modern home, also built in concrete blocks, a few yards from the barns where the farmer who built this place kept animals and tools, and made wine and olive oil. The 430-square-foot home – with a flushing toilet, lights, shower, windows, veranda and tiled floors – was the reason we’d bought the property.The hulking barns, though, remained always at the back of my mind, holding the potential to be transformed into a bigger, more beautiful house.Finally, one day I picked up a borrowed, hand-held jackhammer and started busting into the work.My first objective was to remove a concrete-and-stone bench sitting against a sagging wall of the old barn. After a few weeks of work, I’d burnt through my friend’s jackhammer and a cheap new one.It was hard going. Hand chisels were more apt to bounce off than accomplish any demolition. Normal drills were absolutely useless. The hours accumulated, along with a pile of busted concrete bits, stones of many sizes, lots of sand and cement, steel rods, broken bricks, pebbles.My back was sore. I was exasperated. I looked up and sighed at the thought of what still awaited:One side of the two-story barn was bereft of even a coat of plaster, and bats flew in and out of its gaping cracks. A big concrete trough was pulling away from the wall of the main barn. Inside the barns, the walls had no electrical outlets. Water lines and windows were scarce. The floors needed to be layered in new concrete.And maybe worst of all, concrete beams throughout the structure were showing cracks.Overwhelmed, I went back to jackhammering, chiseling, cutting steel re-bar, piling up rubble, cutting electrical lines into the concrete walls and, eventually, even beginning to plaster.“Rome wasn’t built in a day, I suppose,” I bolstered myself.In town, a friend and marble worker tried to teach me the mysteries of Italian construction, running his hand over a massive stone and mortar edifice.“Look at this ancient place’s walls; look at how thick these walls are,” said Antonio Capuana, admiration in his voice. “These are load-bearing walls that keep up the entire house. This wall was part of a barn for an old monastery.”Back then, he said, cement didn't exist. The builders used stone and cocciopesto — a clay mixed with lime — to make huge structures.Widespread use of modern concrete and cement arrived in Sicily in the early 1900s and boomed after World War II, as it did in much of the world.“Cement changed the world,” Nicolo Pierlucio Raimondo, an architect in Castelbuono, told me.The art of mortar-making goes back to the ancient Romans and Arabs, he said. They experimented with the binding qualities of pozzolans, naturally occurring cements such as volcanic ash and gypsum. The invention of Portland cement in the 1820s, and its mass adoption in the early 1900s, was another game changer.“Think about how much bigger cities have gotten in these last 100 years. Cement had a big part in this,” the architect said. “It helped speed up construction.”But he added a cautionary note: “How long will these concrete structures last? No one knows.”Capuana, the marble worker, pointed across the street to a row of concrete homes built in the 1960s and '70s.“Look at the overhangs on all those buildings,” he said. “They were made with steel and concrete. Over time, we’ve had to rebuild them all.""By contrast, experts are still trying to understand the secret to the longevity of the ancient Romans’ concrete.Modern concrete’s biggest weakness is water seeping through its tiny pores, a major factor in hairline cracks. Once water penetrates and rusts the steel used to reinforce concrete, a cracking process known as spalling worsens.Gioacchino Allegra, a master builder overseeing the remodeling of a concrete home on the outskirts of Castelbuono, said today's concrete is more compact than that of the building boom of the 1960s, which reduces spalling.I also reached out to the International Masonry Institute for guidance.Amy Lamb Woods, a concrete expert and preservationist there, said the post-World War II boom in concrete construction — the Brutalist stuff — was made possible by the advent of better kilns in the early 1900s.On the down side, concrete became associated with urban decay. On the plus side, its use helped create so much modern infrastructure, from highways to hospitals.“There’s this onslaught of: ‘Oh, it’s concrete, it’s ugly,’ and they want to tear them down,” Woods said. “All of us preservation people are advocating for their preservation because we believe these buildings are iconic, breathtaking, especially when they’re maintained well.”In the U.S., that debate has intensified because concrete structures older than 50 years are now eligible for landmark status.Also, because concrete is now recognized as causing some 8 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions, most of that from cooking that cement in those kilns.Yet as Woods noted, “The most green building you can build is the one that you restore and preserve. You’re in essence keeping the building. And so, you’re not putting it into a landfill, and you’re continuing its use.”Listening to her made me feel so much better about the potential in my towering and downright ugly concrete barn, and about all the concrete work waiting to be done.——For more AP Lifestyles stories, go to https://apnews.com/hub/lifestyle.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836444,"Publishers, sellers, authors form Creative Economy Coalition","NEW YORK (AP) — Organizations representing book publishers, booksellers and authors have formed a coalition to protect copyrights and oppose legislation across the country that it fears could drive down e-book prices and damage writers’ ability to support themselvesThe Association of American Publishers, the Authors Guild and the American Booksellers Association are among the members of the Protect the Creative Economy Coalition. Their current focus is proposed legislation in Connecticut, Kentucky and elsewhere that sets boundaries on what publishers can ask for when negotiating with a given state's library system.Libraries and publishers have long battled over terms for e-books, which in principle are far easier than printed books for libraries to loan out repeatedly. Publishers often charge libraries double or more the average retail price for e-book rights and limit how often they can be made available to patrons.Supporters of the state laws have contended that they want books to be more affordable for libraries, and by extension, consumers.“Writers’ incomes have become precariously low, forcing talented writers to leave the profession; as a culture, we lose their books and their important insights,” Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, said in a statement Wednesday. “By forcing pricing limits and other restrictions on not just publishers but thousands of self-published authors, the bills exhibit total disregard of the reality that authors in the commercial marketplace have to earn enough money to stay in the profession.""Last year, a federal judge in Maryland struck down a law that would have required publishers to make e-books available on “reasonable terms” to libraries if they were also being offered to the general public. The Association of American Publishers had contended that the bill violated the United States Copyright Act by allowing states to regulate publishing transactions.Maria Pallante, president and CEO of the publishers association, said in a statement Wednesday that the current bills under consideration “would subject authors and publishing houses of all sizes to serious liabilities and financial penalties for exercising the very rights that the Copyright Act so clearly affords them.""The new coalition also includes the National Music Publishers Association, the News Media Alliance and the Copyright Alliance.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836450,"MATCHDAY: Arsenal plays Sporting, Man U has lead over Betis","A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Thursday:EUROPA LEAGUEOn course for a first Premier League title in 19 years, Arsenal doesn't seem to mind having European commitments to clog up its end-of-season schedule. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta maintains winning the Europa League is an important objective for the club and continues to make only minor lineup changes in the competition, like in the 2-2 draw at Sporting in the first leg of the round of 16 last week. Arsenal will be favored to advance going into the return match at Emirates Stadium. Sporting has already played in north London this season — a 1-1 draw with Tottenham in the Champions League. Manchester United is in good shape to progress, leading Real Betis 4-1 from the first leg, while Sevilla — a six-time competition winner — protects a 2-0 lead at Fenerbahce. Italian teams Juventus and Roma hold leads, too, against Freiburg (1-0) and Real Sociedad (2-0), respectively.CONFERENCE LEAGUELazio is in danger of elimination after losing its first-leg game against Dutch club AZ Alkmaar 2-1 in the round of 16. The second leg is in the Netherlands as Lazio attempts to keep alive its hopes of a first European trophy since 1999, ahead of a game in Serie A against local rival Roma on Sunday. West Ham has what should be a comfortable 2-0 lead over AEK Larnaca of Cyprus ahead of the second leg in London. Villarreal is level at 1-1 with Belgian team Anderlecht after the first leg, while Fiorentina has a 1-0 advantage over Sivasspor ahead of their second leg in Turkey and Nice leads Sheriff Tiraspol of Moldova 1-0.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836453,"Neighbors Bulgaria, Romania sign agreement to boost ties","SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Bulgarian President Rumen Radev held talks Wednesday with his visiting Romanian counterpart as the two neighbors and NATO allies signed a cooperation agreement to boost bilateral ties amid Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.Radev met with Klaus Iohannis in the capital, Sofia, where the two leaders discussed topics including regional security, energy, and economy. They also discussed their countries’ bids to one day join Europe’s ID-check-free travel zone, the so-called Schengen area.In a news conference afterwards, Radev highlighted Tuesday's U.S. drone collision with a Russian fighter jet over the Black Sea, saying ""we must do everything possible” to prevent events from escalating into a global conflict.“In addition to supporting Ukraine,” he said, “we must work to end this conflict as quickly as possible.”Iohannis called Wednesday's meeting “a key moment for bilateral relations” and said the Black Sea drone incident was “serious and regrettable.”“The profound geostrategic changes on our borders, with consequences in the extended Black Sea region … prompt us to realize the need for even closer cooperation,” he said.Iohannis said that he discussed with Radev the EU’s enlargement policy; the expansion of transport infrastructure; and the need to support embattled Moldova, which is not a member of the EU or NATO and has been heavily affected by the war in Ukraine.Despite Bulgaria and Romania both being NATO members since 2004, and EU members since 2007, they were both told last year they must wait longer to participate in the Schengen zone — the world’s largest free travel zone that comprises 26 countries — over some countries' migration concerns.“So far we have proven that we know how to manage illegal migration, which is artificially mixed with the Schengen issue,” Iohannis said Wednesday. “We hope that this year we will receive a positive vote for this.”",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836454,US and Russia ratchet up rhetoric over downing of drone,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and the United States ratcheted up their confrontational rhetoric Wednesday over a U.S. surveillance drone that encountered Russian warplanes and crashed near Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which the Kremlin has illegally annexed. At the same time, the two countries' defense chiefs opened a dialogue about the incident.The Kremlin said the flight proved again that Washington is directly involved in the fighting in Ukraine and added that Moscow would try to recover the drone’s wreckage from the Black Sea. U.S. officials said the incident showed Russia’s aggressive and risky behavior and pledged to continue their surveillance.Russia has long voiced concern about U.S. surveillance flights near its borders, but Tuesday’s incident signaled Moscow’s increasing readiness to raise the ante as tensions soar between the two nuclear powers. It reflected the Kremlin’s appetite for brinkmanship that could further destabilize the situation and lead to more direct confrontations.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who said the incident was part of a ""pattern of aggressive, risky and unsafe actions by Russian pilots in international airspace,” spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, on Wednesday for the first time in five months.""It’s important that great powers be models of transparency and communication, and the United States will continue to fly and to operate wherever international law allows,” Austin told reporters in Washington.Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who also appeared at the briefing, said, ""We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional,” but whether the Russian warplane's collision with the MQ-9 Reaper drone was intentional was still unclear.The Russian Defense Ministry said in its report of the call with Austin that Shoigu noted the U.S. had provoked the incident by ignoring flight restrictions the Kremlin had imposed due to its military operation in Ukraine and also blamed “the intensification of intelligence activities against the interests of the Russian Federation.” Such U.S. actions “are fraught with escalation of the situation in the Black Sea area,” it said, warning that Russia “will respond in kind to all provocations.”Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said in televised remarks the drone incident was “another confirmation” of direct U.S. involvement in the Ukraine conflict. The Kremlin has repeatedly said the United States and other NATO members have become direct war participants by supplying weapons and intelligence to the Kyiv government and pressuring it not to negotiate peace.Patrushev, a confidant of President Vladimir Putin, also said Russia would search for the drone's debris, but added, “I don’t know if we can recover them or not, but we will certainly have to do that.”U.S. officials said Russia dispatched ships to try to recover the wreckage, which Milley said were likely submerged 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500 meters) deep.The U.S. has no vessels in the Black Sea because Turkey closed the Bosphorus Strait to warships in 2022, except for those returning to home port.U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said the drone was in international airspace when the Russian warplane struck its propeller. U.S. officials accused Russia of trying to intercept the unmanned aircraft, although its presence over the Black Sea — a strategic military and economic area for both Russia and Ukraine — was not uncommon.“It is also not uncommon for the Russians to try to intercept them,” Kirby said, adding that such an encounter “does increase the risk of miscalculations, misunderstandings.”Kirby said the U.S. “took steps to protect the information and to protect, to minimize any effort by anybody else to exploit that drone for useful content.”Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, said Russia is capable of recovering the wreckage.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated the Defense Ministry’s statement that Russian jets didn’t use their weapons or hit the drone. He repeated his description of U.S.-Russia relations as at their lowest point but added that “Russia has never rejected a constructive dialogue, and it’s not rejecting it now.”In Washington, Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov expressed concern about “the unacceptable actions of the United States military in the close proximity to our borders.""“What do they do thousands of miles away from the United States?” he said in remarks his embassy released. “The answer is obvious -- they gather intelligence which is later used by the Kyiv regime to attack our armed forces and territory.”He noted “it is important that the lines of communication should remain open,” emphasizing that “Russia does not seek confrontation and stands for pragmatic cooperation in the interests of the peoples of our countries.”While encounters between Russian and NATO aircraft are not unusual — before the Ukraine invasion, NATO planes were involved in an annual average of 400 intercepts with Russian planes — the war has heightened the significance of such incidents.“The last thing that anybody should want is for this war in Ukraine to escalate to become something between the United States and Russia,” Kirby said, speaking Wednesday on CNN. “We’ve been working very, very hard throughout the beginning of this conflict ... to make sure that it doesn’t escalate.""The secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Oleksiy Danilov, tweeted the drone incident was ""a signal from Putin that he is ready to expand the conflict zone, with drawing other parties in.”In another tussle, the U.K. Defense Ministry said British and German fighter jets were scrambled Tuesday to intercept a Russian aircraft near Estonian airspace. The U.K. and Germany are conducting joint air policing missions in Estonia as part of NATO’s bolstering of its eastern flank.The ministry said the Typhoon jets responded after a Russian refueling aircraft failed to communicate with Estonian air traffic control. The Russian plane did not enter the airspace of Estonia, a NATO member.In Ukraine, at least three civilians were killed and another 23 wounded in strikes over the previous 24 hours, the presidential office said.In partially occupied Donetsk province, where much of the heaviest fighting has been concentrated, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said 14 cities and villages were shelled. That included Kramatorsk, where some Ukrainian forces are based.In embattled Bakhmut, where a Russian assault has continued for months, Ukrainian forces have successfully fought for northern parts of the city, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Maliar said.In the northeastern Kharkiv region, one person was killed and another was wounded in Vovchansk, a city near the border with Russia. Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said Russian forces also hit a civilian area in Kharkiv city.Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Ukrainian television a boarding school and an apartment building were damaged.In the south, Russian forces shelled the city of Kherson seven times in the last 24 hours, hitting an infrastructure facility and residential buildings and wounding four people. In Dnipropetrovsk province, Russian forces shelled Nikopol and Marhanets, towns located across a river from the shut-down Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.In another development, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy replaced more governors. Without giving a reason, Zelenskyy dismissed the heads of the Luhansk, Odesa and Khmelnytskyi regions.Volodymyr Fesenko, an analyst at the Penta Kyiv center, said the dismissals “are associated either with a low level of work efficiency or with criticism of abuses.""___Superville reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836456,Fox's Hall talks survival after nearly dying in Ukraine,"NEW YORK (AP) — A year after nearly being killed by Russian bombs while covering the war in Ukraine, Fox News’ Benjamin Hall credits a relentless optimism -- and what he describes as an unexplained miracle -- for getting him through.Truth is, it was probably several miracles that enabled Hall to sit in a cafe at Fox's New York headquarters recently to discuss the book he'd written about his ordeal.There was the Ukrainian special forces officer driving by after the bombing who saw Hall's wave and put him in a car, the lucky train ride from Kyiv to Poland, the 30 — and counting — surgeries he's endured as he heals from the March 14, 2022, incident.No story compares with the voice he heard when the second of three bombs left him torn apart and blacked out. He swears it was his daughter, Honor, then at home in London with her mother and sisters Iris and Hero.The voice was insistent: “Daddy, you've got to get out of the car.” Hall obeyed, just before the third bomb hit, setting him afire.“I've spoken to some people who have had near-death experiences and they often see their family,” Hall told The Associated Press. ""I think when you take everything else away, what is the main thing that means the most to us, the place we want to be? It's back home with your family.“Was it a miracle?” he asked. “I believe so. I was saved that day. It's the title of my book. I was in the middle seat of a small car — it's the death seat — somehow I came out of it, and I'm still alive. Whether it was my daughter or whether it was an angel, I don't have an answer for that.”Hall's two colleagues on the reporting trip, photographer Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian “fixer” Oleksandra “Sasha” Kuvshynova, were both killed.Even after escaping and being taken to a Kyiv hospital, Hall's survival was by no means assured. He was gravely injured. He lost his right leg below the knee, much of his left foot, the sight in his left eye, his left thumb was blown off, his skull was dented and he was burned over much of his body.He was fortunate to get a ride on a diplomats' train out of Kyiv to Poland, where he was evacuated to the American military treatment facility in Landstuhl, Germany.Hall's book captures this great escape, much of it reconstructed through his later reporting. He noted how his father, rescued in war-torn Manila in 1945 and who died at age 89 less than a month before Ben's deployment to Ukraine, both had their lives saved by the U.S. military.He doesn't mince words about what he went through — his screams heard corridors away in a hospital when dressings from his burns were taken off, and the horrific dreams that led him to reduce pain medication.Yet he said he's blessed to have an optimistic nature and determination.“I like the positivity and optimism he's got, which is great,” said Bob Woodruff, the ABC News anchor who suffered a traumatic brain injury when a bomb exploded near where he was reporting in Iraq in 2006.After a period of feeling lucky to be alive, many people who suffer such injuries sink into a dangerous period of frustration and depression, Woodruff said. If Hall has gone through that, he seems to have pulled through, he said.“It takes a long time to adjust and say goodbye to some things you did and say hello to new ones,” Woodruff said.He also says the role of an injured person's loved ones deserves more credit; his wife, Lee, has spoken to Hall's wife, Alicia.From the description of some of his wartime reporting experiences in Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, many before he joined Fox News in 2015, Hall was lucky to make it physically unscathed before Ukraine. With thoughts of his family, he had largely settled into a safer job covering the State Department before volunteering for duty in Ukraine.While impossible to resist an “I told you so” or two, Hall's wife knew how important the story was and how important it was for him to cover it, he said.Has he second-guessed his own decision to go?“Not once,” he said.While important to understand the danger, ""once you've made that decision to go, you've got to be able, if you want to do the job well, to turn that off,” he said. “Because fear will stop you from doing that job.”In his book, Hall recounts a conversation he had with a former soldier about coming to terms with the pain that he's going to face every day.“I don't like telling people about the pain because I don't want to upset anyone else,” Hall said in the interview. “It's for me to deal with, not for someone else to deal with. What are they going to do? Feel bad about me? Who does that help? No one. So I'll deal with it myself.”Hall said he hoped his book can show others that they have reservoirs of strength to deal with adversity. His story also will be told in a two-hour Fox News Channel documentary on Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern.Mindful of his new reality, Hall will have to decide what is next. For Bob and Lee Woodruff, it was starting a foundation that has raised $125 million for injured soldiers. Woodruff continues to report; he spoke in an interview this week from north of the Arctic Circle in Canada.“I've spent my whole career talking about war and horror and the depths of it,” Hall said. “I think I'd like to tell some more positive and optimistic stories now.”",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836457,"UK, German fighter jets intercept Russian plane near Estonia","LONDON (AP) — British and German air force fighter jets were scrambled to intercept a Russian aircraft flying close to Estonian airspace, the U.K. Defense Ministry said Wednesday, amid mounting concerns about confrontation in the skies near Russia and Ukraine.The U.K. and Germany are conducting joint air policing missions in Estonia as part of NATO efforts to bolster its eastern flank in response to Russia.The Typhoon jets responded Tuesday after a Russian air-to-air refueling aircraft failed to communicate with Estonian air traffic control, the U.K. ministry said. The Russian plane didn't enter the airspace of Estonia, a NATO member.British and German planes are patrolling together as part of the NATO Baltic Air Policing mission until the end of April.Wing Commander Scott Maccoll, Commander of the Royal Air Force's 140 Expeditionary Air Wing, said “it was great to see the U.K. and German elements operate as one team.”U.K. armed forces minister James Heappey said “this joint U.K. and German deployment in the Baltics clearly demonstrates our collective resolve to challenge any potential threat to NATO’s borders, whilst demonstrating our combined strength.”Such interceptions are routine —- even before Russia invaded Ukraine last year, NATO planes were involved in about 400 interceptions a year with Russian aircraft. Germany's Defense Ministry said Tuesday's incident was the 28th time Luftwaffe planes had scrambled since German forces were stationed in Estonia last summer.But the incident comes amid heightened tensions after a collision between a Russian jet and a U.S. drone over the Black Sea.Washington and Moscow gave conflicting accounts of Tuesday’s incident. The U.S. said a Russian Su-27 fighter jet struck the propeller of a MQ-9 Reaper drone, and U.S. forces had to bring down the unmanned craft. Russia said the drone crashed after making a “sharp maneuver.”The incident appeared to be the first time since the height of the Cold War that a U.S. aircraft was brought down after an encounter with a Russian warplane. It highlighted the risk of confrontation between Russia and the West amid the war in Ukraine.___Associated Press writer Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this story.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836458,Thai officials search for radioactive cylinder from plant,"BANGKOK (AP) — Authorities in Thailand expanded their search Wednesday for a metal cylinder with radioactive contents that has gone missing from a power plant, warning the public that it poses a danger to health.The 30-centimeter- (12-inch-) long cylinder containing the radioactive material Caesium-137 was discovered missing last Friday from a piece of machinery at a steam power plant in Prachinburi province, 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Bangkok.Ake Wongjinda, a public relations officer for the provincial government, said Wednesday that authorities have inspected locations such as junk shops, scrap metal yards and secondhand stores in Prachinburi and neighboring Chachoengsao province for the 25-kilogram- (55-pound-) cylinder.Health officials cautioned the public that prolonged direct contact with radioactive material can cause skin rashes, hair loss, canker sores, fatigue, and vomiting. They said short-term contact with Caesium-137 may not show immediate symptoms but could lead to a higher risk of cancer.Thongchai Keeratihuttayakorn, director-general of the Department of Medical Services, said Caesium-137 has similar physical characteristics to salt and can disperse easily if its container opened. He said it is used in devices such as ones measuring humidity or the velocity of liquids.The cylinder was connected to a 17-meter- (56-foot-) tall silo and used for measuring ash in the silo, said Permsuk Sutchaphiwat, secretary general of the Thailand’s Office of Atoms for Peace agency.Kittiphan Chitpentham, a representative of the National Power Supply Public Co., Ltd., the power station's owner, said it is not clear whether the cylinder had gone missing by accident. He said that the company would provide a 50,000 baht ($1,445) cash reward for anyone who can provide information about it. The company said it may have disappeared several weeks ago,In 2000, illegally disposed cannisters containing the radioactive substance Cobalt-60 were found in a junkyard in Samut Prakarn, a suburb of Bangkok. At least five people were hospitalized after being exposed to radiation when the cannisters were opened by the scrapyard workers, unaware of the hazard. The cylinders were belived to have come from a medical X-ray machine.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836470,Wisconsin Republicans propose abortion ban exceptions,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republicans who control the Wisconsin Legislature unveiled a bill Wednesday that would create rape and incest exceptions to the state’s 1849 abortion ban and clarify when abortions that protect the health of the mother would be allowed. But the bill would not return the same rights that were in place under Roe v. Wade.The measure drew immediate bipartisan opposition, however.Democratic lawmakers said its introduction was a cynical ploy to deceive voters just three weeks before a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court election. And Democratic Gov. Tony Evers promised a veto.“I won’t sign a bill that leaves Wisconsin women with fewer rights and freedoms than they had before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe,” Evers said.Republican Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu promised that the measure would not be taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate, noting Evers’ promise to veto it, saying: “This is not a topic to use as a political football.”The bill comes as a pending lawsuit supported by Evers seeks to overturn the ban entirely and return the law as it was before Roe v. Wade was overturned.Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that he hoped Democratic lawmakers and Evers would be open to clarifying the health of the mother exception and creating rape and incest exceptions for up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.“We are still proudly pro-life, but there are some things that are different than they were 175 years ago,” Vos told AP. “We wanted to put an idea forward that shows we are willing to be reasonable.”Democrats weren't interested.“Republicans are simply flailing after suffering unexpected defeat during last year’s midterm elections, in large part because of their draconian position on abortion access,"" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard said. ""The proposed legislation is misguided and wholly inadequate. They are sorely mistaken in their hopes that it will placate Wisconsin women.”The Republican bill would allow for abortions only in the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy for victims of rape or incest. It does not say how the determination would be made that a woman was the victim of rape or incest. The bill also does not put a time limit on ending pregnancies that would cause “a serious risk of death of the pregnant woman or of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman.”Republicans are also bringing back a bill that would allow pharmacists to dispense birth control. Bill sponsor Rep. Joel Kitchens said he saw it as a way to prevent more unwanted pregnancies. The Assembly passed the proposal last session, but it died in the Senate.Republicans and their anti-abortion allies, who suffered a series of defeats in ballot questions in states across the political spectrum last year, are tackling the issue nationwide in a variety of ways, including seeking exemptions.Evers made abortion a central issue in his winning reelection campaign, and it’s a key issue in a high stakes state Supreme Court race.Evers has twice called special sessions of the Legislature seeking to repeal the ban and create a way to put the question before voters. Republicans rejected both proposals within seconds, without any debate.Before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June, Wisconsin law allowed for abortions for any reason at 20 or more weeks post-fertilization, or 22 weeks after the last menstrual cycle.Under the current Wisconsin ban, first passed in 1849 and amended over the years, it is a felony to perform nearly all abortions.Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit just days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, leading to the old law being reinstated. He argues that a 1985 law allowing abortions up to the point of a fetus’ viability supersedes Wisconsin’s 174-year-old ban on nearly all abortions. The point of viability is unclear; some physicians say it’s about 20 weeks, others around 28 weeks.The lawsuit also argues that the ban is unenforceable because it has become obsolete. The ban was enacted before women had the right to vote and before the Civil War.The winner of the state Supreme Court race on April 4 will determine majority control of the court that will likely decide the lawsuit. Democratic-backed candidate Janet Protasiewicz is running as a supporter of abortion rights. Her opponent, conservative Dan Kelly, is backed by the state’s three top anti-abortion groups, all of which support keeping the ban in place.Polls have shown a wide majority of Wisconsin voters support keeping abortion legal and at the very least having rape and incest exceptions.Milwaukee, Dane and Sheboygan counties were the only places in Wisconsin where abortions were taking place before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Clinics stopped scheduling abortions after the court’s ruling.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836503,"Wizardry, warfare, Wii on ballot for World Video Game HOF","ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) — Wizardry, warfare and Wii are on the ballot as the World Video Game Hall of Fame narrows down its contenders for the class of 2023.The Hall of Fame on Wednesday announced 12 finalists that are being considered for induction in May. The games for consideration include Age of Empires, Angry Birds, Barbie Fashion Designer, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Computer Space, FIFA International Soccer, GoldenEye 007, The Last of Us, NBA 2K, Quake, Wii Sports and Wizardry.A panel of experts and the public will vote on the winners.“It’s always difficult to narrow the World Video Game Hall of Fame nominations down to just 12 finalists because there are so many games that have had an enormous influence on popular culture or the video game industry itself,"" said Jon-Paul C. Dyson, director of the The Strong's International Center for the History of Electronic Games in Rochester, where the hall is based.“This year’s finalists are some heavy-hitters,” he said.The Hall of Fame recognizes arcade, console, computer, handheld, and mobile games whose popularity has been far-reaching and influenced other games or society at large.Finalist FIFA International Soccer is the most popular sports game franchise of all time, according to the hall, and is a worldwide best-seller with updates every year from publisher Electronic Arts. And then there's Rovio’s Angry Birds, with 2 billion downloads, which is nominated for turning millions of smartphone users into gamers.The 1996 Barbie Fashion Designer game broke with the pattern of the industry marketing to male players; Wii Sports became a hit among older adults; and Nutting Associate’s coin-operated Computer Space from 1971 proved video games could exist outside of computer labs as the first commercial video game, according to the hall.The post-apocalyptic The Last of Us, released by Naughty Dog and Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2013, is now a hit TV show for HBO.Anyone can nominate a game for the hall. Thousands of nominations came in for consideration for this year's class, The Strong museum said.Fan voting is underway online through March 22 as part of what's called the ""Player’s Choice” ballot. The three games that receive the most public votes will form one ballot that will be counted alongside ballots submitted by members of an international committee of experts.The winners will be inducted in a virtual ceremony on May 4.",2023/3/15,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836512,"T-Mobile acquires Mint, partially owned by Ryan Reynolds","Mint Mobile, partly owned by actor Ryan Reynolds, is being acquired by T-Mobile as part of a cash-and-stock deal worth as much as $1.35 billion.T-Mobile's purchase of Ka’ena Corp. will give it access the budget wireless provider Mint, along with Ultra Mobile and wholesaler Plum. The brands, which already use T-Mobile for their network, will be run as a separate business unit.“I never dreamt I’d own a wireless company and I certainly never dreamt I’d sell it to T-Mobile."" Reynolds said in a tweet. “Life is strange and I’m incredibly proud and grateful.”The U.S. wireless carrier said Wednesday that it is acquiring the brands’ sales, marketing, digital and service operations. It plans to use its supplier relationships and distribution scale to help grow the brands and offer competitive pricing and greater device inventory to more U.S. consumers seeking low cost offerings.T-Mobile US Inc. said Mint and Ultra Mobile are complementary to its existing prepaid services, Metro by T-Mobile, T-Mobile branded prepaid and Connect by T-Mobile.T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said the company plans to give a boost to Mint's already successful digital direct-to-consumer business.“Over the long-term, we’ll also benefit from applying the marketing formula Mint has become famous for across more parts of T-Mobile,"" Sievert said. ""We think customers are really going to win with a more competitive and expansive Mint and Ultra.”Mint founders David Glickman and Rizwan Kassim will stay on at T-Mobile after the transaction is complete to manage the brands. Reynolds, meanwhile, will remain in his creative role for Mint.The actual price of the deal will depend on Ka’ena Corp.’s performance during certain periods before and after the closing. The transaction is targeted to close later this year.T-Mobile, based in Bellevue, Washington, became one of the country’s largest cellphone service carriers in 2020 after buying rival Sprint.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836513,Wisconsin man pleads guilty to role in Whitmer kidnap scheme,"BELLAIRE, Mich. (AP) — A Wisconsin man accused of assisting the key figures in a plot to kidnap Michigan's governor pleaded guilty Wednesday to a lesser charge and will cooperate with prosecutors.Brian Higgins said he attempted to provide material support for terrorism, a crime that carries a maximum prison term of five years. He drove past Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's second home in Antrim County in 2020 while allies waited across a lake for a signal from his laser-style device.Higgins was among five men scheduled to face trial later this year in northern Michigan. They were not charged in the kidnapping conspiracy but were accused of providing key support.The ragtag band of anti-government rebels was planning to eventually snatch the Democrat and trigger a civil war before the 2020 election, investigators said, but informants and undercover FBI agents were inside the group for months and helped break up the plot.Higgins, 54, admitted that he was on the night ride with a camera rigged to his pickup truck. Whitmer was not at the house at the time.“I wish to plead guilty,” Higgins told the judge, appearing in court by video from Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, where he has been free on bond.Prosecutors also had evidence that Higgins trained with key members of the conspiracy at a “kill house” on the same weekend as the ride to Elk Rapids.Fourteen people were charged in three different courts. The U.S. Justice Department secured convictions against four men in federal court, including leaders Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox, though two men were acquitted.Three men charged with aiding Fox were found guilty in Jackson County in October and are serving long prison terms.Higgins won't be sentenced by Judge Charles Hamlyn until after the August trial of his four co-defendants. His cooperation could improve his chances for a lighter sentence.“Anti-government extremism poses a threat to the safety of public officials, law enforcement officers and residents all across our state. ... We will keep fighting to deliver justice as the remaining prosecutions continue to play out,"" Attorney General Dana Nessel said.When the plot was foiled, Whitmer blamed then-President Donald Trump, saying he had given “comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.” Last August, after 19 months out of office, Trump said the kidnapping plan was a “fake deal.”___White reported from Detroit.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836514,Amtrak service between NYC and Montreal to resume in April,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amtrak service connecting New York City and Montreal will resume next month, more than two years after the pandemic halted trains from crossing across the shared border between the U.S. and Canada.The reopening of Amtrak's Adirondack line follows the resumption of trains last fall between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada, which was also shuttered because of COVID-19 worries. Last summer, Amtrak reopened full service on the Maple Leaf line, which links New York City and Ontario, Canada.It has been much tougher to relaunch service between New York and Montreal.“The Adirondack line’s yearslong closure has been economically harmful to many of the communities along its route,” said U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York.Towns and cities along the route, one of the most scenic corridors served by Amtrak, have depended on the train service to bring tourists into their communities, officials said.The Adirondack line had nearly 118,000 riders during the fiscal year before the pandemic, up by more than 5% from the year before, according to a statement jointly released by Gillibrand and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also of New York.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836515,Spain's unions back government public pension reform,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain's left-wing government won the backing of unions to reform the nation's public pension system on Wednesday, in stark contrast with neighboring France, where plans to raise the retirement age have led to waves of strikes and mass protests.The leaders of Spain’s two main labor unions, UGT and CC.OO., appeared alongside Minister of Social Security José Luis Escrivá in Madrid to christen the plan the union heads both deemed “historic.”CC.OO. secretary general Unai Sordo said that the reform would be key to ensuring pensions for Spain’s retired population which he said is expected to increase from 10 to 15 million people by 2048.“This is about maintaining a pillar of our social welfare system,” Sordo said.It is very different across the border in France, where labor unions on Wednesday held another round of massive street protests against the push by President Emmanuel Macron to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, a move that he says is necessary to sustain public pensions for the future.Spain, whose workers already must stay on the job until at least age 65 years, won’t be asked to work longer. Instead, the new deal signed off on by its unions will aim to handle a looming boom in the number of retired workers by increasing the social security costs on businesses for higher-wage earners.Spain has one of Europe’s fastest ageing populations and one of its highest rates of youth unemployment at around 30% — a cocktail that made tweaking its pension system a must.A reform of Spain’s social security system was one of the requirements established by the European Union for Spain to continue receiving billions of euros from its post-pandemic recovery funds. Escrivá won approval from Brussels to go ahead with the plan last week.“I want to congratulate the government and above all Minister Escrivá for their ability to negotiate with the European Union, because this is a deal that has Europe’s backing and that has enormous importance for our pensions,” said Pepe Álvarez, secretary general of UGT.Spain’s leading business groups have criticized the plan, saying it will hurt hiring by increasing the burden on companies.The plan will be given the go-ahead by Spain’s Cabinet on Thursday and then head to Parliament to become law. Its passing would be a much-needed boost for the coalition of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez ahead of local and regional elections in May and national elections in December, after recent spats between coalition members over the government's sexual consent law.Following the 2007-09 global recession that hit Spain hard, the government reformed public pensions so that workers could retire at age 65 if they had worked for 38.5 years. If not, they would have to wait until age 67.Spain’s average yearly salary is around 28,000 euros ($29,500), just below the EU average and well below the French average of 40,000 euros ($42,000).",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836516,German investigators take down crypto money laundering site,"BERLIN (AP) — German investigators said they took down a major online money laundering operation on Wednesday, seizing the Germany-based server infrastructure of a platform that dealt in ill-gotten cryptocurrency.Bitcoin currently worth about 44 million euros ($47 million) and roughly seven terabytes of data were secured as investigators took down the platform known as ChipMixer, Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office and Frankfurt prosecutors said. They added that they worked closely with U.S. authorities and the European Union's crime agency, Europol.ChipMixer was active on the darknet, a part of the internet accessible only through specialized tools that provide more anonymity. German investigators said it had offered its services since mid-2017 and had accepted cryptocurrency — largely bitcoin — of criminal origin which was put through a “mixing” process to disguise its origin.Cryptocurrency that was paid in was broken down into tiny amounts known as “chips,” and users' “chips” were blended together to hide where the money came from, investigators said. They added that ChipMixer promised its users complete anonymity.The platform is estimated to have laundered a total of about 154,000 bitcoin, or 2.8 billion euros. A significant part of that is believed to have come from darknet market places, fraudulently obtained cryptocurrency, ransomware groups and other crimes.German investigators said that the FBI is seeking the chief suspect, whom they didn't identify.",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836517,EU lawmakers ask UEFA to ban Belarus from Euro 2024,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A group of more than 100 European Union lawmakers is urging European soccer's governing body to ban Belarus from qualifying for the 2024 European Championship.MEPs from across the political spectrum wrote in a letter sent to UEFA president Alexander Ceferin that the Belarusian national team should not be able to compete because of the country's terrible human rights record.""These are not only UEFA values at stake, but also UEFA’s reputation and image within democratic societies and international community,"" they said.Last week, a court in Belarus sentenced exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to 15 years in prison after a trial in absentia on charges including conspiring to overthrow the government, the latest move in a months-long effort by the government to suppress dissent.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin in his war against Ukraine. Russia used Belarusian territory to send troops into Ukraine more than a year ago at the start of the war.Russia — which is already excluded from UEFA and FIFA competitions — has maintained troops and weapons in Belarus and the two countries have regularly conducted joint drills as part of their military alliance.This stance left Lukashenko even more isolated in Europe, where his country faces sanctions from the European Union for both its role in the war and his repression of domestic opposition.All Belarusian teams have been banned from hosting international soccer games and play home games in neutral countries, with no fans allowed to attend. But UEFA decided last year to let Belarus enter the Euro 2024 qualifying draw despite a government request from tournament-host Germany to remove the team because the country is a military ally of Russia.“The very fact of participating in UEFA Championship by the Belarusian national team will be later used by Lukashenko and his propaganda team to prove he is well-received in the international community,” the MEPs wrote in their letter Wednesday.""This would be an offense to the victims of the Russian aggression in Ukraine and to all the Belarusians who were forced to flee from their homeland as well as those who stayed in Belarus and now must live in fear and terror,"" they added.Belarus is set to start its qualifying campaign against Switzerland on March 25 in neutral Serbia, a decision that has caused some unease with the Swiss. Players with family roots in Kosovo and Albania — including Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri — could face a hostile reception in the city of Novi Sad.Israel, Romania, Andorra and Kosovo are also in the gorup.Most Olympic sports have excluded athletes from Russia and Belarus after Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. But fencing and judo have recently reopened access to athletes from the two countries ahead of qualifying events for the 2024 Paris Olympics.___AP Sports Writers Graham Dunbar in Geneva and James Ellingworth in Duesseldorf, Germany, contributed to this report.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

Energy and Mines Minister Irene Vélez said 10 people were unaccounted for.Six bodies had been recovered by searchers, while five others had been sighted, said Javier Pava, director of the state-run National Unit for Disaster Risk Management.Explosions and cave-ins are common in Colombia's coal mines.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836521,'Quantum Leap' star Caitlin Bassett jumps from Army to TV,"NEW YORK (AP) — Caitlin Bassett plays a woman who jumps through time and space on NBC's “Quantum Leap,” a fitting job for an actor who has lived many lives already.Bassett, who spent seven years in the U.S. Army, then attended law school and later acting school, now finds herself on a hit TV show, a multi-career path driven by her curiosity and heart.“I think part of growing up is owning what you want to do and trying it and being like, ‘If I fail, well, that’s on me. But at least I tried,’” says Bassett, 32.Bassett was an intelligence analyst in the Army, attaining the rank of staff sergeant, and completed three combat deployments — two to Afghanistan and one to Qatar. She is grateful to the military for all that it nurtured in her.“It gave experiences. It gave abilities. It gave discipline. It gave work ethic. It gave perspective. Like, at the end of the day, if no one’s dying, we’re having a good day,” she says.The new “Quantum Leap” takes place decades after the sci-fi classic left off. The first version starred Scott Bakula as a scientist who leapt between various bodies to help people solve a dilemma.In the sequel series, Raymond Lee plays the leaping scientist, and Bassett plays his guide, appearing during every leap as a hologram that only he can see and hear, revisiting the role played by Dean Stockwell.The first episode is set on the day of Live Aid in 1985, and the time-leaping scientist wakes up as the getaway driver of a bank-robbing crew. Bassett's character gives him historical context and teaches him skills, like how to drive a stick shift.In later episodes, he leaps into such predicaments as the cockpit of the space shuttle Atlantis in 1998, a boxing ring in Las Vegas in 1977 and into the body of a a female bounty hunter in 1981. Bassett's character has been given the appropriate background of a former military intelligence officer.Bassett was too young to catch the original series when it aired from 1989-1993 but her parents and older siblings were fans. She admits she was terrified to revisit such a popular show.“In the age of reboots and sequels, nobody wants to mess up beloved things. At no point did I get into acting to really do a bad job,” she says.The revival has been a hit, and NBC has ordered a second season. Bassett sees it as a sort of empathy machine — a weekly advertisement to try to understand other people.“You literally are always having to learn what it’s like to be someone else in their toughest moments, which often are their most defining and most formative in their lives,” she says.“Quantum Leap” executive producer and showrunner Martin Gero says what you see with Bassett is what you get and calls her a “once-in-a-lifetime discovery.”“There’s really very little artifice there. She’s an incredible person,” he says. “To be catapulted into such a massive part on a massive franchise like this is pretty unbelievable and speaks to her very unique and singular ability.”Bassett was raised in Baltimore and comes from a military family. Her father served in Vietnam, and her grandfather served in World War II. She joined the military shortly after graduating high school at 18.“I originally wanted to be a medic, actually, but I tested very highly and I actually got kind of talked into intelligence,” she says. “I’m so grateful I did because I got to peek behind the curtain of how the world works that I never would have gotten working in a medical field.”After her military service ended, Bassett moved to New York, where she attended Brooklyn Law School for two years before deciding to pursue acting full time and getting accepted to the prestigious Stella Adler Studio of Acting, graduating in 2020.“Acting was always something that I had wanted to do, but it just felt like life hadn’t created that opportunity. And then when I was in law school in New York, I saw my life once again taking a direction,” she says. “So I left law school for theater school.”“Quantum Leap” represents Bassett's first big professional job and she hopes the sequel can have the same power as the original in these days of fragmented audiences.“It can hopefully do what the original did which was bring families together,” she says. “It’s an opportunity for multiple generations to watch a show and say, ‘Oh, I was there when this was happening’ or ‘I loved in the original when they did this.’”___ Follow Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836522,Officials: 2 men arrested in burglary of Salah's Cairo home,"CAIRO (AP) — Two men were arrested on suspicion of burglarizing Mohamed Salah's Cairo villa earlier this month while the Egyptian soccer star was out of the country, authorities said Wednesday.In a statement, Egypt's Interior Ministry said the suspects stole several pairs of soccer cleats, a medal, a small crystal ball and cable TV receivers from the Liverpool forward's luxury villa. The home is situated in the upmarket area of Tagamoa, 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Cairo’s center.It was not immediately clear whether the two men were charged with a crime or had legal representation. Their identities were not disclosed.Authorities said both men confessed to entering the empty property by climbing over the villa's rear wall on March 2. Authorities were notified of the break-in by the player’s agent on Sunday and the men were arrested less than 48 hours later, it said.One of the accused had previously worked as a security guard in the neighborhood and was aware the villa was vacant, the ministry said. All of the stolen goods have been returned, the ministry saidPolice officials previously told The Associated Press that only TV cable receivers were taken from the house.Salah is Liverpool’s record all-time Premier League goal scorer and spends much of the year in England. He joined Liverpool in 2018 from Roma. Salah hails from the Nile Delta town of Nagrig.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/15,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836523,Florida man guilty in 2019 fatal shooting of 5 women at bank,"ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has pleaded guilty to fatally shooting five women at a small-town bank branch in 2019 and will face either life in prison or a death sentence during the penalty phase next year.Court records show 25-year-old Zephen Xaver entered guilty pleas Tuesday to five counts of first-degree murder. He had previously pleaded not guilty, with a trial initially set for January in Sebring, located about 84 miles (135 kilometers) southeast of Tampa.Now, a Highlands County judge has set the penalty portion of the case to begin Jan. 16, 2024.Xaver admitted shooting four employees of a SunTrust Bank branch and one customer on Jan. 23, 2019. All five female victims were ordered to lie on the floor and then were shot one by one, investigators said. They added that robbery did not appear to be a motive and that Xaver had no connection to the victims.""“We believe it was a random act,” Sebring Police Chief Karl Hoglund said shortly after the slayings. “Aside from perhaps driving by and seeing it was a bank, we have no known evidence that he targeted this bank for any particular reason.”Investigators said Xaver called 911 from the bank and told a dispatcher what he had done, then refused to come out of the bank building when heavily-armed police arrived. After a two-hour standoff, Xaver finally surrendered and was taken into custody where he has remained ever since.The four SunTrust employees slain that day were Ana Piñon-Williams, Debra Cook, Marisol Lopez and Jessica Montague. The customer who died was Cynthia Watson. Police said one employee who was in a back break room escaped the carnage.There were troubling signs that Xaver, who previously lived in Indiana, was fascinated with guns and killing people. A former girlfriend said after the killings that Xaver described having dreams while still in high school of hurting other students.“He got kicked out of school for having a dream that he killed everybody in his class, and he's been threatening this for so long, and he's been having dreams about it and everything,” the ex-girlfriend, Alex Gerlach, said after the Florida killings.School officials in Bremen, Indiana, contacted police in 2014 after Xaver reported the dream and his mother agreed to take him to a behavioral health center, according to police records. No other action was taken. Police in Michigan released information about a 2017 incident in which he was messaging a girl in that state about “possibly thinking of suicide by cop and taking hostages.”Prior to the shootings, Xaver trained for about two months to be a correctional officer at the nearby Avon Park Correctional Institution. He resigned two weeks before the bank killings.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836524,Fickell eager to build upon Wisconsin's winning culture,"New coaches often spend their first several months dwelling on the need to instill a different culture into their programs.Consider Wisconsin’s Luke Fickell an exception.Fickell says the Badgers already have what he calls a “really good footprint,” something backed up by Wisconsin's 21 consecutive bowl appearances. He just wants to find ways to boost it as the former Cincinnati coach prepares to start his first spring practice at Wisconsin on March 25.“Sometimes the biggest mistake you can do is you go into a place thinking you’re just going to completely change the culture,” Fickell told The Associated Press in an interview. “You can enhance and do things the way you want to do them, but I think by nature a lot of places have unique cultures, especially here, that have been kind of bred for a long time.”Fickell believes the lack of rampant roster turnover following a tumultuous coaching transition offers testament to that culture.Wisconsin fired Paul Chryst on Oct. 2, a day after a 34-10 home loss to Illinois. Athletic director Chris McIntosh hired Fickell after many players had called for popular defensive coordinator and interim head coach Jim Leonhard to get the job.Yet the Badgers didn’t lose many major contributors to the transfer portal aside from three-year starting quarterback Graham Mertz, now at Florida. Offensive lineman Michael Furtney and wide receiver Markus Allen entered the transfer portal but then decided to stay.Most notably, Wisconsin managed to hang on to two-time 1,200-yard rusher Braelon Allen. Fickell said he reached out to Wisconsin’s current players by reminding them why they signed there in the first place.“I kind of sold it as just because I’m new, just because you don’t know me, trust and believe that the things that brought you here and the things that have kept you here so far are the same things that are going to be what you love when you finish up here,” Fickell said.But there will be notable differences under Fickell, who went 57-18 at Cincinnati and led the Bearcats to a College Football Playoff appearance in 2021.Those changes should be most apparent on offense.New offensive coordinator Phil Longo ran a variation of an Air Raid attack during his four seasons in the same position at North Carolina and intends to bring some of that to Wisconsin. Although Longo has said running the ball will remain a priority, his arrival represents a dramatic shift for a program known for its ball-control offenses.“It will be a different tempo and pace to what they’ve seen maybe offensively here for a while,” Fickell said. “But when you really go to study it, it’s still going to be about being physical. It’s still going to be about being able to run the football and control the line of scrimmage.”There also are plenty of new faces.Since Fickell’s arrival, Wisconsin has added 15 transfers, including two walk-ons. Tanner Mordecai, who threw a school-record 72 career touchdown passes at SMU, is one of three quarterback transfers on Wisconsin’s roster.Fickell says he would prefer to take no more than three or four transfers per year moving forward. He noted that most of his incoming transfers have at least three more years of eligibility, giving the new staff more of a chance to develop them.“I would not want to be in the transfer quarterback world,” Fickell said. “I just don’t think that’s the way you continue to sustain and build a program. Obviously we took three of them this year. We had low numbers in that room, so we had to do it.""Wisconsin reached the Rose Bowl as recently as the 2019 season but hasn’t won a Big Ten title since 2012 and has gone 20-13 over the last three seasons, including a 7-6 mark last year. That’s a step back for a program that played in six of the first nine Big Ten championship games and won the first two.Perhaps a new approach can prove beneficial.“The footprint’s there, but it just gets a little bit faded at times,” Fickell said. “Sometimes that’s when change isn’t bad. I told my own son (Cincinnati offensive lineman Landon Fickell) that as I left Cincinnati. I said: ‘The culture is embedded here. Someone’s going to come in and adapt and adjust things a little bit. In some ways, that can give you a chance to be greater.'“I feel the same way here. Recognize the things that are really, really good and then make sure that you can enhance the things that you know are important for what you want to do and how you want to do them.”___AP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/college-football and https://twitter.com/ap_top25",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836525,"Brazil reintroduces visa requirement for US tourists, others","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil is reintroducing the requirement to obtain tourist visas for citizens of the U.S., Australia, Canada, and Japan starting Oct. 1, the foreign ministry said.Former president Jair Bolsonaro had scrapped the visa requirements in 2019 to bolster the country’s tourism industry, but the four countries continued to demand visas from Brazilians.The decision to grant the visa exemptions had represented “a break with the pattern of Brazilian migration policy, historically based on the principles of reciprocity and equal treatment,” the foreign ministry said in a statement released quietly late Monday.“Brazil does not grant unilateral exemption from visiting visas, without reciprocity, to other countries,” the ministry said, while noting that the government is ready to negotiate visa waiver agreements on a reciprocal basis.Bolsonaro criticized the decision last week after the news outlet G1 first reported the upcoming change. “Another revocation by Lula. Less jobs and less stimulus of the hotel sector,” he said on Twitter.Unilateral decisions like the one made by Bolsonaro are rare in diplomacy, according to Leonardo Paz, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank. Its reversal is part of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s ambition to reaffirm its foreign policy, an area neglected under Bolsonaro, Paz said.Still, representatives of the tourism industry were critical of the move.The chief executive of one of Rio de Janeiro’s top tourist attractions, the cable cars on Sugar Loaf Mountain, criticized the decision. Sandro Fernandes told Folhapress before the official announcement that the decision would be a “setback.”“Instead of closing the door to four nationalities, we should be discussing which are the next four to release visa exemptions. And then four more. This should be the government’s agenda,” Fernandes said.Before the pandemic hit, Brazil received 6.4 million tourists in 2019, far below Mexico’s 45 million and less than Argentina’s 7.4 million, according to data from the United Nation’s World Tourism Organization.Data from Brazil’s tourism ministry indicates that entries of Americans, Australians, Canadians and Japanese people fell between 2019 and 2021, but the pandemic caused the global tourism industry to grind almost to standstill and is largely responsible for the drop.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836591,How NATO sees the recent Russian jet incidents,"After an American drone was forced down by a Russian jet in the Black Sea earlier this week, British and German fighter jets policing Estonian airspace as part of a NATO mission also intercepted a Russian aircraft as it approached the Baltic nation on Tuesday.While there is no direct link between incidents involving the two Russian jets this week, they have magnified the yearlong tensions between the West and the Kremlin over the war in Ukraine.The US has said that the Russian fighter jet's action in striking the propeller of the American surveillance drone is a ""brazen violation of international law."" The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, responded rather tartly that there was no reason for US military aircraft and warships to be near Russia's borders.Meanwhile, the incident near Estonia's airspace in which the two Western jets — one from the RAF's 140 Expeditionary Air Wing and the other from the German 71 Tactical Air Wing Richthofen —  intercepted the Russian plane has been described as ""a routine NATO mission"" by the British Royal Air Force (RAF).The RAF and German Air Force have been conducting joint NATO air policing in Estonia as a part of the military alliance's strategy to fortify its eastern flank amid heightened tensions with Russia.""NATO continues to form the bedrock of our collective security. This joint UK and German deployment in the Baltics clearly demonstrates our collective resolve whilst demonstrating our combined strength,"" James Heappey, the UK's minister of state for the armed forces, said in a statement.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to take part in a virtual Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting hosted by the US secretary of defense on March 15, has not yet commented on the Russian jet incidents.Bruno Lete, a senior fellow focusing on security and defense at The German Marshall Fund of the United States in Brussels, however told DW that NATO will remain cautious.""When it comes to the incident with the American drone, it will remain as a dialogue between the US and Russia, and NATO will not get involved, since it is a case between a US drone and Russian jet. Even though this was an act of aggression by the Russian jet, this is gray-zone aggression for NATO and it won't trigger Article 5 — a NATO collective defense treaty where an attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all NATO allies,"" he said.""The incident near Estonian airspace is a violation of the sovereign airspace of NATO member states, since the alliance is in charge of air policing this region. But NATO will remain cautious and pursue a strategy that avoids direct conflict or war with Russia,"" he added.Over the past few years, Russian jets have regularly been intercepted by NATO jets, causing the alliance to bolster its air policing along its frontiers with Russia.""Russia is constantly testing NATO and its abilities on its eastern flank, in the Atlantic Ocean and in the high north in the Arctic because  Russia is keen to understand NATO's military capacity. This is the reason for so many Russian incursions,"" Lete said.Speaking at a press conference to mark Estonia's Independence Day on February 24 this year, NATO's Stoltenberg expressed a similar view and recalled that since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, NATO has significantly reinforced its presence from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea.But according to Lete, while the recent US-Russia jet incident will remain an issue just between the two countries, it will push NATO to ramp up its presence in the Black Sea even further.""NATO is very much aware that its presence in the Black Sea — which lies between Europe and Asia and is bordered by Russia and Ukraine, among other countries —  is underdeveloped, compared to its presence in the Baltic region. While the alliance is trying to fortify its presence, the NATO Black Sea strategy still needs bigger reinforcement. We cannot allow the Black Sea to become a Russian lake,"" he said.In November, NATO's Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana voiced a similar view, highlighting that for more than two decades the Black Sea region had been a launch pad for Russia’s aggressive actions.“This is why we reaffirm the strategic importance of the Black Sea region in NATO's new Strategic Concept that our leaders endorsed in Madrid at the summit last June,"" he said ahead of a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Romania last year.Ever since the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, joined NATO in 2004, the military alliance has been protecting their skies, and when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, NATO air policing over the Baltics, which border Russia, was enhanced.""Russia has regularly tried to test NATO's readiness and response capacity especially over the Baltics as we saw over Estonia this week. So through NATO's Baltic Air policing, there are jet fighters from different NATO members in the Baltics and elswehere in NATO territory, and each time Russia violates the alliance's airspace, NATO is well-prepared to react,"" Lete said.Edited by: Timothy Jones",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836592,Poland: John Paul II abuse cover-up claims divide a nation,"The private Polish television channel TVN24 has been reporting for years about child abuse in the Catholic Church in Poland and about attempts to sweep the scandals under the carpet. The latest program in the series, broadcast just a week ago, has really stirred up a hornets' nest.The journalists behind the documentary provided what they say is evidence that Pope John Paul II knew of cases of abuse but did not take sufficient action against the abusers.Born Karol Wojtyla in 1920, he is often referred to as the ""Polish pope."" John Paul II is viewed as a national hero in his native Poland, not just because he became head of the Catholic Church and the first non-Italian pope since the sixteenth century, but also because of his strong opposition to Communism. He died in 2005 and was canonized in 2014.Indeed, so great is his influence in Poland that the people who consider John Paul II to be their lodestar and point of reference and have been shaping politics and culture in Poland since the collapse of the Iron Curtain are even referred to as the ""JP2 generation.""The period under scrutiny in the TVN24 documentary was the 1960s and 1970s, when Karol Wojtyla was Archbishop of Krakow, in other words before he was elected pope in 1978.The documentary focused on the cases of three priests who sexually abused minors and then — in some cases after serving prison sentences — were allowed to continue working as priests. In one case, the priest in question, who also worked as an informant for the communist secret service, was transferred to Austria.Several of the victims spoke in the documentary, most of them anonymously. One of the victims claimed that he told Wojtyla about sexual abuse by one priest as far back as 1973. He says that the archbishop asked him not to say any more about it.Some in Poland have said that the allegations should lead to a reassessment of John Paul II's legacy. Members of the opposition alliance The Left have even called for his name to be removed from public spaces, including schools and kindergartens named after him.Poland's ruling conservative political alliance, the United Right, has seized the opportunity presented by the documentary to divert attention away from its own problems. The Law and Justice party (PiS) — the largest party in the alliance — is under considerable pressure because of rising prices and several corruption scandals.Coming just six months before parliamentary elections in Poland, the criticism of the popular pontiff is like manna from heaven for the government.The government's response was swift and strongly worded: Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called the accusations ""an attempt to trigger a culture war in Poland."" Culture Minister Piotr Glinski went so far as to say that ""an attack on the pope is an attack on Poland.""The current Archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jedraszewski, sang a very similar tune, speaking of a ""second assassination attempt on John Paul II."" This was a reference to the fact that John Paul II was seriously injured by a gunman in the Vatican in May 1981.The PiS reacted swiftly by drafting a resolution for the parliament to ""defend the good name of Saint John Paul II."" The resolution read: ""The Sejm [lower house of the Polish parliament] …strongly condemns the shameful media campaign, based largely on the materials of the communist apparatus of violence, whose object is the Great Pope — Saint John Paul II, the greatest Pole in history.""The PiS parliamentary party dismissed the documents shown in the TVN24 report as having been ""fabricated by the Communists"" and held up images of the deceased pope in the chamber during the debate. The resolution was passed by a large majority, with some members of the opposition voting with the PiS.Speaker of the parliament Elzbieta Witek (PiS) also waded into the debate. ""John Paul II is our identity, our foundation and our bond. The Communists knew this perfectly well and that's why they sought to destroy him while he was alive. Today, their heirs are doing it after his death,"" she said in a televised address last Thursday. Witek went on to say that Pope John Paul II was ""a beacon of freedom"" for Poles.In reality, the documents from the communist secret service, which are archived in the Institute of National Remembrance, IPN, are only part of the papers presented as evidence in the documentary. Court and Church records as well as victim statements also featured prominently in the program.""The PiS is cynically using John Paul II as a means of holding onto power. The party assumes that it will mobilize its voters with this religious war, thereby securing a third term in power,"" said Justyna Dobrosz-Oracz of the Polish daily newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza.Yet the dispute about the accusations against John Paul II transcends the usual left-right political divide. Icon of Poland's liberal opposition and editor-in-chief of Gazeta Wyborcza Adam Michnik has called on people not to reduce the pope to the clerical sex abuse scandal.The former civil rights activist, who declared himself in favor of an alliance between the Church and the left-wing laity in the 1970s, recalled the late pope's contribution to the defeat of the communist dictatorship and his commitment to Poland joining the European Union. ""Wojtyla was a child of his era. What is a matter of course for us today was not a matter of course 40 years ago,"" said Michnik, even before the TVN24 documentary was aired.Even Pope Francis, the current head of the Catholic Church, has called for understanding. ""You have to put things in the context of the era. [...] At that time everything was covered up. […] It was only when the Boston scandal broke that the Church began to look at the problem,"" said the pope in a recent interview with the Argentine newspaper La Nacion.In a first response to the documentary, the Polish Bishops' Conference declared that ""further archival research"" would be needed to arrive at a just evaluation of the decisions and actions of Karol Wojtyla.It then announced yesterday that it had unanimously decided to put together ""a team of independent specialists to search state and Church archives to shed light on cases of the sexual abuse of minors by some clerics."" It stressed that the report would focus on all dioceses and religious orders in Poland.Adapted from the German by Aingeal Flanagan",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836593,Gianni Infantino: FIFA boss with a flair for opportunity,"DW looks at the chronology of Gianni Infantino's rise to become the most powerful man in the world of soccer.March 23, 1970: Gianni Infantino is born in Brig in the southern Swiss canton of Valais. He is the third child of Maria and Vincenzo Infantino, who came to Switzerland as Italian guest workers. Infantino holds Swiss and Italian citizenship.August 2000: After graduating from high school, studying law at the University of Fribourg in the west of Switzerland and his first professional stations as a lawyer, Infantino starts working for the European soccer association UEFA.January 2004: Infantino is promoted to director of legal and club licensing.October 2009: Infantino, considered a protege of then UEFA President Michel Platini, becomes general secretary, making him the second most powerful man in the association. Infantino, who speaks six languages, becomes known to the wider soccer public for his eloquent hosting of the Champions League and European Championship draws.July 2015: In the wake of the FIFA corruption scandal, Infantino becomes a member of a 13-member committee tasked with initiating reforms in the world governing body.October 2015: UEFA President Platini and Joseph Blatter, president of FIFA, are suspended from their posts and later banned for several years over an ominous million-dollar payment made by Blatter to Platini in 2011. Shortly before the deadline, Infantino applied to succeed Blatter as FIFA chief on October 25. ""I can't just sit and watch FIFA destroy itself,"" says the UEFA general secretary. Platini had actually wanted to succeed Blatter, Infantino was only seen as a stopgap solution.February 26, 2016: At the FIFA Congress in Zurich, Infantino is elected as the new president of the world governing body. In the second round of voting, he receives the majority of votes and prevails over the favored Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa from Bahrain. ""I want to work with them all to restore and rebuild FIFA,"" Infantino promises the delegates at the congress.August 2016: FIFA's ethics committee closes investigations into Infantino. Critics had accused him, among other things, of squandering FIFA funds.January 2017: The newly formed FIFA Council approves the expansion of the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams, starting with the 2026 World Cup, as advocated by Infantino.May 2017: Ahead of the FIFA Congress in Bahrain, the FIFA Council chaired by FIFA President Gianni Infantino removes the two chairmen of the FIFA Ethics Committee, Hans-Joachim Eckert and Cornel Borbely, and other members without giving reasons.March 2018: Infantino informs the FIFA Council about an offer from a financial consortium from the Middle East and Asia. The investors reportedly want to buy two FIFA competitions for around 25 billion U.S. dollars (just over 20 billion euros): first, the Club World Cup, which is to be reformed beforehand, and second, a global Nations League. This plan of Infantino's later comes to nothing.August 2018: A new FIFA Code of Ethics is adopted. The word ""corruption"" is missing, and a statute of limitations is introduced for corresponding offenses.June 2019: At the FIFA Congress in Paris, Infantino is confirmed as president of the organization for another four years by acclamation, i.e. without being elected. 197 of 211 associations had previously approved this procedure.January 2020: Infantino is elected to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).July 2020: The Swiss public prosecutor's office opens criminal proceedings against Infantino. It accuses him of inciting abuse of office by meeting secretly with the head of the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, Michael Lauber. In August 2020, the FIFA Ethics Committee stops its investigation into the matter due to a lack of credible evidence.September 2021: Infantino's plan to organize World Cups every two years instead of every four years become known.November 2021: Former UEFA president Platini reports Infantino to the French judiciary. He accuses his former friend of plotting against him before the election of the FIFA president in February 2016.January 2022: FIFA confirms press reports that Infantino has had a second home in the World Cup host country of Qatar since the fall of 2021.

This means that his re-election at the FIFA Congress in March in Rwanda's capital Kigali is set to be unopposed.Ahead of the World Cup kickoff in Qatar, Infantino gives a bizarre-looking press conference. ""Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel like a migrant worker. I feel like them because I know what it feels like to be discriminated, to be bullied as a foreigner in a country.""FIFA then went on to ban Germany and other participants from wearing the ""One Love"" captain's armband at the World Cup. ""Football is played on the soccer field. Everyone can express their opinion, but when you enter the pitch, we have to respect soccer,"" Infantino said later.March 2023: The Swiss Attorney General's Office drops investigations against Infantino. The matter concerned the use of a private plane in 2017 to get from Suriname to Geneva. The authorities have said that everything was done by the book. However, the investigations into the secret meetings with ex-Federal Prosecutor Lauber continue, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said.This article was translated from German",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836594,Ukraine hails early 'victory' over Russia in Eurobond case,"The UK Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that Ukraine can mount a defense against a Eurobond lawsuit brought by Russia.Judges in London rejected a bid by a Russian-backed investment trust to throw out Ukraine's case — that it had to accept the money in the face of Russian aggression.The lawsuit was brought in 2016 and long predates Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It centers on billions of dollars borrowed from Moscow by pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, months before he was toppled in a popular uprising in February 2014 and shortly before Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.The court decision hinged on Ukraine's assertion that Moscow's threats of military force amounted to illegitimate pressure on Ukraine to assume the $3 billion (€2.8 billion) debt in 2013. The ruling allows Ukraine to stave off any further repayments.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed a ""decisive victory"" against Russia in the UK Supreme Court.""Today Ukraine secured another decisive victory against the aggressor,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter. ""The Court has ruled that Ukraine's defense based on Russia's threats of aggression will have a full public trial. Justice will be ours.""Other Ukrainian officials also celebrated the court's decision. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal called it a ""victory of justice and the rule of law"" on Twitter, while Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted about ""great news in the legal arena.""""The case will now go back into the merits, and we will persist in defending our position,"" Kuleba said.Ukraine says the debt was procured by duress, including unlawful trade measures to deter the country from signing an association agreement with the European Union and threats to its territory.Lawyers representing Russia had told the court in 2019 that the ""geopolitical dispute"" between Ukraine and Russia at the time of the contract had nothing to do with whether the debt was enforceable.A lower court in the UK had endorsed Russia's attempt to throw out the Ukrainian defense. But that was overturned on appeal, and a panel of five judges on the Supreme Court unanimously sided with Kyiv, agreeing with the appeals court that Ukraine has ""an arguable and justiciable defense of duress"".Now the Eurobond case will now go to a full public trial. No trial date has been set yet.""The success of Ukraine's defense turns on whether it can establish that Russia threatened the use of force and that those threats were a reason for Ukraine's decision to enter into the agreement,"" Judge Robert Reed, the court's president, said when announcing its decision.""That question can only be determined after trial,"" he added.Reed also said the appeal ""was heard before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year and neither party has argued that the invasion is of any relevance to our decision"".dh/rc (AFP, Reuters)",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836595,HRW says thousands of Afghan evacuees 'locked up' in UAE,"The rights group Human Rights Watch(HRW)  on Wednesday said between 2,400 and 2,700 Afghans who fled the country after the Taliban takeover were being detained in ""prison-like"" conditions in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).The evacuees have been waiting to be relocated to other countries for more than 15 months after being housed in the ""Emirates Humanitarian City.""At the request of the United States, UAE had agreed to temporarily host the Afghan refugees in makeshift refugee housing.According to a UAE official, the country had hosted more than 17,000 refugees, around 87% of whom were successfully resettled.But the HRW says the remaining thousands did not qualify and were living in ""arbitrary detention."" The rights group further added that Emirati authorities are not following the international and United Nations guidelines for immigrants and refugees.They have been ""locked up for over 15 months in cramped, miserable conditions with no hope of progress on their cases"", stated Joey Shea, an HRW researcher in UAE.Several of the residents of the Emirates Humanitarian City are suffering from mental health issues, the HRW report said.The Afghan refugees also do not have access to move freely or to legal counsel. They are under constant surveillance and have limited educational services for their children.The inhabitants of the facility are also facing issues of ""overcrowding, decay of infrastructure, and insect infestations"", the rights group stated.A refugee told HRW that:  ""The camp is exactly like a prison.""HRW allegations of crippling conditions in the camp were dismissed by a UAE official, who refused to reveal his identity. He told AFP that ""high-quality housing, sanitation, health, clinical, counseling, education, and food services"" were being provided to the refugees.He further said that UAE was still working with the US embassy to relocate the refugees ""in a timely manner.""""We understand that there are frustrations and this has taken longer than intended to complete,"" he added.The US authorities responsible for the resettlement of Afghans told HRW that they have an ""enduring"" commitment to relocate Afghans, including the residents of the Emirate Humanitarian City.",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836596,Germany hosts Israel's prime minister in tense times,"It was meant to be a celebratory anniversary. But German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier got unusually political, and critical, in remarks for the 50th anniversary of the founding of Israel's University of Haifa last week.He spoke of an ""escalation in hate and violence"" in recent months, in light of the Israeli government's ""planned restructuring of its rule of law.""Steinmeier, who served twice as foreign minister in the last 20 years, noted how Germans ""have always been in awe of the strengths and vibrant nature of Israel's rule of law, precisely because we know how important these strengths and this vibrancy is in the region.""Steinmeier's counterpart, Israel's President Isaac Herzog, was standing at his side. The 62-year old, whom Steinmeier called a ""friend and colleague"" and credited as a ""smart and balancing voice in Israeli debate,"" has served in that role since 2021. He is one of the most high-profile checks on the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu, for which he finds himself under political pressure.The Israeli government's planned justice reform would radically alter the country's democratic character. If implemented, it would allow the Knesset, Israel's parliament, to overrule supreme court decisions. The bill is currently making its way through the legislative process.There has never been such open criticism of Israel by German officials. There was no state visit to Jerusalem during the presidency of Moshe Katzav, whose term that started in 2000 ended in 2007 when he resigned following accusations of sexual assault. And Germany has steered clear of weighing in on Israeli domestic politics, including its occupation of Palestinian territories.The German-Israeli relationship is unlike other bilateral relationships, given the shadow of the Holocaust — which ended three years before Israel came into existence — that hangs over it. The two countries established formal ties in 1965, and the relationship has evolved since, most recently with a German-Israeli youth initiative founded last summer.David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, was a major proponent of seeing ""another Germany."" He and Germany's first postwar chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, met twice — in 1960 and 1966. Their interaction always came across as warm, albeit distant. Talks between the two countries were already underway in 1952: first regarding reparations, with Israel standing in as the representative of the six million Jews whom Nazi Germany murdered, and many more Holocaust victims; more secretly, the two sides discussed German weapons deliveries to the newly established Israeli state.Growing tensions in the region helped lead to full relations in 1965. They were met with a skeptical Israeli public, however. Germany's first ambassador to Israel was met with protests.Joint ceremonies and state visits helped smooth things over. Helmut Kohl made two trips to Israel in his 16 years as chancellor. Angela Merkel, who served about as long, went eight times. One of her final trips before leaving office included Israel, in October 2021.""That today we are bound by friendly ties is an invaluable gift — and an improbable one given our history,"" Merkel said in 2018.Merkel's successor, Olaf Scholz, made his first trip in March 2022. The visit was overshadowed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began just weeks earlier. Israel has remained largely on the sidelines.Of course, this is not Israel's first brush with far-right politics. Netanyahu has been prime minister multiple times, largely during the Merkel years. During that period, she traveled to Jerusalem less frequently. In 2017, bilateral consultations to take place in Jerusalem were postponed. They instead took place alongside celebrations for Israel's 70th anniversary, in 2018.Germany's chancellors, in particular Merkel, have never missed an opportunity to emphasize Israel's right to exist. At the same time, German officials have spoken out against Israeli occupation policy, including its expansion of settlements, which they say increases tensions and jeopardizes a two-state solution between Israel and Palestinians.Merkel's address to the Knesset in 2008 was a particular high point in relations — and particularly emotional for those Israeli lawmakers with a connection to the Holocaust listening to remarks delivered in German.""Every chancellor before me was committed to Germany's special historical responsibility for Israel's security,"" she said. ""This historical responsibility is part of my country's raison d'etat. That means Israel's security is never negotiable for me as German chancellor.""Speaking from Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum and memorial in Jerusalem, Scholz followed up his predecessor: ""You can count on Germany always standing firmly on Israel's side.""After talks with his counterpart, then Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, Scholz announced an upcoming invitation to his entire cabinet for bilateral consultations in Berlin.From the first consultations in 2008, in Jerusalem, six more rounds took place by 2018 — split equally between Berlin and Jerusalem. Since then, however, such large-scale meetings between the two sides have become more difficult to pull off, due to the increasing extremism expressed by shaky Israeli governing coalitions.While Scholz extended his congratulations to Netanyahu when he again became prime minister at the end of 2022 and highlighted the countries' close relationship, his government had new doubts over the far-right composition of the parties that put Netanyahu in power. In addition to the justice reform bill, Israel's new leadership has expressed interest in reviving the death penalty and expanding settlements on Palestinian territory.The German government spokesperson, Steffen Hebestreit, has used news conferences to reiterate Germany's support for a two-state solution. Cabinet ministers have also joined in the criticism, calling issues at hand a matter of ""safeguarding liberal democracy,"" as Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said during a visit to Israel. He warned of ""dangers to the rule of law.""Such criticism from the German side is rare, which Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock added to when her Israeli counterpart visited Berlin.""I will not hide the fact that we are worried from abroad,"" Baerbock said, adding that a strong democracy needs ""an independent judiciary that can also review majority decisions.""The remarks came at a time when tens of thousands of Israelis were marching against the justice reform. Baerbock backed them by pointing out that fundamental rights are ""by their very nature minority rights.""Now, Netanyahu himself is coming to Berlin for what may be a tense visit and a new chapter in German-Israeli relations. He is expected to bring criticism of his own, possibly in regard to an alarming rise in antisemitism in Germany. At the same time, Netanyahu faces a corruption trial back home, which Israel's attorney general has called a conflict of interest while his government is pushing for judicial reforms.The two government leaders may give a joint statement in the chancellery, exactly where Scholz and Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, did in August. It was then that the de facto leader of the Palestinian people compared Israel's abuses to the Holocaust. Scholz was heavily criticized for his slow response to the comment, which he eventually called a ""lapse in judgment.""This article was originally written in German.",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836597,Ukraine: Indian medical students return to war-torn country,"Attending classes amidst air sirens has become a part of life for Sonu Sharma, a 23-year-old student at the National Medical University in Kharkiv, a city in northeast Ukraine that has been badly hit by the ongoing war.Sharma told DW that it was the pursuit of his career that made him take one of the toughest decisions of his life. ""I had three options,"" he said. ""Either I drop medicine or transfer to another university in a different country, which will cost a lot of money. Or I go back to Ukraine.""In December, he went for the third option to continue his fourth year of medicine. But it is not easy: ""This is like hell. I don't know what will happen to me the next minute. But I am doing this for my career.""After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the Indian government put Operation Ganga into effect, evacuating around 22,500 Indian nationals from Ukraine via neighboring countries on over 90 flights. Around 20,000 of those evacuated were students, and the large majority were studying medicine.Many have yet to find a stable situation over a year later. Thousands were able to transfer to universities in other countries in the broader region, including Georgia, Serbia and Kyrgyzstan, thanks to an academic mobility program coordinated by the Indian National Medical Commission (NMC). And some 640 chose to go back to Ukraine, according to a report in the Indian daily Economic Times.""We will be in class, or I will be studying in the library and suddenly we hear siren sounds, which means we must go to the bunker immediately to be safe,"" said Abhijit Singh Parmar, a third-year medical student at Bogomolets National Medical University and friend of Sharma's who returned to Ukraine last November.""I do not feel good. It feels like mental torture,"" he added, explaining that he had now decided to leave the war-torn country again because he did not feel safe. He will continue his studies in Kyrgyzstan, even though this will be more expensive for him and is currently awaiting transcripts and other documents.""Even this morning at 3 a.m. when I was sleeping, the siren rang. We had to go to the bunker. There are power cuts that extend to 12 hours a day. I have to study with a small lamp most of the time and it is difficult for me to cope with the situation.""For his part, Sharma said that he would tough it out a little because he was reluctant to go through the bureaucracy of transferring to a different university in another country. ""The quality of life is not good here. But I will see how things pan out and will take a decision.""Sharma said that one of the reasons he had returned to Ukraine was because there was little support at home. ""The Indian government did nothing for us,"" he complained. ""There was no clarity in any of the instructions given.""It was because of this lack of clarity that R. B. Gupta, from the northern Indian city of Gurgaon, decided to set up an organization to fight for the students' admission to Indian medical colleges.But he told DW that he had lost hope in the government and the Supreme Court of India, which he has petitioned.Last year, the top court asked the Indian government to form a committee of experts to find a solution for medical students who are unable to complete their studies because of the war in Ukraine and also the COVID-19 pandemic.""Why has the government still not taken any decision on what to do with the medical students who returned from Ukraine,"" Gupta asked, saying that his 21-year-old son was thinking of quitting medicine altogether and changing profession.The Indian government has argued that there are currently no provisions for accommodating students from foreign medical institutes.""I am still waiting for the decision from the court,"" another parent from the western Indian state of Gujarat told DW. ""I am not sending my son back to Ukraine.""Meanwhile, there are thousands of medical students who returned to India and are still struggling to decide what to do.Many fear that the break in their studies will reflect badly in the long term. They do not know whether online classes or local internships will be validated.Aarthi Paramasivam, a fourth-year medical student from Tamil Nadu, said that she was worried because she had lost six months of practice. Now, she is planning to go to Georgia where she has a place at a medical school. Her parents have had to provide a lot of money to arrange for her move to a new country.""It's going to be hard to start practicing again,"" she told DW. ""After returning to India, I managed to do an internship in local hospitals where I could keep in touch but I was expecting to leave for Georgia in September so I had to quit.""She is still waiting for all the formalities to go through.Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/3/15,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836599,UEFA to study Inter Milan complaint on fan issues at Porto,"NYON, Switzerland (AP) — After hundreds of Inter Milan fans with tickets were denied entry to a Champions League game at Porto, UEFA said Wednesday it will look into the incident and the Italian club promised a formal complaint.Inter chief executive Beppe Marotta said in a post-game interview late Tuesday that children were crying outside the stadium after they were not allowed in to see their team draw 0-0 and advance to the quarterfinals.In a statement Wednesday, Inter said its fans were exposed to “serious tension and potential danger.”“A large number of Inter supporters, including many families with children, were segregated in a containment area near the visitors’ section and held there for the duration of the match, which they were unable to watch,” the club said.The incident flared in Portugal in the same week officials in Italy denied entry for German fans wanting to see the Napoli-Eintracht Frankfurt game on Wednesday in the Champions League round of 16.Host clubs and city authorities are responsible for stadium security and UEFA suggested the issue was that some Inter fans had tickets to sit in sections reserved for Porto supporters.“UEFA had been made aware that a large contingent of visiting supporters have procured tickets in home sectors of the stadium,” the European soccer body said in a statement.Champions League regulations require home clubs to allocate 5% of stadium capacity for away teams, which Porto seemed to have complied with.Inter fans had traveled in large numbers to see their team try to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since 2011 at the Porto stadium, which hosted the final two years ago.“Mitigation measures were discussed between both clubs,” said UEFA, which has a match delegate on site for each game it organizes to liaise with team and city officials. “UEFA is currently looking into the matter.”Inter urged UEFA to intervene “so that light is shed on what happened and that situations of this kind, contrary to the key principles of sportsmanship, equality and inclusion, are never repeated, in defense of all fans, regardless of their football faith and nationality.” ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836600,Iran says 110 arrested over suspected schoolgirl poisonings,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian police said Wednesday that 110 suspects have been arrested in connection with the suspected poisoning of thousands of girls in schools across the country.Students say they have been sickened by noxious fumes in incidents dating back to November that have mainly occurred in girls' schools. Authorities say they are investigating, but there has been no word on who might be behind the incidents or what — if any — chemicals have been used.Unlike neighboring Afghanistan, Iran has no history of religious extremists targeting women's education, even during the height of its 1979 Islamic Revolution. There have been no fatalities, and some officials have suggested that mass hysteria might have played a role.Gen. Saeed Montazerolmehdi, the police spokesperson, announced the arrests in remarks carried by Iranian media. He also said police had confiscated thousands of stink bomb toys, indicating that some of the alleged attacks might have been copycat pranks.Others appear to be more serious, with hundreds of students hospitalized, according to local media reports and rights groups.Iran has heavily restricted independent media and arrested dozens of journalists since the outbreak of nationwide antigovernment protests last September. It has also targeted reporters covering the poisonings, even as officials have provided few details about what is happening.A lawmaker on a government panel investigating the incidents said earlier this month that as many as 5,000 students have complained of being sickened in 230 schools across 25 provinces. Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that has closely monitored the recent protests, has put the number at over 7,000 students.The World Health Organization documented what might have been a similar phenomenon in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012, when hundreds of girls across the country complained of strange smells and poisoning. No evidence was found to support the suspicions, and WHO said it appeared to be a “mass psychogenic illness.”",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836601,Social media madness gives opportunities to Edert and others,"While almost everyone in March Madness wants to be this year's version of reigning national champion Kansas, almost anyone playing over the next three weeks would also love to be this year's version of Doug Edert.If that name doesn't ring a bell, maybe Edert's wispy mustache will. Edert was the reserve guard from Saint Peter's who turned into a social media sensation after scoring 20 points in a first-round upset over Kentucky last March.By the time he and the Peacocks made history by becoming the first 15 seed to advance to the Elite Eight, Edert's mustache had its own Twitter handle and Edert himself had deals hawking chicken wings and a few other products.All of this was spurred by the confluence of social media's ever-growing imprint on society (and sports) combined with the new and loosely regulated world of NIL, the name, imagine and likeness deals that allow college athletes to cash in on paid endorsements.Edert's success story is one of several examples of the ways social media has turbocharged March Madness, that one-of-a-kind American sporting event that had communal elements built in — think, the bracket and the office pool — long before the internet even existed.The key for someone like Edert — and there will almost certainly be another “someone like Edert” once the shots start flying — was to move quickly.“My main focus was basketball, and obviously, I'm trying to do whatever I can to help my team win games,” Edert told The Associated Press. “But at the same time, I'm trying to capitalize on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”Some things — namely, the emerging love affair with his jump shot, to say nothing of his ‘70s-style ’stache — took on a life of their own, the way things often do on TikTok, Instagram and the other social media platforms that help drive the tournament's popularity. Others — namely, the hot wings deal and a few more sponsorships — came because he struck quickly at the urging of his friends and parents, who were watching this unheralded guard from a tiny school blow up in real time.“Nobody was pressuring me, saying, ‘You’ve gotta do this, or you've gotta do that,'” Edert said. “They were just behind me, and they were offering to help in any way they could.”Edert would not divulge the amount he has made from his sponsorships, which included a deal shooting celebrity video messages and another promoting a website that offers adult recreational sports leagues.But, he said, it gave him a “nice little start, for whatever happens after college.” Certainly, it gave him more than someone like him might have gotten only a couple years ago. And it was not something anyone saw coming for a guard from a 3,400-student school in Jersey City, New Jersey.“There's always that chance that a star player, or an underrated player from a team that goes far, will capture the hearts of America, and where will they capture it? On social media,” said Jeffrey Weiner, senior vice president for NIL marketing at GSE Worldwide. “It'll be on TV, and then they'll go look for that person on social media. People are watching these games with their phones in their hands.”Edert said he rarely posted on social media, and had a following of about 1,500 on Instagram in early March of last year.“And after the Kentucky game, I look at my phone and it's 6,000 followers and it's going up,"" he said. It is now 149,000, barely a blip by hoop-star standards, but a 1,000 times more than he had a year ago.Perhaps the single most impactful social media post to emerge in the NIL era came from the TikTok account of Oregon's Sedona Prince.Her takedown of the NCAA for the sparse weight room facilities at the 2021 women's tournament shined a spotlight on the disparities between men's and women's college sports. That video currently has been viewed more than 12.3 million times.In the month between February 2021 and the time Prince posted a month later, the hashtag “NCAA” spiked from 7 million to 490 million views on TikTok. The hashtag “March Madness” has gone from 957 million views in 2021 to 1.4 billion views this year on TikTok — and that 2023 figure was calculated before a single basket had been made in the actual tournament.Prince's TikTok following now numbers 2.8 million. With the explosion in popularity came a deal with an energy drink that includes equity and cash in exchange for creating content on social media. Her current feed also includes sponsored content with Buick and Crocs, which means she now has a bank account to go with her unexpected fame.“I've tried to optimize my NIL opportunities.,” Prince said in an interview last year with Yahoo Finance. “I take what I do off the court, which is TikTok and certain brand deals, but turn them into something I can use for the rest of my life., money that I can retire with, put my kids through college with.”The NIL platform Opendorse estimated that companies spent $917 million on college athlete deals in the first year they were approved. Most of those earnings were made via social media.These days, many arrangements come on the front end through so-called collectives that are tied to schools, often sealed during the recruiting process. Edert, however, was making no such money when he signed to play for Shaheen Holloway at Saint Peter's.“At the beginning of the year, when they explained to students that you can start your own business or have your own brand, I'm thinking, 'This doesn't really apply to me,'” Edert said of the preseason athletic department presentations he sat through.Now, it does, and Edert's star turn at March Madness last year also played a roundabout role in his second run through the recruiting process. When Holloway left Saint Peter's for a job at his alma mater, Seton Hall, several Peacocks, including Edert, used social media to let the world know they were entering the transfer portal.“I announced early in the morning, and by 7:30 or 8, my phone started blowing up,” Edert said.Most of those calls and messages were from coaches at Edert's new school, Bryant University, where they knew a lot more about the guard out of Nutley, New Jersey than they might have the year before. Those coaches weren't the only ones.“Even yesterday, I was signing autographs and taking some pictures with kids in middle school and high school,” Edert said. “They said ‘We love you, Doug.” And I felt great. I’m just doing what I love to do. There's a lot of love and support from a lot of people, and it really means a lot.""___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836602,"Netanyahu rejects judicial compromise, deepening crisis","JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday swiftly rejected a compromise proposal aimed at resolving a standoff over his plans to overhaul the country's legal system, deepening the crisis over a program that has roiled the country and drawn international criticism.The country's figurehead president, Isaac Herzog, presented the compromise in a nationally televised addressl.Herzog, whose ceremonial role is meant to serve as a national unifier and moral compass, unveiled the proposal after more than two months of mass protests against Netanyahu’s plan. He said he had been consulting with a broad cross section of the country and suggested that Israel's survival depends on reaching a compromise.“Anyone who thinks that a real civil war, of human life, is a line that we will not reach has no idea,” Herzog said. “The abyss,” he warned, “is within touching distance.”But Netanyahu quickly turned it down. “Unfortunately, the things the president presented were not agreed to by the coalition representatives,” Netanyahu said at Israel's main international airport before departing to Germany. “And central elements of the proposal he offered just perpetuate the current situation and don't bring the necessary balance between the branches. That is the unfortunate truth.”Netanyahu's plan would allow parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions and give his parliamentary coalition the final say over all judicial appointments.Netanyahu’s allies say the plan is needed to curb what they claim are excessive powers of unelected judges. Their opponents say it would destroy the country’s system of checks and balances by concentrating power in the hands of Netanyahu and his ruling coalition. They also say Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a conflict of interest.Herzog's proposal offered incentives to both sides. Parliament would not be able to overturn Supreme Court rulings. But judges would not be allowed to overturn major legislation known as “Basic Laws,” which serve as a sort of constitution. Basic Laws, however, would require a parliamentary supermajority, instead of a simple majority, to pass.Judicial appointments would be made by a committee comprised of coalition and opposition lawmakers, judges and public representatives. Appointments would require a broad consensus, and no single party would wield a veto.“This is not the president’s draft. It is the draft of the nation,” Herzog said. “There is no side that wins, no side that loses.”Merav Michaeli, leader of the opposition Labor party, welcomed the proposal and said Netanyahu's rejection shows he “is not for legal reform but for judicial overthrow.”Netanyahu’s proposal has sparked weeks of mass protests by tens of thousands of Israelis, drawn criticism from business leaders, economists and legal experts. Military reservists have threatened to stop reporting for duty if it passes. Even some of Israel’s closest allies, including the U.S., have urged caution.Earlier on Wednesday, a senior delegation of Jewish-American leaders paid a flash visit to Israel to urge leaders to find a compromise. The arrival of some 30 leaders from the Jewish Federations of North America marked a rare foray by the American Jewish community into domestic Israeli affairs and reflected concerns that the turmoil inside Israel could spill over to Jewish communities overseas.Eric Fingerhut, the president and chief executive of the Jewish Federations, said the 24-hour visit, coming at short notice, illustrated the “grave concern and worry” the Israeli debate has raised among American Jews.The Federations said the visit was the first time “in recent history” that it has sent such a delegation to discuss Israeli policy with Israeli leaders.Fingerhut said his group was unable to meet with Netanyahu, but held talks with senior members of Netanyahu’s coalition, opposition leaders and Herzog. He said his group’s message to all sides was to find a compromise and calm the deeply polarized atmosphere.American Jews tend to hold liberal political positions and identify with liberal streams of Judaism that have struggled for recognition in Israel. An array of Jewish groups have raised concerns that minority rights and religious pluralism could be weakened by the overhaul.The Jewish Federations of North America represent over 400 Jewish communities across the U.S. and Canada. It raises and distributes more than $2 billion a year to support Jewish communities and vulnerable populations domestically, in Israel and worldwide, making it the largest Jewish philanthropic organization in North America.",2023/3/16,,World

(AP) — The Carolina Panthers added two significant offensive weapons to help out their incoming rookie quarterback.The Panthers announced Wednesday they agreed to terms with forner Philadelphia Eagles running back Miles Sanders and former Cincinnati Bengals tight end Hayden Hurst, both unrestricted free agents.The Panthers plan to select a quarterback with the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft after trading away four draft picks and wide receiver D.J. Moore to the Chicago Bears to move up eight spots. They've also added quarterback Andy Dalton as a backup QB.Sanders ran for 1,126 yards and 11 touchdowns last season, helping the Eagles reach the Super Bowl. He has run for 3,708 rushing yards and 20 touchdowns in his first four seasons in the league, all with Philadelphia.He also has the ability to be a valuable receiver, catching 50 passes for 509 yards and three touchdowns his rookie season.A former second-round draft pick, Sanders will be reunited with Duce Staley, the Panthers' recently hired running backs coach who previously worked with him in Philadelphia.The decision to add Sanders could mean the team is ready to move on free agent running back D’Onta Foreman, who played well after Christian McCaffrey was traded to San Francisco.The 6-foot-4, 250-pound Hurst was a first-round draft pick in 2018 who spent last season with the Bengals and caught 52 passes for 414 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught 13 passes for 141 yards and a touchdown in three postseason games with Cincinnati.Before Cincinnati, the 29-year-old Hurst spent two seasons apiece in Baltimore and Atlanta. His best season came in 2020 when he caught 56 passes for 571 yards and six touchdowns for the Falcons.Tight end has been a major area of weakness for the Panthers since Greg Olsen retired in 2020.The leading tight end last season was Ian Thomas, who caught 21 passes for 197 yards and no touchdowns. Reserve tight end Tommy Tremble had 19 catches for 174 yards and three TDs.Both Thomas and Tremble are under contract this season.The Panthers are still in the market for a wide receiver following Moore's departure, but that position is fairly thin this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836604,Erling Haaland is leaving soccer's greatest in his wake,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It had been a relatively lean spell for Erling Haaland.That was before his record-equaling five goals in a Champions League game when Manchester City routed Leipzig 7-0 on Tuesday.Haaland had only scored three goals in his previous nine appearances — by far his worst run of the season — but is now up to 39 in 35 competitive games since joining City last year.That number might have been higher if not for Pep Guardiola’s decision to substitute him shortly after the hour mark against Leipzig, with a place in the quarterfinals essentially secured.In doing so, the City manager denied Haaland the chance to set a scoring record in European club soccer’s elite competition and surpass even the great Lionel Messi as the only player to get six goals in one match. Luiz Adriano also scored five.“If he achieves this milestone at 22, 23, it will be boring his life,” Guardiola joked afterward. “He wouldn’t have a target to reach in the future.”At this rate, it seems to be only a matter of time before the next record tumbles.FASTEST TO 30On Tuesday, Haaland became the fastest player to reach 30 Champions League goals, beating the record held by former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.Van Nistelrooy hit that landmark in his 34th game in the competition. Haaland needed only 25.Robert Lewandowski did it in 46, Messi in 48, and Neymar in 49 games.YOUNGEST TO 30At 22 years, 236 days old, Haaland is the youngest player to score 30 Champions League goals.He beat the record held by Kylian Mbappé (22 years, 352 days), who had previously surpassed Messi (23 years, 131 days). PREMIER LEAGUE RIVALSHaaland is now only six goals short of setting a record for the most competitive goals scored in a season by a Premier League player.Van Nistelrooy and Mohamed Salah share the record, which stands at 44 goals in a single campaign.Haaland is up to 39 with City having at least 14 more games to play before the end of the season. It could be even more if the Premier League champions advance in the FA Cup and Champions League.PREMIER LEAGUE RECORDWith 28 goals in the league, Haaland has already exceeded the 23 scored by last season’s Golden Boot winners, Salah and Son Heung-Min.The Norwegian is six short of the league record of 34 goals scored by Andy Cole in 1994 and Alan Shearer in 1995.It seems likely that record will fall as well — possibly long before the season concludes.Cristiano Ronaldo’s best Premier League campaign saw him score 31 goals, while City’s all-time leading scorer, Sergio Aguero, never managed more than 26.The record in England’s top division is held by Everton forward Dixie Dean, who scored 60 in 1928.MESSI AND RONALDOAs impressive as Haaland’s numbers are, he may yet fall short of the feats set by Messi and Ronaldo when they were at the height of their powers.Messi scored a remarkable 73 goals in all competitions for Barcelona in 2011-12, which included 50 in the Spanish league.Ronaldo scored 61 for Real Madrid in 2014-15.IS IT ENOUGH?While Haaland’s goals have seen him set new benchmarks, questions still remain about whether he is the right fit for City.Despite his scoring feats, the reigning league champions are in danger of giving up their title, with Arsenal five points clear in the standings.The criticizm is that Haaland makes City too predictable.The Champions League is the club’s ultimate target and the only major trophy it has failed to win since being taken over in 2008 by the ruling family of Abu Dhabi.Haaland described scoring as his “super strength” after the match against Leipzig, but Guardiola warned that his striker's scoring powers might not be enough to see City win the European Cup.“A lot of the time we were out,"" Guardiola said, ""because we conceded a lot.”___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836605,What can ChatGPT maker's new AI model GPT-4 do?,"LONDON (AP) — The company behind the ChatGPT chatbot has rolled out its latest artificial intelligence model, GPT-4, in the next step for a technology that’s caught the world's attention.The new system can figure out tax deductions and answer questions like a Shakespearan pirate, for example, but it still “hallucinates” facts and makes reasoning errors.Here's a look at San Francisco-based startup OpenAI's latest improvement on the generative AI models that can spit out readable text and unique images:WHAT'S NEW?OpenAI says GPT-4 “exhibits human-level performance.” It's much more reliable, creative and can handle “more nuanced instructions"" than its predecessor system, GPT-3.5, which ChatGPT was built on, OpenAI said in its announcement.In an online demo Tuesday, OpenAI President Greg Brockman ran through some scenarios that showed off GPT-4's capabilities that appeared to show it's a radical improvement on previous versions.He demonstrated how the system could quickly come up with the proper income tax deduction after being fed reams of tax code — something he couldn't figure himself.“It’s not perfect, but neither are you. And together it's this amplifying tool that lets you just reach new heights,” Brockman said.WHY DOES IT MATTER?Generative AI technology like GPT-4 could be the future of the internet, at least according to Microsoft, which has invested at least $1 billion in OpenAI and made a splash by integrating AI chatbot tech into its Bing browser.It’s part of a new generation of machine-learning systems that can converse, generate readable text on demand and produce novel images and video based on what they’ve learned from a vast database of digital books and online text.These new AI breakthroughs have the potential to transform the internet search business long dominated by Google, which is trying to catch up with its own AI chatbot, and numerous professions.“With GPT-4, we are one step closer to life imitating art,” said Mirella Lapata, professor of natural language processing at the University of Edinburgh. She referred to the TV show “Black Mirror,” which focuses on the dark side of technology.“Humans are not fooled by the AI in ‘Black Mirror’ but they tolerate it,” Lapata said. ""Likewise, GPT-4 is not perfect, but paves the way for AI being used as a commodity tool on a daily basis.”WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE IMPROVEMENTS?GPT-4 is a “large multimodal model,” which means it can be fed both text and images that it uses to come up with answers.In one example posted on OpenAI's website, GPT-4 is asked, “What is unusual about this image?” It's answer: “The unusual thing about this image is that a man is ironing clothes on an ironing board attached to the roof of a moving taxi.”GPT-4 is also “steerable,” which means that instead of getting an answer in ChatGPT's “classic” fixed tone and verbosity, users can customize it by asking for responses in the style of a Shakespearean pirate, for instance.In his demo, Brockman asked both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to summarize in one sentence an article explaining the difference between the two systems. The catch was that every word had to start with the letter G.GPT-3.5 didn't even try, spitting out a normal sentence. The newer version swiftly responded: “GPT-4 generates groundbreaking, grandiose gains, greatly galvanizing generalized AI goals.”HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?ChatGPT can write silly poems and songs or quickly explain just about anything found on the internet. It also gained notoriety for results that could be way off, such as confidently providing a detailed but false account of the Super Bowl game days before it took place, or even being disparaging to users.OpenAI acknowledged that GPT-4 still has limitations and warned users to be careful. GPT-4 is “still not fully reliable” because it “hallucinates” facts and makes reasoning errors, it said.“Great care should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts,” the company said, though it added that hallucinations have been sharply reduced.Experts also advised caution.“We should remember that language models such as GPT-4 do not think in a human-like way, and we should not be misled by their fluency with language,"" said Nello Cristianini, professor of artificial intelligence at the University of Bath.Another problem is that GPT-4 does not know much about anything that happened after September 2021, because that was the cutoff date for the data it was trained on.ARE THERE SAFEGUARDS?OpenAI says GPT-4's improved capabilities “lead to new risk surfaces"" so it has improved safety by training it to refuse requests for sensitive or “disallowed” information.It's less likely to answer questions on, for example, how to build a bomb or buy cheap cigarettes.Still, OpenAI cautions that while “eliciting bad behavior” from GPT is harder, “doing so is still possible.”",2023/3/16,,World

Skiers in brightly colored helmets jockey for a spot at the bar, their bodies warmed by thick, insulated walls and highly efficient condensing boilers.Overhead, WeatherNation plays on the television, looping footage of last year’s mega storms and flashing a headline: “2022 billion dollar disasters.”Aspen Ski Company's vice-president of sustainability, who sits nearby eating a slice of pizza, says it's not enough for resorts to just change their on-site operations to become “green.""“If you’re a ski resort and you care about climate change or you profess to care about climate change, it absolutely has to go beyond reducing your carbon footprint,” said Auden Schendler. “If your CEO hasn’t spoken out on climate publicly or in an op-ed, you’re not a green company.”As global warming threatens to put much of the ski industry out of business over the next several decades, resorts are beginning to embrace a role as climate activists in the halls of government. The industry contributes just a tiny fraction of overall greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change, but arguably has outsized influence on popular culture and in the business world. While many resorts are focused on reducing their own emissions, others are going much further, leveraging their influence to shift public opinion and advocate for climate legislation.Arapahoe Basin is a ski area leading such efforts in the United States. Positioned high up on the craggy, wind-whipped continental divide in central Colorado, the mountain is relatively well-positioned to endure a warmer, shorter winter season. High altitude, which keeps temperatures cooler and lengthens the time snow stays on the ground, is its golden ticket. But it isn’t immune to extreme weather: it has experienced close calls with wildfires and subsequent mudslides, which washed out a parking lot adjacent to its slopes in 2021.About a decade ago, the ski area transitioned from spending thousands of dollars annually to cancel out some carbon emissions by paying for carbon credits to instead funding a staff position focused on reducing on-site emissions.“If we are gonna ask our guests to be better, we’re gonna ask our guests to talk to their leadership, we’re gonna go talk to our leadership directly, we definitely feel like we need to be doing it too,” said Sustainability Manager Mike Nathan.One way they're working to nudge a transition to renewable energies is with newly installed electric vehicle chargers. After a day on the slopes, Denver resident Kurt Zanca returned to his Tesla, which had been charging for free at one of the five dual-port stations situated in the front row of the mountain's parking lot.Zanca said he thinks charging infrastructure at ski areas can help encourage hesitant shoppers to purchase an EV. “If you can drive up here, charge, go back, no problem, it makes it a lot easier,” Zanca said.In the northern French Alps, luxury chalet operator Alikats also sees incentives for customers as a catalyst for change. They offer discounts to guests who travel by train, opt out of eating meat or don't use a hot tub during their stay.Al Judge, who owns and operates the business with his wife Kat, considers himself a realist. He’s not trying to save snowfall—massive reductions in greenhouse gases emissions worldwide are needed to slow global warming—but rather set a standard for how businesses should operate in a way that respects natural resources and protects biodiversity.“The more that becomes a cultural imperative, the quicker change will happen, and I think business has a very important role to play in that process,” Judge said.Arapahoe Basin, affectionately known by locals as “A-bay,” is working toward net-zero emissions by 2025, partially by relying on credits through the Colorado Carbon Fund to offset some natural gas and diesel they'll still be burning at that time. They also aim to divert 75% of their waste by then — they're currently at 50% through various recycling and composting programs. Nathan says these efforts give them clout when trying to flex their influence off the mountain.They've pressured their utility, Xcel Energy, to expedite the transition to renewable power. Earlier this year, Nathan and other industry leaders met with the governor's staff to encourage the rapid transition to manufacturing EV heavy machinery statewide. And, after watching a federal bill that eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act stall, Nathan and Chief Operating Officer Alan Henceroth co-authored an op-ed and sent letters to Colorado’s congressional delegation.“Kicking the can for another legislative session was going to have direct and negative impacts on businesses like us,” Nathan said.Similarly active in policy work, Judge runs an organization that's studying the lack of public transit in the region and expects to soon lobby French officials for a solution. A train route through the northern Alps would provide a more direct public transit option that could reduce the number of flights coming in, Judge said.Customer travel remains a primary source of pollution for ski areas, with air travel, in particular private jets, a major culprit. For example, over 80 percent of flights in and out of Aspen-Pitkin County Airport are private jets, airport officials said. Ideally, airports could tax private jets and invest that money in renewable energy projects, said Schendler. But the Federal Aviation Administration remains a roadblock. Federal law prohibits airports from spending tax revenue offsite. This restricts any renewable projects to airport grounds, and any revenue made from them must be used exclusively at the facility.While Aspen has yet to win over the FAA, it found a way to sway its local utility, Holy Cross, which supplies power to more than a dozen towns in addition to Vail Mountain Resort along the Interstate-70 corridor. About 15 years ago, Schendler began phoning environmentally minded locals and encouraged them to run for board positions for the utility, which produced about 10% renewable electricity at the time. Today, the board is stacked with pro-renewable members, largely the fruit of lobbying by Aspen and other activists. The utility is split about 50/50 between renewables and fossil fuels, and is committed to 100% renewables by 2030.Another way to speed the transition to renewables is through power purchase agreements. This is when a business or utility commits to buying a set amount of energy from yet-to-be-built projects, guaranteeing some of the funding to be built.Vail Resorts, which owns 37 ski areas in three countries, has done this with a wind farm in Nebraska, and is one of five partners for a new solar array in Salt Lake City. Power purchase agreements have helped Vail reach 100% renewable electricity for all its resort and ski areas in North America, and 96% internationally.Snowshoe Mountain is a ski resort in West Virginia still largely powered by fossil fuels. As the climate bill stalled last summer in Congress, CEO Patti Duncan felt the need to get involved. She doesn't consider herself an activist but wanted to speak up when she watched one of her state’s senators, Joe Manchin, defend the state’s coal industry and hold up the legislation. Duncan wondered, what about the thriving outdoor industry, which is negatively impacted by the burning of fossil fuels?With encouragement by owner Alterra Mountain Company and climate activist group Protect Our Winters, she wrote a letter to Manchin. Days later, he came out in support of the bill. Duncan said she doesn’t know whether her letter played a role in the senator’s decision but is glad she spoke up.“It’s my responsibility to do something about it for our resort and our community and our state,” Duncan said.On the other side of the country, Aspen had installed a kiosk at its Limelight Hotel lobby at the base of Snowmass Mountain. The kiosk allowed guests to send a pre-paid card to the senator, encouraging him to support the bill.The climate bill passed and was signed into law. As a result, record federal funding is now available for households and businesses to decarbonize buildings and transportation. But Mario Molina, executive director of Protect Our Winters, says the work is just getting started.The next steps are “anything and everything that resorts can engage in to leverage not only their political power but also their power as large consumers to help implement and realize the promise of the Inflation Reduction Act,” Molina said. He cautioned of local opposition to renewable energy projects, and said resorts could make a big impact advocating for the permitting necessary for those projects, in addition to taking advantage of every available credit on their own.Many skiers applaud such efforts and want their favorite ski areas to have a role in fighting climate change — with an important caveat.“As long as they’re being sincere and not just sort of doing it for show and not actually making much of a change,” said Archie Bolgar, a British student on vacation at Aspen in January with friends from Boston’s Bentley University.While there are many environmental issues corporations could embrace, Schendler says the focus must be on reducing emissions to make sure global temperatures don't rise more than 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial times. The rise is currently about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), and climate scientists warn that as it increases so too will extreme weather events.“If we can stabilize warming at sub 2 degrees Celsius, we’re going to prevent billions of people from suffering. That’s profound,” he said.____The Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy. The AP is solely responsible for all content.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836608,Ukraine vows to hold on to Bakhmut despite Russian onslaught,"BAKHMUT, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian troops on Wednesday defended positions in Bakhmut in eastern Ukrain e amid a relentless push by Russian forces to capture a city that has been turned into a wasteland by seven months of fighting.Both sides claimed successes in what has become the longest-running battle since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago.Ukrainian officials said that Ukrainian Ground Forces shot down a Russian fighter jet near Bakhmut and made gains in northern parts of the city.Meanwhile, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the mercenary Wagner Group, which has spearheaded the Russian assault on the city, said in a social media post Wednesday that Russian forces have taken control of the settlement of Zaliznyanskoye and are expanding the encirclement of Bakhmut.The claims couldn’t be verified.The battle for Bakhmut intensified after Russian forces captured the nearby town of Soledar in January. Russian forces must go through Bakhmut to push deeper into parts of the Donetsk province they don't yet control, though Western officials say that the capture of the city would have limited impact on the course of the war.An assessment by the U.K. Defense Ministry over the weekend said that paramilitary units from the Wagner Group had seized eastern parts of Bakhmut, with a river flowing through the city marking the front line of the fighting.Russian troops have enveloped the city from three sides, leaving only a narrow corridor leading west. The only highway west has been targeted by Russian artillery fire, forcing Ukrainian defenders to rely increasingly on country roads, which are hard to use before the muddy ground dries.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed the situation in Bakhmut with top military and intelligence officials on Tuesday and all agreed on the need to hold and defend the city, the presidential office said.___Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836609,Chinese businessman arrested in $1 billion fraud conspiracy,"NEW YORK (AP) — A business tycoon long sought by the government of China and known for cultivating ties to Trump administration figures including Steve Bannon was arrested Wednesday in New York on charges that he oversaw a $1 billion fraud conspiracy.Guo Wengui, 54, and his financier, Kin Ming Je, faced an indictment in federal court in Manhattan charging them with various crimes, including wire, securities and bank fraud. Guo was charged in court papers under the name Ho Wan Kwok.U.S. prosecutors said the indictment stemmed from a complex scheme in which Guo lied to hundreds of thousands of online followers in the United States and around the world before misappropriating hundreds of millions of dollars.Kin Ming Je, 55, has not been arrested. Guo was expected to appear in court Wednesday. His attorney did not immediately comment.The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, said in a release that Guo was charged with “lining his pockets with the money he stole, including buying himself, and his close relatives, a 50,000 square foot mansion, a $3.5 million Ferrari, and even two $36,000 mattresses, and financing a $37 million luxury yacht.”Guo was once believed to be among the richest people in China. He left in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown led by President Xi Jinping that ensnared people close to Guo, including a top intelligence official. Chinese authorities have accused Guo of rape, kidnapping, bribery and other offenses.Since then, has been highly sought by that nation’s government, relying on the U.S. for protection.As he lived in New York as a fugitive he became an outspoken critic of the ruling Communist Party and developed a close relationship with Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former political strategist. Guo and Bannon in 2020 announced the founding of a joint initiative they said was aimed at overthrowing the Chinese government.Guo has long argued that the allegations against him in China were false, saying they were intended to punish him for publicly outing corruption there and criticizing leading figures in the Communist Party.For years, his case was the subject of a debate over whether China was abusing international law enforcement cooperation efforts, including Interpol, in seeking his arrest. He sought political asylum in the U.S., saying he feared that if he were forced to leave the country, it might lead to his arrest in a nation with less power to resist Chinese demands.It was on Guo's 150-foot (45-meter) yacht that Bannon was once arrested on federal charges. Just before he left office, Trump made the case against Bannon dissolve with a pardon.Guo was arrested in his sprawling luxury apartment at the Sherry-Netherland, one of the storied Manhattan apartment hotels overlooking Central Park. Hours later, firefighters extinguished a smoky blaze on the same floor as Guo’s penthouse. It wasn’t immediately clear if the fire was in his home or related to his arrest.In court papers, prosecutors asked that Guo be held without bail because of the risk he could flee and ""the danger he poses to the community.” They say Guo has harassed critics and would face more than 100 years in prison if convicted of all charges. They also say he claims less than $100,000 in assets even though he lives lavishly.U.S. prosecutors accuse Guo of lying to his victims, promising them outsized returns if they invested or fed money to his media company, GTV Media Group Inc., his so-called Himalaya Farm Alliance, G'CLUBS, and the Himalaya Exchange.Williams said that, between September 2022 and this month, the U.S. government has seized approximately $634 million from 21 bank accounts, representing the majority of the proceeds of Guo's alleged fraud.He said law enforcement on Wednesday also seized assets that were purchased with proceeds of the alleged fraud, including a Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster.In court papers, prosecutors said Guo was arrested Wednesday at his Fifth Avenue penthouse apartment in Manhattan, which he purchased for $68 million. They said he also owns a mansion in Mahwah, New Jersey, that he bought for about $26 million in 2021 with proceeds from his fraud, along with a Connecticut residence that cost several million dollars in 2020.""According to witnesses, Kwok has surrounded himself with around-the-clock armed security guards who are formally employed by an entity that is funded by proceeds of Kwok’s fraud scheme. In addition, Kwok appears to travel among his residences in a caravan of luxury automobiles,"" the court papers said.The Securities and Exchange Commission also brought civil charges against Guo on Wednesday, saying in a Manhattan federal court filing that Guo led others in committing multiple frauds since April 2020.The SEC said Guo targeted retail investors through online and social media posts and videos, deceiving them with lies such as a claim that a crypto asset security called “H-Coin” was backed by gold reserves.The SEC said Guo and Je raised about $452 million through an unregistered offering of GTV common stock from April 2020 to June 2020, claiming they would “build the most popular and safest social media and transaction platform independent of the Chinese government's censorship and monitoring, allowing the people of China and the world to realize the freedom of speech and trade.”In court papers submitted in their detention request, prosecutors cited dozens of civil lawsuits Guo has been engaged in since arriving in the United States.They wrote that he has “aggressively used litigation and pressure tactics to confront his critics. Indeed, he has fomented unrest directed toward those who have opposed and criticized him.""Prosecutors also noted that Guo initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case in Connecticut, maintaining that he has up to $500 million in debts and no more than $100,000 in assets, “despite living in luxury properties, surrounded by luxury cars and lavishly expensive furniture.”They wrote that he has publicly harassed the court-appointed trustee in the bankruptcy case and publicly attacked his critics, turning “the ire of his hundreds of thousands of followers against them.”And they said he encouraged his online followers to flood the bankruptcy docket with claims regardless of their merit in a bid to obstruct the proceedings and to force the trustee to incur unnecessary costs and expenses.In 2020, prosecutors said, Guo “mobilized his followers” to protest outside a Canadian journalist's home, leading to a physical assault on one of the journalist's friends, who was kicked in the head, suffering a facial fracture, swollen-shut eyes and a lost tooth.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836610,Cup-hungry Boston Bruins shrug off shot at NHL records,"BOSTON (AP) — In a season full of extreme numbers, the Boston Bruins know exactly what value they put on winning the most games in NHL history.“Zero,” defenseman Charlie McAvoy said last week, a day before Boston became the fastest team in history to 50 wins. “Bottom of anything I care about.”The Bruins have been cruising through the regular season, and racking up milestones along the way. But even though they could amass the most wins ever — and most points, too — the players and brass insist they don’t have any interest in the biggest regular-season records of all.“We play for the Stanley Cup,” Bruins President Cam Neely said flatly. “I tell everybody, ‘Enjoy the ride, but it’s all about the Stanley Cup.’”The Bruins were coming off back-to-back 100-point seasons – and three straight early playoff exits – when they fired coach Bruce Cassidy last summer and hired Jim Montgomery to replace him. Key players like McAvoy, a Norris Trophy contender, and Brad Marchand, the team’s No. 2 scorer, were recovering from surgery, but the Bruins didn’t wait until they were at full strength.They won six of seven games before Marchand got back on the ice, moving to the top of the Eastern Conference in the second week of the season; McAvoy’s return helped boost them to the league’s No. 1 overall seed, where they have remained since Veteran's Day. They didn’t lose at home in regulation until January.They were the fastest team in NHL history to 100 points and 50 wins, and the first one to clinch a playoff berth this year. Still, after winning their 50th game, which also turned out to be the playoff clincher, goalie Linus Ullmark couldn’t be less enthusiastic.“Congrats to us, then,” he said. “I guess.”Boston has a chance to post the most wins in NHL history, surpassing the 62 by the 1995-96 Red Wings and tied by the 2018-19 Lightning. It also has a chance to surpass the record 132 points amassed by the 1976-77 Montreal Canadiens.But for a team that has already won the Presidents' Trophy twice since 2004 – and failed to win the Cup both times – a league-leading third top finish doesn’t hold much allure.“To me, the regular season (record), it is nice,” captain Patrice Bergeron said. “But you’re working hard to get into the playoffs. And that’s where the main focus is.”Montgomery said the team hasn't talked about the records, instead concentrating on getting in shape for the playoffs. If the Bruins have only the records to play for in the final days or weeks, he said, they will instead try to make sure everyone is rested and healthy for what they hope will be a two-month postseason slog.“Us preparing for the Stanley Cup playoffs is more important than anything in the regular season,” he said.Defenseman Matt Grzelcyk allowed that the regular-season record “would be quite an accomplishment,” but one that is “pretty low on the list.” It hasn’t escaped his notice that neither the ’96 Red Wings nor the ’19 Lightning won the Cup.“We’ve seen that it’s kind of bit teams in the past,” Grzelcyk said. “We’ll just go out there and compete and let the chips fall where they may.”Similar fates befell the 2001 Seattle Mariners, who won 116 games but didn't even make the World Series; the ’16 Golden State Warriors, who broke the NBA record with 73 wins but lost in the finals; and the ’07 New England Patriots, who won all 18 games in the regular season and playoffs before losing in the Super Bowl.“It was an unbelievable season, ’18-19, but I think it was almost too easy for us to play great,” said former Lightning winger Ondrej Palat, whose team was swept by Columbus in the first playoff round.“It was very frustrating after a year like that,"" Palat said. ""But I’m not saying it’s like the Bruins. The Bruins are playing unbelievable hockey, and they have a big chance in the playoffs.”Of course, Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup in each of the next two seasons.Neely never played his way to the trophy, losing in the finals to the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 and again two years later; he did get his name on the Cup when he helped build the Bruins team that won it all in 2011. That was their last championship, a drought this year's team is looking to end.“It’s been a pleasure to watch this team, there’s no question,” the Hockey Hall of Famer said. “Records are great, they’re nice to have -- and especially team records. But it’s really about who wins the last game of the year.”___AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this report.___AP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836611,Vikings add ex-Cardinals CB Byron Murphy in defensive revamp,"The Minnesota Vikings have made former Arizona cornerback Byron Murphy a key piece of their latest defensive revamp.The Vikings finalized agreements with Murphy, former New Orleans outside linebacker Marcus Davenport and former Miami tight end Josh Oliver on Wednesday, the first day of NFL free agency. The deals will be signed after completion of their physical exams, and the Vikings planned an introductory news conference for Thursday at team headquarters.The 25-year-old Murphy replaced Patrick Peterson in the Cardinals’ starting lineup in 2021 when Peterson joined the Vikings. Now, the 2019 second-round draft pick will take over for Peterson again. Murphy was limited to nine games in 2022, when he was hampered by a back injury. He had a career-high four interceptions in 2021.As the Vikings transition their scheme under new defensive coordinator Brian Flores away from the zone-heavy strategy they used last year, Murphy ought to fit well with man-to-man coverage skills. Peterson departed for Pittsburgh.Murphy, a native of Scottsdale, Arizona, will get a two-year deal. He played in college at Washington.The Vikings also cut cornerback Cameron Dantzler Sr. last week, and Duke Shelley, Chandon Sullivan and Kris Boyd are set to become unrestricted free agents. They're counting on major roles for Andrew Booth Jr. and Akayleb Evans, whose rookie seasons in 2022 were largely limited by injuries. Booth was drafted in the second round and Evans was drafted in the fourth round last year.With the departures of free agents Peterson and defensive end Dalvin Tomlinson and the release of linebacker Eric Kendricks, the Vikings are in the midst of a significant redo of a defense that was one of the league's worst in 2022. Davenport will be a key piece as an edge rusher opposite Danielle Hunter. Za'Darius Smith remains on the roster, but he's carrying a hefty cap hit and has already posted a thank you message to Vikings fans on Twitter that had a farewell vibe.With Davenport, Murphy and Oliver, the Vikings in their second year under general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah have targeted younger free agents with higher upside on buy-low deals, with all three of those players having either underperformed in recent years or been set back by injuries.The Vikings also re-signed two restricted free agents on Wednesday: tight end Ben Ellefson and outside linebacker Kenny Willekes. They reached agreements on Tuesday with four of their players who were eligible for unrestricted free agency: center Garrett Bradbury, kicker Greg Joseph, long snapper Andrew DePaola and backup quarterback Nick Mullens.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/3/16,,World

She's just the 10th player to earn that honor three times.Boston was joined on the first team by Iowa's Caitlin Clark, Villanova's Maddy Siegrist, LSU's Angel Reese and Indiana's Mackenzie Holmes. Boston and Clark were unanimous choices by the 28-member national media panel that votes in the AP Top 25 each week.It’s the second consecutive season that a player joined the club. Kentucky’s Rhyne Howard did it last season.South Carolina’s A’ja Wilson, Baylor’s Brittney Griner, Tennessee’s Chamique Holdsclaw, Duke’s Alana Beard, Oklahoma’s Courtney Paris, Oregon's Sabrina Ionescu and UConn’s Breanna Stewart and Maya Moore are the only other players to earn first-team honors at least three times. Paris and Moore did it four times.Boston earned second-team All-America honors her freshman year.“Aliyah has been the best college player in, to me, as many years as she’s been honored as an All-American, but definitely the past two seasons,"" South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. ""I hope that we can really give her her flowers while she’s still a collegiate athlete because I don’t think there will be another Aliyah Boston to ever grace college women’s basketball.”Boston helped South Carolina go undefeated in the regular season and enter the NCAA Tournament as the top overall seed. She averaged 13.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks a game. She is a big reason the Gamecocks went wire-to-wire as No. 1 in the AP poll for the second straight season.Clark could join the three-timers club next season. The junior once again put up eye-popping numbers averaging 27.0 points, second best in the nation. She also had 8.3 assists and 7.5 rebounds per game to help Iowa win the Big Ten Tournament title for a second consecutive year.“It’s one thing to be a first team All-American, but another to receive it in back-to-back seasons,"" Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. ""Our program, university, and state is so proud of all the things she has accomplished thus far. There’s nobody more deserving than a generational player like Clark.”Clark trailed only Siegrist in scoring. The Villanova star averaged 28.9 points this season and set the career Big East scoring record. She has 984 points this season and is looking to become the fifth player ever to score over 1,000 in a season. She has scored 20-plus points in 34 consecutive games which is one short of Kelsey Plum's record set in 2016-17.“Maddy is an All-American in every sense of the word and she is truly deserving of this honor,” said Villanova coach Denise Dillon. “On the court, the numbers she has put up this year are staggering. To lead the country in scoring and score 1,000 points in one season is amazing. We are so proud of Maddy becoming the first Associated Press All-American in program history.”Reese had a stellar season for the Tigers, averaging 23.4 points and 15.5 rebounds while shooting 54% from the field. The sophomore forward broke Sylvia Fowles' school record of 20 consecutive double-doubles.“Angel Reese joined our program and has had a tremendous impact on our team,” LSU coach Kim Mulkey said. “She has a special skillset that sets her apart as one of the best players in the nation. She is definitely one of the top players in the country. We are excited to see what her future holds and the impact she will have on our team at LSU.”Holmes helped Indiana to one of the best seasons in school history. The Hoosiers, who finished second in the AP poll, won the Big Ten regular season title. Holmes averaged 22.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and shot 68.8% from the field.“It’s an incredible accomplishment for a gal from Maine,” Indiana coach Teri Moren said. “No one is more exited and happier for her than our staff and her teammates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836615,Bill to legalize sports wagering headed to Kentucky Senate,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A bill to legalize sports betting in Kentucky was advanced by a Senate committee on Wednesday, leaving its supporters still facing their biggest challenge as opponents mounted a last stand.The panel sent the measure to the full Senate, setting up a potentially dramatic vote on whether the state that's home to the Kentucky Derby should let its residents legally wager on other sporting events.“The people of Kentucky want this,” Senate Majority Floor Leader Damon Thayer said. “It’s time that we give them the choice — for free will, God-given free will — to engage in legal sports betting.”The bill's Senate prospects are uncertain, due to a higher procedural hurdle to overcome. It needs a three-fifths vote in each chamber to pass, since it’s a revenue-producing bill in an odd-numbered year. The bill passed the House recently, but the Senate has been seen as the bill's toughest test.It still needs to receive procedural readings in the Senate, meaning a showdown vote could occur in late March during the final two days of this year's legislative session. Lawmakers begin an extended break after Thursday to allow Gov. Andy Beshear to consider signing or vetoing bills sent to him. The Democratic governor has been a strong supporter of legalized sports wagering in Kentucky.The measure was on friendly turf Wednesday in the Senate Licensing and Occupations Committee, which easily approved it.Republican Rep. Michael Meredith, the bill’s lead sponsor, said it would regulate activity already entrenched in Kentucky. He pointed to estimates that Kentuckians place around $1 billion in sports wagers each year in what he called the “illegal and unregulated” marketplace. Other Kentuckians simply cross the border to place sports wagers in neighboring states where it’s legal, he said.“It creates a regulated marketplace for sports wagering that takes this activity out of the darkness, out of the shadows and into the light in a regulated format,” Meredith said of his bill.Opponents called sports betting a highly addictive form of gambling, and warned the social costs would accumulate, hurting families, if the bill becomes law. The result would be “more broken families, increased addictions and divorce,” said David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation.The bill would “turn every iPhone in Kentucky into a digital casino” for wagering on sporting events, Walls said. And the bill comes at a time when high inflation is pinching family budgets, he said.In response, Meredith said: “I don’t stand here to debate anyone’s morals or their religious convictions. But again, we know this is happening in the marketplace already, either illegally or just outside the boundaries of our commonwealth. And so I think it’s smart that we regulate this as a state.”If legalized, sports wagering in Kentucky is expected to generate about $23 million a year in tax revenue and licensing fees, Meredith told the Senate committee.House Bill 551 would allow Kentucky’s horse racing tracks to be licensed as sports betting facilities for a $500,000 upfront fee and an annual renewal fee of $50,000.Participating tracks could contract with up to three service providers to provide sports wagering services at the track itself, or through online sites and mobile applications. Service providers would have to pay $50,000 for an initial license, with a $10,000 annual renewal fee.Under the bill, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission would regulate sports wagering operations.Revenue generated from taxing such wagering would cover those regulatory costs. A percentage of the revenue would go into a fund focused on dealing with problem gambling. The leftover revenue after that would flow into the state public pension system.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836616,Bank runs used to be slow. The digital era sped them up,"NEW YORK (AP) — A bank run conjures images of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” with anxious customers crammed shoulder to shoulder, desperately pleading with a harried George Bailey to hand over their money.The failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week had the panic but few other similarities, instead taking place on Twitter, message boards, mobile phones and bank websites.What made the failure of Silicon Valley Bank unique compared to past failures of large banks was how quickly it collapsed. Last Wednesday afternoon, the $200 billion bank announced a plan to raise fresh capital; by Friday morning it was insolvent and under government control.Regulators, policymakers and bankers are looking at the role that digital messaging and social media may have played in the collapse, and whether banks are entering an age when the psychological behavior behind a bank run — mass fear from depositors of losing their savings — may be amplified and go viral quicker than bank officers and regulators can successfully respond.“It was a bank sprint, not a bank run, and social media played a central role in that,” said Michael Imerman, a professor at the Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California-Irvine.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that customers withdrew $40 billion — one fifth of Silicon Valley Bank’s deposits — in just a few hours, prompting the agency to shut down the bank before 12 p.m. ET, instead of waiting until the close of business, which is typical operating procedure for regulators when a bank runs short of money.Some other well-known bank failures, such as IndyMac or Washington Mutual in 2008 or Continental Illinois in the 1980s, only happened after days or weeks of reports indicated those banks faced deep financial difficulties. Then a run occurred and regulators stepped in.The Silicon Valley Bank run was, in many ways, the first of the digital era. Few depositors lined up at a branch. Instead, they used bank apps and phone calls to access their money in minutes. Venture capitalists and business owners described the early stages of the Silicon Valley run being led by private message boards or Slack channels, where entrepreneurs were encouraged to withdraw their funds.Silicon Valley Bank also was unique in being almost entirely exposed to one community — the tech industry, venture capital and startups. When this close-knit community of depositors talked to one another — using digital channels to do so quickly — the bank likely became more vulnerable to rumors and a run. This was a risk outside of the growth of social media, industry experts said.Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, tweeted: “the speed of the world has changed. things can unwind fast. people talk fast. people move money fast.”While the withdrawals initially may have been orderly, they became a full-on bank run Thursday evening after the news spilled over to Twitter that billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel had advised his invested companies to close their accounts with Silicon Valley Bank.“If you are not advising your companies to get the cash out, then you are not doing your job as a Board Member or as a Shareholder. Daily life in startups is risky enough, don’t play with your lifeline...,” wrote Mark Tluszcz, the CEO of Europe-based investment firm Mangrove, on Twitter that Friday morning.For David Murray, the warning of the first bank run of the social-media age came in a one-sentence email.He’s a co-founder of Confirm.com, an employee performance management company in San Francisco that had millions of dollars sitting in accounts at Silicon Valley Bank.Murray received a terse email Thursday morning saying that a run was underway there and recommending everyone pull their money out immediately. The email came from an investor whom Murray hears from so infrequently that his co-founder wondered if it was a phishing attempt or other scam.After verifying the email and seeing the steep drop in the stock price of the bank’s parent company, SVB Financial, Murray and his colleagues rushed to withdraw the company’s money. Instead of heading to a branch, they quickly pulled up a webpage and logged in. It took a few tries, but they eventually moved every cent to an account at a different bank within a half hour.Murray could see fear rising among other startup companies in real time.“We have a trusted network of founders” of startup companies who communicate with each other over Slack, Murray said. “Normally these chat groups are dead. But that day, all the Slack groups were lit up.”As depicted with the fictional Building and Loan in “ It’s a Wonderful Life,” runs on a bank often start off as a rumor and can quickly devolve to a tribal-like collective fear that sends depositors clamoring for their money, even when nothing is wrong. Because a bank run can happen at random and is hard to stop once started, the U.S. government created the FDIC to stop future bank runs under the premise that depositors’ funds would be insured.Between 1930 and 1933, during the Great Depression, roughly 9,000 banks failed. Since the FDIC’s creation in 1933, bank runs have become much rarer. According to the FDIC, there were 562 bank failures between 2001 and 2023, with the vast majority of those happening during the 2007-2009 recession.The entire banking industry is now grappling with the fact that they could be the next target of a social media-fueled bank run. The hive-like behavior is similar to what happened during the 2021 “meme stock” boom where companies were targeted by groups of mostly retail investors, although in that case groups of investors were using social media to push stocks higher.Silicon Valley Bank's failure dominated social media platforms for days. Several prominent investors issued bombastic predictions that if the federal government did not step in to make all Silicon Valley Bank depositors whole — both insured and uninsured — there would be more bank runs on Monday.In the end, Washington capitulated. Under the plan announced by U.S. regulators on Sunday, depositors at Silicon Valley Bank were able to access all their money. A new Federal Reserve program will allow banks to post certain high-quality securities as collateral and borrow from a government emergency fund. Both Treasury and Federal Reserve officials told reporters over the weekend that the programs were created in part due to concerns further bank runs — fueled by social media — could occur.“The last several days represent a unique incident fueled by misinformation on social media and are not indicative of the health of our industry,” said Lindsey Johnson, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, in a statement.For policymakers, there doesn’t appear to be any immediate solution. One possibility that’s been around for decades — also depicted in “It’s a Wonderful Life” — is the idea of a bank holiday where regulators close a bank for a few days to allow for cooler heads to prevail.On Monday after the government stepped in to backstop the banking system, it seemed like a portion of the technology community had become aware of their ability to cause mass panic in finance and should be more careful when posting about the potential health of banks.“In the age of social media, if you have a big enough platform and yell loud enough about a bank run, you might eventually be correct. Doesn’t make it right,” wrote Logan Bartlett with Redpoint Ventures.___An earlier version of this report incorrectly said Confirm.com was required to bank with Silicon Valley Bank by its financial backers.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836628,"Arctic sea ice thins in 2 big jumps, and now more vulnerable","Climate change attacked crucial Arctic sea ice thickness in two sudden big gobbles instead of steady nibbling, a new study says.A little more than 15 years ago, sea ice quickly lost more than half its thickness, becoming weaker, more prone to melting and less likely to recover, according to the study that emphasizes the importance of two big “regime shifts” that changed the complexion of the Arctic.Those big bites came in 2005 and 2007. Before then, Arctic sea ice was older and misshapen in a way that made it difficult to move out of the region. That helped the polar area act as the globe's air conditioner even in warmer summers. But now the ice is thinner, younger and easier to push out of the Arctic, putting that crucial cooling system at more risk, the study's lead author said.Before 2007, 19% of the sea ice in the Arctic was at least 13 feet thick (4 meters) — taller than most elephants — but now only about 9.3% of ice is at least that thick. And the age of the ice has dropped by more than a third, from an average of 4.3 years to 2.7 years, according to the study in Wednesday's journal Nature.It cited “the long-lasting impact of climate change on the Arctic sea ice.”“Ice is much more vulnerable than before because it's thinner, it can easily melt,” said study lead author Hiroshi Sumata, a sea ice scientist at the Norwegian Polar Institute. Thicker sea ice is crucial to all sorts of life in the Arctic, he said.The study shows “how the Arctic sea ice environment has undergone a fundamental shift,” said Walt Meier, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who wasn't part of the research. “This paper helps explain why the sea ice has not recovered from those big drops.”Past studies concentrated more on the extent of Arctic sea ice, or how widespread it is, because that's easily measured by satellites, which don't observe volume well. But 90% of the sea ice eventually is pushed out of the Arctic through the Fram Strait by Greenland, so Sumata overcame the challenges of measuring from space by focusing his observations on that ground-based choke point.He found that first ice was getting younger, which made it thinner and more uniform, and easier to push out through the Fram Strait. Thicker ice has all sorts of edges and weird shapes that make it harder to force out of the Arctic because of aerodynamics, but that's not the case for sleeker, younger ice, Sumata said.Scientists had known before that sea ice was shrinking in extent and getting thinner, but this “flushing” is key, said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who wasn't part of the study.“Such flushing episodes have reduced the residence time of ice in the Arctic Ocean by more than a year so there's less time for it to thicken and it's the thick ice that's resistant to melting out,” Serreze said in an email. “But since the Arctic is quickly warming up, we're probably past the point of hoping the Arctic Ocean can recover.”What likely happened in 2005 and 2007 were periods with warm, large, ice-free open water in the Arctic that exceeded periods of previous summers, Sumata said. White ice reflects the sun's rays, but the dark ocean absorbs it and warms up — something called ice albedo feedback. This cycle of warmer water made it harder for ice to form, survive and get thicker, he said.Once the ocean has accumulated that heat, it can't go back easily. So in the future more big warmer shifts can happen to make ice thinner and weaker, but don’t count on sudden, healing cooling changes, scientists said.Sumata and Serreze think those sudden warm jumps will happen soon and are surprised they haven't quite happened yet. Recent projections predict the Arctic ocean will be ice free in parts of summer in 20 to 30 years.Sea ice thickness and overall Arctic health is crucial even to areas thousands of miles away that don't freeze up, Sumata said.“It will affect the entire Earth because the north and south pole is something like a radiator of the Earth, the air conditioning system of the Earth,” Sumata said. “And the situation we observed indicates the air conditioner is not working well.”___Follow AP’s climate and environment coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment___Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at @borenbears___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836630,"Texas announces takeover of Houston schools, stirring anger","HOUSTON (AP) — Texas officials on Wednesday announced a state takeover of Houston's nearly 200,000-student public school district, the eighth-largest in the country, acting on years of threats and angering Democrats who assailed the move as political.The announcement, made by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's education commissioner, Mike Morath, amounts to one of the largest school takeovers ever in the U.S. It also deepens a high-stakes rift between Texas' largest city, where Democrats wield control, and state Republican leaders, who have sought increased authority following election fumbles and COVID-19 restrictions.The takeover is the latest example of Republican and predominately white state officials pushing to take control of actions in heavily minority and Democratic-led cities. They include St. Louis and Jackson, Mississippi, where the Legislature is pushing to take over the water system and for an expanded role for state police and appointed judges.In a letter to the Houston Independent School District, Morath said the Texas Education Agency will replace Superintendent Millard House II and the district's elected board of trustees with a new superintendent and an appointed board of managers made of residents from within the district's boundaries.Morath said the board has failed to improve student outcomes while conducting “chaotic board meetings marred by infighting"" and violating open meetings act and procurement laws. He accused the district of failing to provide proper special education services and of violating state and federal laws with its approach to supporting students with disabilities.He cited the seven-year record of poor academic performance at one of the district's roughly 50 high schools, Wheatley High, as well as the poor performance of several other campuses.""The governing body of a school system bears ultimate responsibility for the outcomes of all students. While the current Board of Trustees has made progress, systemic problems in Houston ISD continue to impact district students,"" Morath wrote in his six-page letter.Most of Houston’s school board members have been replaced since the state began making moves toward a takeover in 2019. House became superintendent in 2021.He and the current school board will remain until the new board of managers is chosen sometime after June 1. The new board of managers will be appointed for at least two years.House in a statement pointed to strides made across the district, saying the announcement “does not discount the gains we have made.”He said his focus now will be on ensuring “a smooth transition without disruption to our core mission of providing an exceptional educational experience for all students.”The Texas State Teachers Association and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas condemned the takeover. At a news conference in Austin, state Democratic leaders called for the Legislature to increase funding for education and raise teacher pay.“We acknowledge that there’s been underperformance in the past, mainly due to that severe underfunding in our public schools,” state Rep. Armando Walle, who represents parts of north Houston, said.An annual Census Bureau survey of public school funding showed Texas spent $10,342 per pupil in the 2020 fiscal year, more than $3,000 less than the national average, according to the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice University in Houston.The state was able to take over the district under a change in state law that Houston Democratic state Rep. Harold Dutton Jr. proposed in 2015. In an op-ed piece in the Houston Chronicle on Monday, Dutton said he has no regrets about what he did.“We’re hearing voices of opposition, people who say that HISD shouldn’t have to face consequences for allowing a campus to fail for more than five consecutive years. Those critics’ concern is misplaced,” Dutton wrote.Schools in other big cities, including Philadelphia, New Orleans and Detroit, in recent decades have gone through state takeovers, which are generally viewed as last resorts for underperforming schools and are often met with community backlash. Critics argue that state interventions generally have not led to big improvements.Texas started moving to take over the district following allegations of misconduct by school trustees, including inappropriate influencing of vendor contracts, and chronically low academic scores at Wheatley High.The district sued to block a takeover, but new education laws subsequently passed by the GOP-controlled state Legislature and a January ruling from the Texas Supreme Court cleared the way for the state to seize control.“All of us Texans have an obligation and should come together to reinvent HISD in a way that will ensure that we’re going to be providing the best quality education for those kids,” Abbott said Wednesday.Schools in Houston are not under mayoral control, unlike in New York and Chicago, but as expectations of a takeover mounted, the city's Democratic leaders unified in opposition.Race is also an issue because the overwhelming majority of students in Houston schools are Hispanic or Black. Domingo Morel, a professor of political science and public services at New York University, said the political and racial dynamics in the Houston case are similar to instances where states have intervened elsewhere.“If we just focus on taking over school districts because they underperform, we would have a lot more takeovers,” Morel said. “But that's not what happens.""____Weber reported from Austin, Texas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836631,Indigenous farmworker leader bids for Guatemala presidency,"GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — An Indigenous female farmworker leader hopes to become Guatemala’s next president. But Thelma Cabrera faces an uphill fight, after the country’s Electoral Tribunal refused to allow her to register her candidacy.There is just one week left in the registration period for the June 25 elections, but Cabrera and her Movement for Peoples’ Liberation are vowing to go ahead with her campaign whether the gets registered or not.It was never going to be an easy fight. Even though the government's last census said around 48% of Guatemalans identify as Indigenous — and some Indigenous groups insist the number is higher — lighter-skinned elites have always ruled.Paradoxically, the tribunal barred Cabrera's running mate from registering their ticket on the grounds he did not supply a letter stating there are no corruption cases open against him — even though it allowed politicians with pending cases to register.“The political system has been corrupted,” said Cabrera. “The system itself has been designed by the corrupt to kept them free, but to tie the hands of those who are honest. We cannot stand this slavery we are living in anymore.”Cabrera, 52, has unlikely hands for a president, roughened by decades of washing clothes in a river and planting food. She has a sixth-grade education, which she calls “quite a lot for an Indigenous woman in Guatemala.""“We are seeking to transform the country, after all the injustices we have suffered,” Cabrera said in a recent interview at her home.The fight is not without risk. At least 26 members of the Farmworkers Development Committee — the group that founded the Movement for Peoples’ Liberation — have been killed since 2019.The group fights for land and public services for Indigenous people and it seeks to block privatizations. But it has also been accused of stealing electrical power and not paying for it.“They are afraid of us,” Cabrera said of the country's elites. “It is they who are afraid of a roadmap for the nation.”“Nobody is going to take anything away from anyone,” she said. “All we want is for everyone to do their duty.”While Guatemala has been ruled by a succession of male politicians representing the elites, Cabrera still lives in her humble, tin-roofed house in the village of El Asintal, on Guatemala's Pacific coast.Like many Guatemalans, Cabrera's daughter — one of her four children — emigrated to the United States in 2021, because she couldn't find a decent job in her homeland.The U.S. government has sharply criticized the weakening of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala, and in 2021 it cancelled the U.S. visa of Guatemalan Attorney General Consuelo Porras, who had been pursuing former prosecutors who conducted corruption investigations.Around 30 former anti-corruption officials have fled the country, and the persecution appears to have extended to journalists.President Alejandro Giammattei has been dismissive of U.S. officials’ criticism of his attorney general and what they see as Guatemala backsliding on battling corruption. The country’s new special prosecutor against impunity has been placed on a U.S. list of people suspected of corruption or undermining democracy. He is accused of obstructing corruption investigations.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836632,Israel says roadside bomb suspect may have come from Lebanon,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli army said Wednesday that soldiers killed an armed man suspected of entering the country from Lebanon and blowing up a car, raising the risk of renewed tensions with Hezbollah.The security situation in Israel prompted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut in half his planned two-day visit to Germany this week, his office said. The incident unnerved Israelis, who questioned on social media and elsewhere how someone with explosives could travel dozens of kilometers inside Israel and set off a roadside bomb before being detected.The army said soldiers stopped a car carrying the bombing suspect at a checkpoint Monday shortly after a roadside explosion seriously injured a driver near Megiddo Junction in the country’s north. The suspect was wearing a suicide vest and had a rifle and a gun when he was stopped near the border with Lebanon. The army said it shot and killed the man and is questioning the driver.The army said the device exploded at a 90-degree angle, which is unusual for the area. That led officials to suspect that the man infiltrated from Lebanon and may have been linked to Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group.The army said it did not release the details of the incident for two days because it was trying to determine the suspect's identity, which it did not release.Netanyahu received a briefing on the incident Wednesday, which his office said led him to shorten his trip to Germany. The trip also was delayed, Israeli media reported, by negotiations over a proposal to overhaul Israel's judicial system, which has prompted massive protests.A Hezbollah spokesman in Beirut did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. But in a speech last week, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said Israel was growing weaker. “There is no security, there is no stability and there are no guarantees of the future,” he said.Israel and Hezbollah are bitter enemies that fought a monthlong war in the summer of 2006. Israel considers the Iran-backed Shiite militant group its most serious immediate threat, estimating that Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles aimed at Israel.Israel's northern border with Lebanon has remained quiet but tense since the 2006 war.But Israel discovered four years ago what it said was a network of tunnels built by Hezbollah along the border.

It wanted to halt the competition until a decision was made to its challenge of a 1-1 draw against Elche in January, when a video review failed to spot that an Elche player was clearly in an offside position in the buildup to Elche’s 81st-minute equalizer. ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

I think that kind of makes these moments the same.”Starocci beat the No. 2 seed at 174 pounds, Nebraska’s Mikey Labriola, 6-1 in the Big Ten final. Virginia Tech’s Mekhi Lewis, the outstanding wrestler at the 2019 championships and 165-pound national champ that year, is the No. 3 seed at 174 this year.Bravo-Young has some tough competition ahead at 133. Oklahoma State’s Daton Fix was a world silver medalist in 2021, but he has yet to win a national title. He’s a three-time runner-up who Bravo-Young defeated in the finals last year.

Economic Commission for Africa told The Associated Press.Climate change, alongside the war in Ukraine and a global economic slowdown have been identified as key factors that have led to Africa’s economic decline from a growth of 4.6% in 2021 to just 3.6% in 2022, the U.N. report said.The meeting comes as weather extremes are crippling parts of the continent: A punishing cyclone in Malawi and Mozambique has so far claimed more than 225 lives, displaced over 100,000 people and destroyed infrastructure and property. In the east and Horn of Africa, a debilitating drought has put the region on the throes of a famine.Africa contributes less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions despite being home to 17% of the world’s population. Many nations have limited capabilities to deal with the impacts of climate change. Some estimates say the continent will need investments of over $3 trillion by 2030 to adequately adapt to climate change and curb emissions.“Climate change has tremendous impacts in African economies and climate action is impossible without climate finance,"" said Nemera Gebeyehu Mamo Ethiopia’s planning minister. ""Leveraging climate finance can fight poverty and inequality in Africa.”A pledge by rich nations to provide $100 billion a year in climate finance has not yet been fully met.Pedro called on African countries to take matters into their own hands and raise funds by developing carbon credits, where companies and governments pay into reforestation schemes to offset their emissions.“If we take advantage of our rainforests and develop our carbon markets, we could unleash an estimated $82 billion a year in value,"" Pedro said, adding it could create millions of jobs across the continent.___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836638,Court: Ukraine can try to avoid repaying $3B loan to Russia,"LONDON (AP) — The U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that Ukraine can go to trial to try to avoid repaying $3 billion in loans it said it took under pressure from Russia in 2013 to prevent it from trying to join the European Union.The court rejected an attempt to avoid a trial by a British company acting on Russia's behalf to collect the loans. Ukraine said it borrowed the money while facing the threat of military force and massive illegal economic and political pressure nearly a decade before Russia invaded its neighbor.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that the ruling was “another decisive victory against the aggressor.”“The Court has ruled that Ukraine’s defense based on Russia’s threats of aggression will have a full public trial,” he tweeted. “Justice will be ours.”The case was argued in November 2021, and the court was not asked to consider Russia's invasion of Ukraine three months later.Ukrainian authorities allege that the corrupt government of pro-Russian Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych borrowed the money from Moscow under pressure before he was ousted in protests in February 2014, shortly before Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.After the 2014 Ukraine revolution, the country’s new government refused to repay the debt in December 2015, saying Moscow wouldn't agree to terms already accepted by other international creditors.The case came to British courts because London-based Law Debenture Trust Corp. had been appointed by Ukraine to represent the interests of bondholders. The company initially won a judgment to avoid trial but Ukraine appealed.The Supreme Court rejected several of Ukraine's legal arguments, including that its finance minister didn't have authority to enter into the loan agreement and that Ukraine could decline payment as a countermeasure to Russia's aggressions.The ruling, however, said a court could consider whether the deal was void because of threats or pressure that are illegitimate under English law.While the court noted that trade sanctions, embargoes and other economic pressures are ""normal aspects of statecraft,"" economic pressures could provide context to prove that Russia's threats to destroy Ukraine caused it to issue the bonds.“The success of Ukraine’s defense turns on whether Russia’s threatened use of force imposed what English law regards as illegitimate pressure on Ukraine to enter into the trust deed and related contracts,” the court wrote. ""That question can only be determined after trial.""Ukraine said that a month before it entered into the deal, Yanukovych told his Lithuanian counterpart that Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to have Moscow's banks bankrupt eastern Ukrainian factories if it signed an association agreement with the EU.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said the U.K. court recognized the coercion.“Now, the Kremlin will have to disclose all information about the actions against Ukraine in open court,” Shmyhal said. “Justice will definitely prevail. Russia will definitely answer for all its illegal actions and crimes.”___Associated Press writer Yuras Karmanau contributed from Tallinn, Estonia.",2023/3/16,,World

(AP) — Moonwalking astronauts will have sleeker, more flexible spacesuits that come in different sizes when they step onto the lunar surface later this decade.Exactly what that looks like remained under wraps. The company designing the next-generation spacesuits, Axiom Space, said Wednesday that it plans to have new versions for training purposes for NASA later this summer.The moonsuits will be white like they were during NASA’s Apollo program more than a half-century ago, according to the company. That’s so they can reflect heat and keep future moonwalkers cool.The suits will provide greater flexibility and more protection from the moon’s harsh environment, and will come in a wider range of sizes, according to the Houston-based company.NASA awarded Axiom Space a $228.5 million contract to provide the outfits for the first moon landing in more than 50 years. The space agency is targeting late 2025 at the earliest to land two astronauts on the moon’s south pole.At Wednesday's event in Houston, an Axiom employee modeled a dark spacesuit, doing squats and twisting at the waist to demonstrate its flexibility. The company said the final version will be different, including the color.“I didn't want anybody to get that mixed up,” said Axiom’s Russell Ralston.___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836641,St. Louis prosecutor: Ouster effort is politically motivated,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The elected prosecutor in St. Louis, under intense criticism after a visiting teenage athlete lost her legs in a crash blamed on a man who remained free from jail despite multiple bond violations, is accusing Missouri's attorney general of seeking her ouster for political gain.Democratic Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner filed a court response late Tuesday to Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey's lawsuit that seeks to remove her from office. Bailey's effort includes criticism that too many cases, including homicides, go unpunished, that victims and their families are left uninformed, and that Gardner's office is too slow to take on cases brought by police.Criticism of Gardner escalated last month after 17-year-old Janae Edmondson, a volleyball standout from Tennessee, was struck by a speeding car as she and her family walked to their hotel following a tournament game in downtown St. Louis. The driver, 21-year-old Daniel Riley, was out on bond on a robbery charge despite nearly 100 bond violations that included letting his GPS monitor die and breaking terms of his house arrest, according to court records. Critics of Gardner questioned why Riley was allowed to remain free despite so many bond violations.“Mr. Bailey’s Petition seeks to take advantage of a tragedy for political gain, while ignoring the will of the voters,” Gardner’s petition states.Her response says Bailey has no right under the Missouri Constitution to remove her from office simply for what he perceives as mistakes.“But every office will make some mistakes,” according to her filing. It adds that letting the petition proceed would allow any attorney general ""to thwart the will of the people of a locality who have elected the prosecutor of their choice, as the people of St. Louis twice have Ms. Gardner, and say, ‘I know better, so she’s fired.’”Gardner was first elected in 2016 and easily won reelection in 2020. She is St. Louis' first Black circuit attorney. She and many civil rights leaders believe the effort to remove her is motivated not only by politics, but by race.Gardner drew national attention in 2018 when she charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy, accusing him of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. The charge was eventually dropped. But Greitens, a Republican who was also under investigation by Missouri lawmakers, resigned in June 2018.The case drew scrutiny that led to the conviction of Gardner’s investigator. Gardner received a written reprimand for failing to produce documents and mistakenly maintaining that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers.In 2019, she drew the ire of St. Louis police when she placed dozens of officers on an “exclusion list” prohibiting them from bringing cases. The list was developed after a national group accused the officers of posting racist and anti-Muslim comments on social mediaThe next year, Gardner filed a lawsuit accusing the city, a police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office.In addition to the lawsuit, a Republican-led bill in the statehouse would give the governor authority to appoint a special prosecutor to take on violent crimes in counties with a homicide rate over a certain threshold, effectively stripping Gardner of power. Bill sponsor Rep. Lane Roberts said his legislation currently would apply only to St. Louis, but Jackson County, home to parts of Kansas City, is “dangerously close” to reaching the threshold.Republicans also are pushing a bill that would give the state control of St. Louis police, arguing that the city is failing to control crime. Black St. Louis Democrats decried the majority white Legislature for trying to take away control from Black city leaders.Edmondson has been moved from a St. Louis hospital to one in the Nashville area, said Jeff Wismer, one of the coaches at Mid-TN Volleyball Club. She is “trying to push forward in the new version of her life,” Wismer said.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836642,US slaps sanctions on Bosnia’s former intelligence chief,"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — The U.S. government imposed sanctions Wednesday on the former head of Bosnia’s state security agency, accusing him of misusing state resources for the benefit of his political party and collaborating with criminal networks to enrich himself.The Treasury Department alleged that Osman Mehmedagic misused his position to instruct a state-owned telecom company to collect cellular activity of politicians not affiliated with the SDA party.Treasury said in a statement that Mehmedagic also “has used his position, threats and connections” to sway candidates from an alliance of parties that defeated his party in general elections last October to support the SDA during ensuing coalition talks.“There is also credible information that Mehmedagic has collaborated with criminal networks to enrich himself and his political party,” the statement added.Mehmedagic was replaced as head of the state security agency last month after more than 7 years on the post.Also Wednesday, the Treasury Department levied sanctions on Edin Gacanin, born in Bosnia but raised in the Netherlands, accusing him of being “one of the world’s most prolific drug traffickers.”Treasury said Gacanin was the leader of the Tito and Dino Cartel, “which includes his family members and his friends” from Bosnia and also engages in money laundering.The sanctions against Gacanin, it added, were closely coordinated with the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration, the European Union’s Europol agency, and the governments of The Netherlands, France and Belgium.Any property or interest belonging to the sanctioned individuals in the United States is blocked and must be reported.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836643,Garcetti confirmed as India ambassador after 20-month fight,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti won confirmation Wednesday from a divided Senate as the nation’s next ambassador to India, more than a year and a half after he was first nominated by President Joe Biden and after weathering doubts about his truthfulness in a sexual harassment scandal involving a City Hall adviser.The 52-42 vote gave the administration a long-sought victory with several Republicans breaking party discipline for the vote that they said was critical to fill one of the country’s highest-profile diplomatic posts.“It’s a national security imperative to immediately have an ambassador in place in India. We can’t afford to wait any longer,” said Indiana Sen. Todd Young, one of the Republican crossover votes.The day began with uncertain prospects for Garcetti, a two-term, progressive Democrat first nominated to the diplomatic post by Biden in July 2021.With several Democrats defecting, Garcetti's fate rested with Republican senators in a chamber often divided along partisan lines. He secured seven GOP votes, more than enough to make up for the Democratic breakaways.Kansas Republican Roger Marshall said having an ambassador in place in India was vital in advancing relations among members of the “quad” — the U.S. India, Australia and Japan, which he said puts pressure on China.“We don’t agree on all the different policies he did as mayor, but I think he’s a good person at heart and he would be a good ambassador,” Marshall said. He said on the allegations: “He answered my questions adequately.”At the White House, spokesperson Olivia Dalton said Biden “believes that we have a crucial and consequential partnership with India and that Mayor Garcetti will make a strong and effective ambassador.”The vacancy in the ambassadorship had left a significant diplomatic gap for the administration at a time of rising global tensions, including China’s increasingly assertive presence in the Pacific region and Russia’s war with Ukraine.India, the world’s most populous democracy, is continuing to buy oil from Russia, while Western governments move to limit fossil fuel earnings that support Moscow’s budget, its military and its invasion of Ukraine. Russia also provides the majority of India’s military hardware.The nomination had been freighted with questions about what the former mayor knew, and when, about sexual harassment allegations against his friend and once-close adviser, Rick Jacobs. A lawsuit alleges that Jacobs frequently harassed one of the then-mayor’s police bodyguards while Garcetti ignored the abuse or laughed it off.Garcetti, the son of former Los Angeles district attorney Gil Garcetti, has repeatedly denied the claims. Jacobs has called the allegations against him “pure fiction.” The case is scheduled to go to trial later this year.At a Senate committee hearing in December 2021, Garcetti said, “I never witnessed, nor was it brought to my attention, the behavior that’s been alleged. … If it had been, I would have immediately taken action to stop that.”Wednesday's vote tested Democratic loyalty to Biden, and also measured assessments of Garcetti’s judgment and trustworthiness, stemming from the City Hall allegations that shadowed him in the #MeToo era.“I think we can find somebody that will do the job better,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, one of the Democrats who opposed Garcetti.Garcetti also failed to win over Democrat Mark Kelly of Arizona, who said he had “serious concerns.”Rachel Rizzo, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said she sensed frustration about the lack of an ambassador during a recent trip to India. She said it gave ""an impression that the relationship isn’t important.”“It really points to the internal dysfunction in the U.S. Congress at the moment, and it makes it very hard for us to send the messages that we’re trying to send when it looks to our diplomatic partners that we don’t have our house in order,” she said.Last May, a top Senate Republican released an investigation t hat concluded Garcetti “likely knew or should have known” that Jacobs was alleged to be sexually harassing city employees, a finding that appeared to contradict the mayor’s assertion that he was unaware of any inappropriate behavior. The 23-page report released by Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa found it was “extremely unlikely” that the mayor would not have been aware.The White House called that report a partisan smear.In a final push to stop the nomination, Grassley released a statement Tuesday saying his office identified at least 19 people who said they either witnessed inappropriate behavior by Jacobs or were victims of it.“On the one hand, the Biden administration says it supports victims,"" Grassley wrote. ""Yet, on the other hand, the Biden administration supports a nominee who enables misconduct that creates more victims.”The legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, which sought to defeat the nomination, said the vote “will have a chilling effect on future attempts to hold enablers and perpetrators to account and cause victims and witnesses to think twice about the risks they are taking in coming forward.”The nomination, first announced in July 2021, cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 2022 but was not considered by the full Senate. Biden renominated Garcetti early this year, and the White House has defended him as a well-qualified candidate.On a politically divided vote, the committee again advanced the nomination to the full Senate early this month, though Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the panel, said that “new evidence” had raised questions about Garcetti’s judgment and prompted him to oppose the nomination.Garcetti’s confirmation follows a contentious tenure at Los Angeles City Hall framed by rising homelessness, the pandemic and high crime rates as well as sexual harassment and corruption scandals. The Los Angeles area, once known for boundless growth, has seen its population decline.Garcetti took office in 2013 with a “back to basics” agenda that centered on fixing L.A.’s notoriously cratered streets and sidewalks. But those early ambitions faded as out-of-control homeless encampments transformed the city and then the government shuttered businesses, restaurants and schoolrooms — and shed hundreds of thousands of jobs — in the depths of the pandemic.Still, the former mayor has been credited with continuing a transit buildup in a city choked with traffic and establishing tougher earthquake safety standards for thousands of buildings.An Ivy Leaguer and Rhodes Scholar, he spent two decades in city government either as mayor or a city councilman and took a circuitous path toward the diplomatic corps. Ambassadorships are frequently a reward for political supporters.Garcetti considered a 2020 White House run but later became part of Biden’s inner circle, emerging as a widely discussed possibility to join the Cabinet. He took himself out of the running after many of the plum jobs had been filled, saying the coronavirus crisis at the time made it impossible for him to step away from City Hall.___Associated Press writers Seung Min Kim, Lisa Mascaro, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking and Stephen Groves contributed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836644,EPA 'neighbor' rule cuts downwind pollution by power plants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A new “good neighbor” rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency will restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution they can’t control. Nearly two dozen states will have to cut harmful industrial emissions of nitrogen oxide and other pollutants to improve air quality for millions of people living in downwind communities.The final rule, issued Wednesday, will save thousands of lives, keep tens of thousands of people out of the hospital, prevent millions of asthma attacks and reduce sick days, according to the agency.“Every community deserves fresh air to breathe. We know air pollution doesn’t stop at the state line,'' said EPA Administrator Michael Regan.The rule will take effect in May for power plants and ""lock in significant pollution reductions to ensure cleaner air and deliver public health protections for those who’ve suffered far too long from air-quality related impacts and illness,” Regan said. The limits on industrial sites take effect in 2026.States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites don’t add significantly to air pollution in other states. In cases where a state has not submitted a “good neighbor” plan — or where EPA disapproves a state plan — the federal plan would take effect to ensure downwind states are protected.A 2015 rule set by EPA blocks states from adding to ozone pollution in other localities. The rule applies mostly to states in the South and Midwest that contribute to air pollution along the East Coast. Some states, such as Texas, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Wisconsin, both contribute to downwind pollution and receive it from other states.Environmental and public health advocates hailed the final rule as a life-saving measure that will significantly cut air pollution that crosses state lines, harming people who live hundreds of miles away from power plants, cement factories, steel mills and other industrial polluters.“Too many communities breathe unhealthy air because pollution from power plants and industrial sources blows across state lines,'' said Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association. “This rule will curb emissions that contribute to unhealthy levels of ozone in downwind communities and help achieve cleaner air for people who live near polluting sources.''The National Mining Association slammed the rule as part of an ongoing, cumulative effort by the EPA under President Joe Biden to force the closure of coal-fired power plants across the country.“With each rule that targets well-operating coal plants – the very same plants that are called on to keep the lights on when renewables or natural gas are unavailable and consumer demand soars – our electricity grid becomes increasingly vulnerable to crippling supply shortfalls,'' said Conor Bernstein, vice president of the mining group.The cross-state pollution rule, combined with rules on wastewater pollution, mercury and air toxics, and rules expected on greenhouse gas emissions, “make it impossible for utilities to make decisions based on the merits of what keeps the lights on, forcing those utilities to make decisions solely based on the EPA’s agenda,'' Bernstein said.He faulted EPA for failing to consider what he called ""America’s energy reality.'’ As a result, “Americans and American businesses will continue to pay increasingly more for electricity that is less and less reliable,'' Bernstein said. ""Even worse, the EPA is unilaterally making these decisions for the states.''Regan disputed that, saying EPA considered thousands of comments on the rule, including from the power industry.""We have worked with a lot of our grid operators and our regional planning organizations that focus on managing electricity. And we have really prioritized reliability,'' he told reporters in a conference call Wednesday.Regan dismissed complaints by West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito that the rule could threaten electricity affordability and reliability in their state and others.The rule gives power plants flexibility for how to comply, including longstanding emissions trading programs and scrubbers used by many power plants, EPA said.""This rule has some built-in features that we believe allows for us to achieve our public health goals, but also doesn’t jeopardize reliability,'' Regan said.Electricity produced from coal has dropped dramatically in the U.S. over the past decade and-a-half, thanks to competition from cheap and abundant natural gas, declining prices for renewable energy and environmental regulations. Many plants have been shuttered, and a further 23% of the country’s operating coal-powered fleet is scheduled to retire by 2029, according to the Energy Information Administration.Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly vulnerable.A 2021 report by the lung association found that more than 123 million Americans lived in counties that experienced repeated instances of unhealthy ozone levels. Climate change will likely exacerbate the problem by causing more hot sunny days conducive to high ozone levels.Hayden Hashimoto, a lawyer for the Boston-based Clean Air Task Force, said the new rule will protect residents of downwind states — including many in the East Coast — from smog caused by inadequate pollution controls in upwind states in the Midwest.""Downwind states that have already reduced their emissions have been left in the untenable position of trying to solve air quality problems that have been largely caused by upwind sources” from nearby states, he said.America’s Power, a group that advocates for the coal fleet and its suppliers, said EPA was imposing an “anti-coal bias” on states and the nation’s electricity supply. The final rule will result in more coal plant retirements and increase risks to grid reliability, said Michelle Bloodworth, the group's president.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836645,Students call for education reform in Hungary protest march,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Thousands of students and other opponents of Hungary's government marched in the capital Budapest on Wednesday to demand educational reforms and a change in the Central European country's political culture.The protest, dubbed a “freedom march” by organizers, was called by teachers unions and student groups who have spent months pressuring Hungary's government to provide salary raises and better working conditions for educators. The groups have also demanded the repeal of legislation that limits teachers' right to strike.Marchers chanted slogans like “no teachers, no future” and “striking is a basic right” as they moved down one of Budapest's main avenues. Student groups and teachers have engaged in strikes, walkouts and other acts of civil disobedience in recent months after the government didn't fulfill their demands, resulting in several teacher firings.Katalin Torley, a teacher that was fired from a Budapest high school after working there for 23 years, said at the demonstration that Hungary had become an “extremely centralized authoritarian system” which has taken away autonomy from those working in the public sphere.“I think that this movement is not anti-government but against the system,” she said. “Those teachers who engaged in civil disobedience showed that a normal system must be restored.”The March 15 demonstration came on a national holiday commemorating the 175th anniversary of Hungary’s failed 1848 revolution against Habsburg rule. One of Hungary's most important national holidays, March 15 often features large patriotic demonstrations as well as protests in the capital.Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, broke with his tradition of giving an address in Budapest, instead speaking to supporters in the small town of Kiskoros, around two hours from the capital.The address was given in front of the childhood home of Sandor Petofi, widely regarded as one of Hungary’s greatest poets who was instrumental in fomenting the Hungarian rebellion against the Austrian empire in 1848.In his speech, Orbán spoke at length about Petofi's contributions to Hungarian political culture, saying the poet had “created the dialect of Hungarian freedom.”Although Petofi is thought to have been killed in 1849 as he fought in the revolution, Hungarians still feel his presence today when foreign forces attempt to impose their will on Hungary, Orbán said.“He flashes before our eyes, whenever we hesitate, when we falter. We see him as he rebels when foreigners want to tell the Hungarians how to live. We see him turning against the great powers of the world who want to reintegrate Hungarians into a European superstate,” he said.Hungary's government is a frequent critic of the European Union, which has held up billions in funding to Budapest over concerns that Orbán has overseen widespread official corruption and violated the bloc's rule-of-law standards.Orbán has often referred to the EU as an “empire” that seeks to dominate Hungary, just as the Austrian Empire and Soviet Union had in the 19th and 20th centuries. He won his fourth-straight term in office in elections in 2022.“We will never allow the flag of freedom to be wrenched from the hands of the Hungarians,” Orbán said Wednesday. “We will not allow it, and it will not succeed.”___A previous version of this story was corrected to show that the demonstration marked the 175th anniversary of the uprising, not the 150th.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836654,Gio Reyna on US roster after family tried to oust Berhalter,"NEW YORK (AP) — Gio Reyna, whose parents tried to oust U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter after the 20-year-old midfielder was sparingly used at the World Cup, was selected Wednesday by interim coach Anthony Hudson for CONCACAF Nations League matches against Grenada and El Salvador.Reyna made two substitute appearances during the World Cup totaling 52 minutes and Berhalter later said he almost sent a player home because of lack of hustle — remarks Reyna admitted were aimed at him. His parents, former U.S. captain Claudio Reyna and women’s national team midfielder Daniele Egan Reyna, then complained to U.S. Soccer Federation officials and notified them of a 1992 domestic violence incident involving Daniele’s college roommate and Berhalter’s future wife.The USSF commissioned a law firm to investigate, which determined Berhalter did not improperly withhold information of the incident. Hudson was appointed interim coach during the probe and will remain on until after a new USSF sporting director is hired and supervises the coach search. Berhalter is still a candidate.Reyna scored in his first three games for Borussia Dortmund after the World Cup and has appeared in seven matches, six as a substitute.""""For anyone to go through that is going to be a challenge,"" Hudson said. “Speaking to him this week, there was no hesitation from him about coming in. He’s determined to come in and do well.”Hudson said he was not contacted by either of Reyna's parents during the World Cup and that he isn't worried about how people view either his non-use of Reyna, saying: “It’s just not come into my thinking at all.”U.S. captain Tyler Adams will miss the matches at the end of the month because of a hamstring injury. Goalkeeper Zack Steffen and forward Ricardo Pepi are on the 24-man roster after Berhalter left them off of the World Cup squad.Pepi criticized Berhalter following his omission and has eight goals in his last 18 Eredivisie matches for Groningen. Hudson said that Pepi is ""really finding form, finding confidence and he’s been doing well.”Defender Miles Robinson is back after missing the World Cup because of a torn left Achilles last May 7. He returned to Atlanta’s lineup on Feb. 25, the first of three MLS matches he has played this season, and likely will be limited to one of the upcoming matches.The full player pool is available for the first time since the Americans were eliminated from the World Cup with a 3-1 loss to the Netherlands in the round of 16. Hudson said he limited selections from Major League Soccer to just Robinson because other MLS players will have to miss club matches in June and July for national team games.The U.S. is planning to use predominantly Europe-based players for the Nations League final four in mid-June and mostly MLS for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, which runs from June 26 to July 17.“The overseas players are going to need a break,” Hudson said, noting that it “worked very well” in 2021.Forward Daryl Dike returns for the first time since the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup after a hamstring injury and torn thigh muscle limited him to one first-team club match for second-tier West Bromwich Albion between January 2022 and November. Defender Bryan Reynolds is back for the first time since December 2021.Taylor Booth, a 21-year-old Utrecht winger, and Auston Trusty, a 24-year-old Birmingham defender, could make debuts.Players returning to the roster include midfielders Johnny Cordoso of Internacional and Alan Soñora of Juárez. América forward Alex Zendejas is on the roster after making his debut in the Jan. 25 exhibition win over Serbia, when most top players were unavailable. The Mexican-American said this week he has committed his international future to the U.S.The U.S. plays at Grenada on March 24 and El Salvador three days later at Orlando, Florida.Thirteen players who were on the World Cup roster were omitted: Adams, goalkeeper Sean Johnson; defenders Cameron Carter-Vickers, Aaron Long, Shaq Moore, DeAndre Yedlin and Walker Zimmerman; midfielders Kellyn Acosta and Cristian Roldan; and forwards Jesús Ferreira, Jordan Morris, Josh Sargent and Haji Wright.Holdovers from the World Cup roster — in addition to Reyna — are goalkeepers Matt Turner and Ethan Horvath; defenders Sergiño Dest, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson and Joe Scally; midfielders Brenden Aaronson, Luca de la Torre, Weston McKennie and Yunus Musah; and wingers Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah.Hudson said 19-year-old Wolfsburg left back Kevin Paredes is close to being called in and the American staff has been talking with Folarin Balogun, a 21-year-old midfielder eligible to play for the U.S., England and Nigeria. Balogun is fourth in France's Ligue 1 this season with 14 goals for Reims, on a loan from Arsenal.“There is open dialogue with him and his team,"" Hudson said. “That dialogue is continuing.”___The roster:Goalkeepers: Ethan Horvath (Luton, England), Zack Steffen (Middlesbrough, England), Matt Turner (Arsenal, England)Defenders: Sergiño Dest (AC Milan, Italy), Mark McKenzie (Genk, Belgium), Tim Ream (Fulham, England), Bryan Reynolds (Westerlo, Belgium), Antonee Robinson (Fulham, England), Miles Robinson (Atlanta), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach, Germany), Auston Trusty (Birmingham, England)Midfielders: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds, England), Johnny Cardoso (Internacional, Brazil), Luca de la Torre (Celta Vigo, Spain), Weston McKennie (Leeds, England), Yunus Musah (Valencia, Spain), Alan Soñora (Juárez, Mexico)Forwards: Taylor Booth (Utrecht, Netherlands), Daryl Dike (West Bromwich Albion, England), Ricardo Pepi (Groningen, Netherlands), Christian Pulisic (Chelsea, England), Gio Reyna (Borussia Dortmund, Germany), Tim Weah (Lille, France), Alex Zendejas (América, Mexico)___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836656,Storms end Southern California water restrictions for 7M,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — California’s 11th atmospheric river left the storm-soaked state with a bang Wednesday, bringing flooded roadways, landslides and toppled trees to the southern part of the state as well as drought-busting rainfall that meant the end of water restrictions for nearly 7 million people.Even as residents struggled to clean up before the next round of winter arrives in the coming days — with some 27,000 people still under evacuation orders statewide Wednesday — the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's decision brought relief amid the state's historic drought.The district supplies water for 19 million people in six counties. The board imposed the restrictions, which included limiting outdoor watering to one day a week, in parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties last year during a severe shortage of state water supplies.But weather woes remained Wednesday, as an additional 61,000 people remained under evacuation warnings and emergency shelters housed more than 650 people, according to the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services.Meanwhile in Arizona, the city of Sedona urged people in a dozen areas to immediately evacuate Wednesday evening because of predicted flooding of Oak Creek. The churning waters had submerged a roadway near a mobile home park and forecasters said it could rise to 15 feet (4.6 meters), a foot above flood stage.In Southern California, flooding also closed several miles of the Pacific Coast Highway through Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles on the Orange County coast, and potholes disabled more than 30 cars on one Southern California freeway. More than 144,000 utility customers statewide remained without power Wednesday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us.Some Southern California beaches were closed as heavy rain overwhelmed sewage systems and sent thousands of gallons of raw sewage to the sea.In Los Angeles, a man who clung to a concrete wall of the rushing, rain-swollen Los Angeles River was saved from being swept away when a Fire Department rescuer, dangling from a helicopter, reached him and he was hauled up to safety.Gov. Gavin Newsom surveyed flood damage in an agricultural region on the central coast, noting that California could potentially see a 12th atmospheric river next week. Officials have not yet determined the extent of the winter storms' damage, both structurally and financially.“Look back — last few years in this state, it's been fire to ice with no warm bath in between,” the Democrat said, describing “weather whiplash” in a state that has quickly gone from extreme drought and wildfires to overwhelming snow and rain.“If anyone has any doubt about Mother Nature and her fury, if anyone has any doubt about what this is all about in terms of what's happening to the climate and the changes that we are experiencing, come to California,” the governor said.California’s latest atmospheric river was one of two storm systems that bookended the U.S. this week. Parts of New England and New York were digging out of a nor’easter Wednesday that caused tens of thousands of power outages, numerous school cancellations and whiteout conditions on roads.Remaining showers across Southern California were expected to decrease through Wednesday evening as the storm headed toward parts of the Great Basin. The weather service said California will see minor precipitation this weekend, followed by another substantial storm next week.Three clifftop apartment buildings were evacuated Wednesday morning when earth slid away from their backyards in coastal San Clemente, the Orange County Fire Authority said. Residents were also cleared out of a nearby building as the severity of the slide was studied.Orange County had already declared a local emergency when a similar hillside collapsed March 3 in Newport Beach, leaving a house uninhabitable and endangering others.For downtown Los Angeles, the National Weather Service said just under two feet of rain (61 centimeters) has been recorded so far this water year — making this the 14th wettest in more than 140 years of records.An overnight mudslide onto a road in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles County trapped two cars, KNBC-TV reported. Another hillside in the neighborhood also gave way, threatening the foundation of a hilltop home.Weather in the northern and central sections of the state had dried out earlier, following Tuesday’s heavy rain and fierce winds that blew out windows on a San Francisco high-rise and gusted to 74 mph (119 kph) at the city’s airport.Forty-three of the state’s 58 counties have been under states of emergency due to the storms.Despite California’s rains winding down, flood warnings remain in effect on the central coast for the Salinas and Pajaro rivers in Monterey County and other rivers in the Central Valley as water runs off land that has been saturated by storms since late December.Runoff from a powerful atmospheric river last week burst a levee on the Pajaro River, triggering evacuations as water flooded farmland and agricultural communities. Nearly half of the people under evacuation orders were in Monterey County. Closed sections of the Pacific Coast Highway in the area were expected to reopen Wednesday night.The first phase of repairs on the 400-foot (120-meter) levee breach was completed Tuesday afternoon, and crews were working to raise the section to full height, county officials said.Damage continued to emerge elsewhere in the state. In the Sequoia National Forest, the Alta Sierra Ski Resort said it would be closed for at least two weeks because of extensive flooding and infrastructure damage, citing the U.S. Forest Service. There is also “massive slide potential” on the highway serving the resort, the resort tweeted.California was deep in drought before an unexpected series of atmospheric rivers barreled into the state from late December through mid-January, causing flooding while building a staggering snowpack in the Sierra Nevada.Storms powered by arctic air followed in February, creating blizzard conditions that buried mountain communities under so much snow that structures began collapsing.The water content of the Sierra snowpack is now more than 200% of the April 1 average, when it normally peaks, according to the state Department of Water Resources.Michael McNutt, a spokesperson for the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, said the end of the Southern California restrictions is good news but cautioned people to continue to conserve water even in non-drought years.“We all know that the next drought is just around the corner,” he said Wednesday. “We’ve got to treat the water coming out of our taps as the liquid gold that it is.”The district depends almost entirely on state water supplies and had adopted aggressive conservation measures, including putting devices that drastically restrict water flow onto the homes of hundreds of people — including celebrities — who were deemed to be wasting water.That program is now on hold, as is the district’s restrictions on lawn watering.___AP Writer Krysta Fauria contributed to this report.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836662,Falling stocks in Europe and US stoke banking crisis fears,"A record drop in shares at Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse on Wednesday has fanned fears of a possible banking crisis.US-listed shares at the global investment bank plummeted by more than a quarter after the banks largest shareholder — the Saudi National Bank — said it would not inject in more cash into the bank.The Financial Times reported that Credit Suisse had appealed to the Swiss National Bank for a public show of support, citing people familiar with the matter.At the close of trade in Europe on Wednesday, Credit Suisse's stock price was down 24%, having recovered slightly from its lowest ebb during the day. It was trading at around €1.84 — compared to almost €3 per share last week and more than €7.50 per share late last March.Stocks fell in Europe and Wall Street on Wednesday amid worries about the strength of banks on either side of the Atlantic.The volatility comes after last weeks sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the US which forced authorities to intervene to prevent the spread of market disturbances.Multi-national investment firm BlackRock's Chief Executive, Laurence Fink, warned on Wednesday that the US regional banking sector was at risk, and predicted continued high inflation and rate increases.Europe's bank index has seen more than €120 billion ($127 billion) of value by market capitalization wiped out since March 8.Germany's financial supervisory authority (BaFin) has moved to allay fears and said the German banking system appeared robust and capable of absorbing higher interest rates.""Our main focus is currently on some smaller banks with little surplus capital and increased interest rate risks — we are closely monitoring these institutions,"" a BaFin spokesperson said in a statement.The European Central Bank looks poised to hike interest rates again on Thursday in a bid to tackle high inflation.Reuters news agency cited a spokesperson from the US treasury as saying that officials are ""monitoring"" the problems surrounding Credit Suisse and that they have ""been in touch with global counterparts.""kb/msh (Reuters, AP)",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836663,Champions League: Frankfurt fans away at Napoli despite ban,"Eintracht Frankfurt supporters have been involved in violent clashes with rival fans and local police in Naples, Italy, ahead of their team's Champions League last-16 second leg against SSC Napoli on Wednesday night.Despite the German club having turned down their entire ticket allocation for the match at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona after a series of legal wranglings with the Italian authorities (see below), several hundred Frankfurt ultras still traveled to the southern Italian port, accompanied by ""allied"" ultras from Italian side Atalanta.The majority arrived by train on Tuesday night and were taken by bus under police escort to the Royal Hotel Continental on the seafront in central Naples. They were joined on Wednesday morning by a further 100 fans.Around midday on Wednesday, with their numbers swelled to around 600, the Frankfurt fans left the hotel and marched along the promenade, closely watched by Italian anti-terrorist police. When it began to rain in the afternoon, they sheltered at cafes on the Piazza del Gesu.Local Italian media reported that Frankfurt supporters with valid tickets in the home sections would be allowed to proceed to the stadium provided they did not have a registered address in the city of Frankfurt. The rest were to escorted back to the hotel to watch the match on a big screen.The atmosphere remained relatively subdued until late-afternoon when, with police taking up positions to escort Frankfurt fans back to their hotel, stones and bottles were thrown and skirmishes ensued.The situation escalated further when local Napoli ultras arrived on the scene and attacked the Frankfurt ultras and the police with assorted pyrotechnics and fireworks. At least one police car was also set ablaze.According to UEFA regulations, home clubs are obliged to offer five percent of total stadium capacity to supporters of the visiting team in a clearly segregated part of the stadium. Eintracht Frankfurt were therefore entitled to sell 2,700 tickets to their supporters for Wednesday's match, for which many fans had already booked travel and accommodation – partly on six flights chartered by the club.However, following an ultimately unsuccessful series of legal challenges, Eintracht opted to reject their ticket allocation altogether and cancel the charter planes, leaving the team to attempt to overturn a 0-2 first-leg defeat without the backing of their supporters.On the evening of Monday, March 6, Eintracht were informed by European football's governing body UEFA that the Italian interior ministry was preparing a decree for the following morning which would forbid SSC Napoli from selling tickets to Frankfurt fans.Local Frankfurt broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk (HR) reported that the Italian authorities were even considering general local banning orders for German citizens in the city of Naples, citing fears of violent clashes between rival supporters.Ahead of the first leg in Frankfurt three weeks ago, 20 local area bans were issued by police after three Italian fans were attacked in the district of Sachsenhausen. There were also reports of people emerging from cars with Italian number plates to attack Frankfurt fans. The match itself went ahead without any notable incidents, bar a few scuffles in the away end between Napoli fans themselves, of whom 2,600 made the trip. A total of nine people were temporarily taken into custody.Eintracht Frankfurt initially successfully appealed against the decree, obtaining a temporary injunction on March 11 which obliged the Serie A league leaders to offer away tickets for the return leg.However, a new decree by the local Naples prefecture on March 12 banned the Italian club from selling to tickets to people with registered addresses in the city of Frankfurt.""This new decree is, in both its content and its justification, no less illegal and also entirely impractical, since two thirds of our fans don't even come from Frankfurt [itself], but rather from the [wider] region,"" commented Eintracht board member and legal aid Philipp Reschke, as the club appealed again.The following day, March 13, local courts confirmed the validity of the decree and rejected Eintracht's appeal, leading Frankfurt to officially turn down their entire ticket allocation. But several hundred ultras have traveled anyway.Following the legal wranglings, Italian authorities and SSC Napoli have been subjected to fierce criticism from Eintracht Frankfurt, the German Football Association (DFB), the German government, German police and UEFA, among others.""This is a sad day for football,"" said Eintracht legal aid Reschke. ""And this could potentially open Pandora's box. We hope that this doesn't set a precedent.""Eintracht board spokesman – and current interim German Football League (DFL) CEO – Axel Hellmann told DPA: ""This is a grave and unacceptable intrusion by the Italian authorities into the culture and implementation of European club competition. It amounts to an admission of failure on the part of the Italian state that it doesn't see itself as capable of staging a Champions League game with 2,500 away fans. UEFA is now called upon to ensure that this does not set a precedent and endanger the integrity of the competition.""And UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin has offered his support, telling German broadcaster ZDF on Tuesday: ""We have to say that, when something like this happens, then we simply don't play. It's quite simple: we'll change the rules. We have to do something urgently because this decision by the Italian authorities is absolutely not correct.""Germany's interior minister, Nancy Faeser (SPD), has also spoken out, saying the measures are counter-intuitive. ""With high-risk fixtures, all security measures should be thoroughly checked before banning all fans of a team as a last resort,"" she said. ""Such an extreme measure potentially risks further escalation.""Dario Minden, of Eintracht Frankfurt's official fan liaison department and a member of German nationwide supporter group Unsere Kurve, concurs, saying: ""The risk of danger has only been increased by these supposed security measures. The safest course of action is have people in the away end. Because, whatever you do, and whether you like it or not, Naples will not be a Frankfurt-free zone.""Even the chairman of the German Police Union (GdP), Jochen Kopelke, criticized the Italian approach. He told Sportschau that ""such measures can be useful when it comes to the police's job of averting danger,"" but added that they risk increasing the likelihood of violently-minded fans meeting up to fight elsewhere, away from the stadium.Finally, sports lawyer Thomas Summerer opined that the Italian authorities have acted illegally. ""A ticketing ban for fans who live in Frankfurt is a contravention of European law,"" he told Sportschau. ""It effectively constitutes a ban on entering Italy. Since the reason for the visit is to attend the game, it's a restriction on the freedom of services. The users of a service, such as the attendees at a sporting event, should not be prevented from entering a country by a [EU] member state.""Most of the traveling Eintracht Frankfurt supporters in Naples belong to or are close to the club's hardcore ""Ultras Frankfurt"" (UF) and are reportedly accompanied by fellow ultras from Italian club Atalanta, with whom they share friendly links.Such so-called ""fan friendships"" are common within European football's ""ultra"" sub-culture, often within countries (Schalke and Nuremberg being the most well-known in Germany) but also across borders.The ""ultra"" style of football support, characterized by flags, banners, chants and colorful choreographies as an expression of unconditional support for a club, originated in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s and only arrived in Germany in the late 1990s. Consequently, many German ultras still look to Italy as the motherland of the sub-culture, and hold Italian ultras – both friends and foes – in high regard.It's for this reason that a trip to Naples, a city rich in Italian football and ultra culture, and once the home of the legendary Diego Maradona, represents an attractive destination for Eintracht Frankfurt's ultras, seeing a chance to measure themselves against their Napoli counterparts, alongside their friends from Atalanta.In recent years, Eintracht Frankfurt supporters have made generally positive headlines around the world for their passionate support, including when around 30,000 of them veritably took over Barcelona's Camp Nou in April 2022, en route to the club winning the Europa League.While German ultras are generally politically left-leaning and rarely actively seek violence, they will often respond when provoked by rival groups or by the police. Some Italian ultras, on the other hand, do have more violent reputations.Edited by Felix Tamsut",2023/3/15,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836664,Vatican-Nicaragua relations: Strained or broken?,"""The Holy See never leaves. It is thrown out,"" said Pope Francis in an interview with the Spanish newspaper ABC a few months ago. In light of the news coming from Nicaragua, one could certainly say the church is being thrown out of the Central American country.On Monday, the Vatican's news portal, Vatican News, confirmed the Nicaraguan government's desire to ""suspend diplomatic relations."" In concrete terms, that means the closure of the apostolic nunciature, the Vatican's diplomatic mission in Nicaragua.One year ago, on March 12, 2022, the Nicaraguan government ordered Archbishop Waldemar Stanislaw Sommertag, the apostolic nunciate in Managua, to leave the country. Since then, Monsignor Marcel Mbaye Diouf, secretary of the nunciate, has acted as the Vatican's charge d'affaires. Diouf was now reportedly given one week to leave the country.Nicaragua hasn't had an ambassador to the Vatican since September 2021. Currently, Yara Suhyen Perez Calero, a minister in the Nicaraguan government, serves as Managua's representative to the Holy See.Technically, these developments do not yet represent a break in relations, says Ludwig Ring-Eifel, who heads the Centrum Informationis Catholicum (CIC) in Rome. Ring-Eifel was chief editor of the KNA Catholic News Agency in Germany from 2005-2022 and now holds that post at CIC, which oversees reporting from KNA and its German-speaking partners Kathpress in Austria and KIPA in Switzerland.""The Vatican has made clear its view that this is not a complete severance of diplomatic relations but rather a suspension or temporary pause. That means one final escalation exists, namely a formal and final termination,"" says the Vatican expert.Ring-Eifel admits the need to look far back in history to find a similar case: ""Even after the Cuban Revolution, Havana and the Vatican maintained diplomatic relations, despite most staff being ordered out of the country.""In fact, international law does not recognize the terms ""suspend"" or ""pause"" when it comes to diplomatic ties — either they exist or they do not.""Those are just word games,"" as exiled Nicaraguan economist and political analyst Enrique Saenz told DW from Costa Rica. He says diplomatic relations may not have been formally severed, but on a practical political level they have.Ties between the church and the Nicaraguan government have been continually deteriorating since 2018. At the time, authorities came down brutally hard on nationwide anti-government protests.Catholic churches offered many demonstrators shelter and later acted as a mediator between Managua and the opposition. President Daniel Ortega, however, increasingly branded Catholic representatives as opposition sympathizers and ""terrorists"" bent on toppling him.""Ortega turned up the heat and has repeatedly bullied the church. Authorities even went so far as to forbid Catholics from holding traditional Lenten and Holy Week processions this year. Ortega's behavior really exhibits pathological traits,"" said Saenz.The final break came with this February's conviction and sentencing of Catholic Bishop Rolando Alvarez to 26 years in prison for ""conspiracy and the distribution of false information."" In March, Pope Francis gave an interview to the Argentine media outlet Infobae.During the interview Pope Francis referred to Ortega as mentally ""unbalanced."" He went on to compare Ortega's Sandinista regime to the ""communist dictatorship in 1917 or a Hitlerian one in 1935.""""The pope certainly contributed to the escalation,"" admits Ludwig Ring-Eifel of the CIC in Rome. The Vatican expert says the situation has reached an impasse and needs to cool. Ultimately, time will play an important role, says Ring-Eifel, and history has shown that the Vatican has much more of that.This article was translated from German by Jon Shelton",2023/3/15,,

Last week, during the annual legislative meetings, China's top leadership accused Washington of launching a comprehensive ""containment"" and ""suppression"" of Beijing, causing bilateral ties to continue worsening.""Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-around containment, encirclement, and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country's development,"" Chinese leader Xi Jinping said.Foreign Minister Qin Gang also warned of possible conflict between the two countries. ""If the United States does not hit the brakes, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing, and there will surely be conflict and confrontation,"" Qin said during his first press conference as China's foreign minister.The ongoing tensions between China and the US have directly affected the direction of Beijing's diplomacy, pushing China to try to strengthen relations with traditional allies in the developing world while repairing relationships with Western democracies like Australia and Germany, said Zhiqun Zhu, a professor of international relations at Bucknell University in the United States.""Xi had summits with leaders from Iran, Belarus, and Turkmenistan, but he also welcomed German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to Beijing, while French President Emmanuel Macron and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese are likely to visit China later this year,"" he told DW. ""All of these [summits] are part of the diplomatic strategy to push back the US-led effort to counter China,"" he added.China believes its external environment will be filled with uncertainty and unpredictable factors, especially in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine.Sari Arho Havren, a visiting researcher at the University of Helsinki, said the challenging external environment has forced Beijing to realign its foreign policy in multiple areas.""One important element of the realignment of its foreign policy is Beijing's increasingly assertive push to control the international narrative, presenting China as the peaceful global security provider and balancing actor, while portraying the US as the aggressor that fuels and provokes conflicts rather than trying to prevent them,"" she said.China also successfully brokered a deal last week to restore relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia.Following the agreement, Beijing now appears set to take on a larger role in the Middle East and potentially challenge US dominance in the oil-rich region.Una Cerenkova, head of the China Studies Center at Riga Stradins University in Latvia, said that China wants to boost its global role and influence by essentially engaging with any country that may not be on board with the US or has negative views about the existing international system.""China is trying to talk to everyone and their approach is more pragmatic than ideological,"" she underlined. ""What China can get out of these efforts is to become an important player in other countries' heads, letting them think China can be at the table and they can influence global security.""On Ukraine, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin recently reiterated that conflict and sanctions won't end the war there, and suggested that the process of peace talks should take place as soon as possible.His comments came after Beijing issued a 12-point statement to lay out its position on the ongoing war, but China's attempt to present itself as a broker of peace has raised doubts among some top US officials.Additionally, China released the concept paper of the Global Security Initiative (GSI) earlier this month. Chinese state media said the document laid out Beijing's core concepts and principles regarding global peace and security.Drew Thompson, a China expert at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, describes the GSI and China's statement on the war in Ukraine as ""statements of aspiration and preferences"" rather than strategy documents.""It's designed so Chinese stakeholders have a better sense of China's security and political priorities, and it's left up to Chinese officials to determine how they use these broad-framing documents to implement and conduct Chinese statecraft,"" he said.Zhu from Bucknell University noted that while the GSI concept paper and the 12-point statement on Ukraine contain many general principles that could promote peace in Ukraine and elsewhere, the problem is that the GSI is not actionable.""It reiterates China's commitments to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and to take the legitimate concerns of all countries seriously,"" he told DW. ""This is not an actionable plan.""Havren from the University of Helsinki said that, under the current geopolitical context, where competition between China and the US continues to intensify, China will likely maintain closer ties with Russia, as Beijing sees Moscow as a ""valuable multilayer partner"" in the rivalry with the US-led Western bloc.""China acknowledges Russia's role as an influential military and nuclear power and Beijing understands Russia's security concerns, and is sympathetic to its security spheres of interests,"" she told DW. ""Their interests in transforming the global order are aligned. One year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, China and Russia's relations have only become closer.""As for how countries in the Indo-Pacific may respond to an increasingly ambitious China, Sana Hashmi, a postdoctoral fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation in Taipei, said that the region has entered a ""collective initiative period,"" where more countries are becoming potential partners for ensuring regional security.""The US is not seen as the only country responsible for providing security,  and countries like India are increasingly becoming potential partners for security,"" she told DW.

Korea,"Seoul has announced it would build the biggest chip center in the world, largely using some 300 trillion won (roughly $230 billion or €220 billion) of private investment from electronics giant Samsung over the next 20 years.The chip manufacturing ""mega cluster"" of facilities will be built in various locations in Gyeonggi province by 2042.The center will be anchored by five new semiconductor plants built bySamsung.The South Korean government seeks to invest heavily in six technology areas including chips, displays, rechargeable batteries, electric vehicles, robotics and bio-technology.Although the country is well established in these sectors, the government hopes to tap into the growing demand due to adoption of new technologies like 5G wireless networks, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars.According to President Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea will ""build the world's largest scale system semiconductors cluster in the capital areas using massive private investments worth 300 trillion won.""Speaking at an economic policy meeting, Yoon said: ""Speed is important. The government will do its best to realize the cluster project.""The semiconductor center will aim to attract 150 other companies which will be producing materials and components or designing high-tech chips, according to South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy.Samsung's new plants will be located near its existing domestic factories. They will manufacture both computer memory chips used for data storage and higher-margin logic chips made to perform a broader range of functions, Samsung said.With technology powerhouses including the United States, the EU, Japan and China building up their domestic chip manufacturing to deploy protectionist measures, tax cuts and subsides to lure investors, South Korea has now put forward its own bid to enhance its already-strong market share.President Yoon described the technology industry as among South Korea's ""key economic growth engines and security and strategic assets that are also directly linked to job creation and livelihoods.""Most of the world's advanced microchips are made by Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC.Samsung reported a major dip in operating profit of almost 70% in January for the last quarter of 2022 compared to the same time period in 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836668,India: 'Internet shutdown capital of the world',"Last year, around the world, governments in 35 countries shut down the internet at least 187 times.According to a recent report by the US digital rights advocacy group Access Now for the #KeepItOn coalition, India accounted for approximately 58% of all documented shutdowns globally. There were 84 shutdowns in the South Asian nation — more than in any other country.Entitled ""Weapons of control, shields of impunity: Internet shutdowns in 2022,"" the report cited various reasons for Indian authorities' decisions to close down the internet, including protests, elections, conflict, and school exams.""For a country chairing the G20, and on the eve of its pivotal 2024 general elections, these disruptions are jeopardizing the future of India's tech economy and digital livelihood ambitions — truly a global shame,"" said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now.Internet shutdowns paralyze daily life because people can no longer access necessary medical, educational, and financial services.In the northern state of Rajasthan, shutdowns were imposed a dozen times. West Bengal, in eastern India, ordered shutdowns on seven occasions.But it was the troubled region of Jammu and Kashmir that experienced the most shutdowns, at 49, including 16 back-to-back orders for three-day closures in January and February.""This is the new normal,"" Anuradha Bhasin, the editor of the daily Kashmir Times, told DW. ""We saw what happened when the government scrapped Kashmir's special status in 2019: The region saw the longest internet blackout imposed, with it lasting several months. It no longer makes news and people have been forced to get used to this situation.""Article 370 of the Indian constitution granted limited autonomy to Kashmir, which has been the source of a bitter territorial dispute between India and Pakistan since they gained independence from British rule in 1947. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government in New Delhi revoked the special constitutional status in August 2019.Bhasin appealed to the Supreme Court of India in 2019, arguing that internet shutdowns limited the ability of journalists to travel and publish. Accordingly, he said, it was a violation of Article 19 of the constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of expression.The court ruled that the indefinite suspension of internet services would be illegal under Indian law and that orders for internet shutdown must satisfy the conditions of necessity and proportionality.""The principle of proportionality must be brought into the picture to guard against arbitrary state action,"" media critic Pamela Philipose told DW. ""The Indian state, by notching up no less than 84 shutdowns in 2022, is clearly going against the letter and spirit of that judgment.""According to the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), which advocates digital rights and liberties in India, multiple overlapping factors account for the continued and frequent use of such shutdowns.""These restrictions are often enacted by local administrations on the grounds of 'public emergency' and 'public safety,' in the absence of clearly defined grounds for any such suspension or criteria to determine their effectiveness, leading to arbitrary and excessive application,"" Prateek Waghre, IFF's policy director, told DW.Restrictions are often imposed during protests, to prevent demonstrators from coordinating for example, but there are also temporary shutdowns to prevent cheating in exams.Waghre said that factors combined ""to make internet restrictions an early-stage intervention in the state's response toolkit rather than a measure of last resort.""""Shutdowns or disruptions are at times necessary to stop the flow of misinformation during a state of crisis and strife which could only exacerbate the situation,"" a senior official told DW on condition of anonymity.Detailed guidelines issued over three years ago by the Supreme Court on how internet shutdowns should be ordered in India are implemented too infrequently, say critics.Litigation counsel Tanmay Singh from the IFF said decisions were rarely reviewed by judicial or independent bodies. Instead, they were approved by a committee of government members.""There is also a low degree of transparency, as suspension orders and review committee orders are often not published or made public, despite the Supreme Court's directions to publish internet suspension orders widely,"" Singh told DW.""Until these underlying issues are addressed, it is unlikely that we will see India changing its status as the internet shutdown capital of the world,"" he added.According to the IFF, internet restrictions cost the Indian economy $582.8 million (€547 million) in 2021. The previous year, the Indian economy lost an estimated $2.8 billion — more than any other country by far — after shutting down the internet for a combined 8,927 hours.Edited by: Anne Thomas",2023/3/15,,

However, both batters got reprieve against some sloppy Lahore fielding with Sam Billings and Hussain Talat dropping sitters.Haris Rauf (3-34) claimed two wickets in the last over when he first uprooted the off stump of Pollard and then Khushdil Shah was bowled first ball when he played the ball back onto his stumps.Cottrell struck twice in his second over when he had Mirza Baig caught behind and then Abdullah Shafique played across the line to a straight delivery and fell leg before wicket without scoring.Anwar Ali, who shared the new ball with Cottrell, then clean bowled Fakhar Zaman before Afridi, who surprisingly promoted himself to No. 5, holed out at covers off Cottrell’s full toss and Lahore limped to 4-28 inside the first five overs.Sam Billings (19) was one of the three batters to reach double figures before Lahore, which topped at the end of league stage with 14 points from seven wins, was bundled out with more than five overs to spare. ___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836682,Powerful boss of casino union leaving post in Atlantic City,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — He's led Atlantic City casino workers through three strikes, been arrested at protests nearly 10 times, and won workers including housekeepers, cocktail servers and others the best contract they had ever had.Now Bob McDevitt is stepping down as president of the main union for Atlantic City casino workers, Local 54 of Unite Here, after 26 years as one of the most powerful people in Atlantic City, able to bring the industry to its knees when he felt workers were being treated unfairly.It is a power that he has used repeatedly; sometimes, the mere threat of a strike prompted casinos to sign a new contract.“We represent people who traditionally have not been what you would consider high-wage workers — housekeepers, bartenders, cocktail servers, people who clean public areas,” he said. “It's one thing to work as a waiter over the summer while you're in college; it's quite another to try to support yourself and a family on that. That's where we come in.""The union represents about 10,000 workers in Atlantic City who have been able to live a middle-class existence doing jobs that typically pay less in other industries.Pugnacious and gregarious, quick with a joke and even quicker with a profanity, McDevitt was a fixture in Atlantic City who exerted his influence over local and state elected officials on matters affecting Atlantic City and its casinos. During protests, he sat down in roadways and blocked traffic; during Boardwalk rallies, he yelled into bullhorns.Two years ago, he nearly died from a systemic infection that developed from a cut on his foot, which led to its amputation. But he recovered in time to help negotiate a new contract last year providing significant raises, and maintaining health care and pension benefits, including a $22 hourly wage for housekeepers in the final year of the four-year deal.The new contract was reached without the union going on strike. Previously, walkouts were staged in 1999, 2004 and 2016.The 2004 walkout, mainly over casinos' use of non-union subcontractors, lasted 34 days. But the 2016 strike was the most rancorous and controversial: It led to the closure of the Trump Taj Mahal casino, which at the time was owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn.That strike centered on the union's demand that Icahn restore health insurance and pension benefits that a bankruptcy court judge had terminated. Icahn offered to restore health insurance to Taj Mahal workers, but at a level less than what workers at the city’s other casinos received, which the union rejected.Icahn closed the casino on Oct. 10, 2016, saying he had lost $100 million while operating it; about 3,000 workers lost their jobs.“It was very much a fight to the death,” McDevitt said. “If we had capitulated to them, that would have been pivotal. Every other casino would have wanted the same deal.”He said workers realized either they or the casino would survive — but not both.“Everybody has their Popeye moment: ‘That’s all I can stands; I can’t stands no more,’” he said on the day the casino closed. “The workers made a choice that they weren’t going to accept benefits and terms of employment worse than everyone else’s. I applaud them.”McDevitt endured heavy criticism in some quarters for allowing — some say forcing — the casino to close. But he says the reopening of the casino as Hard Rock less than two years later vindicates the decision to let the Taj Mahal go under.McDevitt called Hard Rock's Global Chair Jim Allen the best casino executive who he has ever worked with, citing the company's pay, bonuses and the overall way it treats its workers.Joe Lupo, the former president of Hard Rock in Atlantic City — the former Taj Mahal building — said McDevitt was easy to get along with.“I always enjoyed working with Bob, as he was very cooperative, direct, never minced words, but with a great sense of humor,” said Lupo, who now runs the former Mirage casino in Las Vegas for Hard Rock. “More importantly, he was very passionate and genuinely cares for each member, always prioritizing their future and welfare first.”McDevitt said the worst casino executive he encountered was Bill Yung, who was head of Kentucky-based Columbia Sussex Corp. That company owned the Tropicana in 2007 and allowed conditions to deteriorate to such an extent that New Jersey gambling regulators stripped the company of its casino license, forcing its sale. Columbia Sussex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.McDevitt will leave his post on May 1, replaced by Donna DeCaprio, Local 54's longtime secretary-treasurer.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836683,Trump allies file ethics complaint against Gov. DeSantis,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Allies of former President Donald Trump have filed a complaint with the Florida Commission on Ethics accusing Gov. Ron DeSantis, a leading potential 2024 primary rival, of violating campaign finance and ethics rules with a “shadow” run for the White House.The 15-page complaint filed Wednesday by MAGA Inc., a Trump-supporting super PAC, and shared with The Associated Press, asks the commission to investigate Florida's Republican leader for allegedly “leveraging his elected office and breaching his associated duties in a coordinated effort to develop his national profile, enrich himself and his political allies, and influence the national electorate.""It says DeSantis is “already a de facto candidate for President of the United States,” citing the governor's meetings with donors, outreach by allies to potential staff and his courting of influential Republicans in early-voting states, among other efforts. The complaint asks the nine-member commission — five of whose members were appointed by DeSantis — to punish the governor by having him suspended from office, publicly censured or fined.DeSantis communications director Taryn Fenske dismissed the accusations and questioned the motives of the complaint. “Adding this to the list of frivolous and politically motivated attacks. It’s inappropriate to use state ethics complaints for partisan purposes,"" she said in a statement.Ken Cuccinelli, the former Trump Homeland Security official who recently launched a political action committee supporting DeSantis’ potential run, accused Trump allies of playing “establishment games.”“I’m shocked, but not surprised,"" he said in a statement. “During my tenure as Attorney General of Virginia, I saw complaints all the time and I can tell when spaghetti is just thrown at the wall.”The letter, which was first reported by NBC News, comes as Trump has stepped up his criticism of DeSantis, whom the ex-president's campaign sees as his most serious rival for the 2024 GOP nomination. Trump has tried to belittle DeSantis with nicknames and has focused on the governor's past policy positions, including Florida’s early COVID-19 restrictions and his votes on Social Security while he was a member of Congress.Trump himself faced similar criticism before announcing his own candidacy in November, accused of violating federal campaign laws by raising and spending money for a run ahead of a formal 2024 campaign launch. He was never reprimanded or fined as a result.While DeSantis has not yet formally announced a 2024 campaign, he is widely expected to do so after Florida's legislative session ends in May. In the meantime, he has traveled to early-voting states to promote his new book and has met with donors. His team has also held informal conversations with prospective campaign staff.Ethics Commission spokesperson Lynn Blaise said the agency is not allowed to acknowledge any complaints received until a complaint reaches a point where it can be made public.In addition to the five commission members appointed by DeSantis, the remaining four were appointed by the Senate president and House speaker — both allies of the governor.Complaints often don’t see the light of day unless they are released by the people filing them. The commission does not make complaints or material public until they are dismissed or probable cause determined, in order to protect the privacy of their subjects.If the commission finds the complaint is valid, it could issue a fine or a reprimand, but cannot remove an elected official from office. It could recommend that the governor suspend an elected official for violating ethics laws, but that would require DeSantis to take action against himself if a violation were found.The process is often used by campaigns to raise questions about opponents by making complaints public, although many are resolved or dismissed without the commission finding violations. It is illegal in Florida to file a complaint with malicious intent and false claims. The commission can fine violators, who can also be ordered to pay a defendant's legal fees.Republican Party of Florida Chairman Christian Ziegler, who must remain neutral in a primary, declined to comment on the complaint, but said he’s glad DeSantis is traveling the country promoting his success in Florida.“We’re killing it in Florida,” he said. “There’s great value to having the governor on the road sharing the Florida blueprint with other states. It’s going to make the country better, but it’s also going to help bring in more pro-freedom residents and businesses to our state.”___Colvin reported from New York.

(AP) — Raven Saunders, the U.S. silver-medal shot putter who used her triumph at the Tokyo Olympics to bring attention to social injustice, has been suspended for 18 months for failing to show up for doping tests.The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency announced the sanction Wednesday for the 26-year-old, saying she had committed three “whereabouts failures” within a 12-month period ending on Aug. 15. She will miss this year's world championships, but would be eligible for the Paris Olympics next year.Saunders often comes to meets with brightly colored hair and wearing an “Incredible Hulk” mask. At the end of the medal presentation at the 2021 Olympics, she stepped off the podium and formed an “X” with her wrists. She explained the “X"" stood for ""the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet.""Saunders has been outspoken about growing up in poverty and her bouts with depression. She went to the University of Mississippi, is a four-time NCAA champion and won USA Track and Field's Humanitarian Award in 2021.Saunders joins a growing list of high-profile athletes who have been banned for missed tests, including world-champion sprinters Christian Coleman and Salwa Eid Naser.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836685,Stormy Daniels meets with prosecutors investigating Trump,"NEW YORK (AP) — Porn actor Stormy Daniels met Wednesday with prosecutors who are investigating hush money paid to her on former President Donald Trump's behalf, her lawyer said Wednesday.The news emerged as Michael Cohen, a former Trump attorney who orchestrated the payment, was giving a second day of testimony before a New York grand jury looking into the matter.The $130,000 payment was made in 2016, as Trump's first presidential campaign was in its final weeks and Daniels was negotiating to go on television to air her claims of a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. Cohen made the payment and arranged another payout to a different woman — at Trump's direction, he says.Daniels met with and answered questions from Manhattan prosecutors and is willing to be a witness, her attorney, Clark Brewster, tweeted. The adult film actor tweeted her thanks to him for “helping me in our continuing fight for truth and justice.”The Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment.Later Wednesday, Cohen emerged from what he expected to be his final day of testimony. He said he would continue to provide prosecutors ""any information and any cooperation that they that they need.”Now estranged from Trump, Cohen said he isn't out for vindication or revenge.""This is not about him. This is about holding accountability, truth to power, and everything else in between,” Cohen said.Daniels has said she had a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump that she didn't want, but didn't say no to. Trump says it never happened. The former president's current lawyer said Trump was invited to testify before the grand jury but has no plans to do so.Federal prosecutors in 2018 charged Cohen with campaign finance crimes related to payments to Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, arguing that the payouts amounted to impermissible gifts to Trump's election effort.McDougal, who was paid $150,000, alleged she had an affair with the married Trump in 2006-07. He denied it.Cohen pleaded guilty, served prison time and was disbarred. Federal prosecutors never charged Trump with any crime.Manhattan prosecutors have been examining whether any state laws were broken in connection with the payments or the way Trump's company compensated Cohen for his work to keep the women's allegations quiet.Cohen and federal prosecutors said the company paid him $420,000 to reimburse him for the payment to Daniels and to cover bonuses and other supposed expenses. The company classified those payments internally as legal expenses.Falsifying business records can be a misdemeanor under state law, or a felony if the fudging of paperwork is done in connection with a more serious crime.Trump and his lawyers have said he was extorted into paying the money to Daniels and should be considered the victim in the investigation. Daniels and the lawyers who helped arrange the payment have denied extorting anyone.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836689,Workers dismantle Florida ride where teen fell to death,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Almost a year after a Missouri teen fell to his death, a 400-foot (122 meter) amusement ride was being dismantled this week in central Florida’s tourism corridor.A gigantic crane hovered Wednesday beside the towering ride in Orlando’s International Drive tourism district where 14-year-old Tyre Sampson fell in March 2022. A fence encircled the ride and blocked off parts of the nearby sidewalk and road. The ride's dismantling was expected to take several days.Sampson, who lived in the St. Louis area, was visiting Orlando during spring break when he died from the fall.An autopsy showed that Sampson suffered numerous broken bones and internal injuries in the fall, which was ruled an accidental death. It showed Sampson weighed 383 pounds (173 kilograms), well above the ride manual’s weight limit of 287 pounds (130 kilograms).An initial report by outside engineers hired by the Florida Department of Agriculture said sensors on the ride had been adjusted manually to double the size of the opening for restraints on two seats, resulting in the teen not being properly secured. The report said there were many other “potential contributions” to the accident.Sampson’s family had filed a lawsuit against the owner, manufacturer and landlord of the ride, claiming they were negligent and failed to provide a safe amusement ride. An attorney for the family said Wednesday that they had reached a settlement with the owner but didn't provide details.Legislation is pending in the Florida Legislature aimed at preventing similar accidents. The Tyre Sampson Act would prevent Florida’s smaller attractions operators from making unauthorized adjustments to a ride’s restraint systems and require operators to submit more detailed safety and operational documentation to the state.The teen’s mother, Nekia Dodd, had been advocating for the ride to be dismantled and visited the site on International Drive on Wednesday, saying she was happy no other family will have to go through what hers has.“It won't happen again, and I'm glad for that,"" Dodd said. ""I'm all over the place with emotions.”",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836690,"US, Russian military chiefs resume contact to discuss drone","WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke to his Russian counterpart on Wednesday about the destruction of a U.S. drone over the Black Sea after an encounter with Russian fighter jets, which brought the two countries closest to direct conflict since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine a year ago.It was the first call between Austin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu since October. And Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had a similar call with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the General Staff of the Russian armed forces.“We take any potential for escalation very seriously. And that’s why I believe it’s important to keep the lines of communication open,” Austin said at a Pentagon press briefing. “I think it’s really key that we’re able to pick up the phone and engage each other. And I think that that will help to prevent miscalculation going forward.”The U.S. military said it ditched the Air Force MQ-9 Reaper in the sea after a Russian fighter jet poured fuel on the surveillance drone and then struck its propeller while it was flying in international airspace. Russia has denied that it caused the accident. The U.S. has said it was working on declassifying surveillance footage from the drone that would show Tuesday's crash.That the top U.S. and Russian defense and military leaders were talking so soon after the incident underscored the seriousness of the encounter over the Black Sea and that both sides recognized the need to tamp down the risks of escalation. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, contact between U.S. and Russian military leaders has been limited, with Russian officials refusing to take U.S. military calls in the early months of the war.There are still questions as to whether Russia meant to down the drone, even though the moments that led up to its crash were “intentional,” said Milley, who stood alongside Austin at the briefing.“We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional,” Milley said.However, he told reporters that it was still unclear whether the collision itself was intentional. And he pushed back against Russia's contention that the fighter jets did not come in contact with the drone.“We have absolute evidence of the contact,” Milley said. “It’s very aggressive. ... We have video evidence and all that.""Milley and Austin also left open the possibility that the U.S. could try to recover portions of the downed $32 million drone, which Milley said crashed into waters that were 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,200 to 1,500 meters) deep.Other U.S. officials said the U.S. doesn't have military ships in the region, and won't likely seek to recover wreckage. The Black Sea has been closed since early 2022 to military vessels that do not have a home port along its shores.The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public, said Russia has already sent ships to the area and attempted to recover pieces of the drone.Milley downplayed the significance of any potential recovery by Russia.“It probably broke up. There’s probably not a lot to recover,” he said. “As far as the loss of anything of sensitive intelligence, etc. ... we would take — and we did take — mitigating measures. So we’re quite confident that whatever was of value is no longer of value.”U.S. officials have refused to detail what steps were taken to protect sensitive technology on the drone or the video it collected during its surveillance mission. But officials have long acknowledged that the U.S. can remotely remove sensitive information from high-tech drones and make systems inoperable so they aren't of much value.Milley and Austin also said the incident would not stop the U.S. from flying wherever international law allows.Details of Milley's call with Gerasimov would be kept private, Joint Staff spokesman Army Col. Dave Butler said in a statement. Gerasimov was named the new commander of the Russian forces in Ukraine in January and its previous commander demoted in an apparent sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s dissatisfaction with the state of the war, which has been stalemated.If the call between Austin and Shoigu was de-escalatory in private, it was not apparent from Russia’s public statements.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters earlier Wednesday that Russia has declared certain areas of the Black Sea off-limits to any aerial traffic during the conflict and suggested the U.S. was trying to provoke an escalation through the flights. The drone crashed near Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014 and illegally annexed.“Any incidents that could provoke confrontation between the two great powers, the two largest nuclear powers, raise very serious risks,"" Lavrov said.The Russian Defense Ministry said Shoigu, in the call with Austin, noted that the flights of U.S. drones near Crimea were “provocative” and risked escalating tensions in the Black Sea. He said Russia would respond “in kind to all provocations” in the future, but also noted that the two nuclear powers must act responsibly and maintain channels of communication.Asked about the call, Austin declined to provide any details.Austin and Shoigu first spoke about Russia's invasion of Ukraine in May 2022. At the time it was the highest level U.S.-Russian contact of the war.In October, they spoke twice in three days as the threat of an escalation was high. Shoigu had accused Ukraine of planning to use a dirty bomb, a claim that was strongly rejected by U.S. and Western allies, who accused Russia of seeking a false pretext to justify further escalation, potentially including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon.",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836691,Blinken says Ethiopia must do more on Tigray peace deal,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Ethiopia needs to make more progress implementing a peace agreement with its northern Tigray region before relations with the U.S. are normalized, visiting Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday.Speaking in Addis Ababa, Blinken said Ethiopia must ensure “there are no ongoing gross violations of human rights” and establish an “inclusive and credible” transitional justice process after the two-year Tigray conflict.“Then our own ability to move forward on our engagement with Ethiopia, to include economic engagement, will also move forward,” Blinken said after meeting with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and others.Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the Tigray conflict before the peace agreement was signed in November. Communications, banking and other basic services in the region of more than 5 million people were cut off and recently began to resume.Out of concern for massacres, gang rapes and other abuses committed by all sides in the fighting, the U.S. imposed sanctions, restricted economic support to Ethiopia and suspended the country’s membership in the African Growth and Opportunities Act, a preferential trade pact.Ethiopia, facing a post-conflict reconstruction bill of $20 billion, is eager to see economic and other assistance from the U.S. and others return, but there are concerns about how the government will address the widespread human rights abuses. The government has objected to a United Nations commission of inquiry and seeks to block its funding.“There’s a lot to be done,” Blinken told Ethiopian Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen. “But the most important thing is to keep the peace that has now taken hold in the north and to strengthen our ties as we move along.”Blinken also met with representatives from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front and announced $331 million in new humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia.Humanitarian organizations now returning to Tigray report hunger and lack of medical supplies, with many health centers damaged or destroyed.But the implementation of the peace deal has seen “significant movement in the right direction,” Blinken said.A major challenge is the presence of troops from neighboring Eritrea, which was allied with Ethiopia’s government in the conflict and was not a party to the agreement. Observers have said the Eritreans have pulled back to border areas.Ethiopian officials and Blinken also discussed a dispute with downstream Egypt over Ethiopia’s completion of Africa’s largest hydroelectric dam, according to the government.Blinken is on a four-day trip to Africa that also includes Niger.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836694,Texas judge in abortion pill case is a conservative favorite,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Texas judge hearing a case that could throw into jeopardy access to the nation's most common method of abortion is a former attorney for a Christian legal group who critics say is being sought out by conservative litigants because they believe he’ll be sympathetic to their causes.U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, who's considering a lawsuit aimed at putting a nationwide halt to use of the drug mifepristone, was appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed in 2019 over fierce opposition by Democrats over his history opposing LGBTQ rights. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone in the body and is used with the drug misoprostol to end pregnancy within the first 10 weeks.Kacsmaryk heard arguments in the case on Wednesday, days after he took the unusual step of telling attorneys during a status conference not to publicize the hearing because the case has prompted death threats and protests and he believed “ less advertisement of this hearing is better."" Kacsmaryk said he would rule “as soon as possible.""A former federal prosecutor and lawyer for the conservative First Liberty Institute, the judge has ruled against the Biden administration on other issues, including immigration. He was among more than 230 judges installed to the federal bench under Trump as part of a movement by the Republican president and Senate conservatives to shift the American judiciary to the right.Interest groups have long attempted to file lawsuits before judges they see as friendly to their points of view. But the number of conservative lawsuits filed in Kacsmaryk's Amarillo courthouse — where he is assigned all new cases as the sole district court judge — has spawned accusations that right-wing plaintiffs are seeking him out because they know he’s likely to side with them.“Why are all these cases being brought in Amarillo if the litigants who are bringing them are so confident in the strength of their claims? It’s not because Amarillo is convenient to get to,” said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. “I think it ought to alarm the judges themselves, that litigants are so transparently and shamelessly funneling cases to their courtroom.”If Kacsmaryk rules against the drug, the Food and Drug Administration — which has approved using mifepristone — is expected to quickly appeal the ruling. Clinics have said they could carry on with using one other drug alone to terminate pregnancies if necessary but that approach is slightly less effective.During his confirmation hearings, Kacsmaryk told lawmakers it would be “inappropriate” for a judge to allow their religious beliefs to impact a matter of law. He pledged to “faithfully apply all Supreme Court precedent.""“As a judicial nominee, I don’t serve as as a legislator. I don’t serve as an advocate for counsel. I follow the law as it is written, not as I would have written it,” Kacsmaryk said at the time.Before the abortion pill case, Kacsmaryk was at the center of a legal fight over Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, which required tens of thousands of migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court.In 2021, he ordered that the policy be reinstated in response to a lawsuit filed by the states of Texas and Missouri. The U.S. Supreme Court overruled him and said that the Biden administration could end the policy, which it did last August. But in December Kacsmaryk ruled that the administration failed to follow federal rulemaking guidelines when terminating the practice, an issue that the Supreme Court didn’t address.He has also ruled that allowing minors to obtain free birth control without parental consent at federally funded clinics violated parental rights and Texas law.In other cases, he has ruled that the Biden administration wrongly interpreted part of the Affordable Care Act as prohibiting health care providers from discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. And he sided with Texas in ruling against Biden administration guidance that said employers can’t block workers from using a bathroom consistent with their gender identity.In another case — brought by states challenging a Department of Labor rule — the Justice Department wrote in a recent court filing that “there is no apparent reason—other than judge shopping"" that explains why the lawsuit was filed in Amarillo.Kacsmaryk’s decisions have been “consistent with what a lot of conservatives were hoping for, and a lot of progressives were fearful of,” said Daniel Bennett, an associate professor at John Brown University in Arkansas, who wrote a book on the conservative Christian legal movement. “This is not a judge who’s necessarily going to be riding the fence.”Kacsmaryk's detractors said his past writings and legal work revealed extremist views and animus toward gay and transgender people. In articles before being nominated, he wrote critically of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision that established a nationwide right to an abortion and the Obergefell decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationally.In 2015, he slammed an effort to pass federal gender identity and sexual orientation protections, writing that doing so would “give no quarter to Americans who continue to believe and seek to exercise their millennia-old religious belief that marriage and sexual relations are reserved to the union of one man and one woman.”A year later, he signed a letter that quoted another article as describing the “belief that one is trapped in the body of the wrong sex” as a “fixed, irrational belief” that is “appropriately described as a delusion.”Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine was among those who opposed Kacsmaryk's nomination, citing what she described as an “alarming bias against the rights of LGBTQ Americans and disregard for Supreme Court precedents.”Kacsmaryk’s defenders say he has been unfairly maligned.Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project, a conservative judicial advocacy group, said Kacsmaryk has shown no evidence of bias on the bench. He noted that Kacsmaryk was deemed “qualified,” by the American Bar Association, which means he satisfied what the group describes as “very high standards with respect to integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.”“These allegations that he’s biased are completely unfounded and they unfairly conflate his legal advocacy with bigotry,” Davis said. “These Democrat politicians are sending a message to Christians and other people of faith that they are not allowed in the public square.”Before joining the bench, Kacsmaryk worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Texas and was involved in such cases as the prosecution of Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, the former Texas Tech University student from Saudi Arabia convicted in a failed bomb plot.In 2014, Kacsmaryk joined the First Liberty Institute, which calls itself the “largest legal organization in the nation dedicated exclusively to defending religious liberty for all Americans.” Kacsmaryk noted during his confirmation process that the group has represented all faiths.Among the litigants he defended as the institute's deputy general counsel was an Oregon bakery that refused to provide a cake for a same sex-couple’s wedding.“Obviously, his decisions have been really disappointing to progressives and left-leaning folks and been very pleasing to those on the right,” Bennett said. “But that’s kind of the nature of our judicial branch right now, especially with these hot-button issues.”_____Richer reported from Boston.",2023/3/16,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836696,"Furman found NCAAs thanks to college roommates, best friends","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Mike Bothwell and Jalen Slawson were thrown together five years ago in the same dorm as freshmen at Furman, essentially forced to be roommates as well as teammates.They’ve fought, made up and gotten tighter and tighter through every experience — on and off the court. They're lifelong friends, so close they’ve already vowed to be the best man at each other’s eventual weddings.Now, they are beginning their greatest adventure: Furman is in the NCAA Tournament for the first since 1980 and preparing for a first-round game against Virginia in the South Region.“It hasn’t always been easy,” Bothwell said. “We probably argue as teammates more than anyone else on the team, but that just comes from love and wanting to see each other get to our best and we feel comfortable getting on each other. I think it’s a healthy relationship.”It’s arguably the most pivotal one for the 13th-seeded Paladins (27-7), the Southern Conference champions who have won 14 of their last 15 games heading into Thursday’s matchup against the fourth-seeded Cavaliers (25-7).“I don’t know what clicked, but something did click,” Slawson said. “It was like an instant brotherhood.”Knowing they were going to be paired together, they started calling each other months before they got to campus in 2018 and eventually got on FaceTime.“What are you bringing to the room?”“What do we even need?”“Let’s get this.”“Let’s get that.”Way beyond simple decorating ideas, they bonded over school, video games, basketball and life — the latter two essentially one in the same for the dynamic duo. And they really started to gel while playing side by side for half a decade.Chemistry. Connection. Cohesion. It’s obvious watching these two carry Furman over the last two months, and really over the last two years.Slawson, a 6-foot-7 forward from Summerville, South Carolina, was the conference player of the year, averaging 15.7 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. Bothwell, a 6-3 guard from Cleveland Heights, Ohio, leads the team at 18 points a game to go along with 3.5 rebounds and 3.0 assists.Together, they give Furman a chance against the 2019 NCAA champions.They could have transferred after settling for small roles early in their college careers. They could have taken offers to play at higher-profile schools after becoming two of the better players in the Southern Conference. They could have jumped at a chance to play professionally overseas after going through the NBA Draft process last summer.Instead, they stuck it out. They've remained roommates and besties through two dorm swaps, various summer housing spots and three off-campus apartments.“You can’t take these moments back,” Bothwell said. “Being on a team with a bunch of guys that I love, you can’t change that for the world. … This is just a little icing on the cake, a little cherry on top.“It’s going to get even sweeter if we continue to play the way we’ve been playing.”Furman hasn’t lost in more than a month and so far has dropped just two games in 2023. Coach Bob Richey’s team is one of nine in the country to notch at least 22 wins in six of the last seven seasons.The Paladins looked like they would make the NCAA Tournament last year. But they lost to Chattanooga on 35-foot heave at the buzzer in the league title game, a gut-wrenching ending that provided a year’s worth of motivation.In that second, Bothwell and Slawson knew they would be back for another shot — together.“This is what we wanted,” Slawson said. “It’s what we expected, honestly. It’s unfortunate that it’s coming to end. It’ll be different, but he’ll always be one call away and we’ll see each other regularly.“We’re never going to be too far away from each other.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836697,UN says intense diplomacy under way to end 8-year Yemen war,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. special envoy for Yemen said Wednesday that intense diplomatic efforts are underway to end the eight-year war in Yemen. He cited new regional and international momentum, including the recent restoration of diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who back rivals in the conflict.Hans Grundberg told the U.N. Security Council there has also been “a step change in the scope and depth of the discussions,” and he urged Yemen’s internationally recognized government and Houthi rebels “to seize the opportunities"" created by the new momentum. He singled out continuing efforts by Saudi Arabia and Oman.Grundberg also indicated progress in talks on a prisoner exchange between the Saudi-backed government and Iran-backed Houthis that are co-chaired by the U.N. and the International Committee of the Red Cross. He urged the parties “to finalize the details of the current phase they have agreed on, including the implementation plan.”U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Joyce Msuya had some positive news as well: The number of people going hungry in Yemen has dropped by almost 2 million, and the number at the worst level, facing famine, has dropped to zero.Nonetheless, she said, “Yemen remains a staggering emergency” with more that 17 million people in need of assistance this year, funding in short supply and economic problems “pushing even more people into destitution.""At a pledging conference two weeks ago more than 30 donors promised $1.16 billion for humanitarian assistance this year for Yemen, which Msuya welcomed, but she stressed it was the lowest level since 2017 and far below the $4.3 billion the U.S. needs to help the 17 million people.Yemen’s devastating conflict began in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital of Sanaa and much of northern Yemen and forced the government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition including the United Arab Emirates intervened in 2015 to try to restore the internationally recognized government to power.A U.N.-backed truce initially took effect in April 2022 and raised hopes for a longer pause in fighting, but it ended on Oct. 2 after just six months.Nonetheless, special envoy Grundberg said the overall military situation in the country continues to be “relatively stable” and other elements of the truce continue to be implemented, though he expressed concern at the uptick in the number and intensity of clashes in several front-line areas, including Marib and Taiz.He called these gains “fragile” and urged the government and Houthis “to exercise maximum restraint during this critical time, including refraining from escalatory public rhetoric, to avoid destabilizing the situation.”Grundberg said he recently visited Moscow, Abu Dhabi, Paris, Tehran and Riyadh in his search for moves toward peace, including renewed talks between the warring parties.He said the Saudi-Iran agreement, facilitated in part by China, and good neighborly relations “are important for the region and for Yemen.”“The parties must seize the opportunity presented by this regional and international momentum to take decisive steps towards a more peaceful future,” Grundberg said. “This requires patience and a long-term perspective. And this requires courage and leadership.”China’s deputy U.N. ambassador, Geng Shuang, called the re-establishment of Saudi-Iranian relations “uplifting news for today’s world that is fraught with uncertainties and instability.”“It has injected a positive element into the peace, stability, solidarity and cooperation landscape of the region,"" he said, expressing hope that “it can also create conducive conditions for improving the situation in Yemen.”Shuang told the council that China, along with the international community, ""stands ready to continue its unwavering efforts towards resolving the Yemeni issue and maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East.”U.S. deputy ambassador, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, said he hoped the Saudi-Iran agreement “will contribute to efforts to secure a durable solution to the conflict in Yemen, address the continued flow of Iranian lethal aid to the Houthis and ensure Iranian support for a Yemeni political process.”He said the United States welcomes support for U.N. peace efforts from Yemen’s government, Saudi Arabia, Oman and other regional countries and urges the Houthis “to engage in negotiations in good faith and to work with the U.N. to keep Yemen on the path to peace.”",2023/3/16,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4836698,NASCAR issues largest team fine in history against Hendrick,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — NASCAR levied the largest combined fine on one team in series history Wednesday, hammering Hendrick Motorsports for modifying air-deflecting pieces last weekend at Phoenix Raceway.Hendrick was issued a combined $400,000 in fines — $100,000 to each of its four crew chiefs, along with four-race suspensions for the quartet — and docked the drivers 100 regular-season points and 10 playoffs points each. Although NASCAR has issued larger monetary fines and suspensions, the Hendrick penalties are the largest combined punishment for one organization.NASCAR's winningest team said it would appeal. William Byron has won back-to-back races for Hendrick to give HMS two wins through the first four races of the season, and Alex Bowman was the Cup Series points leader prior to his 100-point deduction.“On Friday at Phoenix Raceway, NASCAR identified louvers on our race cars during a voluntary inspection 35 minutes after the opening of the garage and prior to on-track activity,” Hendrick Motorsports said in a statement. “NASCAR took possession of the parts approximately four hours later with no prior communication. The situation had no bearing on Saturday’s qualifying session or Sunday’s race.”HMS also said it was “disappointed” with the penalties and would be appealing based on facts that include:— Louvers provided to teams through NASCAR’s mandated single-source supplier do not match the design submitted by the manufacturer and approved by NASCAR,— Documented inconsistent and unclear communication by the sanctioning body specifically related to louvers, and— Recent comparable penalties issued by NASCAR have been related to issues discovered during a post-race inspectionHendrick said it would not be requesting a deferral of the crew chief suspensions for this Sunday's race at Atlanta as the appeal process begins.Kaulig Racing’s Justin Haley and his team received the same penalty, and NASCAR disagrees with the argument that the parts were not in compliance when received.“It was obvious to us that these parts had been modified in an area that wasn’t approved,” NASCAR Senior Vice President of Competition Elton Sawyer said.NASCAR confiscated the Hendrick teams’ louvers after practice at Phoenix Raceway. The louvers sit atop the radiator ducts and direct air out of the hood and any modifications could impact downforce. The points penalties dropped Bowman from first to 23rd in the Cup standings, Byron from fourth to 29th and Kyle Larson from fifth to 32nd.Chase Elliott, who did not race at Phoenix because of a broken leg, was not penalized. Because his replacement driver does not receive points in the Cup Series, Josh Berry was also not punished.NASCAR, meanwhile, also penalized Denny Hamlin 25 points and a $50,000 fine for intentionally wrecking Ross Chastain on Sunday’s final lap.___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/3/16,,World
