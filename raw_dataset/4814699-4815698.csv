https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814707,"Miles back for No. 22 TCU; Frogs score 100, end 4-game skid","FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) — Mike Miles Jr. went almost six minutes into his first game in three weeks before taking a shot for TCU. He swished a 3-pointer. 

            Miles, the preseason Big 12 player of the year, had 15 points in his return from a knee issue, while five of his teammates also scored in double figures to help the 22nd-ranked Horned Frogs hit the century mark for the first time ever in a Big 12 game. They beat Oklahoma State 100-75 on Saturday, ending a four-game losing streak. 

            “It was good being back out there with my guys helping,” Miles said. “It hurt me being on the bench while we were losing, not being able to help.”











            The Frogs (18-9, 7-7 Big 12) had lost five of six games, a stretch that began with a Jan. 28 loss at Mississippi State — where Miles hyperextended his right knee in the opening four minutes.

            “We were very conservative with this thing coming back,” coach Jamie Dixon said of Miles' return. “He practiced four times, so we felt pretty good that he was ready to go from the start.”

            Emanuel Miller had 18 points to lead TCU, which shot a staggering season-high 68.4% (39 of 57) from the field. Damion Baugh had 16 points with 11 assists. Shahada Wells had 15 points, Chuck O’Bannon 12 and Micah Peavy 10.

            Bryce Thompson scored 18 points and John-Michael White 15 for the Cowboys (16-11, 7-7). Before a home loss Tuesday to fifth-ranked Kansas, they had a five-game winning streak that included a win over TCU without Miles or big man Eddie Lampkin.

            “The only statement that was made today was by TCU,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “They played like a team that had a tremendous amount of purpose and it didn’t help having a preseason player of the year back. I think it helped lift up those other guys.”

            Miles and Lampkin hadn't shared the floor since a 23-point win at Kansas on Jan. 21. Lampkin, the team's emotional leader, sustained a left high ankle sprain in that game and missed four of six games after that.

            “It was good to have some guys back, obviously. I saw it in practice yesterday, we are a different team,” Dixon said. “Eddie at full speed, and then obviously Mike. So, I mean, not too much of a surprise.”

            CENTURY SHOOTING

            It was only the third time in Dixon's seven seasons that TCU scored at least 100 points, and second this season. The Frogs beat Central Arkansas 103-57 on Dec. 28. 

            Their 68.4% shooting was the third-best in school history. Dixon was a guard for the Frogs when they had their top two shooting games: 69.9% against Howard Payne on Nov. 26, 1985, and 69.1% against Oklahoma State on Dec. 26, 1986. 

            TAKING THE LEAD

            The Cowboys led 19-16 on a 3-pointer by White with 11:13 left in the first half. TCU then went on a 17-2 run in just over seven minutes — going ahead for good with back-to-back inside baskets by Xavier Cork — and outscored Oklahoma State 31-8 the rest of the half for a 47-27 lead. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Oklahoma State: The Cowboys were undone by 11 turnovers in the first half that led to 15 points for TCU. They were also outscored 20-2 in the paint before halftime — and 50-20 in the game. 

            TCU: Miles, who played 35 minutes, was clearly a boost. While the Frogs returned pretty much their entire team from last season, when they won an NCAA Tournament game for the first time in 35 years, there is a different energy with Miles and Lampkin on the court together. 

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            TCU managed to stay ranked through their slump without Miles, including an 11-point loss at 19th-ranked Iowa State on Wednesday night. The Frogs currently have a school-record streak of being ranked in 11 consecutive polls — and that'll likely extend that when the new AP Top 25 is released Monday.

            Nowell finished with 20 points. Keyontae Johnson had 15 points for the Wildcats (20-7, 8-6 Big 12). Nowell scored 18 of his points in the second half.

            “I just wanted to win,” Nowell said. “I wanted to do anything possible to win today, and that was my mindset.”











            Aljaz Kunc led Iowa State (17-9, 8-6) with 15 points.

            Without their 3-point leader, Caleb Grill, in the lineup, the Cyclones worked the inside. They had 24 points inside and relied on balanced scoring, led by Kunc.

            “We just weren’t as intentional defensively, so I felt like it threw our game off balance,” Iowa State head coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “Credit to K-State for the job they did defensively, but it played a role in stretching us out more.”

            Cyclone guards Jaren Holmes and Gabe Kalscheur went a combined 6 for 30 from the floor. 

            Iowa State entered the game leading the Big 12 in steals and boasting the conference's best turnover margin. The Wildcats entered with 84 turnovers in the last five games. Yet, Kansas State kept the turnover rate under control with only 11 and generated more points off turnovers with 19.

            “Turnovers have been our Achilles heel,"" Kansas State head coach Jerome Tang said. “Our guys really locked in on that.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas State: After losing its last two games to unranked opponents, the Wildcats stayed above .500 in the conference and tied with Iowa State in the standings heading into the final four games of the season.

            Iowa State: The Cyclones had an opportunity to sweep the regular-season series against the Wildcats and are in the heart of a tight race inside the top four of the conference. Seeding could become crucial in the Big 12 tournament in March.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814711,"Sénéchal leads No. 6 UConn past Siegrist, No. 14 Villanova","VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) — Lou Lopez Sénéchal scored 22 points, including a crucial rainbow jumper late in the fourth quarter, to lead No. 6 UConn to a 60-51 victory over Maddy Siegrist and No. 14 Villanova on Saturday.

            “I think she’s been absolutely remarkable,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said of Sénéchal. “If we didn’t have Lou, I hate to think where we would be.”

            Dorka Juhász added 14 points and 10 rebounds and Aaliyah Edwards had 13 points and 14 boards for the Huskies (24-4, 16-1 Big East).











            Siegrist, the nation’s leading scorer, had 21 points for the Wildcats (23-5, 14-3). Villanova lost just its second contest in the last 16 — both to the Huskies. Lucy Olsen added 13 points for Villanova.

            The game was close throughout the first three quarters; the Huskies entered the final quarter leading 44-39. Sénéchal made a pair of free throws and then swished a 3 from the top of the key to give UConn its largest lead to that point, 49-39, with 8:55 left. UConn pushed its advantage to a game-high 52-40 on Juhász’s fastbreak layup from Sénéchal with 7:44 left.

            The Wildcats came roaring back, scoring the next 10 points over 3:49 to make it 52-50 with 3:55 to play on Olsen’s drive. The Huskies committed four of their 22 turnovers during the Villanova spurt, which featured back-to-back 3-pointers by Siegrist and Olsen.

            Edwards ended UConn’s 4:39 scoring drought with a layup to make it 54-50. Then Sénéchal nailed her high-arching shot from close range to give the Huskies a five-point advantage that proved enough cushion. 

            “I just tried to put some arc to it,” Sénéchal said. “Didn’t think too much and just tried to make the shot.”

            FULL HOUSE

            At least 100 fans were lined up outside 1½ hours before game time, and fans packed into the Pavilion for just the second sellout in Villanova women’s basketball history. The student section was full and rocking at tipoff, and the national TV cameras focused in on the action on and off the court.

            “The atmosphere was unbelievable,” Auriemma said.

            SIEGRIST’S STAR

            Most cameras and eyes were on Siegrist, the 6-foot-2 senior from Poughkeepsie, New York, who entered leading the country in scoring (29.4 ppg) and had a hot hand in her last two contests. Siegrist followed a school and conference record 50-point performance last Saturday against Seton Hall with 39 points in a win over St. John’s on Wednesday. Over those two contests, Villanova’s all-time leading scorer made 35 of 52 shots, including 7 of 13 3-pointers, while adding 21 rebounds.

            Siegrist displayed her inside and outside scoring skills in a strong first quarter in which she made 5 of 7 shots and scored 10 points. She followed a nifty layup after a back-door cut with a 10-foot baseline fadeaway during one first-quarter sequence. But the Huskies mostly held her in check from that point, and Siegrist finished 8 of 22 from the field, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Her point total matched her season low, the third time this season she has scored 21.

            Edwards did the bulk of the defensive work against Siegrist.

            “I think you have to be physical because she’s a physical player, and Aaliyah is probably the only one on our team that can match that physicality,” Auriemma said. “... As long as (Siegrist) was working hard for everything that she got, I felt like we were doing our part. And then we needed some help from her to miss some shots.”

            Siegrist said she felt good, but the shots just weren’t falling..

            “Some days it doesn’t go in, and today was one of those days,"" she said. ""Every time I let it go from my hand, I think it’s going in.”

(AP) — Lou Lopez Sénéchal scored 22 points, including a crucial rainbow jumper late in the fourth quarter, to lead No. 6 UConn to a 60-51 victory over Maddy Siegrist and No. 14 Villanova on Saturday.“I think she’s been absolutely remarkable,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said of Sénéchal. “If we didn’t have Lou, I hate to think where we would be.”Dorka Juhász added 14 points and 10 rebounds and Aaliyah Edwards had 13 points and 14 boards for the Huskies (24-4, 16-1 Big East).Siegrist, the nation’s leading scorer, had 21 points for the Wildcats (23-5, 14-3). Villanova lost just its second contest in the last 16 — both to the Huskies. Lucy Olsen added 13 points for Villanova.The game was close throughout the first three quarters; the Huskies entered the final quarter leading 44-39. Sénéchal made a pair of free throws and then swished a 3 from the top of the key to give UConn its largest lead to that point, 49-39, with 8:55 left. UConn pushed its advantage to a game-high 52-40 on Juhász’s fastbreak layup from Sénéchal with 7:44 left.The Wildcats came roaring back, scoring the next 10 points over 3:49 to make it 52-50 with 3:55 to play on Olsen’s drive. The Huskies committed four of their 22 turnovers during the Villanova spurt, which featured back-to-back 3-pointers by Siegrist and Olsen.Edwards ended UConn’s 4:39 scoring drought with a layup to make it 54-50. Then Sénéchal nailed her high-arching shot from close range to give the Huskies a five-point advantage that proved enough cushion.“I just tried to put some arc to it,” Sénéchal said. “Didn’t think too much and just tried to make the shot.”FULL HOUSEAt least 100 fans were lined up outside 1½ hours before game time, and fans packed into the Pavilion for just the second sellout in Villanova women’s basketball history. The student section was full and rocking at tipoff, and the national TV cameras focused in on the action on and off the court.“The atmosphere was unbelievable,” Auriemma said.SIEGRIST’S STARMost cameras and eyes were on Siegrist, the 6-foot-2 senior from Poughkeepsie, New York, who entered leading the country in scoring (29.4 ppg) and had a hot hand in her last two contests. Siegrist followed a school and conference record 50-point performance last Saturday against Seton Hall with 39 points in a win over St. John’s on Wednesday. Over those two contests, Villanova’s all-time leading scorer made 35 of 52 shots, including 7 of 13 3-pointers, while adding 21 rebounds.Siegrist displayed her inside and outside scoring skills in a strong first quarter in which she made 5 of 7 shots and scored 10 points. She followed a nifty layup after a back-door cut with a 10-foot baseline fadeaway during one first-quarter sequence. But the Huskies mostly held her in check from that point, and Siegrist finished 8 of 22 from the field, including 1 of 5 from 3-point range. Her point total matched her season low, the third time this season she has scored 21.Edwards did the bulk of the defensive work against Siegrist.“I think you have to be physical because she’s a physical player, and Aaliyah is probably the only one on our team that can match that physicality,” Auriemma said. “... As long as (Siegrist) was working hard for everything that she got, I felt like we were doing our part. And then we needed some help from her to miss some shots.”Siegrist said she felt good, but the shots just weren’t falling..“Some days it doesn’t go in, and today was one of those days,"" she said.

(AP) — Reserve Jalen Graham scored a career-high 26 points and Arkansas beat Florida 85-64 on Saturday, overwhelming a Gators team playing without leading scorer and rebounder Colin Castleton.

            Graham was 12-of-15 shooting, Ricky Council IV scored 15 points, Anthony Black added 14 and Makhi Mitchell collected his 10th career double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Razorbacks (18-9, 7-7 SEC), who snapped a two-game skid. Nick Smith Jr. scored 10 points.

            Riley Kugel scored 17 points and Will Richard 10 for the Gators (14-13, 7-7), who were playing without Castleton for the first time since the 6-foot-11 post broke his hand in Wednesday's win over Mississippi. Jason Jitoboh made his first start of the season in Castleton's place and finished with four points and two rebounds in 24 minutes.











            Mitchell scored six points during a 17-2 run to open the second half and Arkansas led by 21. The lead reached a high of 25.

            Three-point plays by Smith began and ended a 14-2 run that put Arkansas in front by seven with four minutes left in the first half. The Razorbacks led 37-31 at halftime with Graham scoring 14.

            Arkansas, the SEC field-goal percentage leader, finished at 58% and outrebounded Florida 40-25. The Gators were 4 of 21 from 3-point range.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814713,Hader more comfortable with Padres after last year's trade,"PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) — Josh Hader looks around San Diego's clubhouse and sees a team on the rise. He also sees a bunch of familiar faces.

            It's a good feeling.

            The All-Star closer is more comfortable these days than he was when he first joined the Padres in a blockbuster trade in August. That deal was completed during one of the most difficult stretches of his career, right in the middle of a pennant race, and it took a while for him to regain his form.











            “You're just familiar with how they run things. I think that's the biggest thing, right?” Hader said Saturday. “When you're coming over in the middle of the season, you have your routines, you have this and that. ... I think that's the biggest thing is just like finding the comfort in your everyday stuff that you do.”

            San Diego also acquired Juan Soto at last year's deadline, and manager Bob Melvin said he thinks each player likely feels more at home this spring.

            “Whether it's he, whether it's Juan, whether it's anybody that came in last year, they're going to be able to take a deep breath and relax a little bit and be able to go through a full spring and so forth with the team,” Melvin said.

            The 28-year-old Hader avoided arbitration by agreeing to a $14.1 million, one-year contract last month. He is eligible for free agency after this year’s World Series.

            The 6-foot-3 left-hander developed into one of the majors' top closers during his first five seasons with Milwaukee. He went 4-2 with a career-low 1.23 ERA and 34 saves in 2021, helping the Brewers to the NL Central title.

            He opened last season with 19 consecutive scoreless appearances covering 17 2/3 innings. That's when things started falling apart for the lefty.

            Hader had an 8.82 ERA in his last 18 games for Milwaukee, allowing seven homers in 16 1/3 innings. He surrendered a total of six homers in 81 games over the previous two years.

            The trouble continued after the trade. He was tagged for 12 runs and 12 hits in his first 4 2/3 innings for San Diego.

            Hader said he turned around his season by “using the right parts of my body to perform like I normally do.”

            “I got away from it,” he continued, “and I didn't have the answer of how to fix it quick.”

            Hader eventually settled down, allowing one earned run and striking out 14 in his last 11 1/3 innings of the regular season. He was terrific in the playoffs, saving four games and striking out 10 in 5 1/3 innings as the Padres made it to the NL Championship Series.

            “Mentally, to get beat up like that every single day or every single time you get out there, it's hard to just continue to be like ‘Hey man, that’s just what it is,' and you've just got to keep going with it,” Hader said, looking back on his 2022 season. “For me to go through that and be able to just come out and finish on a strong note, ultimately is what you want to do.”

            After making the trades for Soto and Hader and going on a deep October run, San Diego kept adding to its roster in the offseason. Shortstop Xander Bogaerts, infielder/outfielder Matt Carpenter,  designated hitter Nelson Cruz and reliever Seth Lugo signed with the Padres in free agency.

            Hader and San Diego are shooting for the franchise's first championship.

            “We saw what it took to get to where we were, but that's not the end goal,” Hader said. “We want to get to the final piece and win a World Series. Obviously the front office saw what we needed to do to get back to the playoffs, but ultimately win that World Series. As a player, for me, that's exciting stuff.”

            Officer Geoffrey Redd was critically wounded Feb. 2 at the Poplar-White Station Library. Redd, 49, was transported to Regional One Health, where he died “despite the best efforts"" by the hospital staff, Memphis police said.

            “Rest easy, Officer Redd. You will be missed,” the department said in announcing his death.











            Redd served in the U.S. Marine Corps before joining the police department in 2008. He also served as director of security at his church.

            Mayor Jim Strickland offered his “deepest condolences” to the slain officer's family and also ""his Memphis police family.” 

            “He served with honor his country as a marine and his city as a police officer, and we lift up his dedicated public service to the City of Memphis for over 15 years,"" the mayor said in a statement.

            In the library incident, officers responded after a man started the confrontation with another person. When officers attempted to talk with him, he pulled out a weapon and fired, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has said. Redd was hit. 

            His partner returned fire, killing the suspect. 

            Employees and patrons were in the library at the time, but no one else was hurt, according to the TBI. 

            The bureau often investigates shootings around the state when officers are involved and worked on this case at the request of the Shelby County prosecutor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814718,Novak scores twice as Predators defeat Panthers 7-3,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tommy Novak scored twice and Roman Josi had a goal and two assists to lead the Nashville Predators over the Florida Panthers 7-3 on Saturday.

            Ryan Johansen had a goal and an assist and Matt Duchene, Colton Sissons and Yakov Trenin also scored for Nashville, which had lost three of its last four.

            Kevin Lankinen made 30 saves for the Predators. Ryan McDonagh matched a career high with three assists.











            Nick Cousins, Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Reinhart scored for Florida. Sergei Bobrovsky and Spencer Knight combined for 19 saves. Brandon Montour had two assists. 

            “We just weren’t hard enough from the start and gave up way too many goals against obviously,” Tkachuk said. “We definitely didn’t start the game as well as we would have liked, that’s for sure.”

            Both teams began Saturday on the outside of the playoff picture.

            Florida trailed the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference by a point, while the Predators moved within five points of Minnesota in the Western Conference wild-card race. Nashville has played two fewer games than the Wild, and the teams meet Sunday in Minnesota. 

            “You got to enjoy it a little bit and then get on the plane, and obviously a huge game tomorrow,” Josi said. “So we’ve got to take a lot of the good with us.”

            The Predators led 3-2 after the first period on Johansen’s power-play goal at 15:01 off of a redirection of pass from Josi. 

            After Novak began the game’s scoring at 2:36 of the first, Cousins tied it at 7:55 of the first. Cousins, a former Predator, played in his 500th career NHL game. 

            Sissons’ breakaway goal at 7:40 of the second chased Bobrovsky, who allowed four goals on 11 shots.

            “I got Bob out of there because I didn’t think it was going to be goaltending deciding the game,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “For us, he’s played a lot of hockey. It’s an awful lot for him, so give him a little bit of rest and give Spencer some work. It was ugly and it was over.” 

            Novak’s power-play goal at 8:58 of the third gave him the first two-goal game of his career. 

            “He’s a guy that has great poise with the puck and makes plays when he has time and space,” Predators coach John Hynes said of Novak.

            SPECIAL TEAMS

            Nashville scored a pair of power-play goals on three chances. 

            Entering Saturday, Nashville’s power play had connected just once in 11 opportunities in the last four games. The Panthers have allowed five power-play goals over the last three games. 

            GUDAS HURT

            Florida defenseman Radko Gudas exited in the second period and did not return to the game. 

            With the Panthers on a penalty kill to start the second, Gudas blocked a shot by Josi 1:10 into the period. He kept just one hand on his stick for the remainder of his shift, which ended 13 seconds later. 

            Maurice did not have an update on Gudas after the game.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tommy Novak scored twice and Roman Josi had a goal and two assists to lead the Nashville Predators over the Florida Panthers 7-3 on Saturday.Ryan Johansen had a goal and an assist and Matt Duchene, Colton Sissons and Yakov Trenin also scored for Nashville, which had lost three of its last four.Kevin Lankinen made 30 saves for the Predators. Ryan McDonagh matched a career high with three assists.Nick Cousins, Matthew Tkachuk and Sam Reinhart scored for Florida. Sergei Bobrovsky and Spencer Knight combined for 19 saves. Brandon Montour had two assists.“We just weren’t hard enough from the start and gave up way too many goals against obviously,” Tkachuk said. “We definitely didn’t start the game as well as we would have liked, that’s for sure.”Both teams began Saturday on the outside of the playoff picture.Florida trailed the second wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference by a point, while the Predators moved within five points of Minnesota in the Western Conference wild-card race. Nashville has played two fewer games than the Wild, and the teams meet Sunday in Minnesota.“You got to enjoy it a little bit and then get on the plane, and obviously a huge game tomorrow,” Josi said. “So we’ve got to take a lot of the good with us.”The Predators led 3-2 after the first period on Johansen’s power-play goal at 15:01 off of a redirection of pass from Josi.After Novak began the game’s scoring at 2:36 of the first, Cousins tied it at 7:55 of the first. Cousins, a former Predator, played in his 500th career NHL game.Sissons’ breakaway goal at 7:40 of the second chased Bobrovsky, who allowed four goals on 11 shots.“I got Bob out of there because I didn’t think it was going to be goaltending deciding the game,” Florida coach Paul Maurice said. “For us, he’s played a lot of hockey. It’s an awful lot for him, so give him a little bit of rest and give Spencer some work. It was ugly and it was over.”Novak’s power-play goal at 8:58 of the third gave him the first two-goal game of his career.“He’s a guy that has great poise with the puck and makes plays when he has time and space,” Predators coach John Hynes said of Novak.SPECIAL TEAMSNashville scored a pair of power-play goals on three chances.Entering Saturday, Nashville’s power play had connected just once in 11 opportunities in the last four games. The Panthers have allowed five power-play goals over the last three games.GUDAS HURTFlorida defenseman Radko Gudas exited in the second period and did not return to the game.With the Panthers on a penalty kill to start the second, Gudas blocked a shot by Josi 1:10 into the period. He kept just one hand on his stick for the remainder of his shift, which ended 13 seconds later.Maurice did not have an update on Gudas after the game.FORSBERG STILL OUTFilip Forsberg, Nashville’s leading goal scorer, missed his third straight game.

            Demonstrators marched Friday to the National Assembly building to protest against price hikes and the reduction of electricity and fuel subsidies as a result of an IMF program. They overwhelmed police who fired tear gas. Riots soon broke out and the Assembly building damaged.

            On Saturday, police set up roadblocks, extra surveillance and checkpoints on bridges. 











            Justice Minister Kenneth Amoksi took stock during a press conference, saying 119 people had been arrested and 20 injured during the disturbances. More arrests are expected to follow. 

            “We have the images. It is only a matter of time before you are apprehended,” said Amoksi 

            Amoksi was joined in the press conference by chief of police Ruben Kensen, army commander Werner Kioe A Sen and security adviser Humprey Tjin Liep Shie. 

            Kensen said the situation was under control but there will be increased security measures in the coming period. 

            Protest leader Stephano Biervliet was invited by Amoksi to report to the police. 

            Biervliet was live on Facebook at the same time as the press conference. He said he had been threatened and held hostage for a few moments by armed unknown people. 

            “What happened was not my intention.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814721,Vinícius turns playmaker to cue Madrid's 2-0 win at Osasuna,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Stymied by the goalkeeper, Vinícius Júnior turned playmaker to set up a late breakthrough and help Real Madrid win at Osasuna 2-0 in the Spanish league on Saturday.

            Vinícius, back from a one-game suspension, led Madrid’s attack while Karim Benzema rested ahead of Tuesday’s game at Liverpool in the Champions League round of 16.

            Vinícus has emerged as Madrid’s top scorer with 16 across all competitions. But he failed to beat Osasuna goalie Sergio Herrera on three one-on-one situations before assisting Federico Valverde in the 78th minute at El Sadar Stadium.











            Luka Modric played Vinícius clear down the left side of the area. Two defenders hemmed him in, but the Brazil forward flipped a pass to Valverde arriving in a second wave to steer into the net.

            Marco Asensio added a second goal in injury time after 18-year-old Álvaro Rodríguez stole the ball and assisted his fellow substitute.

            “Vinícius is a player who always makes the difference,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “When we started playing more in open space in the second half that was when he took charge. He is a fantastic player, he doesn't stop attacking, doesn't stop dribbling at rivals, he is an incredible talent.

            “This was an important win to keep us in the league race.”

            The hard-fought victory closed Madrid’s gap with Barcelona to five points before the leader hosts Cadiz on Sunday.

            Ancelotti was without three regular starters. Rodrygo started for Benzema. Eduardo Camavinga anchored the midfield with Aurélien Tchouaméni ill, and Dani Ceballos filled in for Toni Kroos, who also rested.

            Osasuna, which drew at Madrid 1-1 in October, caused Madrid problems all game long with its defenders chasing the ball all over the pitch. Moi Gómez, Osasuna’s most incisive player, went close to scoring in the 63rd when the midfielder cut back outside the area and struck the post.

            “It is too bad, we made a huge effort, but you have to be perfect to take points in a game like this,” said coach Jagoba Arrasate, whose Osasuna is in 10th place and has reached the Copa del Rey semifinals.

            Osasuna goalie Herrera was poised to be the player of the match until Valverde finally beat him for his 12th goal of the campaign.

            “We know that it is always tough to play here, against a team that always fights to the end,” Valverde said. “As the clock ticks down you feel the fatigue after so many games, but the goal set us on our way.”

            OWN GOAL

            An own goal in the final moments cost third-placed Real Sociedad a 1-1 draw at home with Celta Vigo.

            Mikel Oyarzabal drove in a pass by Take Kubo to give Sociedad a fifth-minute lead. But Celta was gifted a stoppage-time equalizer when Sociedad defender Robin Le Normand inadvertently redirected a cross into his own net.

            CANALES LEADS

            Sergio Canales set up one goal and scored another from the penalty spot to lead a 2-1 win over Valladolid and help fifth-placed Real Betis close to within one point of Atletico Madrid in fourth.

            Canada forward Cyle Larin briefly pulled the visitors level in the 30th with his third goal in four appearances for Valladolid since arriving on loan from Club Brugge last month.

            MALLORCA ROLLS

            Mallorca rolled over 10-man Villarreal 4-2 for its biggest win since Javier Aguirre became the coach last year.

            The team from the Balaeric Islands had never scored more than two in a game against a top-flight team since Aguirre took over in March 2022.

            Trailing 1-0, Villarreal lost Manu Trigueros to a direct red card when he swiped at the face of a rival following a collision.

            Midfielder Dani Rodríguez led Mallorca with two goals, both from headers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814723,Byram scores twice to help Avalanche beat Blues 4-1,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Bowen Byram scored twice and Mikko Rantanen scored his 200th NHL goal to help the Colorado Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 4-1 Saturday and remain in third place in the Central Division.

            Valeri Nichuskin also scored, and Justus Annunen stopped 19 shots in his season debut to give Colorado its third win in four games. 

            “I thought he was steady,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said of Annunen, who appeared in his third NHL game. “Good outing from him. He didn't have a lot of work, but made some saves look easy.”











            Sammy Blais scored for St. Louis, and Jordan Binnington made 29 saves as the Blues snapped a three-game winning streak less than 24 hours after trading centers Ryan O’Reilly and Noel Acciari to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

            “I don't know if it was tough to get up for,” Blues center Brayden Schenn said. “It was just a lot of emotion from last night. The trade happened so late.”

            Byram recorded his first career multigoal game when he one-timed a feed from Samuel Girard on a power play for his fifth goal of the season to give Colorado a 4-1 lead 9:40 into the third period.

            “It's part of what our identity is,” Bednar said. “Our D have always been active participants in our offense. Bo's obviously missed some time, but getting back up to speed, we're starting to see him contribute a little bit more.”

            Nichuskin scored his ninth goal of the season on a power play 2:56 into the third period to restore Colorado’s two-goal lead. 

            The Avalanche converted on both of their power plays in the third period after starting the game 0 for 2.

            “It's been stale a little bit here recently, Bednar said. ""I think it's trying to be too cute and looking for the perfect play. We just encouraged them after the second to shoot the puck, make sure your work ethic and competitiveness is where it needs to be and just getting more competitive, more simple, shoot it and go to the net.”

            Blais scored his second goal of the season with 4:32 remaining in the second period to narrow St. Louis’ deficit to 2-1.

            “We got one there to make it a one-goal game,"" Blues defenseman Justin Faulk said. ""We had an opportunity going into the third period to put some pressure on. I took a penalty, and they scored and put us on our heels a little bit. We probably were a little bit on the outside too much and didn't test the goalie as much as we'd have liked to.”

            Byram scored his first goal on a pass from Rantanen 7:27 into the second period to stretch Colorado’s lead to 2-0.

            Rantanen scored his team-leading 35th of the season and 200th of his career with 3:23 remaining in the first period to give Colorado a 1-0 lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814724,Spartans pregame ceremony honors 3 killed in campus shooting,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State women's basketball players wiped away tears as they stood shoulder to shoulder during a moment of silence before losing to No. 8 Maryland 66-61 on Saturday, less than a week after three students were killed in a shooting on campus.

            “I’m really proud of us for just showing up,"" said Julia Ayrault, who led the Spartans with 15 points. “It’s hard to come back and play a game that seems so small.""

            Diamond Miller scored 29 points and helped the Terrapins (22-5, 13-3 Big Ten) hold on for the win after leading by 16 points in the second half. 











            “We knew today would be extremely emotional,” Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. “Michigan State was one possession away from taking this game from us.”

            The Spartans (13-13, 5-10) rallied to have a chance at pulling off an upset, coming up short after DeeDee Hagerman missed a 3-pointer with 3 seconds left.

            “They’re strong,” Miller said. “They’re resilient. They did not stop.”

            Michigan State players wore white shirts with “Spartan Strong"" and the school's logo in green during warmups while coaches, support staff, administrators, cheerleaders and mascot sported the tops all afternoon.

            “We all need healing and sports can do that,” said Michigan State acting coach Dean Lockwood, who has filled in for Suzy Merchant since she was in a car crash last month. “We wanted this to be a healing event for our community.”

            The victims, and survivors, were honored with pregame remarks as athletic events resumed on a campus and community reeling from the tragedy.

            Police say Anthony McRae, a 43-year-old man with no connection to the school, went into Berkey Hall where evening classes were being held and opened fire in a classroom then walked about 5 minutes away to the MSU Student Union and fired more shots before fleeing and dying from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.

            The union, which would normally be open on a Saturday afternoon, had signs in door windows that informed visitors it was closed until further notice.

            Red and yellow flowers were placed in door handles at the the northern entrance and on the other side, a slew of flower bouquets were strewn on steps on a sun-splashed, relatively warm afternoon. Near the Berkey Hall sign, flowers and candles were placed in a tree bed where Michigan State graduate Pedro Kuyenga bowed his head for a few minutes.

            “I prayed for the souls of the students who departed unexpectedly and sadly,” he said. “I prayed to give the families affected comfort, and the knowledge and wisdom to the hospital staff helping the students recover.” 

            Streams of people also visited “The Rock,” a community gathering place that has become a makeshift memorial in the days since the attack, and the Spartan Statue, where a sea of flowers have been placed this week.

A meeting in Germany between the officials had been widely anticipated.State Department spokesman Ned Price said that Blinken ""directly spoke to the unacceptable violation of US sovereignty and international law by (China's) high-altitude surveillance balloon in US territorial airspace, underscoring this irresponsible act must never occur again.""Blinken also warned about ""the implications and consequences if China provides material support to Russia or assistance with systemic sanctions evasion,"" Price added.Blinken had canceled a trip to Beijing earlier this month due to the balloon incident, which has become a major issue of contention between the two countries.The US said it shot down a Chinese surveillance balloon on February 4 that floated across the continental airspace, while Beijing insists it was a civilian airship meant for scientific research.China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported that Wang ""made clear China's solemn position on the so-called airship incident.""Wang ""urged the US side to change course, acknowledge and repair the damage that its excessive use of force caused to China-US relations,"" Xinhua reported.Earlier on Saturday, Wang said at the Munich Security Conference that the US response of shooting balloons down was ""hysterical and absurd.""""There are many balloons from many countries in the sky. Do you want to down each and every one of them?""

Now, the Astan family lives in a tent. Two days after the natural disaster struck Turkey and Syria, many such tents were set up for people in need. The Astans and others who have found temporary shelter in Antakya are reporting unhygienic conditions.""They set up a portaloo on the other side of the street,"" Yasemin Astan told DW, gesturing across the road. ""But it's almost impossible to see anything at night, and it is very difficult to walk — how can I leave my children behind and walk all this distance in the dark when I need to use the toilet?""The Astan family shares a tent with several other people. In total, 13 people live here, including nine children. ""This tent just isn't large enough for 13 people,"" Astan said.In addition to the criticism of official efforts to prepare for earthquakes, people across Turkey are calling the government's response inadequate. Many survivors have had to forgo showers since the quake hit on February 6. But that is not their biggest problem: Worst of all, residents say, is the lack of proper toilets.And there is refuse everywhere. A representative of the Family and Social Services Ministry in the camp told DW that he called faraway cities such as Nevsehir and Konya to ask for help. ""I told them: At least send us a rubbish container so refuse won't pile up where people walk,"" the representative said. ""And, of course, there is the acute danger of infectious diseases spreading.""The representative pointed to a portaloo, which he said was at capacity and leaking into the camp. ""Everything from this toilet ends up seeping down,"" he said. ""It is the only toilet in the entire area, even though we asked the authorities for at least 25.""At night, the once-bustling multicultural city is deserted except for soldiers patrolling districts flattened by the earthquake. One aid agency volunteer told DW that ""there are those who have been evacuated from the city, and there are those who are still in Hatay — they are either waiting for burials, or have nowhere to go.""Though some people are still being found alive under the rubble after all this time, officials have now switched their focus to clearing the debris. With the clean-up operation underway, streets are engulfed in dust and dirt. People should be donning masks, though hardly anyone here in the streets is seen wearing one. A volunteer from Sakarya province told DW that these unhygienic conditions make it almost impossible for anyone to recuperate.The Turkish Medical Association has set up a container in the nearby town of Defne to treat survivors and offer clothing and medicine. ""I have been here for six days,"" a doctor who asked that their name not be used told DW. ""We wash ourselves using wet wipes because there is no possibility to shower.""Another doctor said sewage was directed straight into the Asi river, which poses a public health risk. The doctor said this must be addressed immediately. ""There are toilets, but they are not clean and are therefore a potential source of infection,"" the doctor said. ""Slowly, we will see what we all have been fearing: infections, diarrheal diseases and fever breaking out,"" he added. ""Water in the area needs to be treated soon.""The doctor said more than 100 people of the the at least 250 he had treated so far had contracted infectious diseases. ""We observed that gynecological diseases are on the rise: women who have vaginal infections, itching sensations, fungal infections,"" the doctor said. ""The reason is that nobody here has access to showers."" He added that children are suffering from diarrhea ane rashes are breaking out. ""There are people who have been forced to wear the same clothes for days,"" the doctor said, ""and as they sweat skin rashes have been the result."" Cancer patients who have sought help have been turned away as doctors lack the proper medicine to treat them.Patients have also died of hypothermia, a doctor who was working in the pediatric emergency room of the Mustafa Kemal University Hospital on the day of the earthquake told DW. ""There were two soldiers with broken legs, but the orthopedic unit was a bit further away and we had no stretcher to take them to the hospital building,"" the doctor said. ""I ripped a curtain from a window and covered them both, entered the building to retrieve something and ran back — by then, the two had died of hypothermia.""Members of a group cooperating with Turkey's Red Crescent have headed to villages near Kirikhan. Though they have found little structural damage in the villages, they are encountering great demand for food and medicine — especially for children. ""Even if we had medicine, we would need help distributing it,"" a member of the Red Crescent's contingent told DW. ""We are faced with a serious organizational problem. More could have been achieved in eight days.""Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca recently said mobile pharmacies were now operating in the disaster zone and villages still had access to health care. He said public health coordination centers had been set up as well. ""Necessary measures are being taken to prevent infections that can spread after earthquakes: Rabies and tetanus vaccines were sent to the region,"" Koca said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814735,Munich Security Conference discusses Afghanistan dilemma,"International leaders agree that the Taliban are violating fundamental human rights of Afghans. Girls can't go to school, poverty is on the rise, and people are suffering. The longer the Taliban stay in power, the tighter their grip.But what can be done about it? The speakers at ""Talibanned: Prospects for Afghanistan,"" a panel at this year's Munich Security Conference, appeared to have no answer to this question.All hell broke loose when the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. World leaders were quick to condemn the takeover, and there was a genuine and widespread concern about the plight of Afghan people under Taliban rule. A year and a half later, in February 2023, there is scant global attention on Afghanistan.World leaders seem to have shifted their focus to other conflicts and domestic issues. And even the international actors who'd had an initial inclination to respond to the Taliban takeoever are unclear how to handle it now.""Right now, we are looking at the humanitarian assistance,"" Michael McCaul, chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, said during Saturday's Munich Security Council panel. ""Half of Afghanistan's population is starving. We have these nongovernmental organizations on the ground, and the US is providing assistance to them.""Now that the United States has withdrawn troops from Afghanistan, McCaul said, there isn't much the US can do for the country apart from helping out the people. However, the possible security threat posed by Taliban control of Afghanistan remains a matter of concern for the United States. In short, the US does not intend to provide financial assistance to Afghanistan as a country as this would ultimately strengthen the Taliban government.Pakistani Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari told the panel that Afghanistan would need support as a state. ""We all want to see women receiving education in Afghanistan,"" Bhutto-Zardari said. ""We all want to see a more inclusive government in Afghanistan. The terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan is worrisome."" The Taliban government must be willing to deal with these issues, he added.""If the interim government in Afghanistan demonstrates the will to do that, we will have to find a way to build its capacity so that it can do so,"" Bhutto-Zardari said. ""They don't have a standing army, they don't have a counterterrorism force, they don't even have a proper border security.""The comments by Bhutto-Zardari and McCaul illustrate the conflicting and contradictory approaches regarding Afghanistan and the Taliban. Though Pakistan's foreign minister wants the world to engage more with the Taliban, leaders from outside of the region are keeping a diplomatic distance from the group.Mahbouba Seraj, an Afghan activist and journalist, is calling for a united stand to help Afghan people. ""There are two governments in Afghanistan right now,"" Seraj said, expressing her annoyance with regional and international politics surrounding her country. ""One is the UN and its affiliates and the other is the Taliban. People are dying in Afghanistan, so I don't care what the world is saying. Help Afghanistan in any way and make it possible for us to get out of this situation.""While regional and world leaders discuss how to deal with Afghanistan, the Taliban strengthen their rule in the war-ravaged country. There are reports of Taliban infighting, but the group has so far remained largely united.The Afghan rulers have the backing of China and Russia, two world powers that are clashing with the West on several fronts at the moment. McCaul expressed his concern about China's Belt and Road investments in Afghanistan and the potential benefits for the Taliban.Pakistan, a regional player that has historically had an influence on the Taliban, appears to be in a dilemma.Foreign Minister Bhutto-Zardari wants the Taliban to act against ""Islamic State"" and other militant groups operating in Afghanistan. The security situation in Pakistan has only worsened since the Taliban seized power.The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group with links with the Afghan Taliban, have launched two massive terror attacks inside Pakistan in the span of three weeks. On Friday, TTP militants attacked and besieged a central police station in Karachi, the country's economic hub. Pakistani security forces managed to thwart the assault and killed several militants but many people, including police officials, died as a result.""In Peshawar, terrorists cost us over 100 lives, and just recently they attacked a police office in Karachi,"" Bhutto-Zardari said. ""The realistic scenario for us is that whoever is in charge in Afghanistan must fight these organizations.""""You can't solve the humanitarian problems with humanitarian aid alone,"" Bhutto-Zardari said. ""Afghanistan's economy isn't working, its funds are frozen, its banking channels are not functional, and then there are international sanctions. Until these issues are resolved, it will be very difficult for Afghanistan to come out of this crisis.""But there is pushback against that. Removing the sanctions and unfreezing funds would mean strengthening the Taliban regime, which is definitely not an option for the West, even as Afghanistan's population is suffering in the meantime.A member of the audience at the Munich Security Conference panel aptly noted that it is Afghans who have the least say of all in their near-term future.",2023/02/18,,

We cannot and shall not allow that,"" Hoekstra said.He did not say exactly how many Russians had been told to leave the country.The decision comes amid a dispute over Moscow's apparent refusal to grant visas to Dutch diplomats to staff the Netherlands' consulate in St. Petersburg and embassy in the Russian capital.Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Netherlands expelled 17 Russian diplomats on suspicion of espionage, and in response, Moscow expelled some Dutch diplomats from Russia.Hoekstra said the two countries then agreed to admit new diplomats, but he added that Russia was refusing to issue visas.As a result, the Netherlands is closing its consulate in St. Petersburg on Monday because it lacks staff.The Netherlands said it had also decided to limit the number of diplomats at the Russian embassy in The Hague to match the number of those at the Dutch embassy in Moscow.Moscow said it would respond to the Dutch move, the Russian state-owned RIA news agency reported.lo/sms (AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/02/18,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814744,Syrian state media: Israeli airstrikes kill 5 in Damascus,"DAMASCUS (AP) — Israeli airstrikes targeted a residential neighborhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus early Sunday, killing at least five people and wounding 15, Syrian state news reported.

            Loud explosions were heard over a central area of the capital around 12:30 a.m. local time, and SANA reported that Syrian air defenses were “confronting hostile targets in the sky around Damascus.”

            Syrian state media agency SANA, citing a military source, reported that five people had been killed, among them a soldier, and 15 civilians wounded, along with “destruction of a number of residential buildings.”











            The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported that 15 people, including a woman, were killed in strikes targeting sites connected with Iranian militias and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. They took place in the Damascus countryside and on an Iranian school in the neighborhood of Kafr Sousa in the capital, it said.

            There was no immediate statement from Israel on the attack.

            Israeli airstrikes frequently target sites in the vicinity of Damascus. The Saturday night strikes were the first since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6. 

            The last reported attack on Damascus was on Jan. 2, when the Syrian army reported that Israel’s military fired missiles toward the international airport of Syria’s capital early Monday, putting it out of service and killing two soldiers and wounding two others.

            Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, but rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.

            Israel has acknowledged, however, that it targets bases of Iran-allied militant groups, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces.

            The Israeli strikes come amid a wider shadow war between Israel and Iran. The attacks on airports in Damascus and Aleppo were over fears they were being used to funnel Iranian weaponry into the country.DAMASCUS (AP) — Israeli airstrikes targeted a residential neighborhood in the Syrian capital of Damascus early Sunday, killing at least five people and wounding 15, Syrian state news reported.Loud explosions were heard over a central area of the capital around 12:30 a.m. local time, and SANA reported that Syrian air defenses were “confronting hostile targets in the sky around Damascus.”Syrian state media agency SANA, citing a military source, reported that five people had been killed, among them a soldier, and 15 civilians wounded, along with “destruction of a number of residential buildings.”The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported that 15 people, including a woman, were killed in strikes targeting sites connected with Iranian militias and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814745,Anthem for Charles III’s coronation written by Lloyd Webber,"LONDON (AP) — Andrew Lloyd Webber, the English composer who created the scores for blockbuster musicals such as “Cats,’’ “The Phantom of the Opera’’ and “Evita,’’ has written the anthem for King Charles III’s coronation, adapting a piece of church music that encourages singers to make a “joyful noise.” 

            The work by Webber is one of a dozen new pieces Charles commissioned for the grand occasion taking place May 6 at Westminster Abbey. It includes words adapted from Psalm 98 and is scored specifically for the abbey’s choir and organ.

            “I hope my anthem reflects this joyful occasion,” Webber said in a statement distributed by Buckingham Palace.











            The program for the king's coronation ceremony includes older music and new compositions as the palace seeks to blend traditional and modern elements that reflect the realities of modern Britain. New pieces were composed by artists with roots in all four of the United Kingdom’s constituent nations, as well as in the Commonwealth and foreign countries that have sent so many people to its shores. 

            The service will include works by William Byrd (1543–1623), George Frideric Handel (1685–1759), Edward Elgar (1857–1934), Henry Walford Davies (1869–1941), William Walton (1902–1983), Hubert Parry (1848–1918) and Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958), whose music has featured in previous coronations, along with a piece from the contemporary Welsh composer Karl Jenkins.

            There will also be new works by Sarah Class, Nigel Hess, Paul Mealor, Tarik O’Regan, Roxanna Panufnik, Shirley J. Thompson, Judith Weir, Roderick Williams and Debbie Wiseman.

            “The decision to combine old and new reflects the cultural breadth of the age in which we live,’’ said Andrew Nethsingha, the organist and master of choristers at Westminster Abbey.

            “Coronations have taken place in Westminster Abbey since 1066. It has been a privilege to collaborate with his majesty in choosing fine musicians and accessible, communicative music for this great occasion,” Nethsingha said.

             In all, six orchestral commissions, five choral commissions and one organ commission — spanning the classical, sacred, film, television and musical theater genres — were created for the coronation.

            The program will also include personal touches, including a musical tribute to Charles’ late father, Prince Philip, who was born a Greek prince. The new monarch requested Greek Orthodox music, which will be performed by the Byzantine Chant Ensemble.

            Though specifics on some of the material are being kept under wraps, one hymn will definitely be part of the service: Handel’s “Zadok the Priest.”

            The hymn, with its robust chorus of “God Save the King,” has been played at every coronation since it was commissioned for the coronation of King George II in 1727.LONDON (AP) — Andrew Lloyd Webber, the English composer who created the scores for blockbuster musicals such as “Cats,’’ “The Phantom of the Opera’’ and “Evita,’’ has written the anthem for King Charles III’s coronation, adapting a piece of church music that encourages singers to make a “joyful noise.”The work by Webber is one of a dozen new pieces Charles commissioned for the grand occasion taking place May 6 at Westminster Abbey. It includes words adapted from Psalm 98 and is scored specifically for the abbey’s choir and organ.“I hope my anthem reflects this joyful occasion,” Webber said in a statement distributed by Buckingham Palace.The program for the king's coronation ceremony includes older music and new compositions as the palace seeks to blend traditional and modern elements that reflect the realities of modern Britain.

            RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Martin Necas had a goal and two assists to help Carolina win its first NHL Stadium Series outdoor game.

            Jesperi Kotkaniemi, Paul Stastny and Teuvo Teravainen also scored for Carolina, which completed a three-game season sweep of their Metropolitan Division foe. 

            The game was held at Carter-Finley Stadium, home to North Carolina State’s college football team and across the street from Carolina’s home ice at PNC Arena. Delayed two years because of COVID-19 attendance restrictions, the game drew a buzzing sellout crowd of 56,961 fans. 

            Tom Wilson scored midway through the third period for the Capitals, who suffered their fourth straight loss. The past three have come without captain and leading goal-scorer Alex Ovechkin, who is away after the death of his father.

            Officials at OdySea Aquarium made the announcement Friday, posting video of the fuzzy birds on social media. They hatched a few weeks ago and will remain behind the scenes with their parents until they're ready for a public appearance.

            African penguins have suffered a massive population decline over the decades and are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.











            So any successful hatching is cause for celebration, said Jess Peranteau, director of animal care and education at the aquarium.

            The breeding program established by the association aims to build up a viable genetic pool for the species. 

            Officials say two of the three new chicks in Scottsdale are clutch-mates, born to parents Mojo and Lemieux — a power couple of sorts that was selected for pairing as part of the breeding program. The third chick was born to first-time parents Bubbles and Weasley. 

            Aquarium workers will regularly conduct “chick checks,"" brief exams to monitor their growth and development and ensure they are hitting all necessary milestones.

            FRANCE

            Still reeling from three consecutive losses in all competitions, Paris Saint-Germain looks to bounce back against Lille in the league. PSG has been struggling since the start of the year, with stars Neymar and Lionel Messi underperforming. Neymar has been on the end of sharp criticism for a perceived lack of commitment after French media reported that he attended a poker tournament and dined at a fast-food restaurant a day after PSG lost to Bayern Munich 1-0 at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League round of 16. According to the French league, PSG has not lost four games in a row in more than two decades. Another loss would spark its biggest crisis since Qatari investors took over in 2011.











            ENGLAND

            Manchester United tries to strengthen its grip on third place in the Premier League when it hosts Leicester. Lisandro Martinez and Marcel Sabitzer are back for United after missing the midweek Europa League match against Barcelona because of suspensions. Manager Erik ten Hag insisted his players won't be distracted by the uncertainty surrounding the club ownership, with two bidders competing to buy out the Glazer family. Tottenham will again be without manager Antonio Conte, who is recovering from surgery to remove his gallbladder, in the London derby against West Ham. Spurs are out to revive their challenge for a top-four spot. 

            SPAIN

            Barcelona hosts Cadiz amid an uproar in local soccer after it became publicly known this week that a state prosecutor is probing Barcelona’s payment of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the country’s refereeing committee. Barcelona has denied any wrongdoing and says it was paying for reports on referees and never tried to influence their decisions in games. Barcelona leads the league but Real Madrid closed to within five points after winning at Osasuna 2-0 on Saturday. Barcelona will be without the injured Pedri González, but fellow midfielder Sergio Busquets returns after injury. Manager Xavi Hernández could rest some regular starters before visiting Manchester United next week with their Europa League playoff poised at 2-2 after the opening leg. Atletico Madrid hosts Athletic Bilbao wanting to consolidate its hold on fourth place. Sevilla will try to string together three wins in a row for the first time this season when it visits Rayo Vallecano. Last-placed Elche plays Espanyol after just one win in 21 rounds.

            GERMANY

            It’s capital clubs versus Ruhr rivals as Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga title challengers hope to take advantage of the 10-time defending champion’s 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday. Union Berlin can take over the lead – and move two points above Bayern – by beating last-placed Schalke at home, and Borussia Dortmund can move level with Bayern on points with a win over visiting Hertha Berlin. Union and Dortmund have won all of their six Bundesliga games this year. Union celebrated reaching its season target of 40 points for league survival last weekend and has had to set new goals after surprising all with its success. But Schalke has been showing signs of improvement after drawing its last three league games. Also, Bayer Leverkusen hosts Mainz.

            ITALY

            Atalanta, Roma and Lazio seek to continue their push for the Champions League spots in Serie A. Atalanta and Roma are three points below third-placed AC Milan and they host Lecce and Hellas Verona respectively. Lazio is two points further back and visits struggling Salernitana. Roma has won just one of its past five matches in all competitions, while a resurgent Verona has given itself hope of avoiding relegation. It has lost just one of its past seven matches to inch to within two points of safety. A win in the capital would move Verona out of the bottom three if Spezia also loses at home to Juventus. Fiorentina will be hoping for a good result at home to Empoli to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight.

Another loss would spark its biggest crisis since Qatari investors took over in 2011.ENGLANDManchester United tries to strengthen its grip on third place in the Premier League when it hosts Leicester. Lisandro Martinez and Marcel Sabitzer are back for United after missing the midweek Europa League match against Barcelona because of suspensions. Manager Erik ten Hag insisted his players won't be distracted by the uncertainty surrounding the club ownership, with two bidders competing to buy out the Glazer family. Tottenham will again be without manager Antonio Conte, who is recovering from surgery to remove his gallbladder, in the London derby against West Ham. Spurs are out to revive their challenge for a top-four spot.SPAINBarcelona hosts Cadiz amid an uproar in local soccer after it became publicly known this week that a state prosecutor is probing Barcelona’s payment of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the country’s refereeing committee. Barcelona has denied any wrongdoing and says it was paying for reports on referees and never tried to influence their decisions in games. Barcelona leads the league but Real Madrid closed to within five points after winning at Osasuna 2-0 on Saturday. Barcelona will be without the injured Pedri González, but fellow midfielder Sergio Busquets returns after injury. Manager Xavi Hernández could rest some regular starters before visiting Manchester United next week with their Europa League playoff poised at 2-2 after the opening leg. Atletico Madrid hosts Athletic Bilbao wanting to consolidate its hold on fourth place. Sevilla will try to string together three wins in a row for the first time this season when it visits Rayo Vallecano. Last-placed Elche plays Espanyol after just one win in 21 rounds.GERMANYIt’s capital clubs versus Ruhr rivals as Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga title challengers hope to take advantage of the 10-time defending champion’s 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday. Union Berlin can take over the lead – and move two points above Bayern – by beating last-placed Schalke at home, and Borussia Dortmund can move level with Bayern on points with a win over visiting Hertha Berlin. Union and Dortmund have won all of their six Bundesliga games this year. Union celebrated reaching its season target of 40 points for league survival last weekend and has had to set new goals after surprising all with its success. But Schalke has been showing signs of improvement after drawing its last three league games. Also, Bayer Leverkusen hosts Mainz.ITALYAtalanta, Roma and Lazio seek to continue their push for the Champions League spots in Serie A. Atalanta and Roma are three points below third-placed AC Milan and they host Lecce and Hellas Verona respectively. Lazio is two points further back and visits struggling Salernitana. Roma has won just one of its past five matches in all competitions, while a resurgent Verona has given itself hope of avoiding relegation. It has lost just one of its past seven matches to inch to within two points of safety. A win in the capital would move Verona out of the bottom three if Spezia also loses at home to Juventus. Fiorentina will be hoping for a good result at home to Empoli to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World

(AP) — Tolu Smith scored 17 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Cameron Matthews also scored 17 points and Mississippi State beat Mississippi 69-61 in an offensive scrum in overtime on Saturday.

            Dashawn Davis scored 12 points and D.J. Jeffries scored 10 for Mississippi State (18-9, 6-8 SEC) which overcame 19 turnovers shooting 18 for 21 from the foul line.

            Jaemyn Brakefield scored 20 points for Ole Miss (10-17, 2-12), Matthew Murrell scored 15 points though struggled shooting 4 for 17 and Myles Burns scored 10 with a career-high seven steals. Burns' defensive effort was the second-highest steals total in program history. Five other former players equaled the feat. Gerald Glass (1988) and Eric Laird (1983) share the record with eight.











            The Bulldogs shot 16.7% (3 for 18) from 3-point range while Ole Miss shot 13.6% (3 for 22) from deep. The long ball was so hard to come by that Jeffries inadvertently ricocheted one in off the corner of the backboard with the shot clock expiring with 3:25 left in overtime for a 61-56 Bulldogs lead.

            Mississippi State made all four shot attempts and all four foul shots in the extra session and never trailed in overtime. 

            Smith made a layup with 29 seconds left in regulation to tie it at 56-all for Mississippi State. Eric Reed Jr. came up with a block on Murrell who lost his footing on his jump-shot attempt trying for the win.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814767,"Nunge, No. 16 Xavier bounce back from 2 losses, beat DePaul","CINCINNATI (AP) — Jack Nunge had 18 points and 10 rebounds as No. 16 Xavier bounced back from a pair of narrow losses to beat DePaul 82-68 on Saturday.

            Xavier fell earlier in the week by a combined three points to Butler and No. 11 Marquette.

            The Musketeers (20-7, 12-4 Big East) reached the 20-win mark for the 34th time in school history, 32 of which have come since the 1982-83 season. 











            “I don't make light of winning 20 regular-season games,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “It is not easy, especially in a conference like the Big East .... and in our case, the non-conference schedule that we played.” 

            It was the 17th career double-double for Nunge, eighth this season. Adam Kunkel scored 16 points and tied a career-high with eight assists for Xavier.

            Jerome Hunter had 15 points and nine rebounds for the Musketeers and Colby Jones scored 14 points for the Musketeers. 

            Hunter fell one rebound shy of his first career double-double. 

            “I thought Jerome Hunter was really good,” Miller said. “He's regaining the form he played at earlier in the season. When he plays like that, our team takes a step up.”

            Umoja Gibson had 17 points and De'Sean Nelson 16 for DePaul (9-18, 3-13), which lost its eighth in a row.

            Gibson scored 22 points in a win over Xavier last month.

            Xavier went 8 of 17 from 3-point range in the first half. Kunkel made three straight 3s during a 14-3 run as the Musketeers built a 22-point halftime lead. 

            The Musketeers held DePaul to just 27 points in the first half after allowing 45 in the first half in the first meeting. 

            “It was great to get our confidence up and get back on the winning side,” Kunkel said. “We were really focused on the defensive side. We knew the offense would come.” 

            The Musketeers played their fifth game without second-leading scorer and leading rebounder Zach Freemantle, who is out with a foot injury but expected to return by the postseason. 

            ON THE DEFENSIVE

            Xavier which was allowing more than 82 points per game, has held three straight opponents to fewer than 70. The improvement comes at a critical juncture when the Musketeers are without Freemantle's 15.2 points per game. “I feel like we're starting to improve on defense, but it took a while,” Miller said. “Today I thought our defense was as responsible for the win as our offense. That hasn't been the case.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            DePaul: Nick Ongenda made his first start for the Blue Demons since undergoing wrist surgery in December and scored five points before fouling out with eight minutes left. The Blue Demons were without 6-10 forward Yor Anei, who injured his hamstring during Tuesday’s loss to St. John’s. 

            Xavier: The Musketeers have depth concerns at the moment. In addition to Freemantle being out, Desmond Claude has missed two games with a non-COVID related illness and Kam Craft injured his left knee in practice last week and is expected to miss 3-4 weeks. “We have weathered the storm, and that's a credit to our team,"" Miller said. “We need to get healthy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814771,Slimmed-down Giolito looking for big season for White Sox,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — After last season, Lucas Giolito was, well, angry. The right-hander packed up that anger and took it right to the gym.

            The end result is a slimmed-down version of the 6-foot-6 Giolito primed for what he hopes will be a return to his previous form with the Chicago White Sox.

            “I just took last year’s failure as big-time motivation, so I worked really hard in the gym,” he said Saturday. “Kind of revamped, just the focus and attention to every little area when it comes to getting my body in the correct shape.”











            Giolito bulked up ahead of last season, and it turned into a disaster. It started on opening day, when he pitched four scoreless innings before departing because of abdominal tightness on his left side.

            He struggled with consistency all year long. He finished with a 4.90 ERA and 177 strikeouts in 161 2/3 innings over 30 starts, going 11-9.

            In 2021, he had an identical 11-9 record, but he had a 3.53 ERA and 201 Ks in 178 2/3 innings over 31 starts.

            When last season ended, Giolito knew he needed to make a change. In addition to his work in the gym, he also changed his diet.

            He weighed 280 pounds at the start of spring training last year, and he said he is down to 245 right now. 

            “Cut down on fat and leaned out some so that I'm, I'd say, more stable, more explosive, more athletic,” he said, “because me as a big guy it’s important to be able to repeat my mechanics and be an athlete as much as I possibly can. So that was a huge focus.”

            The 28-year-old Giolito threw a live BP session Saturday. Pitching coach Ethan Katz said he has noticed a difference in the pitcher already this year.

            “His body is in a much better spot than it was last year. After everything we went through, that was the goal to kind of get it back to where it’s been,” Katz said. “And you know, he’s in phenomenal shape. His strength numbers are as good as they were last year with all that weight.”

            With Giolito struggling, to go along with a string of injuries, Chicago went 81-81 in 2022 and failed to make the playoffs after beginning the season with lofty expectations.

            At least with Giolito, the White Sox have seen him bounce back before. He went 10-13 with a 6.18 ERA in 2018, allowing a major league-high 118 earned runs and issuing an AL-worst 90 walks.

            He followed that tough year with his best big league season, going 14-9 with a 3.41 ERA and becoming an AL All-Star. He also finished 2019 in a tie for the league lead with three complete games and two shutouts. The next year, he pitched a no-hitter.

            Giolito is eligible for free agency after this season, but he said that isn't on his mind right now.

            “Looking around camp, seeing so many guys show up in great shape and watching bullpens and just unreal stuff right now, I feel like our focus is on righting the ship from last year and going out and playing really good White Sox baseball,” he said. “If I do my part doing that, then everything else will take care of itself.”

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsGLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — After last season, Lucas Giolito was, well, angry. The right-hander packed up that anger and took it right to the gym.The end result is a slimmed-down version of the 6-foot-6 Giolito primed for what he hopes will be a return to his previous form with the Chicago White Sox.“I just took last year’s failure as big-time motivation, so I worked really hard in the gym,” he said Saturday. “Kind of revamped, just the focus and attention to every little area when it comes to getting my body in the correct shape.”Giolito bulked up ahead of last season, and it turned into a disaster. It started on opening day, when he pitched four scoreless innings before departing because of abdominal tightness on his left side.He struggled with consistency all year long. He finished with a 4.90 ERA and 177 strikeouts in 161 2/3 innings over 30 starts, going 11-9.In 2021, he had an identical 11-9 record, but he had a 3.53 ERA and 201 Ks in 178 2/3 innings over 31 starts.When last season ended, Giolito knew he needed to make a change. In addition to his work in the gym, he also changed his diet.He weighed 280 pounds at the start of spring training last year, and he said he is down to 245 right now.“Cut down on fat and leaned out some so that I'm, I'd say, more stable, more explosive, more athletic,” he said, “because me as a big guy it’s important to be able to repeat my mechanics and be an athlete as much as I possibly can. So that was a huge focus.”The 28-year-old Giolito threw a live BP session Saturday. Pitching coach Ethan Katz said he has noticed a difference in the pitcher already this year.“His body is in a much better spot than it was last year. After everything we went through, that was the goal to kind of get it back to where it’s been,” Katz said. “And you know, he’s in phenomenal shape. His strength numbers are as good as they were last year with all that weight.”With Giolito struggling, to go along with a string of injuries, Chicago went 81-81 in 2022 and failed to make the playoffs after beginning the season with lofty expectations.At least with Giolito, the White Sox have seen him bounce back before. He went 10-13 with a 6.18 ERA in 2018, allowing a major league-high 118 earned runs and issuing an AL-worst 90 walks.He followed that tough year with his best big league season, going 14-9 with a 3.41 ERA and becoming an AL All-Star.

Carter, 98, who has lived longer after leaving the White House than any former president in U.S. history, was a Democrat who served from January 1977 to January 1981.
""He has the full support of his family and his medical team. The Carter family asks for privacy during this time and is grateful for the concern shown by his many admirers,"" the center said in a statement.
In recent years, the Georgia native suffered from several health issues including melanoma that spread to his liver and brain, although he had responded well to treatment he received.
The former peanut farmer's rocky four years at the helm of the country were marred by economic woes at home and the Iran hostage crisis that ended just after he left office. But Carter also played a central role in brokering the Camp David accords that led to the landmark Egypt-Israeli peace treaty.
He was swept from office in an electoral landslide in 1980 as voters embraced Republican challenger Ronald Reagan, the former actor and California governor.
However, Carter rehabilitated his legacy as he worked energetically for decades on humanitarian causes.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 in recognition of his ""untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814790,Langer leads Chubb in bid to tie Irwin's Champ wins record,"NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — Bernhard Langer remained in position to tie Hale Irwin's PGA Tour Champions victory record of 45, shooting a 2-under 70 on Saturday to take a one-stroke lead into the final round of the Chubb Classic.

            The 65-year-old Langer, the winner last year, had a 10-under 134 total on Tiburon Golf Club’s Black Course after bettering his age Friday with a 64.

            Charles Schwab Cup winner Steven Alker (65) was a stroke back with Jerry Kelly (66), Dicky Pride (70) and Paul Goydos (71).











            At 8 under, two shots back, were Fred Couples, who shot 69 with bogeys at two par 5s, and Steve Stricker (69), who is seeking a record fourth consecutive PGA Tour Champions victory. 

            Langer already is the oldest winner in PGA Tour Champions history, having won the TimberTech Championship last fall after his 65th birthday.

            With wind blowing steadily beyond 15 mph Saturday, Langer had to work hard for his 70. In all, 10 players will begin the final round within three shots of the German star.

            “To win with this kind of leaderboard, you’ve got to play a near-flawless round of golf, I think,” Langer said. “You’ve got to have a pretty low score, one of the lowest scores tomorrow, and that’s got to be my goal.”

            A bogey at the par-4 11th hole left him at level par for the round, but he edged back ahead down the stretch with birdies on the par-5 12th and 15th. 

            “It was tough,"" Langer said. ""The wind was gusting anywhere from 10 to 25 mph, it seemed, so it was hard to grab the right club at the right time, and challenging pin positions at times.”

            Langer has won the Chubb four times already, on multiple courses. A fifth victory at the Chubb would be the second-most victories by any PGA Tour Champions player at a single event. Irwin, the man whose record Langer will try to run down Sunday, won the Turtle Bay Championship in Hawaii six times.

            “Anytime you do something that hasn’t been done, it’s an achievement and something special, and this certainly would be,” Langer said when asked about Irwin’s record. “When I came out here and I saw Hale Irwin’s 45 wins, I’m going, 'Wow! That’s incredible! I don’t see that will ever be broken kind of thing.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814795,AP source: Brittney Griner re-signs with Phoenix Mercury,"Brittney Griner is headed back to the Phoenix Mercury.

            Griner, who was a free agent, re-signed with the Mercury on a one-year contract according to a person familiar with the deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Saturday because no announcement has been made.

            The 32-year-old Griner had said she would return to Phoenix in a social media post in December, after she returned home from her 10-month ordeal in Russia that included time in a Russian jail. Griner had been arrested at an airport just outside of Moscow on drug possession charges a year ago and was brought home in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange in December. 











            The 6-foot-9 center last played for the Mercury in 2021 and helped the team reach the WNBA Finals. She averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 rebounds that season.

            The website “Her Hoops Stats” was the first to report Griner's signing. 

            Griner, who was drafted No. 1 in 2013 by the Mercury, was listed Saturday on Phoenix's roster on the WNBA website.

            Since returning home from Russia, Griner has been out of the public spotlight, with the exception of appearances at the Super Bowl, the Phoenix Open and an MLK Day event in Phoenix, where she lives.

            Earlier Saturday, the Mercury signed Diana Taurasi to a multiyear contract. The WNBA’s all-time leading scorer has only played with the Mercury since being drafted No. 1 by the team in 2004.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814797,Grambling tops Southern 69-64 at NBA HBCU Classic,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — With the nation watching, Grambling State and Southern put on a show for the SWAC on Saturday.

            Shawndarius Cowart scored 18 points to lead Grambling State to a 69-64 overtime victory over Southern in the NBA HBCU Classic.

            The game was part of the NBA All-Star events in Salt Lake City. The nationally televised game preceded All-Star Saturday night’s lineup featuring the NBA’s dunk contest, 3-point shootout and skills competition.











            “It’s basically a recruiting tool for national exposure for us,” Grambling State coach Donte’ Jackson said. 

            Both schools were thrilled to get a national spotlight shined on their teams and their league, the SWAC. Increased national exposure is going hand-in-hand with an uptick in talent and more competitive results across the league. 

            “The NBA has given us this platform, but this isn’t the end,” Southern coach Sean Woods said. “We’re getting more TV exposure, so you’re starting to see really big time games. And with the transfer portal now, we’re getting transfers coming in from Power 5 schools. The talent pool is rising in our league. “ 

            Cowart went 9 of 13 from the field to pace the Tigers (18-8, 11-3 SWAC) to their fifth consecutive victory. Jourdan Smith added 14 points and nine rebounds. Carte’Are Gordon chipped in 14 points and seven boards.

            Grambling State forced 16 turnovers and blocked nine shots. 

            Brion Whitley scored 13 points for Southern and Terrell Williams, Jr. added 12 points. Bryson Etienne chipped in 10 points and seven rebounds. The Jaguars (13-14, 9-4) outrebounded Grambling State 47-38, but shot just 31% from the field. 

            Grambling State took the lead for good on Gordon’s layup with 2:04 left in overtime. Tramichael Moton converted a three-point play with 19.8 seconds remaining to seal the victory. 

            Southern erased a 14-point deficit behind a 19-3 run late in the second half. Whitley made a go-ahead 3-pointer to give the Jaguars a 62-61 lead with 36 seconds left in regulation. 

            Gordon hit one of two free throws to tie it up and force overtime. 

            “Those guys made a lot of different runs and they could have won the game,” Smith said. “We kept pushing. I feel like I got locked in from the beginning.” 

            Grambling took the lead before halftime and led throughout much of the second half. The Tigers built a double-digit lead behind a 15-4 run. Jonathan Aku and Cowart finished off the spurt with back-to-back layups, giving Grambling State a 51-37 lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814798,Blinken warns China's Wang Yi against aiding Russia in Ukraine,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow.
The top diplomats of the two superpowers met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich, just hours after Wang scolded Washington as ""hysterical"" in a running dispute over the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.
Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Washington said China flew a spy balloon over the continental U.S. before American fighter jets shot it down on President Joe Biden's orders. The dispute also came at a time when the West is closely watching Beijing's response to the Ukraine war.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday morning on NBC News' ""Meet the Press with Chuck Todd,"" Blinken said the United States was very concerned that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia and that he made clear to Wang that ""would have serious consequences in our relationship.""
""There are various kinds of lethal assistance that they are at least contemplating providing, to include weapons,"" Blinken said, adding that Washington would soon release more details.
Speaking to reporters in a briefing call, a senior State Department official said China was trying to ""have it both ways"" by claiming it wants to contribute to peace and stability but at the same time taking ""concerning"" steps to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""(The) secretary was quite blunt in warning about the implications and consequences of China providing material support to Russia or assisting Russia with systematic sanctions evasion,"" the senior official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Russia and China signed a ""no limits"" partnership last February shortly before Russian forces invaded Ukraine, and their economic links have boomed as Moscow's connections with the West have shriveled.
The West has been wary of China's response to the Ukraine war, with some warning that a Russian victory would color China's actions toward Taiwan. China has refrained from condemning the war or calling it an ""invasion.""
Earlier, speaking at a panel at the conference, Wang reiterated a call for dialogue and suggested European countries ""think calmly"" about how to end the war.
He also said there were ""some forces that seemingly don't want negotiations to succeed, or for the war to end soon,"" without specifying to whom he was referring.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi of consequences should China provide material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying in an interview after the two met that Washington was concerned Beijing was considering supplying weapons to Moscow.The top diplomats of the two superpowers met at an undisclosed location on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich, just hours after Wang scolded Washington as ""hysterical"" in a running dispute over the U.S. downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.Relations between the two countries have been fraught since Washington said China flew a spy balloon over the continental U.S. before American fighter jets shot it down on President Joe Biden's orders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814800,Rahm limits mistakes to take Riviera lead as Tigers posts 67,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jon Rahm has a game for wherever he plays, whether it's Spain or Dubai, Hawaii or California. That's what makes the final round at Riviera so daunting for the few people left who have a chance to catch him.

            Rahm played bogey-free Saturday in the Genesis Invitational, pulling away from Max Homa and Keith Mitchell late in the round by keeping that clean card. One last birdie on the closing hole gave him a 6-under 65 and a three-shot lead over Homa.

            At stake is a chance Sunday to return to No. 1 in the world, a ranking that would fit the level of his play for the last six months.











            Rahm was taking nothing for granted.

            “Somebody is going to shoot a round of 4, 5, 6, 7 under. It happens every single tournament we play in, so I have to be aware that somebody is going to make a run and I’m going to have to shoot a 60s round for sure to give myself a chance to win,” Rahm said. “Just aware that I need to keep doing what I’ve been doing.”

            Tiger Woods lost ground, even if he looked good doing it. Woods had a tap-in eagle on his way to a 67, his lowest Saturday round in an official event since he won the Zozo Championship in Japan in the fall of 2019. Even so, he was 12 shots back.

            Homa, who grew up about 30 miles away, attended this tournament as a kid and then won it two years ago, started with a one-shot lead and stayed step-for-step with Rahm. Along with Mitchell, that final threesome combined for 12 birdies and no bogeys through 14 holes on a day when the course played to a 70.31 average.

            “I messed that up,” Homa said with a smile.

            He hurt his own chances, though certainly not confidence. Homa took bogey from the fairway bunker on the 15th, the hardest hole at Riviera, and then missed another par putt from 10 feet after finding a bunker on the par-3 16th. Homa shot 69.

            That was enough to give Rahm an edge, not that he needs much of one.

            Homa has six PGA Tour victories — three of them in the last nine months — and he has come from behind in all but one of them.

            “It gives me confidence, I guess. It’s a bit of a different test with Jon. He played very flawless golf today,” Homa said. “But I feel like I have haven’t really matched everything up yet this week minus the first day, and even then I felt like I could have driven it a little better. I’m encouraged. I’m excited to do that tomorrow. I’m going to have to play a really good round of golf.”

            Mitchell made his only bogey on the final hole and had a 69 to fall four behind. The only other player within five shots was Patrick Cantlay (68).

            Mitchell's only two mistakes was a bad drive into the bunker on the par-5 17th that kept him from reaching the green, and the drive on the 18th that led to a par putt he missed.

            “To play 16 good holes without making a mistake is really all you’re looking for in the last group on Saturday,” Mitchell said. “Jon played amazing, so I’m going to have to really do something special tomorrow to catch up to him.”

            Rahm has been the best player in golf over the last six months. Dating to the BMW PGA Championship on the European tour, he has finished among the top 10 in nine consecutive tournaments, winning four of them.

            All that's left is a return to No. 1 in the world, and he can do that with a victory Sunday.

            For Woods, it felt like a win just being back on the PGA Tour for four straight rounds, something he hasn't done since the Masters. Then again, he only played three times last year because of his right leg severely damaged in a February 2021 car crash.

            He made the cut on the number when the second round was completed Saturday morning, 11 shots off the lead and starting on the back nine in one of the last few groups. That didn't keep thousands of fans lining the fairway over the next five hours.

            Woods made a few birdies on the back nine, and then hit 5-iron onto the front of the green at the par-5 first hole, the ball rolling across the firm turf and a few inches next to the cup before settling 3 feet away for an eagle.

            His only bogey came at the seventh. 

            “I wanted to get in touch with the leaders today, I was hoping to shoot something a little bit lower than I did just so I could reach out to them hopefully with a low round tomorrow,” Woods said. “I might be a little far away.”

            That leader is Rahm, and it's daunting regardless of the margin.

            The Spaniard was at 15-under 198, one extra shot to work with on Sunday. Also in range is the oldest 72-hole scoring record on the PGA Tour — 20-under 264 by Lanny Wadkins in 1985. All that matters to Rahm is another victory that would give him the ranking that his game embodies at the moment.

(AP) — A Tesla driver was killed and a passenger was critically injured Saturday when the car plowed into a fire truck that was parked on a Northern California freeway to shield a crew clearing another accident, fire officials said.

            Four firefighters who were in the truck when it was struck on Interstate 680 were treated for minor injuries, said Tracie Dutter, assistant chief of the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District. 

            The driver was declared dead at the scene, Dutter said. The car needed to be cut open to remove the passenger, who was taken to the hospital.











            Photos showed the front end of the car was crushed and the $1.4 million ladder truck was damaged.

            California Highway Patrol Officer Adam Lane said it was not clear whether the driver may have been intoxicated or whether the Tesla Model S was operating with automation or driving assistance features. 

            The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating how Tesla’s Autopilot system detects and responds to emergency vehicles parked on highways. At least 14 Teslas have crashed into emergency vehicles while using the system. 

            Dutter said the truck had its lights on and was parked diagonally on northbound lanes of the freeway to protect responders to an earlier accident that did not result in injuries. 

            The fatal accident occurred around 4 a.m., and it took several hours to clear the freeway. The firetruck had to be towed away.

            The Model S was among the nearly 363,000 vehicles Tesla recalled on Thursday because of potential flaws in its “Full Self-Driving” system. While the recall is aimed at correcting possible problems at intersections and with speed limits, it comes amid a broader investigation by U.S. safety regulators into Tesla’s automated driving systems.WALNUT CREEK, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814818,Tiger Woods gets some momentum with weekend 67 at Riviera,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jon Rahm could hear the cheers from all over Riviera, the sound typically associated with someone making a charge. Except they came from the opposite side of the course that featured players too far away from the lead.

            What they meant was not nearly as mysterious as to whom they belonged.

            “You're fully aware where Tiger is anywhere,” Rahm said after his own masterpiece Saturday in the Genesis Invitational, a 6-under 65 for a three-shot lead.











            Woods is cheered wildly just walking to the tee, though this time his golf was the source. He had a 67 that didn't allow him to pick up any ground — in fact, he fell a further shot behind and was 12 back going into Sunday.

            “Today was better,” Woods said. “I felt like I made some nice adjustments with my putting and that was the thing that held me back yesterday. I’ve driven it well the last three days, my iron play was been good. And the firm conditions I like, that’s kind of right up my alley with iron play. Just wish I could have putted a little bit better yesterday.”

            What stood out was the day. It was his best score on a Saturday in an official event since the fall of 2019.

            It's a small sample size to be sure — 12 tournaments since he won the Zozo Championship in Japan in 2019 — but his legs are a bigger issue than how he swings the club.

            Woods shattered bones in his right leg and ankle from a car crash in Los Angeles two years ago. He returned 14 months later to play in the Masters and made the cut, a remarkable feat. And then on the weekend, he limped his way to a pair of 78s.

            A month later at Southern Hills for the PGA Championship, he again made the cut with some dazzling play down the stretch on Friday. But the wind shifted, a cold front arrived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and he shot 79 and withdrew.

            Woods made the cut on the number at Riviera and started on the back nine. He opened with a 15-foot birdie putt, missed a good chance on the par-5 11th and then raised the putter in his left hand as his 25-foot birdie putt from the fringe on the par-3 14th dropped for another birdie.

            The biggest moment was on the par-5 opening hole after he made the turn. Caught between clubs and feeling a little wind in his face, he hit a cut with a 5-iron that landed toward the front of the green and rolled inches by the cup before settling 3 feet away for what amounted to a tap-in eagle.

            He finally dropped a shot on the seventh when his approached rolled off the steep ledge, leaving a tough pitch. But he finished better than Friday, when he bogeyed three of his last four holes. 

            “I thought I could make a run where I could reach out and touch the leaders,” Woods said before conceding that he was too far back.

            Rahm is playing at another level right now, a level with which Woods is familiar. The Spaniard has not finished out of the top 10 since August, and he is going for his fifth win over his last nine starts.

            Woods said he was sore after his fourth straight day walking — starting with the pro-am on Wednesday when he stopped playing after 16 holes — and he speaks of the recovery after a round and the preparation before it. 

            That part isn't fun. Saturday was. And while the chill in the morning air hasn't been great, the fast conditions at Riviera are right up his alley.

            “I've been pretty one dimensional on how to hit my tee shots,” he said. “I’ve kind of gone to my little stock shot because I just haven’t played enough where I feel like I can hit different shots. ... The way the golf course is playing, as fast as it is, a flat cut can go a very long way here, so I’ve been able to hit that shot. Then with the firm greens, I thoroughly enjoy that for my iron game, and finally made some putts.”

            Sunday will be his first 72-hole event since the Masters, and only his second since his car crash that happened not far from Riviera. Woods already is looking ahead to his return to Augusta National, but he wants to wait until after this week to see about adding any tournaments before then.

But he finished better than Friday, when he bogeyed three of his last four holes.“I thought I could make a run where I could reach out and touch the leaders,” Woods said before conceding that he was too far back.Rahm is playing at another level right now, a level with which Woods is familiar. The Spaniard has not finished out of the top 10 since August, and he is going for his fifth win over his last nine starts.Woods said he was sore after his fourth straight day walking — starting with the pro-am on Wednesday when he stopped playing after 16 holes — and he speaks of the recovery after a round and the preparation before it.That part isn't fun. Saturday was. And while the chill in the morning air hasn't been great, the fast conditions at Riviera are right up his alley.“I've been pretty one dimensional on how to hit my tee shots,” he said. “I’ve kind of gone to my little stock shot because I just haven’t played enough where I feel like I can hit different shots. ... The way the golf course is playing, as fast as it is, a flat cut can go a very long way here, so I’ve been able to hit that shot. Then with the firm greens, I thoroughly enjoy that for my iron game, and finally made some putts.”Sunday will be his first 72-hole event since the Masters, and only his second since his car crash that happened not far from Riviera. Woods already is looking ahead to his return to Augusta National, but he wants to wait until after this week to see about adding any tournaments before then.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814819,"DeBrusk returns, scores to power Bruins past Islanders 6-2","BOSTON (AP) — Jake DeBrusk didn't hesitate when asked what he missed most about sitting out 17 games with a broken leg: “Scoring goals."" 

            The Bruins forward didn't waste any time after missing six weeks, scoring two minutes into the game on Saturday to propel NHL-leading Boston to a 6-2 victory over the tired New York Islanders. 

            “I’ve been waiting for this day for a while, and I just wanted to get a goal,” said DeBrusk, who scored twice, including the game-winner, in the Jan. 2 Winter Classic despite playing on a fractured fibula and hadn't played since.











            “I just wanted to get the first one,” he said Saturday. “It was great to get that.” 

            Trent Frederic had a pair of goals and Linus Ullmark stopped 26 shots for the Bruins, who have won four of their last five games to amass 89 points and the NHL’s best record. Nick Foligno, Patrice Bergeron and Pavel Zacha also scored for Boston.

            Kyle Palmieri and Matt Martin scored and Semyon Varlamov made 21 saves for the Islanders.

            MILESTONES

            It was Bergeron's 20th goal of the season — the 10th straight year, and 14th in his career, that he has reached the milestone.

            “He’s the model of consistency in this league,"" Foligno said. “He’s a guy that I’ve admired, a long time — and all of us do. He plays the game the right way. I think that’s one of the best compliments you can get as a player. And and he does that."" 

            Bergeron scored when DeBrusk's shot hit high off the glass behind the net and bounced back over the net and into the crease. The Bruins captain tipped it out of the air, about one foot from the goal line. 

            “He has a nose for understanding the scoring areas and the places to be. There’s a reason why that guy doesn’t go through too many slumps in his career,” Foligno said. “We're lucky to have him. He's the gold standard.” 

            ROUGH SCHEDULE

            New York was playing on back-to-back nights after beating Pittsburgh on Friday night to snap a three-game losing streak.

            “There’s a lot of times in the season where you have the advantage, and sometimes you have the disadvantage,” Bruins coach Jim Montgomery said. “That first period, that’s the way you want to play when you have a team on back-to-backs.”

            HOW THEY SCORED

            DeBrusk scored a power-play goal on his second shift back, taking a pass from Brad Marchand and flipping it through Varlamov’s legs. The Bruins, who won 5-0 in Nashville on Thursday night, made it 3-0 before Palmieri got the Islanders on the board early in the second.

            But Boston made it 4-1 on Bergeron's goal. Frederic scored three minutes later, and Zacha added on late in the period.

            HOME COOKING

            The Bruins have only lost twice at home in regulation, including a 2-1 defeat by the Washington Capitals on Feb. 11, their only other game in Boston since the All-Star break.

            “We just talked about getting the home win. The other night we didn’t get one here, coming back off the break and it ticked us off,"" Foligno said. “Something we talked about at the start of the year was being a real hard team at home, being a hard place to play. We wanted to get back to that.”

            The Bruins are 23-2-3 at home this season.

            Hill won the Xfinity Series season-opening race Saturday night for the second consecutive year to diminish some of the sting the Richard Childress Racing driver felt two days earlier when he failed to qualify for the Daytona 500. 

            Hill rebounded and drove from last to first at Daytona International Speedway. The Chevrolet driver was declared the winner after a long NASCAR review of the finishing order. The race went into overtime and Justin Allgaier was the leader until Allgaier's teammate, Sam Mayer, went high in an attempt to make the race-winning pass. 











            Contact between Hill and Mayer caused Mayer to spin and his Chevrolet to flip onto its roof, bringing out the race-ending caution. NASCAR then had to review timing and scoring to determine who was the leader when the yellow was thrown. 

            NASCAR needed nearly 10 minutes to determine Hill was ahead of Allgaier when the race ended. Allgaier settled for second. 

            “You can't lift, it's last lap,” Hill said. “I hope Sam's OK, man. That was a heck of a flip.” 

            Mayer was cleared from NASCAR's infield medical center. 

            Hill on Thursday night attempted to qualify for his first Daytona 500 and was in control of his fate until he was caught in a late crash. He blamed himself because he was in such good shape to make Sunday's main event and should not have been racing so aggressively.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814832,"Nico Hischier leads Devils past weary Penguins, 5-2","PITTSBURGH (AP) — The New Jersey Devils spent years staring up at the standings at the Pittsburgh Penguins.

            Not so much anymore.

            The young Devils are surging. The Penguins, meanwhile, are skidding. And a playoff berth that's been a rite of spring in Pittsburgh for the better part of two decades may be in jeopardy.











            Nico Hischier scored his 100th career goal as part of a two-goal, two-assist night, Vitek Vanecek made 29 saves and the Devils breezed past the weary Penguins 5-2 on Saturday.

            “We played a real solid third period, solid 60 minutes,” New Jersey coach Lindy Ruff said.

            Dawson Mercer had a goal and an assist for the Devils. Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton also scored for New Jersey, while All-Star center Jack Hughes had two assists in his return from a lower-body injury as the Devils improved to an NHL-best 21-4-3 on the road.

            “Not my best, but you know, you miss a week or two and we had the All-Star break too, so really that’s one (game) in pretty much two or three weeks,” said Hughes, who missed four games. ""That’s a good start and it’s a really big win for our team.”

            Evgeni Malkin scored twice for Pittsburgh to reach the 20-goal plateau. Dustin Tokarski stopped 38 shots but it wasn't nearly enough as the Penguins lost for the third time in four games.

            Less than 24 hours after squandering a pair of two-goal leads in a loss to the New York Islanders, the Penguins looked a step behind the fresher, sharper Devils.

            “We played pretty well on Long Island and then for at least for the first half tonight,” Pittsburgh captain Sidney Crosby said. ""Hopefully we can (gain) something from that. But we’ve go to find some consistency in our game.”

            The Devils, in second place in the Metropolitan behind Carolina, appear headed to their first playoff appearance since 2018. 

            Pittsburgh's postseason prospects are far murkier. The Penguins have reached the playoffs in 16 straight seasons, the longest active streak in major North American professional sports.

            Yet the Penguins find themselves in a scramble for one of the Eastern Conference’s two wild-card spots thanks in part to an eight-game losing streak against Metropolitan Division opponents.

            “We’re going to see what we’re made of here down the stretch,” Crosby said. ""That’s the situation we’re in and hopefully it brings out the best in us.”

            Malkin gave Pittsburgh an early jolt when the Russian star tapped in a pass from Rickard Rakell 3:33 into the first to give him 20 goals for the 14th time in his 17-year career, third most among active players behind Washington's Alex Ovechkin (18) and Crosby (15).

            Yet as has been the case most of an erratic season, the Penguins let the Devils back into the game almost immediately.

            Mercer tied it just 1:20 later following a sequence that began with Pittsburgh defenseman Chad Ruhwedel getting tangled up with a linesman deep in the Penguins' zone. A turnover soon followed and Mercer emerged from a scramble in front to rip a shot by Tokarski.

            The Devils took firm control in the second. Hamilton put New Jersey in front 3:27 into the period when he glided down the left circle, received a pass from behind the net by Hischier and fired a shot that zipped by Tokarski.

            Pittsburgh's middling power play had a chance to tie it a few minutes later only to surrender a two-on-one rush that ended with Yegor Sharangovich feathering a backhand pass to Hischier streaking down the left side. Hischier had little trouble beating Tokarski for the captain's 100th career goal.

            “Definitely a goal I’ll never forget, that’s for sure,” Hischier said. “It’s something that no one’s going to take away from me. So I’m pretty happy about it.”

            Bratt's 22nd goal 8:39 into the third pushed New Jersey's lead to three as the Devils moved to 22-0-2 when leading after two periods, the second-best record in the NHL behind Boston.

            NOTES: Pittsburgh goalie Tristan Jarry missed his ninth straight game with an upper-body injury that's required him to meet with medical professionals inside and outside the organization. Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said Jarry “is making progress” but there remains no timetable for his return. ... Pittsburgh D Brian Dumoulin left in the third period with what appeared to be a lower-body injury.

The Penguins, meanwhile, are skidding. And a playoff berth that's been a rite of spring in Pittsburgh for the better part of two decades may be in jeopardy.Nico Hischier scored his 100th career goal as part of a two-goal, two-assist night, Vitek Vanecek made 29 saves and the Devils breezed past the weary Penguins 5-2 on Saturday.“We played a real solid third period, solid 60 minutes,” New Jersey coach Lindy Ruff said.Dawson Mercer had a goal and an assist for the Devils. Jesper Bratt and Dougie Hamilton also scored for New Jersey, while All-Star center Jack Hughes had two assists in his return from a lower-body injury as the Devils improved to an NHL-best 21-4-3 on the road.“Not my best, but you know, you miss a week or two and we had the All-Star break too, so really that’s one (game) in pretty much two or three weeks,” said Hughes, who missed four games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814836,Cold weather expected in northern Taiwan this week,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sunny skies in northern Taiwan on Sunday (Feb 19) are expected to give way to a new cold front pushing southward, causing unstable weather.Cold showers, typical of early spring, will affect much of northern and eastern Taiwan. Central and southern areas won’t be affected according to the Facebook page of WeatherRisk Explore Inc. CEO Peng Chi-ming (彭啟明).Sunday is the start of Yushui (雨水), the second of 24 solar terms according to the lunar calendar. The period usually coincides with more frequent rain. It is also when many bird species begin their migration, and temperatures generally begin to warm.Another forecaster at WeatherRisk, Liao Yu-ting (廖于霆), said that northeasterly monsoon winds will strengthen around noon on Feb. 19, with northern and eastern areas becoming cooler with rain. Rainfall will be especially heavy on the northern coast, northern mountainous areas, and in Yilan, according to Liao's Facebook post.High temperatures in the north will be about 21 to 23 C. In central and southern areas they will be about 25 to 27 C, and in eastern areas they will be around 22 to 24 C.Liao said the weather front will have little impact on central and southern areas. However, weakening winds can make it easier for pollutants to accumulate, resulting in poor air quality. People prone to allergies may want to avoid outdoor activities.On Monday (Feb. 20), northern and northeastern areas will be mostly cloudy with brief periods of rain. Other areas of Taiwan can expect cloudy weather. High temperatures in the north and northeast will drop to 16-17 C, and high temperatures in the central and south will drop to 22-26 C, with temperatures in the southeast dropping to about 22 C.The cold front is expected to peak on Tuesday (Feb. 21) evening with nighttime lows dropping to 13-14 C. Mountainous areas will see chilly temperatures around 10 C. By Wednesday (Feb. 23), weather in various places will gradually improve.A tropical disturbance in the eastern sea near the Philippines is slowly developing in intensity. It could turn into a tropical depression, and potentially turn northward, but it is unlikely to affect Taiwan's weather over the coming week.",2023/02/19,1942,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814838,"Miller, Pringle lead No. 1 Alabama over Georgia 108-59","TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Alabama is a tough team to catch on the rebound. Just ask Vanderbilt, and now Georgia. 

            Brandon Miller scored 21 points, Nick Pringle had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Mark Sears made five 3-pointers in the first half to lead No. 1 Alabama to a 108-59 romp over Georgia on Saturday.

            The Crimson Tide (23-4, 13-1 Southeastern Conference) rebounded from their first SEC loss by racing to a 54-25 halftime lead and making 16 of 34 3s (47.1%) en route to a season scoring high. 











            “I think our guys respond well after losses,” Alabama coach Nate Oats said. “I hope we don’t have any more that we have to respond like that.”

            It was tied for the third-largest margin in an SEC game for Alabama, though still behind a 57-pointer over Vanderbilt last month. That followed a loss to Oklahoma.

            Alabama was coming off a 68-59 loss at No. 10 Tennessee on Wednesday night after rising to No. 1 for only the second time in program history and first in 20 years. Second-ranked Houston hosts Memphis and No. 3 Purdue faces Ohio State on Sunday.

            “It was good just to see the ball fall through the net, and the defense was really there in the first half,” Sears said. “It gave us a spark.”

            The Bulldogs (16-11, 6-8) hit a lower percentage from the free throw line than Alabama did from 3-point range. Georgia was 13 of 30 (43.3%) on foul shots.

            Miller played only 21 minutes and Sears 19 for the Tide. Miller made 3 of 5 3s, and Sears hit 5 of 8 after a perfect first half. Pringle had season highs in both points and rebounds.

            Rylan Griffen scored 13 and Noah Clowney 12 for Alabama.

            Justin Hill, who made the game-winning basket against LSU on Tuesday night, led Georgia with 17 points. Terry Roberts scored 11 and Braelen Bridges 10.

            “I think it’d be hard to forget about this one,” Georgia coach Mike White said. “I haven’t been a part of something like this. I did a very poor job obviously of preparing our guys. We looked rattled from the tip. Alabama's obviously a better basketball team than we are. They are terrific.

            “As good of an offensive team as I’ve seen live or competed against in our league that I can remember.”

            Sears and Miller combined for Alabama's first 20 points and the Tide swiftly built a 30-8 lead. Alabama started 5 of 6 from the floor, all 3s against Georgia's zone defense, and Miller also made three free throws after getting fouled on another attempt.

            He's only the third Tide player to score 500 points as a freshman and reached the milestone faster than either James Robinson or Collin Sexton.

            “It's honestly crazy, especially with the team we have — how skilled we are, how deep we are,"" Pringle said. “Five hundred points already? I don't think you can have a better freshman year than this.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Georgia: Fell to 3-9 away from home, where the Bulldogs are 13-2. Hill made both of his 3-point attempts, but the rest of the team was a combined 2 of 11. Was outrebounded 49-26.

            Alabama: Won its 11th SEC game by double digits, matching the 1955-56 team for the most in program history. ... Has followed up losses with wins by a combined 128 points. ... Went over 100 points for the fifth time.

            ASSISTS

            Alabama had assists on 26 of 39 baskets, getting seven from Jaden Bradley and six from Jahvon Quinerly.

            Taylor made 4 of 7 shots with three 3-pointers for the Aggies (20-7, 12-2), who are off to their best start in Southeastern Conference play since becoming a member in 2012. Taylor was also 10 for 10 at the free-throw line. Dennis hit three 3-pointers, scoring 17 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, while Tyrece Radford pitched in with 12 points.

            Kobe Brown finished with 24 points to pace the Tigers (19-8, 7-7), who have lost two straight and saw a three-game win streak at home end. Brown hit 8 of 13 shots, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc. D'Moi Hodge added 12 points and six steals.











            Texas A&M scored the first five points, but Missouri, which missed eight of its first nine shots, battled back to grab an 11-9 lead on a 3-pointer by Hodge with 13:07 remaining. Taylor made two free throws to tie the game. Dennis followed with a 3-pointer and a jumper to give the Aggies a 16-11 lead at the 9:17 mark. They never trailed again.

Brown answered with a 3-pointer for Missouri and a layup by Sean East II capped a 26-17 run as the Tigers closed to within 61-53 at the 7:04 mark. Radford followed with a layup, Taylor hit two free throws and the Aggies pushed their lead back to double digits and cruised to the finish.

Dennis hit three 3-pointers, scoring 17 points and grabbing 10 rebounds, while Tyrece Radford pitched in with 12 points.Kobe Brown finished with 24 points to pace the Tigers (19-8, 7-7), who have lost two straight and saw a three-game win streak at home end. Brown hit 8 of 13 shots, including 5 of 7 from beyond the arc. D'Moi Hodge added 12 points and six steals.Texas A&M scored the first five points, but Missouri, which missed eight of its first nine shots, battled back to grab an 11-9 lead on a 3-pointer by Hodge with 13:07 remaining. Taylor made two free throws to tie the game. Dennis followed with a 3-pointer and a jumper to give the Aggies a 16-11 lead at the 9:17 mark. They never trailed again.Dennis and Taylor both had 14 points by halftime as the Aggies upped their lead to 39-25. Texas A&M made half of its 26 shots, while the Tigers hit only 9 of 30. The Aggies, who lead the nation in free throws made and attempted, sank all eight of their first-half attempts.Taylor hit a 3-pointer to give the Aggies a 44-27 lead with 18:47 left to play. Brown answered with a 3-pointer for Missouri and a layup by Sean East II capped a 26-17 run as the Tigers closed to within 61-53 at the 7:04 mark. Radford followed with a layup, Taylor hit two free throws and the Aggies pushed their lead back to double digits and cruised to the finish.Aggies coach Buzz Williams improved to 5-2 against Missouri with a 3-0 record on the Tigers' home floor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814843,"Silver speaks on load management, TV deal at NBA All-Star","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association clearly do not agree on everything, as evidenced by the fact that there’s no new Collective Bargaining Agreement yet.

            One thing they do agree on: A record-setting trade deadline this season is a good thing.

            NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in his annual news conference preceding All-Star Saturday events that he felt the robust amount of player movement – 12 deals involving 24 teams and 49 players on trade-deadline day, Feb. 9, alone – only speaks to how many teams think they can make deep playoff runs this season and ultimately compete for a title.











            “It’s interesting also that we’ve had probably as much player movement this year than at any time in our history,” Silver said. “And I think that speaks to teams, as we got close to the trade deadline, trying to situate themselves in the best possible position to compete going into the playoffs. And in this case over 10% of the entire league was moved roughly in the last week before the trade deadline.”

            Among those traded leading up to the deadline: All-Stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, both dealt by Brooklyn, with Durant going to Phoenix and Irving to Dallas.

            Not everyone believes that players are right to ask for trades. Durant said he believes it’s a good thing.

            “It’s bringing more eyes to the league,” Durant said. “More people are more excited. The tweets that I get, the news hits that we got from me being traded, Kyrie being traded, it just brings more attention to the league and that’s really what makes you money, is when you get more attention. I think it’s great for the league, to be honest. Teams have been trading players and making acquisitions for a long time. Now a player can dictate where he wants to go, leave in free agency or demand a trade, it’s just part of the game now.”

            Irving asked for a trade shortly after it became evident that the Nets were not going to meet his expectations regarding a contract extension.

            “I had a plan in place where I wanted to stay in Brooklyn long term, be a Net. It was a dream come true for me,” Irving said. “Obviously, I wish things could have worked out for the best of all of us in terms of winning a championship and etching our names into history of the NBA. Those are big aspirations. It sounds easier said than done.”

            NBPA Executive Director Tamika Tremaglio, speaking at a separate news conference before Silver’s annual event, echoed the players’ stance.

            “Certainly the fact that we have seen so many trades just sort of signifies that, you know, people do believe that they can create a championship team,” Tremaglio said.

            In other matters Silver addressed Saturday:

            LABOR UPDATE

            Talks between the NBA and NBPA are continuing with hopes of getting a new labor deal done. The sides have until March 31 to decide if either wants to opt out of the current deal on June 30; that deadline has already been moved twice and can be again, if necessary.

            “It’s my hope that the deal will be done by then,” Silver said.

            Among the issues that the NBA and the NBPA have been discussing in recent weeks is a return to letting players enter the draft straight out high school without waiting a year — that move is expected to be included in the next CBA — along with what the league considers an “upper spending limit” that would significantly tighten the rules on how much teams can spend each year on their roster.

            “Yes, it has been considered,"" Tremaglio said of the spending limit. “And no, it is not acceptable.""

            LOAD MANAGEMENT

            There doesn't seem to be much of an appetite for the NBA to abandon the traditional 82-game schedule, though injuries and load management leave fans going to games sometimes to learn upon arrival that their favorite players aren't going to be in the game that night.

            It has been an issue for years. The NBA has tried to make the schedule more player-friendly by lowering back-to-back games and eliminating stretches of four games in five days.

            “It's something that I don’t think we’re approaching in an adversarial way with the players association,"" Silver said. “We’re working collectively, together with our doctors, our data scientists and trying to see if there’s an optimal way for player performance. If it means at some point we conclude that we’re better off elongating the schedule ... that’s worth looking at. If we thought it made sense to reduce the number of games we would.""

            TV DEAL

            Silver said he isn't concerned about the potential issue that could come if Diamond Sports Group — which owns several regional sports networks, including 16 broadcasting for NBA teams — enters bankruptcy.

            Diamond, the parent company of 19 Bally Sports networks, skipped about $140 million in interest payments that were due Wednesday, starting a 30-day grace period that could be the prelude to a bankruptcy filing.

            “Short term, I’m not all that concerned,"" Silver said. “It largely affects the regular season for the NBA in terms of distributing, delivering those games directly to our consumers. And if they were to indeed, you know, file for bankruptcy, there won’t be that much of the regular season left. For that period of time, we will have in place arrangements, if necessary, to continue to distribute those games to fans. So I think that’s what’s most important.""

            “I would say long term I’m not that concerned because there are many other ways, platforms, including local over-the-air television, streaming services, other methods, to bring those games linear and digitally directly to fans,"" he added. “In the mid-term, it’s an issue we’re going to have to work through.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814849,Last-place Jackets beat struggling West-leading Stars 4-1,"DALLAS (AP) — Two overturned goals after an early start on the second night of a back-to-back coming off a road game says it all for the struggling Dallas Stars.

            Adam Boqvist broke a tie early in the third period and the last-place Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Western Conference leaders 4-1 on Saturday night.

            The Stars, starting two hours earlier than normal a night after losing 2-1 in a shootout at Minnesota, lost for the seventh time in nine games. Six of the losses have come at home.











            Boqvist's goal was his second of the season, and Liam Foudy had the first regular-season goal of his career for the Blue Jackets, who successfully challenged two Dallas goals in the second period.

            “You’re going to have nights, and you have to find a way to overcome,” said Stars coach Pete DeBoer, whose team is in its first slump of his first season. “Back-to-back, and a tough schedule and some travel and an early start and a couple of overturned goals. We've got to find a way to overcome those things.” 

            Mathieu Olivier gave Columbus a two-goal lead late in the third, and Joonas Korpisalo made 29 saves. Eric Robinson was awarded an empty-net goal after he was brought down by Miro Heiskanen on a breakaway.

            Columbus, which came in with the NHL's worst record won its sixth road game, fewest in the league, and put together consecutive victories for first time in more than two months.

            The Blue Jackets are 3-2 since coming back from the All-Star break. 

            “It's been a challenging year, no question,” coach Brad Larsen said. “For us as coaches to watch them get results when you put the work in. We've played some really good hockey teams in the last stretch here. So hopefully we'll keep it going.”

            Ty Dellandrea scored the only Dallas goal unassisted, but the overturned goals were the story for the frustrated Stars, who haven't scored more than twice in any of the seven losses on their worst skid of the season.

            The first was with Dallas trailing 1-0 when Roope Hintz was called for offsides going to the bench as Jason Robertson waited for a pass at the blue line. Robertson, the Stars' scoring leader, also appeared close to skating in ahead of the puck before beating Korpisalo one-on-one.

            The Stars had pulled even in the second when rookie Wyatt Johnston's apparent go-ahead goal was disallowed because Jamie Benn's skate clipped Korpisalo just as Johnston was shooting.

            “It hurts,” Dellandrea said. “You score two big goals, and they both get called off. I think it just kind of hurts momentum. You work hard for those. But regardless, we've got to score more.”

            Foudy put the Blue Jackets in front late in the first period when he slid a loose puck past Scott Wedgewood after Jack Roslovic lost control trying to get off a shot.

            “I felt like I was playing some pretty good games lately and our line was playing well,” said Foudy, whose only other NHL goal came in the 2020 playoff bubble. “Obviously getting that goal is big for my self-confidence.”

            Less than two minutes after Robertson's goal was disallowed, Dellandrea stole the puck from Kent Johnson in the Columbus zone and beat Korpisalo to the near post. 

            Dellandrea's goal tied it thanks to Wedgewood's save in open ice on a shot from Boqvist barely 10 seconds after the first successful Columbus challenge. Wedgewood had 33 stops. 

            POWER OUTAGE

            The Stars are on an 0-for-20 slide on the power play after failing with their only chance in the third period. Robertson hit the post early in that man advantage. Columbus also had just one power play.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDALLAS (AP) — Two overturned goals after an early start on the second night of a back-to-back coming off a road game says it all for the struggling Dallas Stars.Adam Boqvist broke a tie early in the third period and the last-place Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Western Conference leaders 4-1 on Saturday night.The Stars, starting two hours earlier than normal a night after losing 2-1 in a shootout at Minnesota, lost for the seventh time in nine games. Six of the losses have come at home.Boqvist's goal was his second of the season, and Liam Foudy had the first regular-season goal of his career for the Blue Jackets, who successfully challenged two Dallas goals in the second period.“You’re going to have nights, and you have to find a way to overcome,” said Stars coach Pete DeBoer, whose team is in its first slump of his first season. “Back-to-back, and a tough schedule and some travel and an early start and a couple of overturned goals. We've got to find a way to overcome those things.”Mathieu Olivier gave Columbus a two-goal lead late in the third, and Joonas Korpisalo made 29 saves. Eric Robinson was awarded an empty-net goal after he was brought down by Miro Heiskanen on a breakaway.Columbus, which came in with the NHL's worst record won its sixth road game, fewest in the league, and put together consecutive victories for first time in more than two months.The Blue Jackets are 3-2 since coming back from the All-Star break.“It's been a challenging year, no question,” coach Brad Larsen said. “For us as coaches to watch them get results when you put the work in. We've played some really good hockey teams in the last stretch here. So hopefully we'll keep it going.”Ty Dellandrea scored the only Dallas goal unassisted, but the overturned goals were the story for the frustrated Stars, who haven't scored more than twice in any of the seven losses on their worst skid of the season.The first was with Dallas trailing 1-0 when Roope Hintz was called for offsides going to the bench as Jason Robertson waited for a pass at the blue line. Robertson, the Stars' scoring leader, also appeared close to skating in ahead of the puck before beating Korpisalo one-on-one.The Stars had pulled even in the second when rookie Wyatt Johnston's apparent go-ahead goal was disallowed because Jamie Benn's skate clipped Korpisalo just as Johnston was shooting.“It hurts,” Dellandrea said. “You score two big goals, and they both get called off. I think it just kind of hurts momentum. You work hard for those. But regardless, we've got to score more.”Foudy put the Blue Jackets in front late in the first period when he slid a loose puck past Scott Wedgewood after Jack Roslovic lost control trying to get off a shot.“I felt like I was playing some pretty good games lately and our line was playing well,” said Foudy, whose only other NHL goal came in the 2020 playoff bubble. “Obviously getting that goal is big for my self-confidence.”Less than two minutes after Robertson's goal was disallowed, Dellandrea stole the puck from Kent Johnson in the Columbus zone and beat Korpisalo to the near post.Dellandrea's goal tied it thanks to Wedgewood's save in open ice on a shot from Boqvist barely 10 seconds after the first successful Columbus challenge.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814873,Mac McClung soars to slam dunk title at All-Star Saturday,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Mac McClung might have single-handedly restored the shine on a dunk contest that has been widely panned in recent years.

            McClung, the 6-foot-2 Philadelphia guard on a two-way contract, defeated New Orleans' Trey Murphy III in the finals of the dunk contest, culminating an NBA All-Star Saturday that may have finally answered the question as to whether what used to be the league's signature event can be glitzy again.

            McClung had the answer: Absolutely.











            “I'm truly blessed and grateful for the NBA giving me this opportunity,"" McClung said.

            A 540-degree dunk — not a 360, but a 540, him doing one-and-a-half rotations in the air, a move more reserved for figure skaters and skateboarders than basketball players — was his third perfect score of the night out of four dunks. By the time the judges' scores came up it was already decided. Everyone in the building knew he'd already won.

            “It's over,"" McClung said.

            It was. And he immediately committed to defending his title at Indianapolis at All-Star Saturday next year.

            “If you guys will have me, I'll be back,"" McClung said.

            The final score, not that it mattered, was McClung 100.0, Murphy 98.0.

            His is an unbelievable story: McClung has played mostly in the G League, where he ranks 36th in scoring this season at 19 points per game. He was undrafted in 2021 after spending three college seasons at Georgetown and Texas Tech. He was signed by Golden State last year but never played in a regular-season game for the Warriors, and spent a little time on USA Basketball’s World Cup qualifying team last year as well. 

            “Ever since the beginning, I was the underdog,"" said McClung, who put on a Gate City jersey — his high school and hometown in Virginia, population 1,600 — for the final dunk. “Proving others right instead of others wrong brings a little more satisfaction.""

            Philadelphia would become his third NBA team, and he hasn't even played for the 76ers yet. He played in one game last season for the Chicago Bulls, one other game for the Los Angeles Lakers. 

            He has three NBA baskets.

            He had four dunks on Saturday night. A guy with more dunks than actual NBA field goals might have saved the dunk contest.

            “Give this man his flowers, man,"" TNT commentator Kenny Smith said.

            McClung set the tone for the night with a dunk that had NBA superstars in disbelief — he leaped over two people, took the ball out of the hands of one of them, tapped it on the backboard and then threw down a reverse slam.

            And that was just for starters.

            Riding the momentum of that perfect dunk, he wound up hoisting the trophy that was newly renamed for dunking legend — and former 76ers star — Julius “Dr. J"" Erving.

            “I'm super happy,"" McClung said.

            McClung was nearly perfect on his second dunk as well; four judges gave him a perfect 50, Lisa Leslie gave him a 49 as the only dissenter, but it didn't matter — he was already assured a spot in the final round against Murphy.

            New York's Jericho Sims gave himself a 50 on his second dunk, where he attached an envelope to the net, pulled it down after the dunk and displayed “50"" to the world. No judge agreed, and his two-dunk score of 95.4 wasn't good enough to make the final round.

            Also eliminated after Round 1: Houston's Kenyon Martin Jr., with a score of 93.2.

            3-POINT CONTEST

            Damian Lillard represented his school and his brand, doing them both proud.

            Lillard, the Portland star, won the 3-point contest by topping Indiana teammates Buddy Hield and Tyrese Haliburton in the final round.

            Lillard wore a Weber State jersey with “Dolla” on the back. Weber State is his college; he performs music under the name Dame D.O.L.L.A. And when he got the trophy, he had a Blazers warmup shirt on for that moment.

            “They say the third time’s the charm,” said Lillard, who got his first 3-point title in his third try at the event. “And I’m happy that it happened here. It’s a perfect situation. I’m happy that I did it in my home, coming back here to Utah.”

            Lillard won the final round with 26 points. Hield had 25 and Haliburton scored 17.

            Lillard played his college games in Ogden, Utah, about a half-hour outside of Salt Lake City. And the historic ramification of finally getting a 3-point title wasn’t lost on him.

            “The best shooters in the history of our game, most of them have one of these,” Lillard said as he held the trophy. “I just wanted to get it done at least one time. And now I have it, so I can retire from it.”

            Haliburton won the first round with 31 points. Lillard had 26, and Hield had 23.

            Eliminated in the first round were Boston’s Jayson Tatum, Utah’s Lauri Markkanen, Miami’s Tyler Herro, New York’s Julius Randle and Sacramento’s Kevin Huerter. 

            SKILLS CHALLENGE

            Utah got a win to open All-Star Saturday night.

            The Jazz — a roster composed of Utah players Jordan Clarkson, Walker Kessler and Collin Sexton — won the Skills Challenge on Saturday night, prevailing in two of the three competitions.

            “It feels good, especially to do it in front of the home team,” Sexton said.

            The Rooks were second, with Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, Detroit’s Jaden Ivey and Houston’s Jabari Smith Jr. getting 100 points.

            “I had a lot of fun just doing that even though we took the L,"" said Banchero, who was part of the winning squad in Friday's Rising Stars games. “It was really fun getting out there in front of the fans. Skills Challenge, watched that all the time growing up during All-Star Weekend. So being a part of it was great.""

            The Antetokounmpos were third, with Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Alex Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday — a fill-in for injured Milwaukee Bucks teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo — getting shut out.

            The Rooks won the team relay for 100 points, after having the best time on a course where teams had to complete a 35-foot outlet pass, do downcourt dribbling, a short jumper, a left corner 3-pointer and then a dunk at the other end.

            Next up was the team passing event, won by the Jazz — giving them 100 points — after they were the most accurate in a series of 35-foot outlet passes, 20-foot bounce passes and 25-foot chest passes.

            It ended with the Team Shooting event — worth 200 points — with the Jazz prevailing there to clinch the win.

            “We did it for Utah, man,” Clarkson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814878,"N. Korea makes fresh threats, US bombers fly after ICBM test","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Sunday its latest intercontinental ballistic missile test was meant to further bolster its “fatal” nuclear attack capacity and threatened additional powerful steps over upcoming military drills between the United States and South Korea.

            The United States responded by flying long-range supersonic bombers in a show of force later Sunday for separate joint exercises with South Korean and Japanese warplanes. 

            Saturday’s ICBM test, the North’s first missile test since Jan. 1, signals its leader Kim Jong Un is using his rivals’ drills as a chance to expand his country’s nuclear arsenal to get the upper hand in future dealings with the United States. An expert says North Korea may seek to hold regular operational exercises involving its ICBMs.











            North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said its launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM was organized “suddenly” without prior notice at Kim's direct order.

            KCNA said the launch was designed to verify the weapon’s reliability and the combat readiness of the country’s nuclear force. It said the missile was fired at a high angle and reached a maximum altitude of about 5,770 kilometers (3,585 miles), flying a distance of about 990 kilometers (615 miles) for 67 minutes before accurately hitting a pre-set area in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.

            The steep-angle launch was apparently to avoid neighboring countries. The flight details reported by North Korea, which roughly matched the launch information previously assessed by its neighbors, show the weapon is theoretically capable of reaching the mainland U.S. if fired at a standard trajectory. 

            The Hwasong-15 launch demonstrated the North’s “powerful physical nuclear deterrent” and its efforts to “turn its capacity of fatal nuclear counterattack on the hostile forces” into an extremely strong one that cannot be countered, KCNA said.

            Whether North Korea has a functioning nuclear-tipped ICBM is still a source of outside debate, as some experts say the North hasn’t mastered a way to protect warheads from the severe conditions of atmospheric reentry. The North says it has acquired such a technology.

            The Hwasong-15 is one of North Korea’s three existing ICBMs, all of which use liquid propellants that require pre-launch injections and cannot remain fueled for extended periods. The North is pushing to build a solid-fueled ICBM, which would be more mobile and harder to detect before its launch.

            “Kim Jong Un has likely determined that the technical reliability of the country’s liquid propellant ICBM force has been sufficiently tested and evaluated to now allow for regular operational exercises of this kind,” said Ankit Panda, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

            Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at Korea Aerospace University in South Korea, said that North Korea appeared to have launched an upgraded version of the Hwasong-15 ICBM. Chang said the information provided by North Korea showed the missile will likely have a longer potential range than the standard Hwasong-15.

            Later Sunday, U.S. B-1B bombers and other aircraft separately trained with South Korean and Japanese fighter jets over and near the Korean Peninsula. A South Korean military statement said Sunday’s training reaffirmed Washington’s “iron-clad” security commitment to South Korea. 

            North Korea is sensitive to the deployment of U.S. B-1B bombers, which are capable of carrying a huge payload of conventional weapons. 

            The North’s launch came a day after it vowed an “unprecedentedly” strong response over a series of military drills that Seoul and Washington plan in coming weeks.

            In a statement Sunday, Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of Kim Jong Un, accused South Korea and the U.S. of “openly showing their dangerous greed and attempt to gain the military upper hand and predominant position in the Korean Peninsula.”

            “I warn that we will watch every movement of the enemy and take corresponding and very powerful and overwhelming counteraction against its every move hostile to us,” she said.

            North Korea has steadfastly slammed regular South Korea-U.S. military drills as an invasion rehearsal though the allies say their exercises are defensive in nature. 

            “By now, we know that any action taken by the U.S. and South Korea — however justified from the vantage point of defense and deterrence against (North Korea’s) reckless behavior — will be construed and protested as an act of hostility by North Korea,” said Soo Kim, a security analyst at the California-based RAND Corporation. “There will always be fodder for (Kim Jong Un’s) weapons provocations.”

            “With nuclear weapons in tow and having mastered the art of coercion and bullying, Kim does not need ‘self-defense.’ But pitting the U.S. and South Korea as the aggressors allows Kim to justify his weapons development,” Soo Kim said.

            U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the U.S. will take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the American homeland and South Korea and Japan. South Korea’s presidential National Security Council said it will seek to strengthen its “overwhelming response capacity” against potential North Korean aggression based on the military alliance with the United States.

            The South Korean and U.S. militaries plan to hold a table-top exercise this week to hone a joint response to a potential use of nuclear weapons by North Korea. The allies are also to conduct another joint computer simulated exercise and field training in March.

            The foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan, meeting on the sidelines of a security conference in Germany on Saturday, agreed to boost a trilateral cooperation involving the United States and exchanged in-depth views on the issue of Japan’s colonial-era mobilization of forced Korean laborers — a key sticking point in efforts to improve their ties, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry. 

            South Korea and Japan are both key U.S. allies but often spat over issues stemming from Tokyo’s 1910-45 colonial occupation of the Korean Peninsula. But North Korea’s recent missile testing spree is pushing the two countries to explore how to reinforce their security cooperation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814879,"Ukraine in mind, US frantic to avert Mideast showdown at UN","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is scrambling to avert a diplomatic crisis over Israeli settlement activity this week at the United Nations that threatens to overshadow and perhaps derail what the U.S. hopes will be a solid five days of focus on condemning Russia’s war with Ukraine.

            
                Secretary of State Antony Blinken made two emergency calls on Saturday from the Munich Security Conference, which he is attending in an as-yet unsuccessful bid to avoid or forestall such a showdown. It remained unclear whether another last-minute intervention might salvage the situation, according to diplomats familiar with the ongoing discussions who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.

            Without giving details, the State Department said in nearly identical statements that Blinken had spoken to Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from Munich to “reaffirm the U.S. commitment to a negotiated two-state solution and opposition to policies that endanger its viability.”











            “The secretary underscored the urgent need for Israelis and Palestinians to take steps that restore calm and our strong opposition to unilateral measures that would further escalate tensions,” the statements said.

            Neither statement mentioned the proposed U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate halt to Israeli settlements. The Palestinians want to bring that resolution to a vote on Monday. And neither statement gave any indication as to how the calls ended.

            But diplomats familiar with the conversations said that in his call to Abbas, Blinken reiterated an offer to the Palestinians for a U.S. package of incentives to entice them to drop or at least delay the resolution. 

            Those incentives included a White House meeting for Abbas with President Joe Biden, movement on reopening the American consulate in Jerusalem, and a significant aid package, the diplomats said.

            Abbas was noncommittal, the diplomats said, but also suggested he would not be amenable unless the Israelis agreed to a six-month freeze on settlement expansion on land the Palestinians claim for a future state.

            Blinken then called Netanyahu, who, according to the diplomats, was similarly noncommittal about the six-month settlement freeze. Netanyahu also repeated Israeli opposition to reopening the consulate, which was closed during President Donald Trump's administration, they said.

            The U.S. and others were hoping to resolve the deadlock on Sunday, but the diplomats said it was unclear if that was possible, 

            The drama arose just ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which will be the subject of special U.N. General Assembly and Security Council sessions on Thursday and Friday.

            The U.S. opposes the Palestinian resolution and is almost certain to veto it. Not vetoing would carry considerable domestic political risk for Biden on the cusp of the 2024 presidential race and top House Republicans have already warned against it. 

            But the administration also fears that using its veto to protect Israel risks losing support at the world body for measures condemning Russia's war in Ukraine. 

            Senior officials from the White House, the State Department and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. have already engaged frantic but fruitless diplomacy to try to persuade the Palestinians to back down. The dire nature of the situation prompted Blinken's calls on Saturday, the diplomats said.

            The Biden administration has already said publicly that it does not support the resolution, calling it “unhelpful."" But it has also said the same about recent Israeli settlement expansion announcements. 

            U.N. diplomats say the U.S wants to replace the Palestinian resolution, which would be legally binding, with a weaker presidential statement, or at least delay a vote on the resolution until after the Ukraine war anniversary.

            The Palestinian push comes as Israel’s new right-wing government has reaffirmed its commitment to construct new settlements in the West Bank and expand its authority on land the Palestinians seek for a future state.

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The United Nations and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

            Ultranationalists who oppose Palestinian statehood comprise a majority of Israel’s new government, which has declared settlement construction a top priority. 

            The draft resolution, circulated by the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council, would reaffirm the Security Council’s “unwavering commitment” to a two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living side-by-side in peace as democratic states. 

            It would also reaffirm the U.N. Charter’s provision against acquiring territory by force and reaffirm that any such acquisition is illegal.

            Last Tuesday, Blinken and the top diplomats from Britain, France, Germany and Italy condemned Israel’s plans to build 10,000 new homes in existing settlements in the West Bank and retroactively legalize nine outposts. Netanyahu’s Cabinet had announced the measure two days earlier, following a surge in violence in Jerusalem.

            In December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.” It stressed that halting settlement activities “is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.”

            That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.

            The draft resolution before the council now is much shorter than the 2016 document, though it reiterates its key points and much of what the U.S. and Europeans already said last week.

            Complicating the matter for the U.S., the Security Council resolution was introduced and is supported by the UAE, an Arab partner of the United States that has also normalized relations with Israel, even as it has taken a tepid stance on opposing Russia’s attack on Ukraine.

            The U.S. will be looking to the UAE and other council members sympathetic to the Palestinians to vote in favor of resolutions condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and calling for a cessation of hostilities and the immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces.

Netanyahu’s Cabinet had announced the measure two days earlier, following a surge in violence in Jerusalem.In December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.” It stressed that halting settlement activities “is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.”That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.The draft resolution before the council now is much shorter than the 2016 document, though it reiterates its key points and much of what the U.S. and Europeans already said last week.Complicating the matter for the U.S., the Security Council resolution was introduced and is supported by the UAE, an Arab partner of the United States that has also normalized relations with Israel, even as it has taken a tepid stance on opposing Russia’s attack on Ukraine.The U.S. will be looking to the UAE and other council members sympathetic to the Palestinians to vote in favor of resolutions condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and calling for a cessation of hostilities and the immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces.___Associated Press writer Edith M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814901,"From historic defeat, Thailand strives for World Cup success","WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — On June 11, 2019 the Thailand women’s soccer team endured the biggest-ever loss at a women’s soccer World Cup, a 13-0 trouncing by the United States which cast an unwelcome spotlight on the state of the sport in the South East Asian nation.

            On Saturday, a refurbished Thailand team under a new head coach and with the youngest playing group in its history played Cameroon in an inter-continental playoff match in New Zealand, hoping to qualify again for a World Cup and move beyond the shadow of that defeat.

            Thailand saw its hopes of World Cup redemption dashed as it conceded two late second-half goals to lose 2-0 to a physical Cameroon side and was eliminated from the playoffs. 











            Despite not qualifying for the 2023 tournament, those in charge of the Thailand team have high hopes for the future. 

            Head coach Miyo Okamoto, a plain-speaking former Japan professional, has made waves with her innovative approach to tactics and selections. Okamoto likely would make more waves if she fully expresses her views on her team’s funding, development and its opportunities to play international matches.

            In an interview with the Associated Press, Okamoto made clear that having taken up her current role in 2021 she personally is untouched by any hangover from the last World Cup. 

            ""We haven’t been the coaching staff for the full four years since the last World Cup,” Okamoto said, speaking with a translator. “It’s only been two years since we took over from a Thai male coach so we can only talk about the last two years we have been involved in the program.

            “More than half of the players are brand new faces since the last World Cup. We’ve made it a really new, young team. Our average age is about 23 which is exceptionally low for our historical national teams.”

            Okamoto’s first year in charge was dictated by COVID. With international matches all but impossible, the Thai players spent almost 10 months in training camps.

            Last year at last brought some release and the Thailand team played around 18 matches in the calendar year beginning with the AFC Women’s Asian Cup in India and including friendly matches against Australia and China-Taipei. At a training camp in Japan, the Thai team played informal matches against Japan club teams.

            Thailand had the chance to qualify directly for the World during the Indian tournament but an outbreak of COVID among the squad damaged its chances.

            Like most coaches, Okamoto always would prefer more matches and feels there is work still be done. Her approach in rebuilding the Thai team over the past two years has been from the ground up.

            “Over the past two years we’ve been rebuilding the whole tactical system of play which we think was lacking for the Thai team in the past,” she said. “We started with the basics.

            “We created the rules for the teams (including the women’s under-20 team) and we’ve been working on that for the past two years, very basic tactical stuff.

            “It’s going to be unrealistic for us to completely control the game and have dominance over other international teams. So we prioritize defending well and capitalizing on counter-attacking opportunities we may encounter.”

            Irravadee Makris, the Alaska-born, Alabama raised midfielder exemplifies Okamoto’s influence on the Thai team. The now 31-year-old was a left-field selection who learned on Facebook of her call-up to the national squad.

            Makris now wants to make the best of her late chance by being a member of a World Cup team.

            “That’s an aspect of our game we’ve been focusing on lately, trying to get stronger and get used to the physicality we’re going to face by playing against bigger, faster players,"" she said in a FIFA interview. ""Miyo wants us to be positive. That confidence and aggression is definitely something she’s brought to my game and it’s improved me a lot.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814914,Suspicions surround Chinese delegation's activity in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Legislators of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have raised concerns over an alleged lack of transparency by the Taipei City Government in relation to the itinerary of the Chinese delegation that arrived in Taiwan on Saturday (Feb. 18).Taipei City invited a six-person delegation from the Shanghai branch of China’s Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) for a three-day visit from Feb. 18-20. The group, led by Li Xiaodong (李驍東), was ostensibly invited by Mayor Chiang Wan-an (蔣萬安) to view lantern displays in Taipei to help improve cross-strait ties.Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) previously announced that the TAO delegation’s activity while in Taiwan will be closely monitored and that an initial itinerary was approved in advance of their arrival.However, questions have been raised about discrepancies in the group’s schedule and the conduct of the Taipei City Government. The group was expected to spend several hours viewing lantern displays on Saturday afternoon, but finished their tour several hours early.LTN reported that the delegation’s itinerary was changed at the last minute by the city government without public notice. In a Facebook post, DPP legislator Lin Chun-hsien (林俊憲) called for the Chiang administration to be more forthcoming about the activities of the Chinese TAO delegation, given the potential national security threat that the group represents.

“What did the group do during this lost time? Were there matters being discussed at some secretive meeting?” asked Lin. He also observed that, even if it were a delegation from an allied nation, the central government would never let such a discrepancy take place. He urged the Taipei City Government to explain how this could occur with a delegation representing China, the country that poses the greatest threat to Taiwan.DPP Taipei City Councilor Ho Meng-hua (何孟樺) posted a three-day itinerary for the group on Facebook on Friday (Feb. 17), which was likely the one approved by the MAC. Ho claimed that Mayor Chiang feared making the itinerary public due to the possibility of protests in Taipei.In a second Facebook post, Ho accused the Taipei City Government of deceiving the public in regards to the Chinese delegation and their activities in Taiwan. Despite the MAC having already approved a detailed itinerary submitted days in advance, city officials were claiming the itinerary was “still under discussion” on Saturday morning, less than an hour before the TAO delegation arrived.“Did Chiang Wan-an secretly meet with the Shanghai delegation and discuss highly sensitive issues related to national sovereignty?” Ho asked in her Facebook post.The city government has so far refused to release any records of communications between city officials and the TAO delegation, reported LTN. After approval for the visitors was granted by the Tsai administration, city officials said they would adhere to the guidelines outlined by the MAC, to keep the visit “low-key, simple, and safe.”The MAC previously announced that the TAO delegation’s activity in Taiwan will be closely monitored. It is unknown at this time whether Taipei City or the mayor will be called to account for any deviation from the approved itinerary.",2023/02/19,4883,Politics

            “Crazy,” said O’Reilly, who had an assist. “Great just to dive right in, get a big win like that.”











            Pierre Engvall, William Nylander and David Kampf scored for Toronto. Joseph Woll made 29 saves. Auston Matthews and Rasmus Sandin each picked up two assists.

            Josh Anderson scored 42 seconds into the second period for Montreal, which got 37 stops from Jake Allen.

            “The expectation’s the same,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said of his undermanned group. “Just be engaged as a player and keep working on the things that we’re talking about.”

            Down 1-0 in the second period, Bunting took a pass from Matthews on a power play and scored his 17th before Engvall made it 2-1 when he fired a shot Allen could only get a piece of for his 12th.

            Bunting added his second of the night with 1:40 left in the period off a Calle Jarnkrok feed that saw O’Reilly pick up an assist.

            Nylander stretched the lead to 4-1 four minutes into the third with his team-leading 31st goal following some great work down low from Matthews.

            Kampf rounded out the scoring late with his fifth of the season, and first in 28 games.

            Dealt to the Leafs along with Acciari for four draft picks — including Toronto’s 2023 first-round selection — in a swap that included Minnesota for salary cap purposes, O’Reilly, who won the Stanley Cup and Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP with St. Louis in 2019, started on a line between John Tavares and Mitchell Marner.

            O’Reilly and Acciari were dealt shortly before 11 p.m. ET on Friday and on a plane early to get to Toronto in time to face Montreal despite the fact the Leafs are set to play the Blackhawks in Chicago on Sunday.

            The pair could have met their teammates in the Windy City and remained in the same time zone, but were adamant their first taste of Leafs life would come on home ice.

            “Don’t want to waste any time,” Acciari said. “Played against these guys for a while now. Now being able to play with them is fun. I don’t have to the chase them around anymore.”

            Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said one of the hiccups in getting to Toronto in time for Saturday’s tilt was the fact both players didn’t have their equipment when the trade was made official.

            “O’Reilly might have found a way to acquire the keys to the building to go get his gear,” Keefe said with a smile. “And he grabbed Acciari’s while he was there. That just speaks to what those guys are about. There’s the on-ice things that everyone’s going to see.

            “I got a glimpse into what they’re going to bring to our room.”

            NO SUBTRACTIONS

            Giordano was glad the Leafs didn’t lose anyone off their roster in the trade.

            “The first thing that goes through your mind is, ‘Who did we lose?’” he said. “Everyone in here has been a big part of our success.”

            HOMETOWN FEEL

            O’Reilly joining the Leafs means almost half of Toronto’s roster is comprised of players from southern Ontario.

            “It does give you some perspective on the passion for this team,” said Tavares, who grew up in nearby Oakville. “We’ve got a great opportunity.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814923,Suspect arrested in slaying of university police officer,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A man is facing murder and other charges in the death of a Temple University police officer shot and killed near campus Saturday night, authorities said. 

            The Philadelphia district attorney's office said 18-year-old Miles Pfeffer will face charges of murder, murder of a law enforcement officer, robbery, carjacking and weapons crimes in the death of Officer Christopher Fitzgerald, who prosecutors said was shot in the head while responding to an incident near campus.

            “Pfeffer is also alleged to have attempted to rob Officer Fitzgerald of his gun and to have gone through his pockets, while the officer was laying on the ground and fatally wounded,” District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement Sunday. “Pfeffer is further alleged to have committed a carjacking a short time after, close to the location of the officer’s murder.”











            The Bucks County district attorney's office said Pfeffer was taken into custody shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday at his Buckingham Township home by township and Philadelphia police as well as state police and federal marshals. “Police used the fallen officer’s handcuffs in placing the suspect under arrest,” county prosecutors said.

            There was no immediate word on whether Pfeffer had an attorney; a number listed for his home was no longer in service.

            Temple University officials said Fitzgerald had been on the university police force since October 2021.

            “Officer Fitzgerald gave his life to selflessly serve and defend this community,” Jennifer Griffin, the university's vice president for public safety, said in a statement. “This loss leaves an enormous hole in all of our hearts. He was a father, a husband, a son, a colleague, and a friend.”

            University president Jason Wingard said he was “heartbroken” and called the shooting “a gut-wrenching reminder of our police officers’ daily bravery and sacrifices to protect our students, faculty, staff and community” as the city and the nation deal with “an unprecedented epidemic of violence.”

            Ken Kaiser, the university's senior vice president and chief operating officer, was quoted by the Philadelphia Inquirer as saying it was the first shooting death of a campus officer during his more than 30 years at Temple. “It just shakes everybody to the core,” he said.

            Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro tweeted that he and first lady Lori were “devastated for the family of the Temple University police officer who was killed in the line of duty tonight, bravely serving his community.”

            They sent prayers to his family, Temple police and the university community, he added, saying, “May his memory be a blessing.” 

            Joseph Regan, president of the Fraternal Order of Police State Lodge, also expressed condolences.

            “There are no words to describe the news of another one of our officers being shot,” Regan said in a statement. “This officer is a hero whose legacy and unselfish act will live in our hearts and memories forever.”

            It was the first fatal shooting of an on-duty police officer in Philadelphia since 2020, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A man is facing murder and other charges in the death of a Temple University police officer shot and killed near campus Saturday night, authorities said.The Philadelphia district attorney's office said 18-year-old Miles Pfeffer will face charges of murder, murder of a law enforcement officer, robbery, carjacking and weapons crimes in the death of Officer Christopher Fitzgerald, who prosecutors said was shot in the head while responding to an incident near campus.“Pfeffer is also alleged to have attempted to rob Officer Fitzgerald of his gun and to have gone through his pockets, while the officer was laying on the ground and fatally wounded,” District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a statement Sunday. “Pfeffer is further alleged to have committed a carjacking a short time after, close to the location of the officer’s murder.”The Bucks County district attorney's office said Pfeffer was taken into custody shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday at his Buckingham Township home by township and Philadelphia police as well as state police and federal marshals. “Police used the fallen officer’s handcuffs in placing the suspect under arrest,” county prosecutors said.There was no immediate word on whether Pfeffer had an attorney; a number listed for his home was no longer in service.Temple University officials said Fitzgerald had been on the university police force since October 2021.“Officer Fitzgerald gave his life to selflessly serve and defend this community,” Jennifer Griffin, the university's vice president for public safety, said in a statement. “This loss leaves an enormous hole in all of our hearts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814926,"Ballo dominates inside, No. 8 Arizona beats Colorado 78-68","TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona opened the game by getting the ball down low to Azuolas Tubelis for a jump hook.

            Kerr Kriisa followed with two bad passes, then Tubelis two of his own — not the start coach Tommy Lloyd had in mind for a conference home game.

            The Wildcats shook it off and turned to their biggest strength: getting the ball into the paint.











            Oumar Ballo had 18 points and 16 rebounds, Cedric Henderson Jr. added 15 points and No. 8 Arizona dominated inside to beat Colorado 78-68 on Saturday night.

            “We obviously want to go inside and then defensively we want to protect the paint,” Lloyd said. “Nothing more complicated than that.”

            The rash of opening turnovers put the Wildcats (24-4, 13-4 Pac-12) into an early 12-point hole. Arizona righted itself quickly with a big run and slogged through a slowed-down second half by dominating the paint at both ends. 

            Henderson and Ballo picked up the slack with leading scorer Tubelis in foul trouble, combining to hit 14 of 21 shots. Those two helped Arizona outscore Colorado 40-24 in the paint.

            “That’s why they’re a top-10 team — they’ve got everything,” said Colorado's Luke O'Brien, who had nine points and nine rebounds. 

            The Buffaloes (15-13, 7-10) used a closing 17-3 run to upend Arizona State 67-59 on Thursday night, but a big hole was too much to overcome in one of the nation's toughest road environments.

            Tristan da Silva had 18 points for Colorado, which shot 38%. 

            “We got good looks in the first half and we got good looks in the second,” Colorado coach Tad Boyle said. “At some point, you have to make your open shots and we didn’t do that consistently.”

            Arizona bounced back from a loss to Stanford by shooting 56% from the floor in an 88-62 thumping of Utah on Thursday night.

            The Wildcats stumbled out of the gate against Colorado.

            Arizona made sloppy passes for turnovers on four of its first five possessions while the Buffaloes ran their offense crisply. Colorado made seven of its first 11 shots to take an early 12-point lead.

            “We weren't locked in to start the game, clearly,” Henderson said. 

            The Wildcats shook off the cobwebs after that, upping their play at both ends of the floor.

            Arizona went on a 12-0 run to tie it up and held Colorado without a field goal for 3 1/2 minutes to build a 41-30 lead. The Wildcats hit 17 of 32 shots and didn't have a turnover the final 15 1/2 minutes of the first half to lead 46-34.

            Colorado quickly cut the lead to seven to start the second half, but went nearly 5 1/2 minutes without hitting a shot as Arizona extended it to 54-41.

            The Buffaloes slowed down Arizona will full-court pressure and zone in the half-court, but seemed to have defensive breakdowns at crucial moments — like a dunk by Henderson at the shot clock buzzer.

            “We just try to change it up on them, but we broke down and couldn’t get couldn’t get stops when we needed to get stops,” Boyle said.

            FOULING TUBELIS

            Tubelis struggled with foul trouble the previous two games, exacerbated by a technical foul for kicking the ball into the stands against Utah.

            The Lithuanian big man made it three straight foul-trouble games, sitting the rest of the half after picking up his second foul nine minutes into the game. Tubelis finished with 13 points in 22 minutes.

            “Maybe it's a little bit bad luck and a little bit self inflicted wounds by him,” Lloyd said. “He’s got to be smart and he’s got to play better. He’s had an amazing year.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Colorado: The Buffaloes couldn't have gotten off to a much better start in what's been a house of horrors for them. Colorado managed to bog down Arizona's offense in the second half, but struggled offensively to remain winless (0-11) at McKale Center since joining the Pac-12 in 2011-12.

            Arizona: Turnovers have been a problem for the Wildcats at times this season, but most of the time they've been able to overcome it. They did it again Saturday night behind a stifling defense that's gotten better as the season has progressed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814929,Kaluma's late 3s help No. 18 Creighton beat St. John's 77-67,"NEW YORK (AP) — Arthur Kaluma hit three straight 3-pointers down the stretch and No. 18 Creighton overcame a second-half scoring drought to pull away from St. John's for a 77-67 victory Saturday night.

            Creighton (18-9, 12-4) remained in a three-way tie for second place in the Big East after Providence and Xavier won earlier in the day. Marquette holds a one-game lead in the conference and visits Creighton on Tuesday night.

            Kaluma made a trio of 3s in a conference game for the first time this season. He entered shooting 41.9% from behind the arc but missed his first three attempts. He was 4 of 18 from deep over his previous five games. 











            “Art probably hasn’t shot as well as he would like this season for his standards, but he does trust his work,” Bluejays coach Greg McDermott said. “The guy gets extra work in every day on his shooting and you hope that extra work will pay off when your team needs you the most. Art hit some really big ones for us down the stretch.”

            Ryan Nembhard had 16 points for the Bluejays, who went scoreless for six minutes in allowing St. John’s to briefly take the lead. Kaluma finished with 13 points and Ryan Kalkbrenner added 12 as Creighton won for the ninth time in 10 games.

            “We were really stuck in the mud there offensively,” McDermott said.

            Joel Soriano led St. John's with 15 points and eight rebounds. David Jones added 14 points off the bench but the Red Storm (16-12, 6-11) were unable to get their third straight win.

            Creighton entered shooting 47.1% from the field and shot 56.7% in its 104-76 rout of St. John’s last month at home. The Bluejays made enough shots late in this one to finish at 38.7% overall. 

            Creighton led by just one before Kaluma hit 3s on consecutive possessions to make it 64-57 with 3:44 left. He drained another 3 to make it 67-57 with 2:28 remaining and then found Kalkbrenner for a dunk that made it 69-57 with 1:47 to go.

            “It was big time,” Kaluma said. “We didn’t play our best basketball but at the end of the game when it matters, I was able to step up and hit some big shots for my team.”

            St. John’s scored 11 straight points and took a 49-48 lead on Kolby King's layup with 11:54 left after Soriano blocked a shot by Nembhard. Creighton missed 13 straight shots from the field over 7 1/2 minutes until Nembhard’s basket gave the Bluejays a 52-49 lead with 9:54 to go.

            Creighton took its first double-digit lead at 35-24 when Baylor Scheierman stole the ball from Posh Alexander and found Kaluma for a two-handed dunk with 4:11 left in the first half. After St. John’s got within five, the Bluejays held a 42-32 lead at halftime when Kalkbrenner blocked Jones at the rim. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Creighton: The Bluejays went 13 of 33 (39.4%) from 3-point range after shooting a combined 30% (12 of 40) in a split against UConn and Providence.

            St. John’s: Playing at Carnesecca Arena on campus, the Red Storm were unable to get their third win over a ranked conference foe this season after beating Providence at Madison Square Garden last weekend and winning at UConn on Jan. 15.

            “I think we didn’t make the right plays, that’s all,” St. John’s coach Mike Anderson said. “They did. Simple as that.”

            MISSING

            Red Storm junior guard Andre Curbelo was out for a third straight game due to a coach's decision. The Illinois transfer is averaging 9.6 points and 4.5 assists per game. He also was held out Jan. 3 against Marquette.

            St. John’s also announced sophomore guard Rafael Pinzon was suspended indefinitely for not meeting team standards. Pinzon is averaging 6.1 points in 19 games this season.

            After the game, Anderson declined to elaborate on either player's absence.

            Brandon Huntley-Hatfeld gave Louisville the lead with a pair of free throws with 1:34 left in the first half, Ellis padded it with two more from the line and Kamari Lands hit a jumper to send the Cardinals into intermission with a 39-36 lead. 











            Clemson took a brief lead early in the second half on a Hunter Tyson layup, but Louisville went on a 9-0 run to lead 52-44 with 15 minutes to play and flirted with an 10-point lead for much of the rest of the way.

            Tyson knocked down a 3 to pull Clemson within four, 68-64, but Mike James hit a jumper and Huntley-Hatfield dunked to make it 74-66 going into the final minute of play. Tyson drilled an open 3 to get within five, 74-69, and Louisville turned the ball over on the inbounds pass with 46 seconds left. 

            The Tigers found Chauncey Wiggins with the inbounds pass but JJ Traynor blocked the shot and the Cardinals gathered the loose ball. Ellis hit 5 of 6 from the line and added an uncontested dunk with a second left to set the final margin.

            Traynor had a career-high 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds for Louisville (4-23, 2-14). James finished with 13 points.

            PJ Hall led Clemson (19-8, 11-5) with 28 points and eight rebounds. Brevin Galloway and Chase Hunter scored 16 and 15 points, respectively, and Tyson added another 12.

            A long moment of silence was broken by the Michigan band playing the Spartans' alma mater — “MSU Shadows” — while Crisler Arena was dimly lit with green and white lights from LED wristbands that were given to fans. A large “Spartan Strong” flag was held up in the student section. 

            The Wolverines, and their student section, wore maize shirts with “Michigan Basketball Stands with MSU” across the front.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814957,"Broad, Anderson and Bazball devastate NZ in 1st test","MOUNT MAUNGANUI, New Zealand (AP) — For New Zealand the end at least came quickly. England needed less than a session on the fourth day Sunday to complete a 267-run win in the first day-night cricket test and to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.

            Stuart Broad who clean bowled four New Zealand top-order batters late on the third day to leave the home side 63-5 overnight and make the win imminent, finished with 4-49. His long-time and record-breaking partner James Anderson took 4-18, sealing the win when he bowled No. 11 Blair Tickner (8) about 15 minutes before tea as New Zealand was all out for 127.

            That raised Anderson and Broad’s tally of test wickets in partnership to 1,009 in 103 matches, eclipsing the record of 1,001 previously held by Australians Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne.











            England will now take a 1-0 series lead into the second and final test in Wellington from Friday.

            “Obviously another great performance. We were very clinical with the bat and obviously very clinical with the ball,” England captain Ben Stokes said. “When you’ve got Stuart Broad and James Anderson in your bowling attack it’s obviously going to very hard for anyone with a bat in their hand.”

            New Zealand had shown some signs of resistance after the collapse of its top order when allrounders Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell stuck together for almost an hour before stumps on day three.

            The resistance was broken spinner when Jack Leach removed Bracewell (25) in the third over of the day Sunday and England resumed a rapid push for victory.

            Anderson trapped Scott Kuggeleijn lbw next over, then had New Zealand captain Tim Southee caught first ball by Joe Root at slip with his next ball and the England players likely were setting up tee times with the end in sight.

            Neil Wagner followed quickly but Mitchell and last man Blair Tickner made England wait a little longer, sticking together for almost 11 overs. Mitchell was able to post his sixth test half-century and he finished unbeaten on 57.

            “All credit to England. They strategically played it pretty well,” New Zealand captain Tim Southee said. “We were on the receiving end of a couple of night periods which obviously weren’t ideal.

            “That spell (by Broad) last night was obviously impressive but we knew if we got through last night there would not be many demons in the pitch today. I think it’s credit to the way they bowled under lights last night.”

            Almost from the first ball of the match the difference between the teams was obvious: England constantly was on the attack, New Zealand constantly was defensive.

            Even when it lost the toss, England was determined to go on the offensive and opener Ben Duckett blasted a half-century from 37 balls to put his team on the front foot. New Zealand hung in at times but never gained the upper hand.

            England twice routed New Zealand’s top order under floodlights when the ball moved around more than in daylight on a relatively docile pitch. That was not by accident but design.

            Stokes made the second-earliest first day declaration in test history when he ended his team’s first innings at 325-9 almost 90 minutes before stumps. In that period Anderson and Ollie Robinson dismissed Kane Williamson, Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls and left New Zealand 37-3 before it clawed back to 306 with Tom Blundell’s 138 on the second day.

            England then raced to 374 in its second innings at a one-day international rate of more than five runs an over with half-centuries to Joe Root, Harry Brook and Ben Foakes. England’s lead was 393 and the innings ended again in time to send New Zealand in under floodlights for the second time.

            This time Broad wrecked the New Zealand top order, bowling Devon Conway, Latham, Williamson and Blundell.

            “It was all set up,” Broad said. “The way we set the whole game up, we were building towards knowing we wanted to bowl as much as possible under the lights with the harder pink ball.

            “All our conversations through the day were about not so much (about) runs but the timing of when to bowl, which is a bit weird but that’s the day-night system. It’s nice to be on that side, and you’ve got to put a lot of work in to control when you can bowl at the good times.”

            That control is the essence of Bazball, the doctrine of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Bazball is mischaracterized when it is portrayed as a policy of attack without restraint or caution. It is about taking control and dictating terms as England did when they were able to cherry pick when they wanted to bowl.

It’s nice to be on that side, and you’ve got to put a lot of work in to control when you can bowl at the good times.”That control is the essence of Bazball, the doctrine of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. Bazball is mischaracterized when it is portrayed as a policy of attack without restraint or caution. It is about taking control and dictating terms as England did when they were able to cherry pick when they wanted to bowl.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World

(AP) — Liam Robbins scored 24 points and grabbed 12 rebounds and Ezra Manjon made a layup with one second left as Vanderbilt rallied last in a 67-65 victory over Auburn on Saturday night.

            Robbins made just 3 of 10 shots from the floor with a 3-pointer, but he sank 17 of 20 free throws for the Commodores (15-12, 8-6), who have won five straight Southeastern Conference games for the first time since 2015. The game featured 16 lead changes and 12 ties. Vanderbilt coach Jerry Stackhouse picked up his first win in four tries against Auburn's Bruce Pearl.

            Johni Broome finished with 20 points and six rebounds to pace the Tigers (18-9, 8-6). Jaylin Williams added 17 points and six boards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4814980,Hurricanes top Capitals 4-1 in Carolina's 1st outdoor game,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Hurricanes stepped out of the tunnel in a stadium packed full of buzzing fans, with the lights from cellphone flashlights bouncing along the stands and North Carolina State's marching band playing to their pregame walk to an outdoor rink.

            “Not having experienced one of those,"" Carolina coach Rod Brind'Amour said, ""I don't know how it could be much better, to be honest with you.""

            The Hurricanes did their part on the ice, too.











            Martin Necas had a goal and two assists to help the Hurricanes beat the Washington Capitals 4-1 on Saturday night in their first NHL Stadium Series outdoor game.

            Jesperi Kotkaniemi, Paul Stastny and Teuvo Teravainen also scored for Carolina, which completed a three-game season sweep of their Metropolitan Division foe. 

            The game was held at Carter-Finley Stadium, home to North Carolina State’s college football team and across the street from Carolina’s home ice at PNC Arena. Delayed two years because of COVID-19 attendance restrictions, the game drew a buzzing sellout crowd of 56,961 fans on a night that felt more like spectacle than a regular-season game.

            “That was cool,"" Stastny said. “I'm not a big college (football) guy but I always kind of watch those Saturday night games under the lights, when they come down from the tunnel, and that's what it kind of felt like.”

            “There’s no question,” Carolina captain Jordan Staal said, “those are pinch-yourself moments.”

            Tom Wilson scored in the third period for the Capitals, who suffered their fourth straight loss. The past three have come without captain and leading goal-scorer Alex Ovechkin, who is away after the death of his father.

            “We’ve got to get our confidence back,” Wilson said. “We’ve got to get our swagger back a little bit.”

            Carolina finished with a 10th win in 11 games. And this one had the added significance that came with the long-awaited outdoor game — the latest chance for the league to hold one of its marquee events in a so-called “nontraditional” market within its southern footprint.

            Temperatures hit the 70s for multiple days earlier in the week, while rain arrived to delay Friday’s practices, but conditions were optimal Saturday: clear and chilly all day, with temperatures dipping into the low 40s by the puck drop and high 30s by the final horn.

            The Hurricanes gave their festive crowd plenty of reasons to stay rowdy, starting with Kotkaniemi’s finish in close barely two minutes into the game. Then Carolina scored three goals in a 5 1/2-minute span of the second period to blow this one open.

            “We found ourselves chasing them and chasing the game,"" Washington coach Peter Laviolette said.

            The highlight was Necas hammering a one-timer on the power play from the left side past Darcy Kuemper. The flurry also included Hurricane goaltender Frederik Andersen tallying an assist. 

            On a night when he finished with 24 saves, Andersen earned a point when he lofted a long pass to Teravainen to ignite a 2-on-1 chance, with Teravainen passing to Necas, who drew Kuemper to his side and sent it back to Teravainen for the easy putaway and a 4-0 lead.

            SWEET THREADS

            The teams followed outdoor-game tradition by arriving in coordinated and themed attire, from a comfortable afternoon on the links to a throwback to glory days on the high school gridiron.

            The Hurricanes walked from PNC Arena in old-timey plaid golf knickers, matching hats and a black top over a white collared shirt with red tie. Defensemen Brent Burns and Jaccob Slavin were among those to complete the look by carrying a golf club.

            The Capitals exited a school bus sporting blue jeans, a white T-shirt, custom lettermen-styled jackets, knitted caps and toting footballs.

            GOLF SURGE

            Fittingly, Carolina's postgame “Storm Surge” on-ice celebration for the fans followed the golf theme.

            After leading fans in coordinated claps, the players dropped their gloves to the ice used their hockey sticks to swing at them as though they were teeing off.

            NODS TO THE PACK

            NHL chief content officer Steve Mayer had said the night would also honor host N.C. State. And there were plenty such touches.

            The Wolfpack marching band sat behind one goal at ice level. Mascots Mr. and Ms. Wuf sported Hurricanes gear. And there was the familiar football gameday sight of the motorized cart featuring a large white N.C. State football helmet on a wolf head parked near the Capitals tunnel.

            Former Wolfpack basketball greats David Thompson and Dereck Whittenburg — who led N.C. State to NCAA championships in 1974 and 1983, respectively — introduced the Hurricanes as they emerged from the tunnel.

            And finally, there was Ripken the Bat Dog — official tee retriever for N.C. State football and bat retriever for the nearby minor-league Durham Bulls baseball team — performing a ceremonial puck drop between Staal and Washington's Nicklas Backstrom.

Defensemen Brent Burns and Jaccob Slavin were among those to complete the look by carrying a golf club.The Capitals exited a school bus sporting blue jeans, a white T-shirt, custom lettermen-styled jackets, knitted caps and toting footballs.GOLF SURGEFittingly, Carolina's postgame “Storm Surge” on-ice celebration for the fans followed the golf theme.After leading fans in coordinated claps, the players dropped their gloves to the ice used their hockey sticks to swing at them as though they were teeing off.NODS TO THE PACKNHL chief content officer Steve Mayer had said the night would also honor host N.C. State. And there were plenty such touches.The Wolfpack marching band sat behind one goal at ice level. Mascots Mr. and Ms. Wuf sported Hurricanes gear. And there was the familiar football gameday sight of the motorized cart featuring a large white N.C. State football helmet on a wolf head parked near the Capitals tunnel.Former Wolfpack basketball greats David Thompson and Dereck Whittenburg — who led N.C. State to NCAA championships in 1974 and 1983, respectively — introduced the Hurricanes as they emerged from the tunnel.And finally, there was Ripken the Bat Dog — official tee retriever for N.C. State football and bat retriever for the nearby minor-league Durham Bulls baseball team — performing a ceremonial puck drop between Staal and Washington's Nicklas Backstrom.UP NEXTCapitals: Host Detroit on Tuesday night.Hurricanes: Host St. Louis on Tuesday night.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/19,,World

            Pickett made 11 of 20 from the field, 4 of 8 from 3-point range and 6 of 7 from the free-throw line with just two turnovers. Andrew Funk added 11 points, including three 3-pointers, for Penn State (16-11, 7-9 Big Ten).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815014,'I just want my legs back': Myanmar landmine casualties soar,"BANGKOK (AP) — The 3-year-old boy had taken only two steps from his mother’s lap when a deafening explosion rang out. The blast caught the woman in the face, blurring her vision. She forced her eyes open and searched for her son around the busy jetty where they’d been waiting for a ferry, near their small village in south-central Myanmar. 

            Through the smoke, she spotted him. His small body lay on the ground, his feet and legs mangled with flesh peeled away, shattered bones exposed. 

            “He was crying and telling me that it hurt so much,” she said. “He didn’t know what just happened.”











            But she did. 

            ___

            The woman's son had detonated a landmine, an explosive device designed to mutilate or destroy whatever comes into its path.

            
                Landmines have been banned for decades by most countries, since the United Nations Mine Ban Treaty was adopted in 1997. But in Myanmar, which is not party to the treaty, the use of mines has soared since the military seized power from the democratically elected government in February 2021 and armed resistance has skyrocketed. 

            Landmines are planted by all sides of the bloody conflict in Myanmar, and they’re responsible for surging civilian casualties, including an alarming number of children as victims, according to an AP analysis based on data and reports from nonprofit and humanitarian organizations, interviews with civilian victims, families, local aid workers, military defectors and monitoring groups. 

            In 2022, figures from the U.N. show, civilian casualties from landmine and unexploded ordnance spiked by nearly 40%. Experts say this and other official tallies are vastly undercounted, largely due to difficulties monitoring and reporting during the conflict. 

            Despite incomplete numbers, experts agree that the increase in Myanmar is the largest ever recorded. 

            Virtually no area is immune to the threat. Over the past two years, mine contamination has spread to every state and region except for the capital city, Naypyitaw, according to Landmine Monitor, a group that tracks global landmine use.

            The military also uses civilians as human shields, a practice widespread in the country for decades but raising alarms with increasing mine incidents. AP's analysis found the military, known as the Tatmadaw, forced people to walk ahead of troops to detonate potential landmines in their path, protecting their own troops. 

            According to local and international human rights groups, the Tatmadaw has mined homes, villages, walking paths, church compounds, farms, cellphone towers and a Chinese-backed oil and gas pipeline and copper mine. 

            The Myanmar military, which has acknowledged mine use in the past, did not respond to a list of questions AP sent to their official spokesperson's email. 

            Even when the fighting moves on, the landmines don’t. The mines left behind can indiscriminately maim or kill those who happen upon them for years after hostilities have ended. 

            It raises the specter of casualties for years to come. In countries including Egypt and Cambodia, people continue to die from millions of mines left behind long after conflicts has ended.

            ___

            “Leaving an activated mine like this is the same as releasing a monster,” said a 26-year-old military defector who worked as a combat engineer platoon commander in Myanmar. “Mines don’t have friends or enemies. Even a gun only shoots in the direction it’s pointed.” 

            Like most who were interviewed by AP, the defector spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family from military retaliation. Many in Myanmar who speak with reporters can face detainment or violence. 

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance have been a persistent issue in Myanmar for more than four decades. The problem has grown exponentially since the military takeover, with heavier use of landmines in more parts of the country, said Kim Warren, a U.N. landmine specialist who's monitored issues in Myanmar. 

            In 2022, 390 people were victims of landmines and unexploded ordnance in Myanmar, more than a 37% increase from 2021, according to figures compiled by UNICEF. Overall, 102 people were killed and 288 were wounded, with children making up some 34% of the victims, compared with 26% in 2021. 

            Still, Warren said, incidents are underreported. She cited the lack of a robust information management system, the sensitivities around reporting conflict-related data, and difficulties getting care for victims. 

            Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan, Landmine Monitor’s Myanmar expert, said his group counts only casualties it can confirm with confidence.

            “We’ve always been undercounting,” he said. “How many more? Double? Almost certainly. Triple? Could be.” 

            Experts concede the total number of casualties may seem small, with Myanmar’s population of about 56 million, but say the rapid increase is distressing nonetheless, given the underreported cases, the destructive nature of mines and their use amid the decades-long conflict. 

            Experts are particularly concerned about children victims, like the boy who triggered the mine at the jetty. Many are unaware of how lethal landmines and unexploded munitions are; some pick them up and play with them.

            Most children are no longer in school amid the conflict, leading to more unsupervised time. Violence has also forced more than 1.2 million people from their homes, according to the U.N., so children and others frequently move around in unfamiliar areas. 

            Many civilian victims encounter landmines during daily routines — just going about their days until life changes forever.

            ___

            In March 2021, two teenage cousins were working on a small family-run plot in Shan state. They had just left to dig for sweet potatoes when the father of one of the boys heard a blast from his home. He rushed to help, but he was too late. They'd been killed instantly. They’d triggered a mine. 

            The father, 47, tears up when he returns to the fields, where he found tattered clothes and mangled bodies. 

            “But it’s my family’s business, so I have to come to the farm to make a living,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his relatives.

            On the other side of the country, in western Chin state, a 20-year-old farmer was returning home from weeding a rice paddy field on a sunny May day when he triggered a mine buried on a path he’d walked many times before.

            “The explosion engulfed me, and my entire surroundings were clouded in smoke. I thought I was dying,” he told AP on condition of anonymity, out of fear for his safety. “I could see bones. The right leg was completely destroyed up to the ankle. My whole body was hot as if it was on fire and my skin was black.” 

            During his 18-day stay in the hospital, his right leg was amputated about four inches below the knee.

            Many victims and families won't know who was responsible for the blasts — the Tatmadaw or anti-military groups — as all sides of the conflict use mines. 

            A member of a militia that operates in Sagaing said his group has removed nearly 100 mines thought to be planted by the military and plans to reuse them to augment its arsenal of homemade devices. 

            “A mine is an indispensable weapon to attack the enemy,” said the member, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity over the sensitive information and fear the military would retaliate against his family.

            It’s a common practice: Militias and armed groups announcing they’ve demined areas where they operate, only to reuse the weapons.

            “They just move the mines to a new location,” Moser-Puangsuwan said. “And that is not what we call demining.”

            The militia member said villagers are warned of mine locations and civilians are rarely harmed. But Moser-Puangsuwan and other experts said it’s just not possible to prevent civilian casualties. 

            “They’re using an indiscriminate weapon,” Moser-Puangsuwan said. “Once it’s out there, it will kill or injure the next person who comes across it, whether they’re the enemy, whether they’re one of the soldiers on your side, or whether they are civilians.”

            One man in Myanmar’s western Chin state described how soldiers took him, his pregnant wife and their 5-year-old daughter captive, making them and 10 other civilians to walk ahead, beating them with rifles if they refused.

            The civilians moved slowly ahead through the suspected minefield, expecting with each step to trigger a blast, while a firefight between an anti-government militia and the soldiers broke out, he said. 

            “I thought: ‘Today is the day I die,’” said the man, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They later escaped, with no mines detonated during their march. 

            Landmine Monitor documented similar incidents in other states, calling it a “grave violation of international humanitarian and human rights law” in its most recent report.

            Myanmar and Russia were the only states with documented new use of mines in 2022, according to Landmine Monitor, though Human Rights Watch in January alleged Ukraine also used antipersonnel mines when Russian forces occupied the city of Izium. Non-state armed groups have also been confirmed to be using them in at least five countries in 2022, including anti-government forces in Myanmar.

            Myanmar and Russia are among countries that aren't signatories to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, along with China, North and South Korea, and the United States.

            Landmine Monitor also confirmed the military has been increasingly mining infrastructure such as mobile phone towers and power lines to deter attacks. Military-planted mines also are protecting at least two major Chinese-backed projects — a copper mine in Sagaing and a pipeline pumping station in northeastern Shan state that is part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, Moser-Puangsuwan said. 

            “We are not aware of the situation you mentioned,"" a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a fax to AP. ""The cooperation project between China and Myanmar is in line with the common interests of both sides and has brought tangible benefits to the people of Myanmar.” 

            It made no reference to any of those who had been maimed.

            ___

            For those who survive a blast, health care is difficult to access. Many areas are remote, with limited road infrastructure or access to medical facilities. Staffing is low; health workers are often forced to go into hiding or leave Myanmar over participation in anti-military protests. Few victims can afford prosthetics and rehabilitation. 

            At the jetty, the explosion that maimed the 3-year-old boy set off a frantic search for help, with his mother traveling dozens of kilometers across rural countryside by motorbike and boat. 

            A small clinic on the other side of the river gave basic first aid and morphine for pain. A larger rural clinic bandaged wounds and provided a blood transfusion. It wasn't until the pair got to the main hospital in the regional capital that doctors were able to amputate both of the boy's legs — the right below the knee and the left just below his hip.

            The hospital bill was more than six times the family's monthly income of 400,000 Myanmar Kyat ($190). 

            For months, the boy used a wheelchair. He would stare out the window of their small wooden home, watching friends play. “I just want my legs back,” he'd say. 

            In November, he was admitted to an orthopedic rehabilitation center. The Red Cross paid for quality prosthetic limbs and taught him to use them. 

            Now 4, the boy is back home and can move around on his own, allowing his mother to go back to work in the bean fields.

            He speaks frequently about the blast, but his mother isn't sure he'll ever process what happened. And the family will never be the same. 

            “Maybe he still doesn’t understand,” she said. “He is still young.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815015,"No. 4 UCLA blows out Cal 78-43, improves to 15-0 at home","LOS ANGELES (AP) — This time, the UCLA Bruins had their minds in the game for 40 minutes.

            
                Jaime Jaquez Jr. scored 20 points on his 22nd birthday and fourth-ranked UCLA routed last-place California 78-43 on Saturday night to improve to 15-0 at Pauley Pavilion this season and extend the nation’s longest home winning streak to 23 games.

            After falling behind against Stanford two days earlier before pulling out a win, the Bruins stormed to a 25-6 lead against Cal.











            “Sometimes it’s very easy to just lose your focus and not care and just try and go for stats or try and shoot the ball every time you get it,” Jaquez said. “I don’t think we did that. We shared the ball really well, everyone played hard, and we got a great win.”

            Amari Bailey contorted his body every which way in adding 16 points and nine rebounds for the first-place Bruins (23-4, 14-2 Pac-12). They clinched a first-round bye in next month's Pac-12 Tournament.

            “Just more energy on the ball, more energy defensively,” Bailey said in explaining his performance. 

            UCLA's 11th win in a row over last-place Cal was essentially an exhibition game, with the Bruins leading all the way and drawing loud cheers for three dunks by Adem Bona and acrobatic moves around the basket by Bailey. 

            Jaquez stole the ball and fed Bailey for a one-handed dunk midway through the second half. Bailey returned the favor on the next play, finding Jaquez under the basket for an easy layup that extended UCLA's lead to 59-22, its largest of the game. Bailey later hit a 3-pointer in front of 13,659, tying the season's highest attendance.

            “Our defense was as good as it could be early in the game and then we held them to 11 field goals,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. “The goal was to stay focused, that we were professional and had the right attitude. The results speak for themselves when you do that.”

            Kuany Kuany scored 14 points to lead the Golden Bears (3-24, 2-14), who dropped their 11th in a row. They fell to 0-3 against top-5 teams this season, having also lost a pair against No. 8 Arizona.

            Trailing 59-22, the Bears scored 10 straight points during their only big run of the game.

            The Bruins led 38-15 after a dominant first half. They held the Bears to 18% shooting, outrebounded them 25-14 and outscored them 20-6 in the paint. Cal didn't score its first basket until six minutes into the game.

            BIG PICTURE

            California: The Bears finished off another losing road trip, having also been blown out at USC on Thursday. They have four games remaining in the regular season before heading into the Pac-12 Tournament without leading scorer Devin Askew (15.5 points per game). He's been out since Feb. 1 after surgery for a sports hernia, one of several injuries to befall the team. The Bears have used 12 different starting lineups this season.

            UCLA: The Bruins hit the road next week to play at Utah and Colorado. They beat the Utes by 19 points and the Buffaloes by 14 points in January. After that, they close the regular season at home against Arizona State and No. 8 Arizona. UCLA beat the Sun Devils by 12 points and lost at Arizona by six points. ... Kenneth Nwuba is day-to-day with a left hip injury. ... Abramo Canka missed the game with a non-COVID-19 illness.

            BIRTHDAY BOYS

            Some in the crowd serenaded Jaquez with a chorus of “Happy Birthday.” Bailey had a birthday on Friday when he turned 19. “I’m not going to disclose the festivities, but there will be some festivities afterwards,” a smiling Jaquez said.

            THEY GOT RUSSELL

            The fans chanted “We want Russell!” multiple times in the second half, urging Cronin to put in Russell Stong. They got their wish when the fifth-year senior entered with two minutes left. It was his eighth appearance of the season and only his second since Dec. 14. He made one of two free throws, earning wild cheers for the first and an anguished groan for the miss.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815018,'I just want my legs back': Myanmar landmine casualties soar,"BANGKOK (AP) — The 3-year-old boy had taken only two steps from his mother’s lap when a deafening explosion rang out. The blast caught the woman in the face, blurring her vision. She forced her eyes open and searched for her son around the jetty where they’d been waiting for a ferry, near their small village in south-central Myanmar. 

            Through the smoke, she spotted him. His body lay on the ground, his feet and legs mangled with flesh peeled away, shattered bones exposed. 

            “He was crying and telling me that it hurt so much,” she said. “He didn’t know what just happened.”











            But she did. 

            ___

            The boy had detonated a landmine, an explosive device designed to mutilate or destroy whatever comes into its path.

            Landmines have been banned for decades by most countries, since the U.N. Mine Ban Treaty was adopted in 1997. But in Myanmar, which isn't party to the treaty, the use of mines has soared since the military seized power from the democratically elected government in February 2021 and armed resistance has skyrocketed. 

            Landmines are planted by all sides of the conflict in Myanmar, and they’re responsible for surging civilian casualties, including an alarming number of children as victims, according to an AP analysis based on data and reports from nonprofit and humanitarian organizations, interviews with civilian victims, families, local aid workers, military defectors and monitoring groups. 

            In 2022, U.N. figures show, civilian casualties from landmine and unexploded ordnance spiked by nearly 40%. Experts say this and other official tallies are vastly undercounted, largely due to difficulties monitoring and reporting during the conflict. 

            Despite incomplete numbers, experts agree the increase in Myanmar is the largest ever recorded. 

            Virtually no area is immune to the threat. Over the past two years, mine contamination has spread to every state and region except for the capital city, Naypyitaw, according to Landmine Monitor, a group that tracks global landmine use.

            The military also uses civilians as human shields, a practice widespread in the country for decades but raising alarms with increasing mine incidents. AP's analysis found the military, known as the Tatmadaw, forced people to walk ahead of troops to detonate potential landmines in their path, protecting their own troops. 

            The Myanmar military, which has acknowledged mine use in the past, didn't respond to a list of questions AP sent to their official spokesperson's email. 

            When the fighting moves on, landmines don’t. Mines left behind can indiscriminately maim or kill those who happen upon them, years later. 

            It raises the specter of casualties for years to come. In countries including Egypt and Cambodia, people continue to die from millions of mines left behind long after conflicts has ended.

            ___

            “Leaving an activated mine like this is the same as releasing a monster,” said a 26-year-old military defector who worked as a combat engineer platoon commander in Myanmar. 

            Like most who were interviewed by AP, the defector spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family from military retaliation. 

            Landmines and unexploded ordnance have been a persistent issue in Myanmar for more than four decades. The problem has grown exponentially since the military takeover, with heavier use of landmines in more parts of the country, said Kim Warren, a U.N. landmine specialist. 

            In 2022, 390 people were victims of landmines and unexploded ordnance in Myanmar, more than a 37% increase from 2021, according to figures compiled by UNICEF. Overall, 102 people were killed and 288 were wounded, with children making up some 34% of the victims, compared with 26% in 2021. 

            Still, Warren said, incidents are underreported. 

            Yeshua Moser-Puangsuwan, Landmine Monitor’s Myanmar expert, said his group counts only casualties it can confirm with confidence: “We’ve always been undercounting.” 

            Experts concede the total number of casualties may seem small, with Myanmar’s population of about 56 million, but say the rapid increase is distressing nonetheless. Experts are particularly concerned about children victims. Many are unaware of how lethal landmines and unexploded munitions are; some pick them up and play with them. 

            Many civilian victims encounter landmines during daily routines. 

            ___

            In March 2021, two teenage cousins were working on a small family-run plot in Shan state. They'd just left to dig for sweet potatoes when the father of one of the boys heard a blast. He rushed to help but was too late. They'd been killed instantly. They'd triggered a mine. 

            The father, 47, tears up when he returns to the fields. 

            “But it’s my family’s business, so I have to come to the farm to make a living,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect himself and his relatives.

            Many victims and families won't know who was responsible for the blasts — the Tatmadaw or anti-military groups. 

            A member of a militia that operates in Sagaing said his group has removed nearly 100 mines thought to be planted by the military and plans to reuse them to augment its arsenal of homemade devices. 

            “A mine is an indispensable weapon to attack the enemy,” said the member, who spoke by phone on condition of anonymity over the sensitive information and fear the military would retaliate against his family.

            One man in Myanmar’s western Chin state described how soldiers took him, his pregnant wife and their 5-year-old daughter captive, making them and 10 other civilians walk ahead, beating them with rifles if they refused.

            “I thought: ‘Today is the day I die,’” said the man, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. They escaped — no mines detonated during their march. 

            Landmine Monitor documented similar incidents in other states, calling it a “grave violation of international humanitarian and human rights law.” 

            Myanmar and Russia were the only states documented to have used mines in 2022, according to Landmine Monitor.

            The group also confirmed the military has been increasingly mining infrastructure such as mobile phone towers and power lines to deter attacks. Military-planted mines also are protecting at least two major Chinese-backed projects — a copper mine in Sagaing and a pipeline pumping station in northeastern Shan state that is part of China’s Belt and Road initiative, Moser-Puangsuwan said. 

            “We are not aware of the situation you mentioned,"" a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote to the AP in a fax. ""The cooperation project between China and Myanmar is in line with the common interests of both sides and has brought tangible benefits to the people of Myanmar.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815019,Health care vaccine mandate remains as some push for an end,"LOWRY CITY, Mo. (AP) — At Truman Lake Manor in rural Missouri, every day begins the same way for every employee entering the nursing home's doors — with a swab up the nose, a swirl of testing solution and a brief wait to see whether a thin red line appears indicating a positive COVID-19 case. 

            Only the healthy are allowed in to care for virus-free residents. 

            Despite those precautions, a coronavirus outbreak swept through the facility late last year. An inspector subsequently cited it for violating the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination requirement for health care facilities. 











            Truman Lake Manor is one of about 750 nursing homes and 110 hospitals nationwide written up for violating federal staff vaccination rules during the past year, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Most were given a bureaucratic nudge to do better — though some nursing homes also received fines, especially when they had multiple other problems.

            One year after it began being enforced nationwide on Feb. 20, 2022, the vaccination requirement affecting an estimated 10 million health care workers is the last remaining major mandate from President Joe Biden's sweeping attempt to boost national vaccination rates. Similar requirements for large employers, military members and federal contractors all have been struck down, repealed or partially blocked. 

            The health care vaccination mandate is scheduled to run until November 2024. But some contend it’s time to stop now, citing fewer severe COVID-19 cases, health care staffing shortages and the impending May 11 expiration of a national public health emergency that has been in place since January 2020. 

            “Their regulations are making it harder to give care – not easier,"" said Tim Corbin, the administrator of Truman Lake Manor who also doubles as a nurse, adding that ""the mandates need to end.” 

            CMS said in a statement to the AP that “the requirement for staff to be fully vaccinated has been a critical step in responding to the pandemic” and “has saved Americans from countless infections, hospitalizations, and death.”

            The policy requires workers, contractors and volunteers at facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid payments to have the full primary dosage of an original COVID-19 vaccine, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Though nursing homes can be fined for violations, CMS generally gave violating facilities additional time to update their policies and come into compliance. 

            The Republican-led U.S. House recently passed legislation that would halt the mandate, but the bill is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-led Senate.

            Meanwhile, the requirement continues with mixed results and — in some cases — widespread exceptions.

            When a state inspector visited Truman Lake Manor in December, a coronavirus outbreak had infected 26 of the 60 residents and about a quarter of the staff within the previous few weeks. Corbin said the outbreak originated from an unvaccinated employee with a religious exemption who tested negative for COVID-19 before working a shift and wore a mask. The employee didn't feel well and tested positive after arriving home. 

            The inspector found that more than 40% of staff had been granted religious exemptions from getting vaccinated. But the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services does not scrutinize the rationale for such exemptions. The reason the facility was cited for a vaccination deficiency was because three employees had failed to receive their second dose of the vaccine and had no exemption on record. After the citation, they each got the second shot, and regulators OK'd the corrections in January. 

            It's hard to find workers willing to be vaccinated, Corbin said, because many local residents remain opposed to the vaccine or doubt its effectiveness. Just 42% of adults in St. Clair County are vaccinated against COVID-19 — a rate barely half the national average. 

            The 120-bed facility is operating at half capacity and turning potential residents away, “because I can’t hire enough people to take care of them,” said Corbin, who's been running ads touting a $5,000 signing bonus for nurses. 

            Rhonda Martin, a nurse educator at the facility, said she understands people's hesitancy to get vaccinated. Though she received the initial shots and a booster, Martin still got sick from COVID-19 last fall and missed a couple weeks of work. 

            “At first, I was all for the vaccine, because I felt as health care workers, we needed to protect ourselves and the patients that we take care of,” she said. “The longer that it’s been going on, the vaccines haven’t seemed to help.”

            At one facility in Greenwood, South Carolina, the vaccine mandate caused an exodus among nursing staff that took a while to replenish.

            “People said, 'You know what? I’m going to just stop working,’"" said David Buckshorn, CEO of Wesley Commons in Greenwood. ""To have a requirement that someone feels strongly they don’t want to follow, that really limits our ability to bring people in.""

            Workforce shortages are causing more than half of nursing homes nationally to limit resident admissions, according to the American Health Care Association, which represents long-term care facilities. Though most other health care sectors have rebounded, nursing home employment was down 13% in 2022 comparedto pre-pandemic levels and reached lows not seen since the 1990s.

            LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit nursing homes and other aging service providers, originally supported the mandate and still encourages vaccinations. But it now says a federal requirement no longer is needed. 

            “Our country is in a very different place now than in summer of 2021, when the mandate was initially proposed,” said LeadingAge President and CEO Katie Smith Sloan.

            Though deaths are down significantly from their peak in January 2021, older adults and people with underlying health problems remain more susceptible to serious cases of COVID-19. Because of that, some medical professionals believe the vaccine mandate should continue at nursing homes and hospitals. 

            “This is an important requirement,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “Not only does it protect the health care worker themself, but it also protects the patients.”

            Some patient advocates also continue to back the vaccine mandate. 

            ""The more we drop requirements in general, the more dangerous it becomes for nursing home residents,” said Marjorie Moore, executive director of the St. Louis-based nonprofit VOYCE, which advocates for long-term care residents. 

            Nationwide, about 5% of the over 15,000 nursing homes caring for Medicare or Medicaid patients have been cited for violating the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, and about 2% of the 4,900 hospitals, according to the AP's analysis. But those citations haven't been evenly spread among states and occurred less often during the latter half of 2022.

            Twenty-four states cited no hospitals for COVID-19 vaccination violations.

            Nearly 1 in 5 nursing homes received staff vaccination citations in Louisiana, and nearly 1 in 7 in Michigan, the highest rates nationally. By contrast, 14 states and the District of Columbia had two or fewer facilities cited. Texas, which has the most nursing homes nationally participating in Medicare or Medicaid, had just one nursing home cited for violating the vaccination rule. 

            Kansas, Florida and Texas each declined to check for vaccination violations, instead leaving that process to CMS, which hired contractors. As a result, CMS said Texas was docked more than $2.5 million in federal funding, Florida more than $1.2 million and Kansas nearly $350,000. 

            Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who faced reelection in a Republican-leaning state, said last year that the vaccine mandate conflicted with state law and could worsen workforce shortages.

            Like Kansas, Kentucky also has a Democratic governor with a Republican-led Legislature. But Gov. Andy Beshear's administration said state inspectors noted no vaccination deficiencies because hospitals and nursing homes all met federal guidelines when accounting for exemptions.

            “We have been at the forefront of encouraging vaccines,"" said Betsy Johnson, president of the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities and the Kentucky Center for Assisted Living. “We understand vaccines save lives.”

            Nationally, the number of nursing homes cited for vaccination violations declined noticeably after CMS last June stopped requiring state inspectors to check for compliance when responding to complaints about unrelated allegations, such as neglect of patients. CMS cited substantial compliance with the vaccination requirement while making the change.

            Before then, Gil-Mor Manor in rural Morgan, Minnesota, was one of just three facilities cited for the worst deficiency category, indicating widespread “immediate jeopardy” to residents. 

            A May inspection report said the facility lacked policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 — such as requiring N95 masks — for 15 unvaccinated employees with religious exemptions. It said three other employees caring for patients were neither vaccinated nor exempted. 

            The ""failures resulted in 7 of 27 of residents contracting COVID-19,” the report said. 

            The nursing home responded by approving exemptions for the unvaccinated employees, updating its policies and hiring a consultant to provide additional training to its nurse in charge of infection control, facility administrator Terrie Rothmeier said. Inspectors lifted the “immediate jeopardy” designation within three weeks. The facility was not fined. 

            “We resolved the issue,” Rothmeier said.

Similar requirements for large employers, military members and federal contractors all have been struck down, repealed or partially blocked.The health care vaccination mandate is scheduled to run until November 2024. But some contend it’s time to stop now, citing fewer severe COVID-19 cases, health care staffing shortages and the impending May 11 expiration of a national public health emergency that has been in place since January 2020.“Their regulations are making it harder to give care – not easier,"" said Tim Corbin, the administrator of Truman Lake Manor who also doubles as a nurse, adding that ""the mandates need to end.”CMS said in a statement to the AP that “the requirement for staff to be fully vaccinated has been a critical step in responding to the pandemic” and “has saved Americans from countless infections, hospitalizations, and death.”The policy requires workers, contractors and volunteers at facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid payments to have the full primary dosage of an original COVID-19 vaccine, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Though nursing homes can be fined for violations, CMS generally gave violating facilities additional time to update their policies and come into compliance.The Republican-led U.S. House recently passed legislation that would halt the mandate, but the bill is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-led Senate.Meanwhile, the requirement continues with mixed results and — in some cases — widespread exceptions.When a state inspector visited Truman Lake Manor in December, a coronavirus outbreak had infected 26 of the 60 residents and about a quarter of the staff within the previous few weeks. Corbin said the outbreak originated from an unvaccinated employee with a religious exemption who tested negative for COVID-19 before working a shift and wore a mask. The employee didn't feel well and tested positive after arriving home.The inspector found that more than 40% of staff had been granted religious exemptions from getting vaccinated. But the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services does not scrutinize the rationale for such exemptions. The reason the facility was cited for a vaccination deficiency was because three employees had failed to receive their second dose of the vaccine and had no exemption on record. After the citation, they each got the second shot, and regulators OK'd the corrections in January.It's hard to find workers willing to be vaccinated, Corbin said, because many local residents remain opposed to the vaccine or doubt its effectiveness. Just 42% of adults in St. Clair County are vaccinated against COVID-19 — a rate barely half the national average.The 120-bed facility is operating at half capacity and turning potential residents away, “because I can’t hire enough people to take care of them,” said Corbin, who's been running ads touting a $5,000 signing bonus for nurses.Rhonda Martin, a nurse educator at the facility, said she understands people's hesitancy to get vaccinated. Though she received the initial shots and a booster, Martin still got sick from COVID-19 last fall and missed a couple weeks of work.“At first, I was all for the vaccine, because I felt as health care workers, we needed to protect ourselves and the patients that we take care of,” she said. “The longer that it’s been going on, the vaccines haven’t seemed to help.”At one facility in Greenwood, South Carolina, the vaccine mandate caused an exodus among nursing staff that took a while to replenish.“People said, 'You know what? I’m going to just stop working,’"" said David Buckshorn, CEO of Wesley Commons in Greenwood. ""To have a requirement that someone feels strongly they don’t want to follow, that really limits our ability to bring people in.""Workforce shortages are causing more than half of nursing homes nationally to limit resident admissions, according to the American Health Care Association, which represents long-term care facilities. Though most other health care sectors have rebounded, nursing home employment was down 13% in 2022 comparedto pre-pandemic levels and reached lows not seen since the 1990s.LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit nursing homes and other aging service providers, originally supported the mandate and still encourages vaccinations. But it now says a federal requirement no longer is needed.“Our country is in a very different place now than in summer of 2021, when the mandate was initially proposed,” said LeadingAge President and CEO Katie Smith Sloan.Though deaths are down significantly from their peak in January 2021, older adults and people with underlying health problems remain more susceptible to serious cases of COVID-19. Because of that, some medical professionals believe the vaccine mandate should continue at nursing homes and hospitals.“This is an important requirement,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “Not only does it protect the health care worker themself, but it also protects the patients.”Some patient advocates also continue to back the vaccine mandate.""The more we drop requirements in general, the more dangerous it becomes for nursing home residents,” said Marjorie Moore, executive director of the St. Louis-based nonprofit VOYCE, which advocates for long-term care residents.Nationwide, about 5% of the over 15,000 nursing homes caring for Medicare or Medicaid patients have been cited for violating the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, and about 2% of the 4,900 hospitals, according to the AP's analysis. But those citations haven't been evenly spread among states and occurred less often during the latter half of 2022.Twenty-four states cited no hospitals for COVID-19 vaccination violations.Nearly 1 in 5 nursing homes received staff vaccination citations in Louisiana, and nearly 1 in 7 in Michigan, the highest rates nationally. By contrast, 14 states and the District of Columbia had two or fewer facilities cited. Texas, which has the most nursing homes nationally participating in Medicare or Medicaid, had just one nursing home cited for violating the vaccination rule.Kansas, Florida and Texas each declined to check for vaccination violations, instead leaving that process to CMS, which hired contractors. As a result, CMS said Texas was docked more than $2.5 million in federal funding, Florida more than $1.2 million and Kansas nearly $350,000.Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who faced reelection in a Republican-leaning state, said last year that the vaccine mandate conflicted with state law and could worsen workforce shortages.Like Kansas, Kentucky also has a Democratic governor with a Republican-led Legislature. But Gov. Andy Beshear's administration said state inspectors noted no vaccination deficiencies because hospitals and nursing homes all met federal guidelines when accounting for exemptions.“We have been at the forefront of encouraging vaccines,"" said Betsy Johnson, president of the Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities and the Kentucky Center for Assisted Living. “We understand vaccines save lives.”Nationally, the number of nursing homes cited for vaccination violations declined noticeably after CMS last June stopped requiring state inspectors to check for compliance when responding to complaints about unrelated allegations, such as neglect of patients. CMS cited substantial compliance with the vaccination requirement while making the change.Before then, Gil-Mor Manor in rural Morgan, Minnesota, was one of just three facilities cited for the worst deficiency category, indicating widespread “immediate jeopardy” to residents.A May inspection report said the facility lacked policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 — such as requiring N95 masks — for 15 unvaccinated employees with religious exemptions. It said three other employees caring for patients were neither vaccinated nor exempted.The ""failures resulted in 7 of 27 of residents contracting COVID-19,” the report said.The nursing home responded by approving exemptions for the unvaccinated employees, updating its policies and hiring a consultant to provide additional training to its nurse in charge of infection control, facility administrator Terrie Rothmeier said. Inspectors lifted the “immediate jeopardy” designation within three weeks. The facility was not fined.“We resolved the issue,” Rothmeier said.__Harjai reported from Los Angeles and is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815020,Taiwan eases indoor mask mandate Feb 20,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Starting on Monday (Feb 20), the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) will relax rules governing the wearing of masks indoors.Masking regulations are being relaxed as COVID concerns wane. Generally speaking, mask mandates will only be enforced at medical institutions and on public transportation. To better explain the changing mandate, TVBS compiled some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to better educate the public.There are two types of places where masks are still mandatory. The first is medical care institutions, which include hospitals, clinics, medical affairs offices, pharmacies, long-term care institutions, elderly welfare service offices, veterans’ homes, childrens' and juvenile service centers, and welfare institutions for the physically and mentally disabled.Public transport and special means of transport include railway cars, ships, buses, aircraft, and other means of transport, including related stations. However, the CECC said one can take off masks to eat, drink, take pictures, and receive medical treatment where wearing a mask is inconvenient.According to the CECC regulations, passengers taking public transportation and special transportation are required to wear masks. This includes taxis, cable cars, ambulances, and other buses. Therefore, it is always necessary to wear a mask when taking a taxi.The CECC says masks are only required indoors when entering medical care institutions or public transportation and special vehicles. Therefore, people can independently decide whether to wear masks in other indoor places. It is still recommended to wear a mask in crowded spaces with poor ventilation and proper social distancing cannot be kept, but it is not required.More clarification about easing of the indoor mask mandate. (Ministry of Health and Welfare photo)The CECC suggests a mask should be worn in the following four instances.
(1) Fever or respiratory symptoms.
(2) When elderly people or those that are immune-compromised go out.
(3) Places where crowds gather and proper social distancing cannot be maintained or ventilation is poor.
(4) When in close contact with the elderly or immunocompromised (especially those who have not been fully vaccinated).The CECC said that people can independently decide whether to wear masks except for medical care institutions and public transportation. However, if the organizer of an event requires wearing a mask, the public has to cooperate, otherwise, the organizer has the right to prohibit those who do not wear a mask from entering the venue or undertaking other measures.The CECC said mask regulations on school campuses will be released starting from March 6. After this time, masks will still be required at school health centers, school buses, kindergarten vehicles, campus shuttle buses, etc. Schools will also have the discretion to adopt their own mask measures.The CECC emphasized that regardless of whether one is indoors or outdoors, individuals have all the power and discretion to wear a mask. If you are worried about COVID transmission, you can choose to continue wearing a mask.",2023/02/19,9904,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815038,Detectives treating Los Angeles bishop's death as homicide,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Catholic bishop in Southern California was shot and killed Saturday just blocks from a church, a slaying of a longtime priest hailed as a “peacemaker” that's stunned the Los Angeles religious community, authorities said.

            Detectives are investigating the death of Bishop David O’Connell as a homicide, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 

            Authorities have not said whether the bishop was targeted in the shooting or if his religion was a factor in the killing. The sheriff’s department would not say how or specifically where his body was discovered. The shooter — or shooters — remain at-large.











            O'Connell, 69, had been a priest for 45 years and was a native of Ireland, according to Angelus News, the archdiocese's news outlet. Pope Francis had named him one of several auxiliary bishops of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles — the largest in the country — in 2015. 

            O’Connell worked in South Los Angeles for years and focused on gang intervention, Angelus News reported. He later sought to broker peace between residents and law enforcement following the violent 1992 uprising after a jury acquitted four white LA police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a Black man. 

            Nearly two decades later, O'Connell brought the San Gabriel Valley community together to rebuild a mission there after an arson attack and in recent years spearheaded Catholic efforts in the region to work with immigrant children and families from Central America.

            O'Connell was found in Hacienda Heights around 1 p.m. Saturday with a gunshot wound. Sheriff's deputies were called to the area — just blocks from the St. John Vianney Catholic Church, which is part of O'Connell's archdiocese — on a report of a medical emergency.

            Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene, the sheriff's department said. The archdiocese said O'Connell lived in Hacienda Heights — an unincorporated community about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles — but it was not immediately clear whether he was found at his home or elsewhere.

            Masses at churches across the region were dedicated to O’Connell on Sunday. Neighbors and parishioners left flowers and candles and prayed the rosary next to police tape in Hacienda Heights. About 50 people prayed and sang in a vigil Sunday afternoon near part of the neighborhood surrounded by crime scene tape.

            “I’ve been crying for two days, every time I think of him,” said Ramona Torres, who has been a lector in her church for more than 30 years and would often read at Masses that O'Connell was conducting. 

            Gabriela Gil first met O'Connell when she was pregnant with her youngest child after a Catholic school Mass.

            “I asked him if he would pray over my belly,"" she told The Associated Press as she and her family paid their respects at the crime scene.

            A mother of seven, Gil would talk to O'Connell about her sons and daughters and her faith over the years. “I’ve never ever felt more understood by anyone in this world,” she said, adding that she originally thought he had died of a heart attack or some medical emergency.

            News of his killing stunned her — just last year, O'Connell had presided over her son's confirmation.

            “I saw him in the parking lot before the Mass started and he was just going out for a little walk, praying his rosary,” she said.

            
                The Diocese of Cork and Ross in Ireland, where O'Connell was born, was shocked by the priest's death. Bishop Fintan Gavin said in a statement that O'Connell “has always maintained his connection with family and friends in Cork” through frequent visits back to Ireland. 

            
                The LA County sheriff offered the agency's condolences, saying detectives are “committed to arresting those responsible for this horrible crime.”

            “He was a peacemaker and had a passion serving those in need while improving our community,” Sheriff Robert Luna said on Twitter.

            Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez offered the archdiocese's prayers for the family of “Bishop Dave,” as well as law enforcement investigating the crime.

            “He was a peacemaker with a heart for the poor and the immigrant, and he had a passion for building a community where the sanctity and dignity of every human life was honored and protected,” Gomez said.

            Former LA Mayor Eric Garcetti called the bishop “a friend of many years” and said he was part of a prayer group with O'Connell during the coronavirus pandemic.

            “This city has lost one of its most beautiful angels,” Garcetti said on Twitter Sunday.

            The violence was the latest to rock religious leaders in Los Angeles . Two Jewish men were shot and wounded last week by a gunman who authorities said targeted them for their faith.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815039,"Skinner scores game-winner, Sabres beat Sharks 4-2","SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Jeff Skinner scored the game-winning goal, and the Buffalo Sabres beat the San Jose Sharks 4-2 on Saturday night.

            Sabres forward Dylan Cozens extended his goal streak to three. Alex Tuch and Owen Power also scored for Buffalo. Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen made 33 saves for his 14th win of the season.

            “I think (Luukkonen) obviously kept us in (the game) early. He made some really big saves, especially that one at the end of the first,"" Skinner said.











            Evgeny Svechnikov and Alexander Barabanov scored for San Jose, while Kaapo Kahkonen made 27 saves for his 12th loss this season.

            “Steve (Lorentz) came to help me in the corner. The puck went low to high, and I went to the net, and luckily, I got a tip in,” Svechnikov said.

            Skinner received a pass from Tage Thompson midway through the third period for his 21st goal of the season.

            At 3:01 of the first period, Cozens went coast to coast and beat Kahkonen through the legs for his 20th goal this season.

            “I was looking for some options, but I think they all kind of came off the bench (and) were flat-footed, so I just had to take it outside and just throw it on, and it found a way in,"" Cozens said.

            Svechnikov deflected a shot late in the first for his sixth of the season and to tie the game at one.

            Just like Cozens’ goal, Power was able to beat the Sharks netminder with a shot that went five-hole for his fourth goal of the season.

            The Sharks dominated play throughout the second, outshooting the Sabres 9-2 halfway through the period. At 8:02 of the second, Erik Karlsson took a shot that rebounded off the back boards right to Barabanov to slide home.

            Early in the third, Sabres forward Peyton Krebs was awarded a penalty shot but was stopped.

            “(Kahkonen) played well. I’m sure he’d like to have that first goal back, but he made some big saves after that,"" Sharks coach David Quinn said. ""He’s played very well. He’s looking like the No. 1 goalie we know he’s capable of being.”

            Tuch scored his 26th goal into an empty net to ice the game in the third.

            “We were much, much better the third period. We finally decided to shoot a puck, and we did not through two periods,"" Sabres coach Don Granato said. ""We made a lot of work for ourselves because we were unwilling to shoot a puck.”

            Silovs was called up from Abbotsford of the American Hockey League on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Latvian made his debut in a 6-4 loss to the New York Rangers on Wednesday night.

            “We wanted to get the win for him,” Pettersson said. “I think last game we didn’t defend good enough and we didn’t help him but he still kept us in the game. And today I think was a better effort, our defensive game was better. Obviously, stuff to work on but it’s a step in the right direction.”











            Canucks newcomer Anthony Beauvillier also scored twice and Andrei Kuzmenko and Phillip Di Giuseppe added goals.

            Vancouver snapped a three-game skid, improving to 4-5-1 since Rick Tocchet took over as head coach Jan. 22.

            Pettersson has a career-high 71 points with 27 goals and 44 assists.

            “Obviously, was something that was on my mind when I got close,” Pettersson. “But I’m happy we got the win and happy for Arturs to get his first NHL win.”

            Scott Laughton and Morgan Frost scored for Philadelphia, and Carter Hart made 17 saves. The Flyers have lost four in a row.

            “We played better,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “We really need to try to find some more offence consistently, but I thought our effort was better than the last game.”

            Philadelphia pulled Hart with just over three minutes remaining for an extra attacker, and got a prime opportunity to rally when Di Giuseppe was called for high-sticking moments later.

            The Flyers opted to go with six attackers, but it was the Canucks who found the back of the net when Pettersson flipped in a backhander out of his own zone. He scored again with 40.3 seconds left.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815041,"Marchessault scores twice, Golden Knights beat Lightning 5-4","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jonathan Marchessault scored twice in the first period, the first one ending a 13-game goal drought and the second allowed to stand after a replay challenge.

            That decision by the Toronto replay office proved crucial as the Vegas Golden Knights remained hot with a 5-4 victory Saturday over the Tampa Bay Lightning.

            They extended their winning streak to five games to remain in first place in the competitive Pacific Division. It's quite a response for the Knights after they entered the All-Star break with a 1-5-2 stretch.











            “I did feel it was a playoff vibe,” Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said. “I was comfortable with my lines in November and then bunch of guys got hurt, damn it, and so that kind screwed that up. Now we’re back to pretty good health minus (Mark Stone). I like the way they’re operating.”

            This was Tampa Bay's first regulation loss of a four-game trip. The Lightning, who head home Tuesday night to host Anaheim, were 3-0-1 in their previous four games overall.

            The Knights got to Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy four times in the first, the first time the two-time Stanley Cup champion has allowed that many goals in an opening period, according to Sportsnet Stats.

            Shea Theodore had three points in opening period alone. He has a history of producing against the Lightning, twice putting up four-point games against them and scoring the winning goal with 2.3 seconds in a 2017 meeting.

            Reilly Smith had two assists for Vegas, and four Lightning players each had two points — Victor Hedman, Vladislav Namestnikov, Corey Perry and Mikhail Sergachev.

            Both teams came out firing, scoring three goals within a 47-second stretch of the first period. Namestnikov and Steven Stamkos scored for the Lightning and Brett Howden for the Knights. Stamkos' goal, a top-shelf one-timer from the left circle, was on a power play.

            Vegas scored three more times in the period, with Marchessault scoring twice and Theodore once. Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper immediately challenged the 5-foot-9 Marchessault's second goal for a high stick, but after the video replay, the goal was upheld.

            “Come on,” Cooper said when asked about the goal after the game. “I think Marchessault could stand right here and say he had a high stick on that goal. The rule's confusing to me now. I thought that was plain as day, but they saw it differently.""

            The question was whether Marchessault had a high stick when he swatted the puck to the ice not when he actually shot. In that case, it was a matter if the stick was above his shoulders.

            “I thought my stick was around my shoulders and I hit the bottom part of it,” Marchessault said. “I just got a little taller than I was in Tampa (2014-16). They didn't know that.”

            The Lightning got to within a goal in the second period on Perry's goal. That ended the Knights' five-game streak of allowing two or fewer goals.

            Vegas added the clincher with 1:09 left on Nicolas Roy' empty-netter from 142 feet. That became especially critical when former Knight Pierre-Edouard Bellemare scored with 10 seconds remaining.

            NOTES

            Stamkos has points in 16 of his past 22 games (nine goals, 21 assists). He also has 11 points in nine career game against the Knights. ... Vegas' Paul Cotter extended his points streak to four games (three goals, one assist) and Theodore to three games (two goals, four assists). ... Tampa Bay's Anthony Cirelli went to the locker room later in the second period after a collision with Vegas’ Brayden McNabb, but returned in the third. ... The Knights' power-play dry spell is at 23 chances in a row, and they have converted one in their past 30 attempts.

He said that even if Hungary has provided relief aid to Ukraine and refuge to Ukrainians fleeing the war, it ''does not mean doing away with our relationships with Russia, because that would be contrary to our national interests.''Hungary is heavily dependent on Russia for meeting its energy requirements.In the past decade, Hungary has forged strong economic and diplomatic ties with Russia under Orban's leadership. It has also secured major agreements on oil, gas and nuclear fuel with Russia.During his address, Orban also accused the European Union of prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine.Instead of brokering peace through negotiations, he believes the EU worsened the situation by sanctioning Russia and supplying Ukraine with weapons.''When Russia launched its attack, the West didn't isolate the conflict but elevated it to a pan-European level,'' he said.The EU has criticized Orban's government for overseeing the steady erosion of democratic institutions.In the latest dispute, the EU has blocked billions of euros in funds for Hungary over anti-corruption reforms.mf/wd (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815058,India wins 2nd test by 6 wickets after Australia crumble,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Australia started the third day of the second test with high hopes, but in less than four hours it had instead suffered another embarrassing batting collapse before India chased down a meagre total to win by six wickets before tea on Sunday. 

            Australia was 61-1 at the start of the day and looked to continue its batting counterattack from the previous evening. But instead it was India's spinners who ran amok as the visitors crumbled to 113 all out with Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin taking all ten wickets. 

            Left-arm spinner Jadeja took career-best figures of 7-42 in a devastating spell but was aided by some poor shot selection by a panicked Australia batting lineup. 











            It was Jadeja’s 12th five-wicket haul in tests, as he picked up a match-haul of 10 wickets for 110 runs. His previous innings best was 7-49 against England at Chennai in 2016. 

            Making Australia’s morning collapse count, India chased down the 115 runs it needed to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match series with 100-test veteran Cheteshwar Pujara smashing a four off Todd Murphy to end the match. 

            Australia put up a semblance of resistance with Nathan Lyon (2-49) and Todd Murphy (1-22) sharing three wickets to accompany a bizarre run out of captain Rohit Sharma but to no avail as India won by six wickets. 

            Australia made a poor start losing Travis Head (43) to the sixth ball of the morning as Ashwin had Head caught behind with Srikar Bharat holding on for a smart catch. 

            Marnus Labuschagne (35) and Steve Smith (9) added 20 runs for the third wicket in the calmest passage of play for the tourists. 

            That changed soon after when Ashwin trapped Smith lbw at the end of the 19th over, and the decision stayed in India’s favor despite the batsman opting for DRS. 

            Labuschagne was the next to go, bowled off Jadeja two overs later, as the ball kept low. His dismissal opened the floodgates as Australia collapsed from 95-3 to 95-7 in the space of 11 balls.

            After Labuschagne, Ashwin (3-59) trapped Matt Renshaw (2) lbw as the batters tried in vain to sweep. 

            Peter Handscomb was caught at slip for a three-ball duck, and Jadeja bowled Pat Cummins off the next ball after the Australia captain went for an unsightly slog, which defined his team’s poor batting approach. 

            It got worse as Jadeja bowled Alex Carey (7) with the score just past 100. 

            He also bowled Nathan Lyon (8) and Matthew Kuhnemann (3) in successive overs to end the innings and set India a straightforward chase of 115 runs to win. 

            In the chase, India lost Lokesh Rahul for one run before lunch but Sharma teed off, hitting 31 off 20 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes. He was then run-out after a mix-up with Pujara. 

            The latter added 30 runs with Virat Kohli (20) for the third wicket before Kohli was stumped off Murphy. 

            Shreyas Iyer scored 12 off 10 balls before holing out in the deep off Lyon. 

            Pujara (31 not out) added 30 runs with Srikar Bharat (23 not out) to finish off the proceedings shortly before tea. 

            Australia scored 263 runs in its first innings. India replied with 262 on day two, thanks to Axar Patel’s fighting half-century. Lyon picked up 5-67. 

            The hosts had won the first test in Nagpur by an innings and 132 runs, also within three days. 

            “I thought 260 was a decent score in the first innings. India batted well, even with just one or two partnerships. We were ahead of the game and slipped. So that’s disappointing for us. We need a review on what could have been done differently,” said Cummins, after the loss.

            The third test will be played in Indore from March 1. Dharamsala was initially scheduled to host the game, before the venue was changed after a delay in the relaying of the outfield.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815059,Backlund scores in OT as Flames stop Rangers' win streak,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Mikael Backlund’s power-play goal 1:28 into overtime Saturday night gave the Calgary Flames a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, snapping their seven-game winning streak.

            Andrew Mangiapane and Nazem Kadri both scored in the first minute for Calgary (26-19-11). The Flames pulled even in points with Minnesota for the second wild-card berth in the Western Conference, but the Wild have a game in hand.

            “It’s a playoff game every game for us. We can’t afford to lose too many more, so we've got to go on a streak here,"" Backlund said.











            Vladimir Tarasenko and Alexis Lafreniere scored for the Rangers (33-14-9), who have earned at least one point in each of their last 10 games (8-0-2). They are 14-2-4 in their last 20.

            New York is two points behind New Jersey for second place in the Metropolitan Division.

            “Going down early like we did, first two shifts of the game 2-0, in order to get a point we had to claw back,” said Rangers center Vincent Trocheck, who had two assists. “I thought we played a good game the rest of the way. Just first two minutes really killed us.”

            The Rangers scored 36 goals during their winning streak — which included scoring at least four in seven straight games for the first time since February 1991.

            But against a struggling Flames team, they could only solve Jacob Markstrom twice on 21 shots. Markstrom won for just the second time since Jan. 6. He improved to 15-13-7.

            Jaroslav Halak, who made 29 saves, fell to 8-6-2.

            “We hung him out to dry early. Some of the saves he made were unbelievable,” New York defenseman Ryan Lindgren said.

            The game-winner came 38 seconds into a penalty on Adam Fox after the Rangers defenseman caught Dillon Dube with a high stick during a scrum in the corner.

            On the 4-on-3 man advantage, Backlund deflected Jonathan Huberdeau’s shot past Halak.

            “You know my shot, there’s no way that was going in,” Huberdeau said with a chuckle. “I saw Backs was wide open. He works on that every morning skate, so the work paid off this time. That’s a huge win for us.”

            Huberdeau had two primary assists.

            “Great shot by him seeing that we had some room in front there,” Backlund said. “He had a good night for us and he played really well, created a lot of chances and looks in the O-zone.”

            Calgary was ahead 2-0 less than a minute into the game, but the score remained that way for more than 36 minutes before New York cut the deficit in half at 16:53 of the second period when Tarasenko capped off a pretty three-way passing play with Artemi Panarin and Trocheck.

            Panarin’s assist extended his point streak to seven games (six goals, nine assists).

            Calgary had numerous chances to regain a two-goal lead in the third, but Halak was excellent.

            The Rangers tied it at 12:48 of the third. Lafreniere got a pass from Trocheck and put a shot on net that was partially stopped by Markstrom. As the rebound slithered toward the far post, Lafreniere was able to tap it in before Markstrom could get across.

            It was Lafreniere's first career power-play goal.

            “It’s nice to win games when you’re coming back, but you should play better at the start,” Tarasenko said. “Everybody knows that we can play better. I don’t think anybody’s satisfied with the result today.”

            Calgary scored two goals eight seconds apart in the opening minute.

            Mangiapane got in alone and made a terrific deke to get his 12th goal 38 seconds in.

            Right after that, Kadri finished off a tic-tac-toe passing play with Huberdeau and Jakob Pelletier, and his 21st goal of the season had the Saddledome crowd buzzing.

            LINDHOLM MISSING

            The Flames were without No. 1 center Elias Lindholm, away from the team for the birth of his first child. His spot between Dube and Tyler Toffoli was taken by Adam Ruzicka, who has no points in his last 15 games and has gone 26 games without a goal.

            STREAK BUSTER

            Chris Kreider had his seven-game point streak snapped while Mika Zibanejad had his six-game point spree halted. Halak also had his seven-game winning streak snapped. He last loss was on Dec. 3, 2022.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Mikael Backlund’s power-play goal 1:28 into overtime Saturday night gave the Calgary Flames a 3-2 victory over the New York Rangers, snapping their seven-game winning streak.Andrew Mangiapane and Nazem Kadri both scored in the first minute for Calgary (26-19-11). The Flames pulled even in points with Minnesota for the second wild-card berth in the Western Conference, but the Wild have a game in hand.“It’s a playoff game every game for us. We can’t afford to lose too many more, so we've got to go on a streak here,"" Backlund said.Vladimir Tarasenko and Alexis Lafreniere scored for the Rangers (33-14-9), who have earned at least one point in each of their last 10 games (8-0-2). They are 14-2-4 in their last 20.New York is two points behind New Jersey for second place in the Metropolitan Division.“Going down early like we did, first two shifts of the game 2-0, in order to get a point we had to claw back,” said Rangers center Vincent Trocheck, who had two assists. “I thought we played a good game the rest of the way. Just first two minutes really killed us.”The Rangers scored 36 goals during their winning streak — which included scoring at least four in seven straight games for the first time since February 1991.But against a struggling Flames team, they could only solve Jacob Markstrom twice on 21 shots. Markstrom won for just the second time since Jan. 6. He improved to 15-13-7.Jaroslav Halak, who made 29 saves, fell to 8-6-2.“We hung him out to dry early. Some of the saves he made were unbelievable,” New York defenseman Ryan Lindgren said.The game-winner came 38 seconds into a penalty on Adam Fox after the Rangers defenseman caught Dillon Dube with a high stick during a scrum in the corner.On the 4-on-3 man advantage, Backlund deflected Jonathan Huberdeau’s shot past Halak.“You know my shot, there’s no way that was going in,” Huberdeau said with a chuckle. “I saw Backs was wide open. He works on that every morning skate, so the work paid off this time. That’s a huge win for us.”Huberdeau had two primary assists.“Great shot by him seeing that we had some room in front there,” Backlund said. “He had a good night for us and he played really well, created a lot of chances and looks in the O-zone.”Calgary was ahead 2-0 less than a minute into the game, but the score remained that way for more than 36 minutes before New York cut the deficit in half at 16:53 of the second period when Tarasenko capped off a pretty three-way passing play with Artemi Panarin and Trocheck.Panarin’s assist extended his point streak to seven games (six goals, nine assists).Calgary had numerous chances to regain a two-goal lead in the third, but Halak was excellent.The Rangers tied it at 12:48 of the third.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815060,"Fiala, Kings fight back for 6-5 shootout win over Coyotes","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Fiala had two goals and an assist and the Los Angeles Kings held on to beat the Arizona Coyotes 6-5 in a shootout Saturday night.

            Anze Kopitar, Blake Lizotte and Matt Roy each had a goal and an assist during a five-goal outburst in the first period, but the Kings had to recover after squandering a four-goal lead to win their fourth straight game.

            “It's obviously a big trap when you take a lead by that much,” Kings center Phillip Danault said. “We got caught again, but big character win.”











            Jonathan Quick made 27 saves, getting his 369th career victory to tie Tom Barrasso for third-most by American goaltenders.

            Clayton Keller had two goals for Arizona, and Josh Brown, Travis Boyd and Christian Fischer also scored. The Coyotes picked up at least a point for the eighth straight game, their longest streak since a 11-0-1 stretch in February 2012. 

            Karel Vejmelka was replaced late in the first after allowing five goals on 14 shots. Connor Ingram made 23 saves in relief.

            “I think that was a big wake-up call for our team,” Fischer said. “If we’re not on top of the puck, aggressive, playing the way we have to, we’ll get embarrassed just like we did.”

            The Kings have scored at least five goals in four consecutive games for the first time since Dec. 1-8, 1992, and it didn’t take long for their offensive firepower to shine yet again.

            Los Angeles had five goals in 7:48 span in the first period. Fiala bookended the spree with his 20th and 21st goals. He opened the scoring on a power play and made it 5-1 with 4:12 remaining in the period.

            “This lead tonight happened fast,” Kings coach Todd McLellan said. “It happened, bang, bang, bang, one after another. And then from that point on, we got extremely casual.""

            The Coyotes took advantage of that relaxed attitude to fight back, starting when Keller scored during a 5-on-3 power play late in the second period. He made it 5-3 37 seconds into the third.

            Boyd scored two seconds after an Arizona power play expired at 7:06, and Fischer tied it at 5 44 seconds later. 

            The contrasting emotions on how the final 40 minutes of regulation played out were apparent in the reaction from the opposing benches. McLellan pointed out that “championship quality or caliber teams don’t do that” with such a substantial lead, while his Coyotes counterpart Andre Tourigny was pleased by the response. 

            “That’s who we are,” Tourigny said. “At the end of the day, that’s a good thing because we take a lot of pride in being that competitive and working that hard. … The boys really dig in and found a way.” 

            VINTAGE SAVE

            Gabe Vilardi and Adrian Kempe scored in the shootout, and Quick saved Nick Schmaltz’s attempt by waiting him out before using his stick to knock the puck away. Nick Bjugstad put his try wide of the net and off the boards with a chance to extend it to the third round.

            “That was an incredible save,” McLellan said. “He’s a competitive guy and just when you think you have him beat, something pops out, whether it’s a leg, a glove, a stick.” 

            WARNING SIGNS

            McLellan had been critical of his team for similar slippage in their game during a 5-2 win against Buffalo on Monday, including taking unnecessary penalties. In this instance, it was simultaneous whistles against defenseman Mikey Anderson for hooking and forward Viktor Arvidsson for tripping that allowed Arizona back into the contest.

            “Even when you're winning, you're trying to fix things,"" McLellan said. 

            WORTH NOTING

            The Kings hadn’t scored five goals in the first period since Nov. 13, 2005, in an 8-2 victory over Columbus. ... Kings F Trevor Moore briefly came out of the game in the third period, but McLellan said he was fine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815061,Eberle scores twice to lift Kraken over Red Wings 4-2,"SEATTLE (AP) — Jordan Eberle had two goals and an assist as the Seattle Kraken defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4-2 on Saturday night.

            Jamie Oleksiak and Eeli Tolvanen also scored for the Kraken, and Philipp Grubauer made 20 saves.

            “Incredible,” Grubauer said of Seattle’s effort. “I think it started a couple games ago. We are doing the right things, and it’s looking more like playoff hockey, where we make the right decision in that moment for the team. They’re not making any selfish plays. … We’ve got to continue that because there is not much hockey left, and our division is pretty tight, so we need every point.”











            Pius Suter and Dylan Larkin each had a goal for the Red Wings, and Ville Husso stopped 21 shots.

            Eberle gave Seattle a 1-0 lead at 16:50 of the first, but Suter tied it with 16 seconds left in the period. Eberle put the Kraken ahead again early in the second with his 13th goal of the season.

            “Anytime you get scored on late in the period, it can be tough and deflating a little bit, but we responded, obviously,” Eberle said. “We got one early in the second and then the one at the end of the second was big, too. And then early in the third. Timely goals are always key to putting teams away.”

            Oleksiak made it 3-1 on a 4-on-4 situation with eight seconds left in the second, assisted by Eberle and Matty Beniers.

            “We didn’t execute,"" Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “Throughout our lineup, throughout all of our areas in our game, execution was not there tonight.”

            Tolvanen’s goal at 4:49 of the third gave the Kraken a 4-1 lead. Larkin put the puck past Grubauer at 17:39. 

            Beniers finished with two assists. 

            “I thought we were fast,” Beniers said. “They came out hot in the beginning, and we were able to answer and get some momentum and come out in the second and really play well.”

            The Kraken beat the Red Wings for the second time in franchise history. 

            “I was happy with the effort,” Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said. “We got off to a good start, we built a lead. We didn’t manage the puck very well in the last 10 minutes, and that caused a lot of trouble for us. But (Grubauer) was good, and we got through it. We had the benefit of the lead we built in the first 50.”

            NOTES: Eberle has 14 points (10 goals, four assists) in his last 12 games against Detroit. … Tolvanen’s third-period goal gave him a point in each of the Kraken’s past five games, setting a career high. … Detroit defenseman Filip Hronek and left wing Tyler Bertuzzi both played their 300th career game. … Saturday was Seattle’s second annual Black Hockey History Night, and the Kraken wore special warmup jerseys to mark the occasion.

After several netizens began posting photos on social media of signs explaining the suspension of items that include eggs, McDonald’s responded to allay concerns. The company said that egg supplies are normal at most locations, but sales of some breakfast items exceeded expectations at a handful of locations.Although the exact number was not disclosed, some McDonald's locations in Taiwan were forced to stop selling the following items on Sunday: the Egg Burger, the Egg Burger with Bacon, the Egg Burger with Sausage, the Egg Burger with Chicken, along with the Egg McMuffin, the Mega McMuffin, and the Sausage McMuffin with Egg.McDonalds says that the company is not currently worried about an egg shortage, reported UDN. They thanked their customers for their support and said they were sorry for the unfortunate suspension of some items in a few stores on Sunday. Sales of the breakfast items simply exceeded regular sales projections.In recent weeks, there has been growing concern over a shortage of eggs in Taiwan. Some supermarket chains, including PX-Mart and Carrefour have begun limiting the amount of eggs that customers can purchase at a time.The Council of Agriculture has said that egg supply issues are expected to be resolved by late February, and that egg prices should decrease slightly in the following weeks, reported UDN. However, many consumers worry that the problem may still be getting worse.",2023/02/19,5888,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815074,Cronin says UCLA seed in NCAA bracket preview is 'comical',"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Division I men’s basketball committee revealed its top 16 teams for next month’s NCAA Tournament on Saturday, and UCLA coach Mick Cronin found his team’s current seed to be “comical.”

            Top-ranked Alabama was voted as the committee’s top overall seed. No. 2 Houston, No. 3 Purdue and No. 5 Kansas were selected as No. 1 seeds — for now.

            No. 8 Arizona was chosen as the sixth overall seed, while fourth-ranked UCLA was eighth. The Pac-12 rivals will meet March 4 in their regular-season finale. The Wildcats beat the Bruins 58-52 last month.











            “If you ask my one-word answer on that ranking — comical,” a straight-faced Cronin said after the Bruins routed California 78-43 on Saturday night. “I'm going to try not to laugh.”

            Cronin attributed the Bruins' projected seed to last summer's announcement that UCLA and USC are leaving the Pac-12 to join the Big Ten in 2024. 

            “When we left the Pac-12, it cost a lot of people millions of dollars and there was going to be fallout, and I think it’s a direct result,” he said. “I had nothing to do with us leaving the league, but you deal with the fallout being a lame duck.”

            The committee placed the 16 teams into the four regions. The Bruins (23-4 overall, 14-2 Pac-12) landed in the East Regional, to be played in New York, along with Purdue, No. 11 overall seed Iowa State and No. 14 overall seed Marquette.

            Meanwhile, Arizona (24-4, 13-4) was placed in the West, to be played in Las Vegas, with Kansas, No. 12 seed Kansas State and No. 15 seed Gonzaga.

            “A couple years ago we proved your seed doesn't matter,” Cronin said.

            In 2021, the 11th-seeded Bruins reached the Final Four before losing in overtime to Gonzaga in the national semifinals.

            UCLA's leading scorer, Jaime Jaquez Jr., said he wasn't aware the preview bracket had been announced.

            “I'll wait for the final bracket to be excited or not excited,” he said. “Probably excited.”

            The bracket preview show aired on CBS. 

            Selection Sunday for the NCAA Tournament is March 12.

            AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Division I men’s basketball committee revealed its top 16 teams for next month’s NCAA Tournament on Saturday, and UCLA coach Mick Cronin found his team’s current seed to be “comical.”Top-ranked Alabama was voted as the committee’s top overall seed. No. 2 Houston, No. 3 Purdue and No. 5 Kansas were selected as No. 1 seeds — for now.No. 8 Arizona was chosen as the sixth overall seed, while fourth-ranked UCLA was eighth. The Pac-12 rivals will meet March 4 in their regular-season finale. The Wildcats beat the Bruins 58-52 last month.“If you ask my one-word answer on that ranking — comical,” a straight-faced Cronin said after the Bruins routed California 78-43 on Saturday night. “I'm going to try not to laugh.”Cronin attributed the Bruins' projected seed to last summer's announcement that UCLA and USC are leaving the Pac-12 to join the Big Ten in 2024.“When we left the Pac-12, it cost a lot of people millions of dollars and there was going to be fallout, and I think it’s a direct result,” he said. “I had nothing to do with us leaving the league, but you deal with the fallout being a lame duck.”The committee placed the 16 teams into the four regions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815082,Ukrainian grain shipments drop as ship backups grow,"LONDON (AP) — The amount of grain leaving Ukraine has dropped even as a U.N.-brokered deal works to keep food flowing to developing nations, with inspections of ships falling to half what they were four months ago and a backlog of vessels growing as Russia's invasion nears the one-year mark. 

            Ukrainian and some U.S. officials are blaming Russia for slowing down inspections, which Moscow has denied. Less wheat, barley and other grain getting out of Ukraine, dubbed the “breadbasket of the world, ” raises concerns about the impact to those going hungry in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia — places that rely on affordable food supplies from the Black Sea region.

            The hurdles come as separate agreements brokered last summer by Turkey and the U.N. to keep supplies moving from the warring nations and reduce soaring food prices are up for renewal next month. Russia is also a top global supplier of wheat, other grain, sunflower oil and fertilizer, and officials have complained about the holdup in shipping the nutrients critical to crops.











            Under the deal, food exports from three Ukrainian ports have dropped from 3.7 million metric tons in December to 3 million in January, according to the Joint Coordination Center in Istanbul. That's where inspection teams from Russia, Ukraine, the U.N. and Turkey ensure ships carry only agricultural products and no weapons.

            The drop in supply equates to about a month of food consumption for Kenya and Somalia combined. It follows average inspections per day slowing to 5.7 last month and 6 so far this month, down from the peak of 10.6 in October. 

            That has helped lead to backups in the number of vessels waiting in the waters off Turkey to either be checked or join the Black Sea Grain Initiative. There are 152 ships in line, the JCC said, a 50% increase from January. 

            This month, vessels are waiting an average of 28 days between applying to participate and being inspected, said Ruslan Sakhautdinov, head of Ukraine's delegation to the JCC. That's a week longer than in January.

            Factors like poor weather hindering inspectors’ work, demand from shippers to join the initiative, port activity and capacity of vessels also affect shipments.

            “I think it will grow to be a problem if the inspections continue to be this slow,” said William Osnato, a senior research analyst at agriculture data and analytics firm Gro Intelligence. “In a month or two, you’ll realize that’s a couple a million tons that didn’t come out because it’s just going too slowly.”

            “By creating the bottleneck, you’re creating sort of this gap of the flow, but as long as they’re getting some out, it’s not a total disaster,” he added.

            U.S. officials such as USAID Administrator Samantha Power and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield have blamed Russia for the slowdown, saying food supplies to vulnerable nations are being delayed.

            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said in statement Wednesday on Facebook that Russian inspectors have been “systematically delaying the inspection of vessels” for months.

            They accused Moscow of obstructing work under the deal and then “taking advantage of the opportunity of uninterrupted trade shipping from Russian Black Sea ports.”

            Osnato also raised the possibility that Russia might be slowing inspections “in order to pick up more business” after harvesting a large wheat crop. Figures from financial data provider Refinitiv show that Russian wheat exports more than doubled to 3.8 million tons last month from January 2022, before the invasion.

            Russian wheat shipments were at or near record highs in November, December and January, increasing 24% over the same three months a year earlier, according to Refinitiv. It estimated Russia would export 44 million tons of wheat in 2022-2023.

            Alexander Pchelyakov, a spokesman for the Russian diplomatic mission to U.N. institutions in Geneva, said last month that the allegations of deliberate slowdowns are “simply not true.”

            Russian officials also have complained that the country's fertilizer is not being exported under the agreement, leaving renewal of the four-month deal that expires March 18 in question.

            Without tangible results, extending the deal is “unreasonable,” Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin on Monday told RTVI, a privately owned Russian-language TV channel.

            U.N. officials say they have been working to unstick Russian fertilizer and expressed hope that the deal will be extended. 

            “I think we are in slightly more difficult territory at the moment, but the fact is, I think this will be conclusive and persuasive,” Martin Griffiths, U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told reporters Wednesday. “The global south and international food security needs that operation to continue.”

            Tolulope Phillips, a bakery manager in Lagos, Nigeria, has seen the impact firsthand. He says the cost of flour has exploded 136% since the war in Ukraine began. Nigeria, a top importer of Russian wheat, has seen costs for bread and other food surge.

            “This is usually unstable for any business to survive,” Phillips said. “You have to fix your prices to accommodate this increase, and this doesn’t only affect flour — it affects sugar, it affects flavors, it affects the price of diesel, it affects the price of electricity. So, the cost of production has generally gone up.”

            
                Global food prices, including for wheat, have dropped back to levels seen before the war in Ukraine after reaching record highs in 2022. In emerging economies that rely on imported food, like Nigeria, weakening currencies are keeping prices high because they are paying in dollars, Osnato said. 

            Plus, droughts that have affected crops from the Americas to the Middle East meant food was already expensive before Russia invaded Ukraine and exacerbated the food crisis, Osnato said. 

            Prices will likely stay high for more than a year, he said. What's needed now is “good weather and a couple of crop seasons to become more comfortable with global supplies across a number of different grains” and “see a significant decline in food prices globally.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815083,"Russia's year of war: Purge of critics, surge of nationalism","TALLINN, Estonia (AP) — Moscow's nights display few signs of a nation at war.

            Cheerful crowds packed restaurants and bars in the Sretenka neighborhood on a recent Saturday night, watched by officers marked as “tourist police.” Nearby, a top-hatted guide led about 40 sightseers to a 300-year-old church.

            There's only an occasional “Z” — the symbol of Russia's “special military operation,” as the Ukraine invasion is officially known — seen on a building or a shuttered store abandoned by a Western retailer. A poster of a stern-faced soldier, with the slogan “Glory to the heroes of Russia,” is a reminder the conflict has dragged on for a year.











            Western stores are gone, but customers can still buy their products — or knockoffs sold under a Russian name or branding.

            The painful, bruising changes to Russian life require more effort to see.

            A broad government crackdown has silenced dissent, with political opponents imprisoned or fleeing abroad. Families have been torn apart by the first mobilization of reservists since World War II. State TV spews hatred against the West and reassuring messages that much of the world still is with Russia. 

            And Russia’s battlefield deaths are in the thousands.

            QUASHING THE CRITICS

            “Indeed, the war has ruined many lives — including ours,” Sophia Subbotina of St. Petersburg told The Associated Press.

            Twice a week, she visits a detention center to bring food and medicine to her partner, Sasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician with serious health issues. Skochilenko was arrested in April for replacing supermarket price tags with antiwar slogans.

            She is charged with spreading false information about the military, one of President Vladimir Putin's new laws that effectively criminalize public expression against the war. The crackdown has been immediate, ruthless and unparalleled in post-Soviet Russia.

            Media cannot call it a “war,” and protesters using that word on placards are hit with steep fines. Most who took to the streets were swiftly arrested. Rallies fizzled.

            Independent news sites were blocked, as were Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. A prominent radio station was taken off the air. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, led by 2021 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, lost its license.

            Skochilenko, who says she is not an activist but simply someone horrified by war, faces up to 10 years in prison.

            Prominent Putin critics either left Russia or were arrested: Ilya Yashin got 8½ years, Vladimir Kara-Murza is jailed awaiting trial and Alexei Navalny remains in prison.

            Entertainers opposing the war quickly lost work, with plays and concerts canceled. 

            “The fact that Putin has managed to intimidate a significant part of our society is hard to deny,” Yashin told AP from jail last year.

            PUSHING THE GOVERNMENT LINE

            The purge of critics was followed by a splurge of propaganda. State TV suspended some entertainment shows and expanded political and news programs to boost the narrative that Russia was ridding Ukraine of Nazis, a false claim Putin used as pretext for the invasion. Or that NATO is acting via puppets in Kyiv but that Moscow will prevail.

            “A new structure of the world is emerging in front of our eyes,” proclaimed anchor Dmitry Kiselev in a December rant on his weekly show. “The planet is getting rid of Western leadership. Most of humanity is with us.”

            These messages play well in Russia, says Denis Volkov, director of the country's top independent pollster Levada Center: “The idea that NATO wants to ruin Russia or at least weaken … it has been сommonplace for three-fourths (of poll respondents) for many years.”

            The Kremlin is pushing its narrative to the young. Schoolchildren were told to write letters to soldiers, and some schools designated “A Hero’s Desk” for graduates fighting in Ukraine.

            In September, schools added a subject loosely translated as “Conversations about Important Things.” Lesson plans for eighth to 11th graders seen by AP describe Russia’s “special mission” of building a “multipolar world order.”

            At least one teacher who refused to teach the lessons was fired. Although not mandatory, some parents whose children skip them face pressure from administrators or even police.

            A fifth grader was accused of having a Ukraine-themed photo on social media and asking classmates about supporting the war, and she and her mother were detained briefly after administrators complained, said her lawyer, Nikolai Bobrinsky. When she skipped the new lessons, authorities apparently decided to make ""an example” of her, he added.

            SURVIVING SANCTIONS

            The sanctions-hit economy outperformed expectations, thanks to record oil revenues of about $325 billion after the war sent energy prices soaring. The Central Bank stabilized the plummeting ruble by raising interest rates, and the currency is stronger against the dollar than before the invasion.

            McDonald's, Ikea, Apple and others left Russia. The golden arches were replaced by Vkusno — i Tochka (“Tasty — Period”), while Starbucks became Stars Coffee, with essentially the same menus.

            Visa and Mastercard halted services, but banks switched to the local MIR system, so existing cards continued to work in the country; those traveling abroad use cash. After the European Union banned flights from Russia, airline ticket prices rose and destinations became harder to reach. Foreign travel is now available to a privileged minority.

            Sociologists say these changes hardly bothered most Russians, whose average monthly salary in 2022 was about $900. Only about a third have an international passport.

            Inflation spiked nearly 12%, but Putin announced new benefits for families with children and increased pensions and the minimum wage by 10%.

            MacBooks and iPhones are still easily available, and Muscovites say restaurants have Japanese fish, Spanish cheese and French wine.

            “Yes, it costs a bit more, but there’s no shortage,” said Vladimir, a resident who asked not to be fully identified for his own safety. “If you walk in the city center, you get the impression that nothing is happening. Lots of people are out and about on weekends. There are fewer people in cafes, but they are still there.”

            Still, he admitted the capital seems emptier and people look sadder.

            ‘IN THE TRENCHES, OR WORSE’

            Perhaps the biggest shock came in September, when the Kremlin mobilized 300,000 reservists. Although billed as a “partial” call-up, the announcement sent panic through the country since most men under 65 — and some women — are formally part of the reserve.

            Flights abroad sold out in hours and long lines formed at Russia’s border crossings. Hundreds of thousands were estimated to have left the country in the following weeks.

            Natalia, a medical worker, left Moscow with her boyfriend after a summons was delivered to his mother. Their income was cut in half and she misses home, but they've decided to try it for a year, said the woman, who asked that her last name and location not be revealed for their safety.

            “Between ourselves, we’re saying that once things calm down, we will be able to come back. But it wouldn’t resolve the rest of it. That huge snowball is rolling downhill, and nothing will be back (as it was),” Natalia said.

            Draftees complained of poor living conditions at bases and shortages of gear. Their wives and mothers claimed they were deployed to the front without proper training or equipment and were quickly wounded.

            A woman who is contesting her husband being drafted said her family life fell apart after she suddenly had to care for her children and frail mother-in-law.

            “It was hard. I thought I’d lose my mind,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his legal case is continuing. Her husband came home on leave — suffering from pneumonia — and needs psychological care because he jumps at every loud sound, she said.

            Vasily, a 33-year-old Muscovite, learned authorities tried twice this month to deliver a summons to a former apartment where he is officially registered. Although not sure if the summons was to draft him or to clear up his enlistment records, especially after a September attempt to deliver call-up papers, he doesn't intend to find out. 

            “All my friends who went (to the enlistment office) to figure it out are in the trenches now, or worse,” added Vasily, who withheld his last name for his own safety.

            Volkov, the pollster, said the dominating sentiment among Russians is that the war is “somewhere far away, it is not affecting us directly.”

            While anxiety over the invasion and mobilization came and went over the year, “people started feeling again that it indeed doesn’t affect everyone. ’We’re off the hook. Well, thank god, we’re moving on with our lives.’”

            Some fear a new mobilization, which the Kremlin denies.

            LIVES LOST

            As the war became bogged down by defeats and setbacks, families got the worst news possible: a loved one was killed. 

            For one mother, it was too much to bear.

            She told AP she became “hysterical” and “started shaking” when told her son was missing and presumed dead while serving on the Moskva, the missile cruiser that sank in April. The woman, who at the time spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisal, said she found it hard to believe he was killed.

            The military has confirmed just over 6,000 deaths, but Western estimates are in the tens of thousands. Putin promised generous compensation to families of those listed as killed in action — 12 million rubles (about $160,000).

            In November, he met with a dozen mothers, which Russian media said were hand-picked among Kremlin supporters and officials, and told one of them her son's death wasn't in vain.

            “With some people ... it is unclear why they die -– because of vodka or something else. When they are gone, it is hard to say whether they lived or not -– their lives passed without notice,"" he told her. ""But your son did live – do you understand? He achieved his goal.”

Schoolchildren were told to write letters to soldiers, and some schools designated “A Hero’s Desk” for graduates fighting in Ukraine.In September, schools added a subject loosely translated as “Conversations about Important Things.” Lesson plans for eighth to 11th graders seen by AP describe Russia’s “special mission” of building a “multipolar world order.”At least one teacher who refused to teach the lessons was fired. Although not mandatory, some parents whose children skip them face pressure from administrators or even police.A fifth grader was accused of having a Ukraine-themed photo on social media and asking classmates about supporting the war, and she and her mother were detained briefly after administrators complained, said her lawyer, Nikolai Bobrinsky. When she skipped the new lessons, authorities apparently decided to make ""an example” of her, he added.SURVIVING SANCTIONSThe sanctions-hit economy outperformed expectations, thanks to record oil revenues of about $325 billion after the war sent energy prices soaring. The Central Bank stabilized the plummeting ruble by raising interest rates, and the currency is stronger against the dollar than before the invasion.McDonald's, Ikea, Apple and others left Russia. The golden arches were replaced by Vkusno — i Tochka (“Tasty — Period”), while Starbucks became Stars Coffee, with essentially the same menus.Visa and Mastercard halted services, but banks switched to the local MIR system, so existing cards continued to work in the country; those traveling abroad use cash. After the European Union banned flights from Russia, airline ticket prices rose and destinations became harder to reach. Foreign travel is now available to a privileged minority.Sociologists say these changes hardly bothered most Russians, whose average monthly salary in 2022 was about $900. Only about a third have an international passport.Inflation spiked nearly 12%, but Putin announced new benefits for families with children and increased pensions and the minimum wage by 10%.MacBooks and iPhones are still easily available, and Muscovites say restaurants have Japanese fish, Spanish cheese and French wine.“Yes, it costs a bit more, but there’s no shortage,” said Vladimir, a resident who asked not to be fully identified for his own safety. “If you walk in the city center, you get the impression that nothing is happening. Lots of people are out and about on weekends. There are fewer people in cafes, but they are still there.”Still, he admitted the capital seems emptier and people look sadder.‘IN THE TRENCHES, OR WORSE’Perhaps the biggest shock came in September, when the Kremlin mobilized 300,000 reservists. Although billed as a “partial” call-up, the announcement sent panic through the country since most men under 65 — and some women — are formally part of the reserve.Flights abroad sold out in hours and long lines formed at Russia’s border crossings. Hundreds of thousands were estimated to have left the country in the following weeks.Natalia, a medical worker, left Moscow with her boyfriend after a summons was delivered to his mother. Their income was cut in half and she misses home, but they've decided to try it for a year, said the woman, who asked that her last name and location not be revealed for their safety.“Between ourselves, we’re saying that once things calm down, we will be able to come back. But it wouldn’t resolve the rest of it. That huge snowball is rolling downhill, and nothing will be back (as it was),” Natalia said.Draftees complained of poor living conditions at bases and shortages of gear. Their wives and mothers claimed they were deployed to the front without proper training or equipment and were quickly wounded.A woman who is contesting her husband being drafted said her family life fell apart after she suddenly had to care for her children and frail mother-in-law.“It was hard. I thought I’d lose my mind,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his legal case is continuing. Her husband came home on leave — suffering from pneumonia — and needs psychological care because he jumps at every loud sound, she said.Vasily, a 33-year-old Muscovite, learned authorities tried twice this month to deliver a summons to a former apartment where he is officially registered. Although not sure if the summons was to draft him or to clear up his enlistment records, especially after a September attempt to deliver call-up papers, he doesn't intend to find out.“All my friends who went (to the enlistment office) to figure it out are in the trenches now, or worse,” added Vasily, who withheld his last name for his own safety.Volkov, the pollster, said the dominating sentiment among Russians is that the war is “somewhere far away, it is not affecting us directly.”While anxiety over the invasion and mobilization came and went over the year, “people started feeling again that it indeed doesn’t affect everyone. ’We’re off the hook. Well, thank god, we’re moving on with our lives.’”Some fear a new mobilization, which the Kremlin denies.LIVES LOSTAs the war became bogged down by defeats and setbacks, families got the worst news possible: a loved one was killed.For one mother, it was too much to bear.She told AP she became “hysterical” and “started shaking” when told her son was missing and presumed dead while serving on the Moskva, the missile cruiser that sank in April. The woman, who at the time spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisal, said she found it hard to believe he was killed.The military has confirmed just over 6,000 deaths, but Western estimates are in the tens of thousands. Putin promised generous compensation to families of those listed as killed in action — 12 million rubles (about $160,000).In November, he met with a dozen mothers, which Russian media said were hand-picked among Kremlin supporters and officials, and told one of them her son's death wasn't in vain.“With some people ... it is unclear why they die -– because of vodka or something else. When they are gone, it is hard to say whether they lived or not -– their lives passed without notice,"" he told her. ""But your son did live – do you understand? He achieved his goal.”___Associated Press writer David McHugh in Frankfurt, Germany, contributed.___Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/19,126,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815096,"US congressional delegation arrives in Taiwan to talk trade, tech","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A bipartisan delegation of four U.S. congressmen arrived in Taiwan early Sunday (Feb. 19) morning, and were welcomed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs's (MOFA) Director of North American Affairs Hsu Yu-Tien (徐佑典).The delegation, which will be in Taiwan for five days, includes Ro Khanna of California, Tony Gonzales of Texas, Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, and Jonathan Jackson of Illinois. The representatives are expected to meet with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), TSMC founder Morris Chang (張忠謀), and chief officials of Google's Taipei office to discuss bolstering links between the tech industries of Taiwan and the U.S.Last week, Ro Khanna announced that he was planning a congressional trip to Taiwan, and that he would seek to rebalance economic and trade relations. His trip to Taiwan has been planned since the U.S. passed the CHIPS Act in August 2022, LTN reported.The CHIPS Act is aimed at boosting semiconductor research, development, and production in the U.S., and limiting China’s access to key technologies considered important for national security. Taiwan is considered a strategic partner in the global semiconductor industry.Khanna and Auchinschloss were both recently appointed to the newly formed House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.In a statement on the committee assignment, Auchinschloss, who is a military veteran, said that while the U.S. can approach China with the intention of collaboration and competition, the U.S. must be prepared for conflict with China over Taiwan. ""In the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea, we have to be ready to fight and win,"" said the congressman.

Representative Tony Gonzales, also a veteran, has likewise expressed his support for Taiwan in the past and taken a hardline towards China in recent months. On Friday (Feb. 17), he introduced a new bill in Congress that would forbid foreign adversaries like China from purchasing land near military bases or sensitive areas.",2023/02/19,1947,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815123,Bittersweet market outlook for Taiwan pineapples,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Domestically produced pineapples are about to be harvested as farmers are hampered by a Chinese export embargo venturing into its third year.To compensate for the loss of this market, pineapple producers turned to Japan, where consumers pay a higher price but demand high standards regarding sweetness, physical appearance, pesticide residue, and traceability labeling, according to a News and Market report.In April this year, the COA will require pineapple packagers to affix traceability labels regarding detailed information associated with the production, packaging, and sales of domestically produced pineapples. This regulation is proving onerous as a labor shortage continues to affect the agricultural industry.This is a response to Japanese consumers expressing their dissatisfaction with poor quality pineapples from Taiwan last year. Many exported pineapples experienced internal browning (IB) or ""black heart"" as arrival times were delayed by 3 to 14 days, potentially causing discoloring and abnormal metabolism.According to the News and Market report, another challenge has been too few pesticides approved for usage in the Japanese market. Thus, post-harvest cleaning of pineapples is often no more than spraying pineapples with high-pressure air guns to remove bugs. Japanese detection of cosmet moths in a container can lead to costly fumigation, which also affects fruit quality.For one farmer, Mr. Lin, growing pineapples continues to become more and more challenging each year, but the number of pesticides he is able to use is still limited. He used bacillus thuringiensis, a soil-dwelling bacteria that is a common biological pesticide to little effect, because Japan scrutinizes drug residue on fruits.Post-harvest cleaning is also no more than a bath of diluted water and bleach for fruit stems, though the Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station developed a high-temperature steam sterilizer to prevent stem molding. According to industry sources, a few packaging plants have purchased steam sterilizers, though their usage is thought to have a limited effect on molding and pests.Furthermore, the industry continues to battle a label shortage which affects harvesting and packaging. Traceability reporting has irritated many as qualifying for traceability records means exporters have to submit three years of data for review by COA officials.In addition to the administrative problems and the labor challenges of affixing such information to each pineapple, the COA requires pineapples to pass drug residue and sugar content levels before export. Fruit failing to achieve a Brix sweetness level of 14 is prohibited from export, and won't qualify for production or packaging subsidies.With all of these challenges ahead, Taiwanese pineapple growers are facing an uneasy road, potentially requiring some help and support from domestic consumers willing to purchase the fruit, which can take 18 months to grow but can spoil quickly within a week.",2023/02/19,2354,Food Safety & Health
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815124,Taiwan police help stranded Indonesian female hiker find place to stay overnight,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Police recently helped an Indonesian female solo climber stranded on a mountain highway in central Taiwan find a place to stay overnight.A female climber from Indonesia recently went to climb the Hehuan North Peak in the Hehuan Mountain area, CNA reported Tuesday (Feb. 14). After she reached the summit and came down to the trailhead, it was almost 5 p.m., and the last minibus operated by Nantou Bus and all taxis on the mountain had left, so she walked toward Wuling along the mountain highway.Police officer Peter Lai (賴彼得) of the Hehuan Police Station was driving back to the station when he drove by the hiker walking by herself along Provincial Highway 14A at dusk, according to CNA.The hiker seemed a bit shy to ask Lin for help at first, according to the report. However, Lai saw from the rearview mirror that the woman turned her head to watch the patrol car drive past. The officer turned back and asked the hiker if she needed help, the report said.The hiker removed her shayla and identified herself as “Xianni” (仙妮) from Indonesia. She said in Mandarin that she was heading to Taichung Station, but there seemed to be no buses available.At first, the officer drove her to Wuling, trying to find tourists to give her a ride to Qingjing to catch a bus down the mountain. However, when he arrived at the Wuling parking lot, no one was there, according to the report.So, Lai drove her to the Cuei Fong Police Station of the Nantou County Police Bureau for help. There Xianni expressed her wish to find a place to stay overnight and then catch a bus down the mountain the next day. Lai and Cuei Fong Police Station Chief Chang Sheng-hua (張勝華) helped her find a bed and breakfast in Qingjing.After two officers dropped her off at the bed and breakfast, Xianni thanked them repeatedly for getting her to safety.",2023/02/19,1826,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815165,Syrian state media: Israeli airstrikes kill 5 in Damascus,"BEIRUT (AP) — Israeli airstrikes targeted residential areas in Syria's capital Damascus early Sunday, killing at least five people and wounding 15, Syrian state news reported.

            The strikes come amid a wider shadow war between Israel and its archenemy Iran, a close ally of Syria's President Bashar Assad in the country's ongoing war.

            Loud explosions were heard over a central area of Damascus around 12:30 a.m. local time. 











            Syrian state media agency SANA reported that air defenses were “confronting hostile targets in the sky around Damascus.” Citing a military source, it reported that five people had been killed, among them a soldier, and 15 civilians wounded.

            The news agency also said that the strikes destroyed several residential buildings and damaged areas connected to Damascus' famous medieval citadel and an applied arts institute housed there.

            The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, reported that 15 people, including a woman, were killed in strikes targeting sites connected with Iranian militias and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. The group said the strikes hit sites in the capital's Kafr Sousa neighborhood, including an Iranian school there, and outlying areas of the city.

            There was no immediate statement from Israel on the attack. A spokesperson for the Israeli military declined to comment.

            Samer Abdo, an engineer living on an upscale residential street in Kafr Sousa that was struck by missiles, was picking through shattered glass and broken wood in his apartment Sunday morning. Abdo told The Associated Press that his family had woken up in terror to the building shaking.

            “We thought at first that it was an earthquake like the one that happened two weeks ago,” he said.

            Mohamad Dulo, another resident of the neighborhood, said, “All the windows fell into the street, and people ran down to the streets as well."" 

            Dulo said he did not understand why the area was targeted. “It's a residential area,” he said. “There is nothing (military) here.”

            Director General of Antiquities and Museums Mohamad Awad told the AP that the damaged buildings around the Damascus Citadel were arts and heritage institutes, as well as the offices for managing the historical site.

            “It will cost a lot to rebuild or restore some of the buildings that were destroyed in the attack,” Awad said, adding that the strike destroyed “rare and expensive” equipment and machinery that has been hard to obtain due to sanctions and the country’s economic crisis.

            An official with an Iran-backed group denied media reports that the strike on Kafr Sousa targeted Iranian or Palestinian officials.

            The strike hit a parking garage under a building and killed 10 civilians and troops all of them Syrians, he said. He denied that there had been any Iranians or Hezbollah members killed.

            The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

            An official with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an Iran-backed militant group, warned Israel in a statement Sunday that there would be “a decisive response without delay to any assassination attempt (on) the leaders of the resistance,” and in particular its senior official Akram “Abu Mohamad” Ajouri, whose home in Damascus has previously been targeted by airstrikes.

            Israeli airstrikes frequently target sites in the vicinity of Damascus, but it is rare for them to target residential areas in the city. The Saturday night strikes were the first since a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6. 

            Syria’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, coming “at a time when Syria was healing its wounds, burying its martyrs, and receiving condolences, sympathy, and international humanitarian support in the face of the devastating earthquake.” It called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn it.

            Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency Sunday said no Iranian nationals were harmed in Israel’s strike on Damascus. It said one of the rockets hit the same place where former Hezbollah commander Imad Moghnieh was killed in 2008.

            The last reported attack on Damascus was on Jan. 2, when the Syrian army reported that Israel’s military fired missiles toward the capital's international airport, putting it out of service and killing two soldiers.

            The attack came amid Israeli fears that the Damascus airport was being used to funnel Iranian weaponry into the country.

            Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, but rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.

            Israel has acknowledged, however, that it targets bases of Iran-allied militant groups, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support President Assad’s forces.

            While he did not directly mention the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel would continue to defend itself from what it sees as Iran’s aggression.

            “We will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and we will not allow it to entrench itself along our northern borders. We are doing everything and we will do everything to protect our citizens and we respond with intensity to the attacks against us,” he said.

It said one of the rockets hit the same place where former Hezbollah commander Imad Moghnieh was killed in 2008.The last reported attack on Damascus was on Jan. 2, when the Syrian army reported that Israel’s military fired missiles toward the capital's international airport, putting it out of service and killing two soldiers.The attack came amid Israeli fears that the Damascus airport was being used to funnel Iranian weaponry into the country.Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on targets inside government-controlled parts of Syria in recent years, but rarely acknowledges or discusses the operations.Israel has acknowledged, however, that it targets bases of Iran-allied militant groups, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has sent thousands of fighters to support President Assad’s forces.While he did not directly mention the strikes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel would continue to defend itself from what it sees as Iran’s aggression.“We will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and we will not allow it to entrench itself along our northern borders. We are doing everything and we will do everything to protect our citizens and we respond with intensity to the attacks against us,” he said.___Associated Press journalists Abdelrahman Shaheen in Damascus, Tia Goldenberg in Jerusalem and Bassem Mroue in Beirut contributed to this report.",2023/02/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815166,Ginnis’ skiing silver is Greece’s 1st big winter sport medal,"COURCHEVEL, France (AP) — AJ Ginnis’ long journey to skiing glory began on the relatively obscure slopes of Mount Parnassus north of Athens, took him briefly to the Austrian Alps as a teenager, then over to Vermont and eventually a spot on the U.S. ski team.

            Six knee surgeries later — three ACLs, one MCL plus operations to repair “a bunch of meniscus and cartilage damage” — Ginnis is now a member of the Greek team and his second-place finish in slalom at the Alpine skiing world championships on Sunday earned Greece its first major medal in a Winter Olympic sport.

            “You put Greece on the map,” Johan Eliasch, president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, told Ginnis before placing the silver medal around the skier's neck at the awards ceremony to conclude the final event at worlds.











            When the U.S. ski team disbanded its men's slalom team in 2018 as Ginnis struggled with his injuries, the skier was inspired by Greek tennis players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari to start competing for his birth nation.

            “They opened a door into a new sport,"" Ginnis said. ""So whether it’s skiing or the next sport that starts taking off in Greece, I just hope (my medal) acts as an inspiration.”

            Ginnis stood second after the opening run and held his position through deep ruts that constantly threatened to knock him off course to finish 0.20 seconds behind Norwegian winner Henrik Kristoffersen.

            Ginnis already became the first skier from Greece on a World Cup podium when he finished second in the last slalom before worlds.

            “It’s just a dream, the last two weeks. History for Greece, best moment in my career,” Ginnis said. “I can’t believe it. I don’t know what happened. During the (second) run I thought it was not enough and I just gave everything in the last gates.”

            After the first run, Ginnis said he had no pressure.

            “I ski for Greece, so I ski free,” he said, adding with a laugh that he prayed to “all 12” Greek gods before the race.

            Kristoffersen posted the fastest-second run time and improved from 16th position after the opening run. Alex Vinatzer finished 0.38 behind to take bronze and earn the Italian men their first medal at these worlds.

            First-run leader Manuel Feller of Austria dropped to seventh.

            Ginnis was born in Greece and learned to ski at Mount Parnassus, a 2 ½-hour drive from Athens. At 12 he moved to Austria with his father, a ski instructor who ran a ski shop near the Parnassos Ski Center, then on to the United States and competed for the U.S. at the 2017 worlds.

            He's now coached by two friends, Sandy Vietz and Gaby Coulet, who roomed together at the University of Vermont.

            “He went to chase his dream for Greece after so many injuries and he never let go,” Coulet said. “He's a role model of perseverance and also sportsmanship.”

            Ginnis doesn't blame the U.S. team for letting him go.

            “All credit to them. They did develop me. I think for me it was like a will of wanting to ski for my home country because I did grow up there and then for them, I was a really injured athlete,” said Ginnis, who now competes with braces on both knees under his racing suit.

            “So I don’t blame them at all for cutting the team when they did. It sure made things harder for me. But, hey, I’m here ... so I’m not complaining.”

            American skier Luke Winters, one of Ginnis’ former teammates, was impressed.

            “He’s always had the speed. It’s good to see him consistently put it in there,” Winters said. “It’s just how the sport goes. All of a sudden, you figure it out and some people can go right to the top.”

            Kristoffersen earned his econd world title after winning gold in giant slalom four years ago. He became the 10th man to win both world titles in the tech disciplines.

            “That’s a prestigious list to be on,” Kristoffersen said.

            Kristoffersen switched his equipment supplier in the offseason, joining the ski brand founded by his former rival and record-eight time overall champion Marcel Hirscher, who retired in 2019.

            With Feller losing his first-run lead, Austria was left without a gold medal for the first time in 36 years at worlds — since Crans Montana in 1987 — ahead of hosting the next worlds in Saalbach-Hinterglemm in 2025.

            Lucas Braathen shared second position with Ginnis after the opening run but dropped to seventh in a tie with Feller.

            Braathen, who leads the season-long World Cup slalom standings, competed less than three weeks after he underwent surgery for appendicitis.

            Olympic champion Clement Noel missed the podium by three-hundredths in fourth place, and defending champion Sebastian Foss-Solevaag of Norway finished 19th.

            Switzerland led the final medals table with three golds and seven medals in total, ahead of Norway with two golds and nine medals overall.

            The U.S. team also had two gold medals, from the team event and from Mikaela Shiffrin's giant slalom victory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815180,Sean Penn's 'Superpower': The 'idiot's guide' to Ukraine,"Three months before the invasion, Sean Penn and his film production team were already in Ukraine, preparing a documentary that would profile Volodymyr Zelenskyy's atypical career trajectory from actor-comedian-producer to president.But that story took an unexpected turn when Russia invaded Ukraine, leading the still relatively inexperienced politician to become a wartime leader.The ensuing documentary, ""Superpower,"" co-directed by Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufmann, premiered on Friday at the Berlinale.The premiere came a day after Penn's appearance on stage at the film festival's opening ceremony, where he introduced a live video address by the Ukrainian president.Volodymyr Zelenskyy gained fame as an actor, starring in, among other projects, the satirical TV series ""Servant of the People."" In the sitcom, he portrays a history teacher who is unexpectedly elected Ukraine's president after a video of him making a crude rant against governmental corruption goes viral.Penn's documentary takes its title from a scene of ""Servant of the People"": While putting his son to bed, the fictional president explains that his new position is hard work, because there are a lot of people who want to harm the country. ""Do you have a superpower?"" asks the kid. ""Of course,"" the father replies. ""You. And I'll fight the bad guys.""Similarly, in an inaugural speech in 2019, Zelenskyy quotes his then 6-year-old son. The boy's first reaction following his father's election was to ask, ""So I'm the president now too?"" The question prompted Zelenskyy to realize that his child was actually right: ""Everyone of us is president,"" he stated in his speech, emphasizing his will to get the people involved in building a more democratic country.""Superpower"" offers a good introduction to how the comedic superstar, as a Russian-speaking Jew, did not fit into Putin's propaganda narrative that Ukraine is filled with neo-Nazis who want to deprive the ethnic Russian population of their rights. That didn't stop the Kremlin from branding Zelenskyy as a Nazi, though.The film also shows how the Ukrainians' own perception of Zelenskyy evolved within a few months.In interviews shot in December 2021, different people admit that they didn't vote for him, skeptical of his ties to oligarchs as a powerful TV producer, all while accepting that he was still ""the lesser of all evils."" A Crimea veteran says the president unfortunately ""probably doesn't have the balls"" to face Putin.But Zelenskyy did become the unifying leader of Ukraine, notably by staying in his country to defend it instead of fleeing, famously declining US President Joe Biden's offer to help him leave by stating, ""I need ammunition, not a ride.""A year into the conflict, Russia's continued attacks and the growing number of casualties make it hard to conclusively define the leader's legacy: ""Zelenskyy went beyond expectations, but Russia is not going anywhere,"" as one expert interviewed in the film puts it.But Sean Penn definitely found a figure of hope in Zelenskyy, one he believes should inspire Americans to remember ""that their hardwired sense of freedom shouldn't be taken for granted.""After months of preparation through various interviews with people of all walks of life, as well as with foreign policy experts, journalists, military personnel and politicians such as Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, the film crew finally gets to meet the Ukrainian president himself.Days before the invasion, many experts were skeptical it would actually happen, and Penn was among those who rejected the possibility.Then, of all days, their interview in the presidential palace is scheduled on February 24, 2022 — the day Russia invades Ukraine.Despite the crisis, Zelenskyy still manages to find a short slot for Penn and his team in his secret bunker.Penn left the interview visibly convinced of Zelenskyy's superpower: ""I believe with everything in my heart that this is a man of love, of intelligence and courage,"" the actor tells a grassroots Russian journalist shortly afterwards. ""And I still believe that leading with love is proving itself to be the most powerful weapon on Earth.""""We made a unapologetically biased film, because that is the truth we found,"" Sean Penn said at a Berlinale press conference on Saturday, following the premiere of his film. The actor is among the most high-profile advocates of providing precision weapons to Ukraine. ""We live in an odd time where this is the most significant humanitarian intervention that can be made,"" he added.Those expecting a behind-the-scenes portrait of the Ukrainian leader in the command center will be disappointed by the documentary.Apart from two sit-down interviews — the second one held in a garden in June 2022 — and a Zoom call with an exhausted Zelenskyy a month into the war, the film rather follows Sean Penn on his journey to understand Ukraine's recent history and the current developments, including the impact of the 2014 Euromaidan Revolution that ousted the pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych, and which was followed by Russia's invasion of Crimea.The Vice production includes many cigarette-and-vodka-filled scenes, with Penn traveling to Ukraine several times for the documentary, and also shows the actor's advocacy work to boost US support for Ukraine's defense efforts.For anyone who has been following the war over the past year, the film does not provide much new insight into the current events. As director Aaron Kaufman pointed out at the press conference, the production team entered the project with a ""very shallow United States view"" of Ukraine, and their film essentially aims to get people ""to a base level of understanding,"" or as Penn described it, it's ""the idiot's guide"" to the conflict.In a world where disinformation, clickbait distractions and Fox News commentators do not fill this information gap, it is easy to forget that such works remain crucial.",2023/02/18,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815181,Olesen cruises to four-shot Thailand Open victory,"CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark claimed his seventh European tour title with a four-shot victory in the Thailand Classic at the Amata Spring Country Club on Sunday.

            Starting the final round two shots ahead of countryman Nicolai Hojgaard and Yannik Paul of Germany, the Dane never let anyone threaten him as he cruised through the last 18 holes with an error-free 66 to win on 24-under 264, four ahead of the German.

            After two spectacular birdies on the 13th and 14th, Olesen never looked back. 











            “I had some good chances to make birdies but I didn’t capitalize on them. Then it was a bonus to make birdies on two tough holes. It made me feel a little more comfortable. I felt steady and felt in control,” said the 33-year-old Olesen who had three birdies on the front nine and three more on the back. 

            The win marked his first title in Asia and is his first since the British Masters in May 2022.

            “It’s very special... It’s been a long time since I last won on a tour,” said Olsen, who will return to the world top 100 next week. 

            One-time European tour winner Paul finished with five birdies and one bogey to sign off with a 68 and a total 20-under 268 in second.

            Alexander Knappe of Germany, with a dazzling performance on the back nine where he managed seven birdies, finished with a 67 for 270 to finish joint-third along with Dutchman Joost Luiten (69).

Also in Dec., the second-highest number was recorded for trains traveling in the direction from Nanjing Fuxing Station to Taipei Zoo Station during the evening peak hours, averaging 12,000 riders per hour.In order to increase the passenger throughput, the service frequencies in parts of the morning and evening peak hours will be shortened by 10 to 30 seconds and 10 to 20 seconds, respectively.In addition to shortening time between trains, Taipei Metro completed refitting for BT370 cars in January by removing some seats and baggage racks. Taipei Metro estimated that the two measures will increase capacity by about 1,000 passengers per hour during peak hours, TRTC added.(TRTC photo)",2023/02/19,2589,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815212,Biden’s test: Sustaining unity as Ukraine war enters Year 2,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One year ago, President Joe Biden was bracing for the worst as Russia massed troops in preparation to invade Ukraine. 

            As many in the West and even in Ukraine doubted Russian President Vladimir Putin's intentions, the White House was adamant: War was coming and Kyiv was woefully outgunned.

            In Washington, Biden's aides prepared contingency plans and even drafts of what the president would say should Ukraine's capital quickly fall to Russian forces — a scenario deemed likely by most U.S. officials. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was offered help getting out of his country if he wanted it.











            Yet as Russia's invasion reaches the one-year mark, the city stands and Ukraine has beaten even its own expectations, buoyed by a U.S.-led alliance that has agreed to equip Ukrainian forces with tanks, advanced air defense systems, and more, while keeping the Kyiv government afloat with tens of billions of dollars in direct assistance. 

            For Biden, Ukraine was an unexpected crisis, but one that fits squarely into his larger foreign policy outlook that the United States and like-minded allies are in the midst of a generational conflict to demonstrate that liberal democracies such as the U.S. can out-deliver autocracies. 

            In the estimation of the White House, the war transformed what had been Biden's rhetorical warnings — a staple of his 2020 campaign speeches — into an urgent call to action.

            Now, as Biden prepares for a major address in Poland tied to the war's first anniversary, he faces a legacy-defining moment. 

            “President Biden’s task is to make the case for sustained free world support for Ukraine,” said Daniel Fried, a U.S. ambassador to Poland during the Clinton administration and now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council. “This is an important trip. And really, Biden can define the role of the free world in turning back tyranny.""

            The president elevated his trip to Europe by first stopping in Ukraine on Monday for an unannounced visit to meet with Zelenskyy and underscore the U.S. commitment to the Ukrainian cause. “I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said of his decision to visit Kyiv.

            Biden administration officials are quick to direct primary credit for Ukraine's staying power to the courage of its armed forces, with a supporting role to the Russian military’s ineptitude. But they also believe that without their early warnings and the massive support they orchestrated, Ukraine would have been all but wiped off the map by now. 

            Sustaining Ukraine's fight, while keeping the war from escalating into a potentially catastrophic wider conflict with NATO, will go down as one of Biden's enduring foreign policy accomplishments, they argue.

            In Poland, Biden is set to meet allies to reassure them of the U.S. commitment to the region and to helping Ukraine “as long as it takes.” It's a pledge that is met with skepticism both at home and abroad as the invasion enters its second year, and as Putin shows no signs of retreating from an invasion that has left more than 100,000 of his own forces killed or wounded, along with tens of thousands of Ukrainian service members and civilians — and millions of refugees.

            Biden's job now is, in part, to convince Americans — and a worldwide audience — that it's more important than ever to stay in the fight, while cautioning that an endgame is unlikely to come quickly.

            His visit to Poland is an opportunity to make the case to ""countries that repudiate archaic notions of imperial conquest and wars of aggression about the need to continue to support Ukraine and oppose Russia,” said John Sullivan, who stepped down as the U.S. ambassador to Moscow in September and is now a partner at the global law firm Mayer Brown. “We always preach, we are seeking to protect a rules-based international order. It’s completely done if Russia gets away with this.”

            The U.S. resolve to stand up to Russia is also being tested by domestic concerns and economic uncertainty. 

            Forty-eight percent of the U.S. public say they favor the U.S. providing weapons to Ukraine, with 29% opposed and 22% saying they’re neither in favor nor opposed, according to a poll published this past week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It's evidence of slipping support since May 2022, less than three months into the war, when 60% of U.S. adults said they were in favor of sending Ukraine weapons. 

            Further, Americans are about evenly divided on sending government funds directly to Ukraine, with 37% in favor and 38% opposed, with 23% saying neither, according to the AP-NORC poll. 

            This month, 11 House Republicans introduced what they called the “Ukraine fatigue” resolution urging Biden to end military and financial aid to Ukraine, while pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to a peace agreement. Meanwhile, the more traditionalist national security wing of the GOP, including just-announced 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley, a former U.N. envoy, has critiqued the pace of U.S. assistance, pressing for the quicker transfer of more advanced weaponry.

            “Don’t look at Twitter, look at people in power,"" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told the Munich Security Conference on Friday. “We are committed to helping Ukraine.”

            But Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said he wants the president and his administration to impress on allies the need to share the burden as Americans grow weary of current levels of U.S. spending to assist Ukraine and Baltic allies.

            Sullivan said he hears from Alaskans, ""Hey, senator, why are we spending all this? And how come the Europeans aren’t?” 

            The U.S. has provided more economic and military aid than any country since the start of the war, but European nations and other allies have collectively committed tens of billions of dollars to back Ukraine and have taken in millions of refugees fleeing the conflict. 

            From the beginning of his administration, Biden has argued the world is at a crucial moment pitting autocracies against democracies. 

            The argument was originally framed with China in mind as America's greatest economic and military adversary, and with Biden looking to reorient U.S. foreign policy toward the Pacific. The pivot toward Asia is an effort that each of his recent predecessors tried and failed to complete as war and foreign policy crises elsewhere shifted their attention.

            With that goal, Biden sought to quickly end the U.S. military's presence in Afghanistan seven months into his term. The end to America's longest war was darkened by a chaotic withdrawal as 13 U.S. troops and 169 Afghan civilians looking to flee the country were killed by a bombing near Kabul's international airport carried out by the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate. 

            U.S. officials say the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan has given the administration the bandwidth and resources to focus on assisting Ukraine in the first land war in Europe since World War II while putting increased focus on countering China's assertive actions in the Indo-Pacific.

            While the war in Ukraine caused large price increases in energy and food markets -– exacerbating rampant and persistent inflation — Biden aides saw domestic benefits to the president. The war, they argued, allowed Biden to showcase his ability to work across the aisle to maintain funding for Ukraine and showcase his leadership on the global stage.

            However the months ahead unfold, it's almost certain to be messy.

            While Biden last year had to walk back a public call for regime change in Russia that he had delivered off the cuff from Poland just weeks after the war began, U.S. officials increasingly see internal discontent and domestic pressures on Putin as key to ending the conflict.

             “So how does it end?"" Undersecretary of State Victoria Nuland asked at an event this past week in Washington. ""It ends with a safe, viable Ukraine. It ends with Putin limping back off the battlefield. I hope it ends eventually with a Russian citizenry, who also says, ‘That was a bad deal for us and we want a better future.’”

            When Biden hosted Zelenskyy in Washington in December, the U.S. president encouraged him to pursue a “just peace” — a framing that the Ukrainian leader chafed against.

            “For me as a president, ‘just peace’ is no compromises,"" Zelenskyy said. He said the war would end once Ukraine’s sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity were restored, and Russia had paid back Ukraine for all the damage inflicted by its forces.

            “There can’t be any ‘just peace’ in the war that was imposed on us,” he added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815213,Supreme Court weighs liability shield for internet giants,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Islamic State gunmen killed American college student Nohemi Gonzalez as she sat with friends in a Paris bistro in 2015, one of several attacks on a Friday night in the French capital that left 130 people dead.

            Her family's lawsuit claiming YouTube's recommendations helped the Islamic State group's recruitment is at the center of a closely watched Supreme Court case being argued Tuesday about how broadly a law written in 1996 shields tech companies from liability. The law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, is credited with helping create today’s internet.

            A related case, set for arguments Wednesday, involves a terrorist attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2017 that killed 39 people and prompted a suit against Twitter, Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube.











            The tech industry is facing criticism from the left for not doing enough to remove harmful content from the internet and from the right for censoring conservative speech. Now, the high court is poised to take its first hard look at online legal protections.

            A win for Gonzalez's family could wreak havoc on the internet, say Google and its many allies. Yelp, Reddit, Microsoft, Craigslist, Twitter and Facebook are among the companies warning that searches for jobs, restaurants and merchandise could be restricted if those social media platforms had to worry about being sued over the recommendations they provide and their users want.

            “Section 230 underpins a lot of aspects of the open internet,” said Neal Mohan, who was just named senior vice president and head of YouTube. 

            Gonzalez's family, partially backed by the Biden administration, argues that lower courts' industry-friendly interpretation of the law has made it too difficult to hold Big Tech companies accountable. Freed from the prospect of being sued, companies have no incentive to act responsibly, critics say.

            They are urging the court to say that companies can be sued in some instances.

            Beatriz Gonzalez, Nohemi's mother, said she barely uses the internet, but hopes the case results in it becoming harder for extremist groups to access social media.

            ""I don’t know much about social media or these ISIS organizations. I don’t know nothing about politics. But what I know is that my daughter is not going to vanish just like that,” Gonzalez said in an interview with The Associated Press from her home in Roswell, New Mexico.

            Her daughter was a 23-year-old senior at California State University, Long Beach, who was spending a semester in Paris studying industrial design. Her last communication with her mother was a mundane exchange about money via Facebook, two days before the attacks, Gonzalez said. 

            The legal arguments have nothing to do with what happened in Paris. Instead, they turn on the reading of a law that was enacted “at the dawn of the dot-com era,” as Justice Clarence Thomas, a critic of broad legal immunity, wrote in 2020.

            When the law was passed, 5 million people used AOL, then a leading online service provider, Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, recalled at a recent conference at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. Facebook has 3 billion users today, Wheeler said. 

            The law was drafted in response to a state court decision that held an internet company could be liable for a post by one of its users in an online forum. The law's basic purpose was “to protect Internet platforms’ ability to publish and present user-generated content in real time, and to encourage them to screen and remove illegal or offensive content,” its authors, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and former Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., wrote in a Supreme Court filing.

            Groups supporting the Gonzalez family say companies have not done nearly enough to control content in the areas of child sexual abuse, revenge porn and terrorism, especially in curbing computer algorithms' recommendation of that content to users. They also say that courts have read the law too broadly.

            “Congress never could have anticipated when it passed Section 230 that the internet would develop in the ways it has and that it would be used by terrorists in the ways it has,” said Mary McCord, a former Justice Department official who authored a brief on behalf of former national security officials.

            Mohan said YouTube is able to keep people from seeing almost anything that violates the company's rules, including violent, extremist content. Just 1 video in 1,000 makes it past the company's screeners, he said.

            Recommendations have emerged as the focus of the Supreme Court case. Google and its supporters argue that even a narrow ruling for the family would have far-reaching effects. 

            “Recommendation algorithms are what make it possible to find the needles in humanity’s largest haystack,” Kent Walker and Google’s other lawyers wrote in their main brief to the Supreme Court.

            “If we undo Section 230, that would break a lot of the internet tools,” Walker said in an interview. 

            Some sites might take down a lot of legitimate content in a display of excessive caution. Emerging forces and marginalized communities are most likely to suffer from such a heavy hand, said Daphne Keller of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, who joined with the American Civil Liberties Union in support of Google.

            The justices' own views on the issue are largely unknown, except for Thomas'.

            He suggested in 2020 that limiting the companies' immunity would not devastate them.

            “Paring back the sweeping immunity courts have read into Section 230 would not necessarily render defendants liable for online misconduct. It simply would give plaintiffs a chance to raise their claims in the first place. Plaintiffs still must prove the merits of their cases, and some claims will undoubtedly fail,” Thomas wrote.

            The Gonzalez family alleges that YouTube aided and abetted IS by recommending the group's videos to viewers most likely to be interested in them, in violation of the federal Anti-Terrorism Act.

            But nothing in the suit links the attackers who killed Gonzalez to videos on YouTube, and the lack of a connection could make it hard to prove the company did anything wrong.

            If the justices would avoid the hard questions posed by the case, they could focus on Wednesday's arguments involving the attack in Istanbul. The only issue is whether the suit can go forward under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

            A ruling for the companies in that case, where the allegations are very similar to those made by the Gonzalez family, would end the lawsuit over the Paris attacks, too.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815215,Nigeria's presidential frontrunners in final push for votes,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leading contenders in Nigeria’s presidential election have made their last push for support, a week before the West African nation's key election.

            As the campaign period neared its end, both the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition's Atiku Abubakar on Saturday held rallies in the northeast, where extremists have waged a decade-long insurgency against Nigeria. They both promised to improve the lives of residents in the region.

            On social media, third-party candidate Peter Obi, who has emerged ahead of the other 17 candidates in most polls, said Africa’s most populous country needs a “reset and reboot"" from the two major parties that have governed Nigeria since it left military rule in 1999.











            The Feb. 25 election that would lead to a transitional government is the most consequential vote in many years for Nigeria, a country of more than 210 million people, according to analysts. 

            “This is a battle for the soul of the country considering the challenges confronting the country,” said Idayat Hassan, who leads the Center for Democracy and Development that promotes democracy in the country.

            Nigeria is struggling with a worsening security crisis that has killed thousands in the past year, an ailing economy that has made citizens poorer, and growing separatist agitations in the southern region that have left the country more divided along ethnic lines.

            “This is where the future of our state and the country resides — in the hands of PDP,” the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party's Abubakar told thousands of supporters in Adamawa state as they waved the party’s red, green and white colours.

            “If you give us your mandate, we promise to lead by our promises to make sure that we have a united country, a peaceful country, a buoyant economy for our country; that we have the best education for our children and also we devolve powers to our states and local governments with corresponding resources,” said the 76-year-old, who has taken part in two previous presidential elections, including in 2019 when he lost to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.

            In Borno state, the epicenter of the 12-year-long extremism that has upended lives and livelihoods for millions, causing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, Tinubu, of the ruling All Progressives Congress, or APC, told multitudes of supporters that “renewed hope is here; success is back. We will take care of all of you.”

            The former governor of Lagos — Nigeria’s economic hub and largest city — promised to replicate what he did when he led that state from 1999 to 2007. 

            “We are promising you the people of Borno, you have faced difficulties and challenges (but) that is over now,” said the 71-year-old as he addressed supporters waving brooms — the party’s symbol.

            “I can guarantee one thing: ""We will revive the economy, we will develop Nigeria,” Tinubu said.

            The Labour Party’s Obi — who has grown from an underdog in the early days of the campaign to become the favorite in most polls — is appealing in particular to Nigeria’s young, a large percentage of the country's 93.4 million registered voters.

            “In this march to freedom, I have not come out for myself! I have come out for the millions of youths that are losing hope in our beloved country!” Obi tweeted.

            In a backlash against the two most popular parties, the 61-year-old said Nigeria is not bereft of good governance ideas and plans but is “bedeviled by the impunity"" of a small number of people benefiting from the country’s resources at the expense of the masses.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The leading contenders in Nigeria’s presidential election have made their last push for support, a week before the West African nation's key election.As the campaign period neared its end, both the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu and the main opposition's Atiku Abubakar on Saturday held rallies in the northeast, where extremists have waged a decade-long insurgency against Nigeria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815216,Indonesian police to deport mafia fugitive back to Italy,"DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian police said Sunday they will escort back to Italy an Italian-Australian fugitive who was arrested on Indonesia’s tourist island of Bali after seven years on the run in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime. 

            Antonio Strangio, 32, appeared on Interpol's “red notice” list when he was stopped and detained in Bali on Feb. 3 after arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

            Bali police spokesperson Satake Bayu Setianto cited safety reasons in refusing to say when Strangio will be deported to Italy, where he's wanted on charges of trafficking 160 kilograms (352 pounds) of marijuana. The suspect was shown to reporters at an airport news conference given by the police and was escorted to the departure hall on Sunday afternoon. 











            Strangio is allegedly connected to the ’ndrangheta mafia, considered by Italian prosecutors to be the most important criminal organization in the Western world. 

            ""For the ’ndrangheta itself, there are special operations between European countries, and all of its members are red notice subjects who must be held accountable for trials in their respective countries,” Anggaito Hadi Prabowo, an official from the Indonesian national police international relations division, told reporters.DENPASAR, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesian police said Sunday they will escort back to Italy an Italian-Australian fugitive who was arrested on Indonesia’s tourist island of Bali after seven years on the run in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime.Antonio Strangio, 32, appeared on Interpol's “red notice” list when he was stopped and detained in Bali on Feb. 3 after arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.Bali police spokesperson Satake Bayu Setianto cited safety reasons in refusing to say when Strangio will be deported to Italy, where he's wanted on charges of trafficking 160 kilograms (352 pounds) of marijuana.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815224,Abortion among major issues at stake in Wisconsin court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A conservative tilt on the Wisconsin Supreme Court has given Republicans victories on voting restrictions, gerrymandered legislative districts and other high-stakes cases in recent years.

            Voters now have a chance to tip that balance toward the left, with implications for abortion rights and perhaps the outcome of the 2024 presidential election in one of the nation's most closely divided political battlegrounds.

            Tuesday's primary will feature two conservatives and two liberals running for the seat of a retiring conservative justice. The top two finishers advancing to the April 4 general election.











            The eventual winner will determine whether conservatives maintain the majority on the officially nonpartisan court or it flips to 4-3 liberal control for at least the next two years. The court came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and both major parties are preparing for another close margin in the 2024 contest.

            “For a lot of Americans, this is the moment that they can catch their breath after all the intensity of 2022,” said Ben Wikler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “But in Wisconsin, this race is at least as important as all the battles of the last two years.”

            The Supreme Court election campaign could break national spending records if a conservative and a liberal make it through the primary, with issues such as abortion, the fate of legislative maps, union rights and challenges to election results at stake.

            Four of the past six presidential races in Wisconsin have been decided by less than a percentage point, including Donald Trump’s victory in 2016 and Biden’s win in 2020. In 2024, Democrats will try to reelect Sen. Tammy Baldwin and chip into Republican’s hold on six of the state’s eight congressional seats.

            “The alarm has been sounded,” Wikler said. “National Democrats, elected officials and civic engagement groups can all see plainly that this race is the key to the future of not just democracy in Wisconsin, but American democracy writ large.”

            In addition to the court ruling on any challenges to the 2024 election results, Republicans said laws they enacted when they had full control of state government are in jeopardy. That includes a 2011 law signed by then-Gov. Scott Walker that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public employees, as well as GOP-drawn legislative districts, a voter ID law, a ban on absentee ballot drop boxes and a host of other measures.

            “Rarely is there a race like this that has so much potential to overturn so many key issues and decisions in the past,"" said Brandon Scholz, who ran two campaigns for the conservative justice whose retirement set up the race and is a former Wisconsin Republican Party executive director.

            The court is likely to determine whether the state’s law that bans nearly all abortions — enacted in 1849, a year after statehood — remains in effect and whether Democrats get a chance to undo political maps drawn by Republicans, who have increased the number of state legislative seats they hold to a near supermajority. A voting rights attorney already has pledged to file a lawsuit the day after the new justice takes office if a liberal wins.

            The contest is the latest example of how officially nonpartisan court races have grown into political battles as major legal fights play out at the state level.

            Unlike in many other states, including neighboring Michigan, voters in Wisconsin don't have the ability to place initiatives on the ballot to overturn laws or make their own. Their only options are making changes through the Legislature, which has been under Republican control since 2011, or the courts.

            Recent state Supreme Court elections in other states show the impact that a flip in majority control can have.

            
                In North Carolina, the new Republican majority earlier this month agreed to rehear redistricting and voter identification cases less than two months after the court’s previous edition, led by Democrats, issued major opinions against the GOP-controlled Legislature.

            The conservatives running in Wisconsin for the seat of retiring Justice Patience Roggensack are former Supreme Court Justice Dan Kelly and Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow. The liberals are Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz and Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell.

            While the race is nonpartisan and Wisconsin voters don't register by party, each of the candidates has staked out clear conservative or liberal-leaning positions on some of the top issues.

            Protasiewicz has called the GOP-drawn legislative maps “rigged” and has made her support for abortion rights the focus of her television ads, the first to air in the race. The Wisconsin Republican Party has filed an ethics complaint against her, arguing that Protasiewicz has prejudged cases that could come before her. Her backers dismiss the action as a campaign stunt.

            Mitchell, who would be the first Black justice elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, also has said the current legislative maps are not fair and expressed his belief that women have the right to an abortion.

            Both conservative candidates are supported by anti-abortion groups in the state.

            Wisconsin’s 19th century law banning abortion went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. The state’s Democratic attorney general, with support from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, is suing to overturn it. The case is expected to reach the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

            Dorow became nationally known after presiding over the trial of Darrell Brooks Jr., who was convicted by a jury of killing six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in 2021.

            
                Her first TV ad showed footage from the Waukesha parade killings as she made her case as a tough-on-crime candidate. Kelly was appointed to the court in 2016 but lost in 2020 when Democratic turnout was high for the presidential primary.

            Dorow has been active in local Republican Party politics. Kelly was endorsed by Trump during his unsuccessful run two years ago and did work for both the state and national Republican parties the past two years, including advising on the scheme in Wisconsin to have fake electors cast ballots for Trump. Both Dorow and Kelly have been speaking to GOP groups across the state during the primary campaign.

            Spending on the race is expected to soar after Tuesday's primary and eventually could exceed the most ever spent on a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin — $10 million in 2020, according to the Brennan Center for Justice The most ever spent on a state Supreme Court election is $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004, according to the center.

            A week before Tuesday's primary, about $3.5 million had been spent on ads supporting the left-leaning candidates while $3.4 million had been spent backing the conservatives, according to AdImpact Politics, which tracks advertising. Protasiewicz has raised nearly $1.9 million since she got into the race last year, which is about $500,000 more than the campaigns of the other three candidates combined.

            That level of spending creates “all sorts of problems” for the perception of the court, said Matt Rothschild, director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks spending in state elections.

            “It totally defies our ideal of having independent, nonbiased judiciary,"" he said.MADISON, Wis.

Kelly was endorsed by Trump during his unsuccessful run two years ago and did work for both the state and national Republican parties the past two years, including advising on the scheme in Wisconsin to have fake electors cast ballots for Trump. Both Dorow and Kelly have been speaking to GOP groups across the state during the primary campaign.Spending on the race is expected to soar after Tuesday's primary and eventually could exceed the most ever spent on a Supreme Court race in Wisconsin — $10 million in 2020, according to the Brennan Center for Justice The most ever spent on a state Supreme Court election is $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004, according to the center.A week before Tuesday's primary, about $3.5 million had been spent on ads supporting the left-leaning candidates while $3.4 million had been spent backing the conservatives, according to AdImpact Politics, which tracks advertising. Protasiewicz has raised nearly $1.9 million since she got into the race last year, which is about $500,000 more than the campaigns of the other three candidates combined.That level of spending creates “all sorts of problems” for the perception of the court, said Matt Rothschild, director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks spending in state elections.“It totally defies our ideal of having independent, nonbiased judiciary,"" he said.",2023/02/19,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815225,Vinícius again the target of insults in Spanish league match,"MADRID (AP) — The insults against Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior have continued in Spain, with the Brazil forward again being targeted by opposing fans in a Spanish league match.

            The insults started during the moment of silence before Madrid’s 2-0 win at Osasuna on Saturday, and continued with fans chanting, “Die, Vinícius” later in the game.

            “The insults continue, but so does the dancing,” Vinícius said on Twitter after the victory. 











            Returning from a one-game suspension, Vinícius led Madrid’s attack and set up the late goal by Federico Valverde that put Madrid on its way to a win on the road.

            The 22-year-old Vinícius, who is Black, has been the target of hate insults since arriving to play in Spain in 2018. Several racist attacks have been made against him during matches, and his effigy was hanged by the neck off a bridge before a derby against city rival Atletico Madrid last month.

            “It’s lamentable,” Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said. “There’s no place for this nonsense. We have to stop looking at Vinícius, we have to start looking at the fans. It’s a shame, because you see kids with their parents and they are showing him the finger.”

            Madrid's veteran Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti said the foul language directed at Vinícius during the moment of silence in honor of earthquake victims was “a disrespect toward Tukey and Syria.”

            A 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit those countries on Feb. 6, killing more than 44,000 people. 

            There has been little punishment for hate attacks against soccer players in Spain, though recently Valladolid suspended 12 season ticket holders while investigating their alleged use of verbal abuse against Vinícius. Spanish media said Sunday that the Mallorca fan who called the Brazilian “a monkey” in another match has been identified by authorities.

            The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815226,Michigan State set to resume classes after fatal shootings,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State University professor Marco Díaz-Muñoz is still haunted by what he witnessed last Monday night, when a gunman entered his classroom in Berkey Hall, killing two of his students in what he describes as “12 minutes of terror.”

            “Those images haunt me. The images of those two girls,” Díaz-Muñoz told The Associated Press.

            Arielle Anderson and Alexandria Verner, both juniors, would die that night, Feb. 13. The gunman would shoot six more students during the rampage in two campus buildings. Brian Fraser also would die. Five others would suffer critical gunshot wounds.











            Classes are resuming Monday at the 50,000-student university, though Berkey Hall, an academic building, will not reopen. Officials said Sunday that swiftly resuming classes makes sense for the 2 1/2-month balance of the spring term. 

            “Coming back together is something that will help us,” said Thomas Jeitschko, executive vice president for academic affairs, adding that faculty will have extensive flexibility in how they run their courses. 

            “We know that everybody heals at their own pace and in their own manner. Getting it exactly right will not be possible,” Jeitschko said at a news conference Sunday. “Coming back into spaces that are familiar, interacting with people who are familiar, is helpful in the process of healing and grieving.”

            Díaz-Muñoz said the university had offered to have another professor teach through the end of the semester. 

            “On one hand, I want to forget it all. But then on the other hand, I think I need to help my students pick up the pieces,"" Díaz-Muñoz said. “I think I need to help my students build a sense of meaning. It’s not going to be the same as before, but there has to be something good out of it.""

            Some in the community, however, aren't ready. The editorial board of The State News, the student newspaper, wrote Thursday that they wouldn't immediately attend classes, saying more time was needed to heal.

            Jo Kovach, president of student government, said “students are scared” and will need “flexibility, empathy and options” from their professors.

            Following the shooting, parents arrived from all over the state to bring students home, at least for the rest of last week. A petition demanding hybrid or online options for students received more than 20,000 signatures by Saturday.

            Jeitschko said students will have weeks to decide whether to take a regular grade or a credit/no credit option, which would not affect their overall grade-point average.

            “Let the semester play out. Come back. Try to heal,” he said.

            Díaz-Muñoz understands that some students won’t be ready to return, saying that some will still have “the fear of looking over their shoulder and looking out the window, at the doors.”

            “There are some kids in my class that are graduating this semester. And they need this horrific nightmare to have a better ending than the way it ended on Monday,” Díaz-Muñoz said.

            Sparrow Hospital said three wounded students remained in critical condition Sunday while one was upgraded to fair and another was listed in serious but stable condition. Interim university President Teresa Woodruff said Michigan State would cover funeral costs and hospital expenses. 

            Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023. In 2022, there were more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

            The shots broke out at Michigan State on Monday during evening classes at Berkey Hall and nearby at the MSU Union, a social hub where students can study, eat and relax. Students across the vast campus were ordered to shelter in place for four hours — “run, hide, fight” if necessary — while police hunted for Anthony McRae, 43, who eventually killed himself when confronted by police not far from his home in Lansing. 

            Police said McRae's mental health could have been a factor, based on a note found on him. He was the lone shooter and had no connection to the victims or to Michigan State as a student or employee, they said. 

            Díaz-Muñoz describes hearing “explosions” outside his class before a masked man appeared in the doorway of Room 114 and opened fire. Students hid behind desks and chairs before breaking windows to escape. 

            After “one to two minutes"" of shooting, the gunman turned around and left, leaving behind “destruction and death in my classroom,” said Díaz-Muñoz. 

            For Díaz-Muñoz, the terror didn’t end as abruptly. The carnage in his classroom was “something you saw in a movie,” he said.

            Díaz-Muñoz says he has taken prescription medication as a way to force himself to sleep, only emerging from his room “for a bowl of soup.”

            The assistant professor said that he is sharing his story in hopes of bringing about gun reform. 

            “If the lawmakers and the senators saw what I saw, instead of hearing in the news one more statistic. If they had seen those girls and the pools of blood that I saw, the horror we lived, they would be shamed into action,"" Díaz-Muñoz said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815227,Tunisia orders top European trade union official expelled,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — President Kais Saied of Tunisia ordered Europe's top trade union official to leave the North African country after she addressed protesters at a demonstration organized by an influential labor union. 

            Authorities accused Esther Lynch, the Irish general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, of making statements that “interfered with Tunisian internal affairs” during a Saturday protest against Saied in the port city of Sfax. 

            Tunisia's General Labor Union, or UGTT, organized the demonstration to protest a crackdown on the increasingly authoritarian president's political opponents and his critics in the media, judiciary, business community and trade unions. 











            In an address to the protesters, Lynch demanded the release of union leader Anis Kaabi, who was arrested by security forces last month. 

            She called on the Tunisian government to negotiate with the UGTT leadership and to improve the economy, which has teetered on the brink of bankruptcy amid political instability that deepened after a parliamentary election last month in which only 11% of voters cast ballots. 

            “By orders of the president, Tunisian authorities ordered Esther Lynch to leave the country within 24 hours, following statements made during the UGTT-led demonstration that interfered with Tunisian internal affairs,” said a statement by the Tunisian presidency that was posted on Twitter late Saturday. 

            The European Trade Union Confederation (or the ETUC confirmed that Lynch left Tunisia on Sunday. 

            The treatment of Lynch by the Tunisian authorities “is in line with the campaign of intimidation and harassment being waged against trade unions by President Kais Saied,” including “arrests, sacking of union officials (and) malicious lawsuits,"" the ETUC said in a statement. 

            “These tactics are part of a campaign by President Saied to break the union's resistance to policies which are making ordinary people pay for the country's economic, social and constitutional crisis,” the statement said. 

            Saied won the presidency in a 2019 landslide on a promise to improve the country's economy. Instead, the president appears determined to upend the country's political system, threatening a democracy once seen as a model for the Arab world and sending the economy toward a tailspin. 

            In December, the International Monetary Fund froze an agreement on a $1.9 billion loan for Tunisia. The deeply indebted government needs the funds to pay UGTT-represented public sector salaries and to fill budget gaps aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout from Russia's war in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815228,"Key developments in the aftermath of the Turkey, Syria quake","ISTANBUL (AP) — As the search and rescue effort for buried survivors of the Feb. 6 earthquake started to wind down in Turkey, demolition teams have moved in to clear the mounds of rubble left by the worst disaster in modern Turkish history. 

            Here’s a look at the key developments Sunday from the aftermath of the earthquake.

            DEATH TOLL IN TURKEY RISES SLIGHTLY











            The number of confirmed deaths in Turkey due to the earthquake rose to 41,020 as of Sunday night, according to the national disaster agency AFAD. 

            Yunus Sezer, the agency's chairperson, told journalists in Ankara earlier in the day that search and rescue work in nine of the 11 provinces listed as an earthquake disaster area had ended. Rescue operation were ongoing in Kahramanmaras, the site of the epicenter, and Hatay, one of the hardest-hit provinces. 

            “We continue these efforts every day with the hope of reaching a living brother or sister,” Sezer said.

            While rescue operations continue in the two provinces, there were no signs of anyone being dug alive from the rubble since three members of one family — a mother, father and 12-year-old boy — were extracted from a collapsed building in Hatay on Saturday morning. The boy later died.

            The new figure takes the combined death toll in Turkey and Syria to 44,708. The U.N. has said the full scope of the deaths in Syria may take time to determine. 

            HATAY MAYOR SAYS 21,000 DIED IN PROVINCE

            The mayor of Hatay says his province suffered around 21,000 deaths in the earthquake, more than half of the total number of the confirmed fatalities in Turkey.

            “At least 80% of the buildings must be demolished in Antakya,” Lutfu Savas told broadcaster HaberTurk. Antakya is the capital of Hatay and the site of the ancient city of Antioch.

            Savas added that there were 24,000 injured people across the province, which lies between Syria and the Mediterranean Sea.

            MORE THAN 6,000 AFTERSHOCKS

            Turkey’s disaster management said some 6,040 aftershocks hit the 11 provinces that form the disaster zone declared by the government in the days following the initial quake.

            The initial quake was measured with a magnitude of 7.8, and was followed nine hours later by a 7,5 magnitude tremor.

            Orhan Tatar, general manager of the agency, AFAD, said 40 aftershocks were of a 5 to 6 magnitude, while one was recorded at 6.6. 

            “It is extremely important to stay away from damaged buildings and not enter them,” he told a televised news briefing in Ankara.

            He also warned of “secondary disasters” such as landslides and rockfalls.

            INSPECTIONS FIND OVER 100,000 BADLY DAMAGED BUILDINGS

            Some 105,794 buildings checked by Turkey's Environment and Urbanization Ministry are either destroyed or so badly damaged as to require demolition, the ministry said Sunday. 

            Of these, 20,662 had collapsed, the statement said. The damaged or destroyed buildings contained more than 384,500 units, mostly residential apartments.

            The figures were for Turkey and did not cover collapsed and damaged buildings in neighboring Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815229,Drama of McCarthy's election may open House to more cameras,"NEW YORK (AP) — The difference between a government-controlled camera that followed a climactic moment in Rep. Kevin McCarthy's election as House speaker and one operated by a C-SPAN journalist was like a fuzzy black-and-white picture contrasted with sparkling, clear color.

            In one, McCarthy strides up an aisle in the House chamber and disappears from view. A few people in the front turn to see where he's going. After a minute, and some audible gasps, everyone stands to watch what the camera doesn't show.

            C-SPAN captured the entire scene, including the exasperated McCarthy's tense, finger-pointing conversation with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and a GOP colleague held back from lunging at Gaetz.











            Some in Congress and C-SPAN are seizing on that moment to ask that the House floor be more fully open to cameras in the interest of transparency. There's been tangible movement in that direction.

            McCarthy, as House speaker, has the final word. His office has signaled that changes are being considered. Already, government cameras have broadened their views.

            “I'm guardedly optimistic that the speaker would consider independent media coverage, if not permanently, at least on request,” said Ben O'Connell, C-SPAN director of editorial operations. “We had a lot of positive feedback from both sides of the aisle.”

            There's been little change in how the public has seen House sessions since cameras were first brought in almost 44 years ago, according to Susan Swain, C-SPAN's co-CEO. For the most part, the podium and lawmakers who come to the front to speak are shown, but little else. There are exceptions when other cameras are allowed, such as when a joint session of Congress is convened for the State of the Union.

            The quirk that increased visibility that week in January was that, technically, at the time there was no speaker. Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., consented to three C-SPAN cameras, O'Connell said.

            “We want to make it as accessible as possible, and I think cameras do that,” said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who has 25 co-sponsors for a resolution supporting C-SPAN’s bid.

            Beyond the McCarthy drama, cameras offered other insights such as when polar political opposites Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., had a conversation.

            All of Pocan's co-sponsors are Democrats, which give them little sway with McCarthy, R-Calif. But there's been some GOP support for the concept, including from Gaetz. 

            Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, was quoted by CNN as saying, “What the American people were able to see unfold on the floor was a good thing for our democracy and our republic.”

            Given how the speaker's vote played out in public, it wouldn't surprise Pocan if McCarthy had little interest in more closely watched proceedings. But that hasn't necessarily been the case.

            McCarthy's office didn’t necessarily mind how things looked during the vote and is open to greater access on certain occasions.

            “We are exploring a number of options to open up the People’s House to ensure a more transparent and accessible Congress for the American people,” said Mark Bednar, a McCarthy spokesman.

            The Senate has similar rules, but has gotten less attention because of the McCarthy vote.

            Without fanfare, the government-controlled cameras have been offering some different views in recent weeks, observers said. There are eight cameras installed, up from six four years ago.

            What's uncertain is whether C-SPAN will get what it prefers: its own cameras, installed in the gallery overlooking the House floor, controlled robotically by journalists and available by pool to all news organizations.

            McCarthy's office is likely to move with caution, said Brendan Buck, who worked for then-Speakers John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and is now a partner at the communications firm Seven Letter.

            “Once you give something, it’s hard to take it back,” he said. “They have to make sure they are comfortable giving the access, knowing that it may be forever.""

            Buck said he believed that some rank-and-file members of Congress would be more resistant than leadership. With Washington increasingly segregated by party, the House floor is one of the few places members have to get to know colleagues they might not normally spend time with, he said.

            “They don't want every conversation they have to have eyes and ears on it,” Buck said. That may not be a good reason to restrict cameras, but it may actually serve democracy, he said.

            More cameras might also promote performing rather than legislating, a point Pocan conceded.

            “But, honestly, people who are going to cause disruption are going to do it regardless,” he said. Pocan doesn't want cameras kept away for the wrong reasons, like the risk a representative could be caught dozing on the job.

            Every time that a new speaker has been elected in the 22 years that O'Connell has been at C-SPAN, the company's top executive dutifully writes to request access to the chamber by journalists with video cameras, he said.

            This year, he said, “I didn't think we were going to do anything because it felt like we were shouting at a wall.”

            Yet the speaker's vote, where C-SPAN's video was used widely by other television networks and on social media, led Swain to try again.

            The Radio and Television Correspondents Association, which represents broadcast outlets that cover Congress, supports C-SPAN's request. The group's chairman, Jared Halpren, said he appreciates the willingness of McCarthy's office to explore alternatives.

            If changes are made, they would be tied directly to the night McCarthy was elected.

            “It was a perfect crystallization of the argument for allowing independent media in the chamber on a more regular basis,” O'Connell said.

            AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.NEW YORK (AP) — The difference between a government-controlled camera that followed a climactic moment in Rep. Kevin McCarthy's election as House speaker and one operated by a C-SPAN journalist was like a fuzzy black-and-white picture contrasted with sparkling, clear color.In one, McCarthy strides up an aisle in the House chamber and disappears from view. A few people in the front turn to see where he's going. After a minute, and some audible gasps, everyone stands to watch what the camera doesn't show.C-SPAN captured the entire scene, including the exasperated McCarthy's tense, finger-pointing conversation with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and a GOP colleague held back from lunging at Gaetz.Some in Congress and C-SPAN are seizing on that moment to ask that the House floor be more fully open to cameras in the interest of transparency. There's been tangible movement in that direction.McCarthy, as House speaker, has the final word. His office has signaled that changes are being considered. Already, government cameras have broadened their views.“I'm guardedly optimistic that the speaker would consider independent media coverage, if not permanently, at least on request,” said Ben O'Connell, C-SPAN director of editorial operations. “We had a lot of positive feedback from both sides of the aisle.”There's been little change in how the public has seen House sessions since cameras were first brought in almost 44 years ago, according to Susan Swain, C-SPAN's co-CEO. For the most part, the podium and lawmakers who come to the front to speak are shown, but little else. There are exceptions when other cameras are allowed, such as when a joint session of Congress is convened for the State of the Union.The quirk that increased visibility that week in January was that, technically, at the time there was no speaker. Outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., consented to three C-SPAN cameras, O'Connell said.“We want to make it as accessible as possible, and I think cameras do that,” said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who has 25 co-sponsors for a resolution supporting C-SPAN’s bid.Beyond the McCarthy drama, cameras offered other insights such as when polar political opposites Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., had a conversation.All of Pocan's co-sponsors are Democrats, which give them little sway with McCarthy, R-Calif.

            Neymar picked up the injury at the start of the second half after the Brazil forward scored PSG's second goal before the interval. 

            PSG led 2-1 when Neymar was injured following contact with Lille's Benjamin Andre.











            PSG has been struggling since the start of the year, with stars Neymar and Lionel Messi underperforming. Neymar has been on the end of sharp criticism for a perceived lack of commitment after French media reported that he attended a poker tournament and dined at a fast-food restaurant a day after PSG lost to Bayern Munich 1-0 at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League round of 16.

            Neymar, who damaged the same ankle at the World Cup in Qatar, gave PSG a 2-0 lead at the end of a fast-developing collective move he also started, slotting the ball into an empty net from Vitinha's assist.

            It's unclear whether Neymar will be able to play next Sunday against Marseille in French soccer's biggest match.

            “He sprained his right ankle. He is undergoing tests to know the extent,"" PSG coach Christophe Galtier said.

            PSG lost another key player against Lille, with Nuno Mendes going off near the half-hour mark. Mendes, who played on the left side of PSG's backline against Lille, was substituted after colliding with winger Jonathan Bamba. Galtier said Mendes' injury does not look to be serious.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815241,"'All Quiet' wins 7 BAFTAs, including best film, at UK awards","LONDON (AP) — Antiwar German movie “All Quiet on the Western Front” won seven prizes, including best picture, at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, building the somber drama’s momentum as awards season rolls toward its climax at next month’s Oscars.

            Irish tragicomedy “The Banshees of Inisherin” and rock biopic “Elvis” took four prizes each.

            “All Quiet,” a visceral depiction of life and death in the World War I trenches based on Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel, won Edward Berger the best director award. Its other trophies included adapted screenplay, cinematography, best score, best sound and best film not in English.











            Austin Butler was a surprise best actor winner for “Elvis.” Baz Lurhmann’s flamboyant musical also won trophies for casting, costume design and hair and makeup. Cate Blanchett won the best actress prize for orchestral drama “Tár.""

            Martin McDonagh’s “Banshees,” the bleakly comic story of a friendship gone sour, was named best British film.

            “Best what award?” joked McDonagh of the film, which was shot in Ireland with a largely Irish cast and crew. It has British funding, and McDonagh was born in Britain to Irish parents.

            “Banshees” also won for McDonagh’s original screenplay, and awards for Kerry Condon as best supporting actress and Barry Keoghan for best supporting actor.

            The prizes — officially the EE BAFTA Film Awards — are Britain’s equivalent of Hollywood’s Academy Awards and will be watched closely for hints of who may win at the Oscars on March 12.

            Madcap metaverse romp “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” the Academy Awards front-runner, was the night’s big loser, winning just one prize from its 10 BAFTA nominations, for editing.

            Actor Richard E. Grant was a suave and self-deprecating host — with support from TV presenter Alison Hammond — for the ceremony at London’s Royal Festival Hall, where the U.K’s movie academy heralded its strides to become more diverse but said there was more to be done. 

            Grant joked in his opening monologue about the infamous altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock at last year’s Oscars.

            “Nobody on my watch gets slapped tonight,” he said. “Except on the back.”

            Guests and presenters walking the red carpet on the south bank of the River Thames included Colin Farrell, Ana de Armas, Eddie Redmayne, Brian Cox, Florence Pugh, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cynthia Erivo, Julianne Moore and Lily James.

            Heir to the throne Prince William, who is president of Britain’s film and television academy, was in the audience alongside his wife, Kate. William wore a tuxedo with black velvet jacket, while Kate dressed in a floor-length Alexander McQueen dress that she also wore to the 2019 BAFTAs.

            Helen Mirren paid tribute to William’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September. Mirren, who portrayed the late monarch onscreen in “The Queen” and onstage in “The Audience,” called Elizabeth “the nation’s leading lady.”

            Britain’s film academy introduced changes to increase the awards’ diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.

            This year there were 11 female directors up for awards across all categories, including documentary and animated films. But just one of the main best-director nominees was female: Gina Prince-Bythewood for “The Woman King.”

            BAFTA chair Krishnendu Majumdar said the academy's soul-searching had been “a necessary and humbling process.” He said the “vital work of levelling the playing field” would continue.

            “West Side Story” star Ariana DeBose opened the show by performing “Sisters are Doin’ it for Themselves,” with an added rap shoutout to some of the nominated women, including Blanchett, Michelle Yeoh and Viola Davis.

            Blanchett said it had been “an extraordinary year for female performers. To be counted among them is really special.”

            It was a strong year for Irish actors at the BAFTAs, with Deryl McCormack up for the BAFTA Rising Star award — though he lost out to Emma Mackey – and Condon, Keoghan, Farrell and Brendan Gleeson all getting acting nominations for “Banshees.”

            McCormack hailed the event as “the Irish BAFTAs.”

            “It is a small country, but to see the talent that comes out of it is quite amazing,” he said. 

            Writer-director Charlotte Wells won the prize for best British debut for the affecting father-daughter drama “Aftersun.” Three-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell became the first costume designer to be awarded the academy’s top honor, the BAFTA fellowship.

            The harsh world outside showbiz intruded on the awards when Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who works for investigative website Bellingcat, said he was now allowed to attend the awards because of a risk to public security. He features in “Navalny,” a film about jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny that won the best documentary BAFTA.

            “Navalny” producer Odessa Rae dedicated the award to Grozev, “our Bulgarian nerd with a laptop, who could not be with us tonight because his life is under threat by the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.”

            Jamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for “Everything Everywhere,” said the chance awards season provides to celebrate cinema was more important than who wins.

            “It’s a moment of celebration in the midst of everything,” Curtis told The Associated Press on the red carpet. “It’s hard out there. Everywhere. All at once. All the time.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815256,Health care vaccine mandate remains as some push for an end,"LOWRY CITY, Mo. (AP) — At Truman Lake Manor in rural Missouri, every day begins the same way for every employee entering the nursing home's doors — with a swab up the nose, a swirl of testing solution and a brief wait to see whether a thin red line appears indicating a positive COVID-19 case. 

            Only the healthy are allowed in to care for virus-free residents. 

            Despite those precautions, a coronavirus outbreak swept through the facility late last year. An inspector subsequently cited it for violating the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination requirement for health care facilities. 











            Truman Lake Manor is one of about 750 nursing homes and 110 hospitals nationwide written up for violating federal staff vaccination rules during the past year, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Most were given a bureaucratic nudge to do better — though some nursing homes also received fines, especially when they had multiple other problems.

            One year after it began being enforced nationwide on Feb. 20, 2022, the vaccination requirement affecting an estimated 10 million health care workers is the last remaining major mandate from President Joe Biden's sweeping attempt to boost national vaccination rates. Similar requirements for large employers, military members and federal contractors all have been struck down, repealed or partially blocked. 

            The health care vaccination mandate is scheduled to run until November 2024. But some contend it’s time to stop now, citing fewer severe COVID-19 cases, health care staffing shortages and the impending May 11 expiration of a national public health emergency that has been in place since January 2020. 

            “Their regulations are making it harder to give care – not easier,"" said Tim Corbin, the administrator of Truman Lake Manor who also doubles as a nurse, adding that ""the mandates need to end.” 

            CMS said in a statement to the AP that “the requirement for staff to be fully vaccinated has been a critical step in responding to the pandemic” and “has saved Americans from countless infections, hospitalizations, and death.”

            The policy requires workers, contractors and volunteers at facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid payments to have the full primary dosage of an original COVID-19 vaccine, with exemptions for medical or religious reasons. Though nursing homes can be fined for violations, CMS generally gave violating facilities additional time to update their policies and come into compliance. 

            The Republican-led U.S. House recently passed legislation that would halt the mandate, but the bill is unlikely to pass in the Democratic-led Senate.

            Meanwhile, the requirement continues with mixed results and — in some cases — widespread exceptions.

            When a state inspector visited Truman Lake Manor in December, a coronavirus outbreak had infected 26 of the 60 residents and about a quarter of the staff within the previous few weeks. Corbin said the outbreak originated from an unvaccinated employee with a religious exemption who tested negative for COVID-19 before working a shift and wore a mask. The employee didn't feel well and tested positive after arriving home. 

            The inspector found that more than 40% of staff had been granted religious exemptions from getting vaccinated. But the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services does not scrutinize the rationale for such exemptions. The reason the facility was cited for a vaccination deficiency was because three employees had failed to receive their second dose of the vaccine and had no exemption on record. After the citation, they each got the second shot, and regulators OK'd the corrections in January. 

            It's hard to find workers willing to be vaccinated, Corbin said, because many local residents remain opposed to the vaccine or doubt its effectiveness. Just 42% of adults in St. Clair County are vaccinated against COVID-19 — a rate barely half the national average. 

            Workforce shortages are causing more than half of nursing homes nationally to limit resident admissions, according to the American Health Care Association, which represents long-term care facilities. Though most other health care sectors have rebounded, nursing home employment was down 13% in 2022 comparedto pre-pandemic levels and reached lows not seen since the 1990s.

            LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit nursing homes and other aging service providers, originally supported the mandate and still encourages vaccinations. But it now says a federal requirement no longer is needed. 

            Though deaths are down significantly from their peak in January 2021, older adults and people with underlying health problems remain more susceptible to serious cases of COVID-19. Because of that, some medical professionals believe the vaccine mandate should continue at nursing homes and hospitals. 

            “This is an important requirement,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “Not only does it protect the health care worker themself, but it also protects the patients.”

            Nationwide, about 5% of the over 15,000 nursing homes caring for Medicare or Medicaid patients have been cited for violating the COVID-19 vaccination requirement, and about 2% of the 4,900 hospitals, according to the AP's analysis. But those citations haven't been evenly spread among states and occurred less often during the latter half of 2022.

            Twenty-four states cited no hospitals for COVID-19 vaccination violations.

            Texas, which has the most nursing homes nationally participating in Medicare or Medicaid, had just one nursing home cited for violating the vaccination rule. 

            Kansas, Florida and Texas each declined to check for vaccination violations, instead leaving that process to CMS, which hired contractors. As a result, CMS said Texas was docked more than $2.5 million in federal funding, Florida more than $1.2 million and Kansas nearly $350,000. 

            Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who faced reelection in a Republican-leaning state, said last year that the vaccine mandate conflicted with state law and could worsen workforce shortages.

            Nationally, the number of nursing homes cited for vaccination violations declined noticeably after CMS last June stopped requiring state inspectors to check for compliance when responding to complaints about unrelated allegations, such as neglect of patients. CMS cited substantial compliance with the vaccination requirement while making the change.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815257,Atalanta push for top 4 falters with surprise loss to Lecce,"MILAN (AP) — Atalanta’s push for the top four in Serie A was dented on Sunday by a surprise 2-1 loss at home to Lecce as the race for the Champions League qualifying places intensified.

            Assan Ceesay and Alexis Blin netted in each half for Lecce, which moved 10 points clear of the relegation zone with the win. Rasmus Højlund pulled one back for Atalanta three minutes from time.

            Atalanta slipped to sixth after Roma beat relegation-threatened Hellas Verona 1-0 and Lazio won 2-0 at struggling Salernitana. 











            Roma moved above fourth-place AC Milan on goal difference. Head-to-head is the first tiebreaker at the end of the season. Lazio was two points outside the top four, with Atalanta a point further back.

            Atalanta had been hoping to move level with Milan, ahead of their match next week.

            But it got off to the worst possible start as Ceesay drove a low shot into the bottom left corner from more than 30 yards out to give Lecce the lead in the fourth minute.

            Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini was furious with his players in the first half but the home team improved after the break.

            Ademola Lookman thought he had leveled almost immediately after the restart but it was ruled out for offside.

            Instead, Lecce doubled its lead in the 74th minute when a corner was taken short and the ball whipped in by Gabriel Strefezza for a completely unmarked Blin to head home.

            Lecce gifted Atalanta a way back into the match when goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone hesitated on a clearance allowing Højlund to close and deflect the ball into the net.

            That set up a nervy finale but Falcone atoned for his error by pushing Luis Muriel’s ferocious strike over the bar in stoppage time.

            SUPER IMMOBILE

            Ciro Immobile appears to be returning to form just in time for Lazio.

            Immobile scored two goals in nine second-half minutes to spoil Paulo Sousa’s first match in charge of Salernitana.

            They were Immobile’s first Serie A goals in more than a month and halted Lazio’s three-match winless run. He had scored in the Europa Conference League win over Cluj midweek.

            Lazio broke the deadlock on the hour mark as Adam Marušić romped down the right flank and put in a low cross for Immobile to tap in at the back post.

            Immobile won and converted a penalty nine minutes later after being clattered into by Salernitana goalkeeper Luigi Sepe.

            Luis Alberto had another penalty saved by Sepe in the final minute.

            Salernitana defender Dylan Bronn had given away that penalty and he was booked for dissent but then immediately shown a red card as he continued to protest.

            Salernitana remained four points above the drop zone.

            FIRST GOAL

            Ola Solbakken scored his first goal for Roma on his first start for the team

            Solbakken, who joined from Bodø/Glimt, netted on the stroke of halftime after Leonardo Spinazzola backheeled the ball to him to complete a lovely and quick passing move.

            Defender Rick Karsdorp made his first appearance for Roma since falling out with coach José Mourinho three months ago.

            It was only Verona's second defeat in its past eight matches and left it two points behind 17th-place Spezia and safety.

            TIGHT DEFENSE

            Juventus moved into the final European qualifying spot with a 2-0 win at Spezia.

            Clinical finishes from Moise Kean and Ángel Di María in each half handed Juventus its third straight league win without conceding a goal.

            Also, Fiorentina snatched a 1-1 draw at home to Empoli.

Lazio was two points outside the top four, with Atalanta a point further back.Atalanta had been hoping to move level with Milan, ahead of their match next week.But it got off to the worst possible start as Ceesay drove a low shot into the bottom left corner from more than 30 yards out to give Lecce the lead in the fourth minute.Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini was furious with his players in the first half but the home team improved after the break.Ademola Lookman thought he had leveled almost immediately after the restart but it was ruled out for offside.Instead, Lecce doubled its lead in the 74th minute when a corner was taken short and the ball whipped in by Gabriel Strefezza for a completely unmarked Blin to head home.Lecce gifted Atalanta a way back into the match when goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone hesitated on a clearance allowing Højlund to close and deflect the ball into the net.That set up a nervy finale but Falcone atoned for his error by pushing Luis Muriel’s ferocious strike over the bar in stoppage time.SUPER IMMOBILECiro Immobile appears to be returning to form just in time for Lazio.Immobile scored two goals in nine second-half minutes to spoil Paulo Sousa’s first match in charge of Salernitana.They were Immobile’s first Serie A goals in more than a month and halted Lazio’s three-match winless run. He had scored in the Europa Conference League win over Cluj midweek.Lazio broke the deadlock on the hour mark as Adam Marušić romped down the right flank and put in a low cross for Immobile to tap in at the back post.Immobile won and converted a penalty nine minutes later after being clattered into by Salernitana goalkeeper Luigi Sepe.Luis Alberto had another penalty saved by Sepe in the final minute.Salernitana defender Dylan Bronn had given away that penalty and he was booked for dissent but then immediately shown a red card as he continued to protest.Salernitana remained four points above the drop zone.FIRST GOALOla Solbakken scored his first goal for Roma on his first start for the teamSolbakken, who joined from Bodø/Glimt, netted on the stroke of halftime after Leonardo Spinazzola backheeled the ball to him to complete a lovely and quick passing move.Defender Rick Karsdorp made his first appearance for Roma since falling out with coach José Mourinho three months ago.It was only Verona's second defeat in its past eight matches and left it two points behind 17th-place Spezia and safety.TIGHT DEFENSEJuventus moved into the final European qualifying spot with a 2-0 win at Spezia.Clinical finishes from Moise Kean and Ángel Di María in each half handed Juventus its third straight league win without conceding a goal.Also, Fiorentina snatched a 1-1 draw at home to Empoli.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815259,Estonian leader: Russia must be held accountable after war,"Munich (AP) — Estonia’s prime minister on Sunday insisted that once the war in Ukraine ends, Russia must be brought to justice for war crimes as well as for the decision to invade its neighbor if it is to have any chance of developing a normal relationship with the West.

            Kaja Kallas, whose small Baltic country is the biggest per-capita contributor of military aid to Ukraine, told The Associated Press that the conflict cannot end with a peace deal that carves up the country and doesn’t hold Moscow to account.

            “I don’t think there can be any relations as usual with a pariah state that hasn’t really given up the imperialistic goals,” she said on the sidelines of a major security conference in Munich. “If we don’t learn this lesson and don’t prosecute the crimes of aggression, the war crimes will just continue.”











            She spoke the day after Vice President Kamala Harris said the United States has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine and needs to be held accountable. “Justice must be served,” Harris said in her speech to the conference.

            The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, dismissed the U.S. announcement “as an attempt to demonize Russia.”

            Kallas noted that while Nazi crimes were prosecuted in the Nuremberg trials following World War II, no tribunal was set up following the Cold War to prosecute crimes by the Soviet Union, including mass deportations of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians during the five-decade-long Soviet occupation.

            This time, Russia’s leadership has to be held responsible. “There has to be accountability (before) we can talk about our relations with Russia,” she said.

            Asked about China’s calls for peace talks and suggestions that Western countries are prolonging the war by arming Ukraine, Kallas said that while everyone wants peace, a deal that cedes Ukrainian territory to Russia would signal to the world that “aggression pays off.” 

            Russia's invasion must come at a ""higher price, so that all the aggressors or would-be aggressors in the world would make the calculation that it doesn’t pay off,” Kallas said.

            Kallas, 45, leads Estonia's center-right Reform Party and has been prime minister since 2021. Not everyone supports her line on Ukraine. Ahead of parliamentary elections in two weeks, opposition leader Martin Helme of the far right Conservative People's Party has called for a more cautious approach and accused Kallas of emptying Estonia’s own arsenals, leaving the country vulnerable.

            Kallas dismissed that suggestion, saying “we of course have given a lot but we are also thinking about our own defense.”

            Kallas has figured in speculation about potential candidates to replace Jens Stoltenberg as NATO secretary-general when he leaves the post in the fall. She dismissed that as “very unlikely,” but noted that the Baltic countries had not been given any high leadership positions in NATO since they joined in 2005.

            “Some have said it can’t be from countries like the Baltic states because it will provoke Russia,” she said. “First of all, I don’t think our relations with Russia can get any worse than they right now are because he’s waging a war in Ukraine. And the second is that you are actually saying that we give power to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin to decide who cannot be, for example, the secretary-general of NATO.”Munich (AP) — Estonia’s prime minister on Sunday insisted that once the war in Ukraine ends, Russia must be brought to justice for war crimes as well as for the decision to invade its neighbor if it is to have any chance of developing a normal relationship with the West.Kaja Kallas, whose small Baltic country is the biggest per-capita contributor of military aid to Ukraine, told The Associated Press that the conflict cannot end with a peace deal that carves up the country and doesn’t hold Moscow to account.“I don’t think there can be any relations as usual with a pariah state that hasn’t really given up the imperialistic goals,” she said on the sidelines of a major security conference in Munich. “If we don’t learn this lesson and don’t prosecute the crimes of aggression, the war crimes will just continue.”She spoke the day after Vice President Kamala Harris said the United States has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine and needs to be held accountable. “Justice must be served,” Harris said in her speech to the conference.The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, dismissed the U.S. announcement “as an attempt to demonize Russia.”Kallas noted that while Nazi crimes were prosecuted in the Nuremberg trials following World War II, no tribunal was set up following the Cold War to prosecute crimes by the Soviet Union, including mass deportations of Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians during the five-decade-long Soviet occupation.This time, Russia’s leadership has to be held responsible. “There has to be accountability (before) we can talk about our relations with Russia,” she said.Asked about China’s calls for peace talks and suggestions that Western countries are prolonging the war by arming Ukraine, Kallas said that while everyone wants peace, a deal that cedes Ukrainian territory to Russia would signal to the world that “aggression pays off.”Russia's invasion must come at a ""higher price, so that all the aggressors or would-be aggressors in the world would make the calculation that it doesn’t pay off,” Kallas said.Kallas, 45, leads Estonia's center-right Reform Party and has been prime minister since 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815260,"Karachi finally wins a game in PSL, Multan routs Islamabad","KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Karachi Kings ended their three-match losing streak with a resounding 67-run win over defending champion Lahore Qalandars in the Pakistan Super League on Sunday.

            Multan Sultans earlier routed batting powerhouse Islamabad United by 52 runs for their third successive win at home to take an early lead in Pakistan's premier domestic Twenty20 competition with six points from four games. Six teams are competing.

            Karachi was asked to bat first and finally got its combination right with James Vince (46) and Matthew Wade (36) providing a rollicking start, leading their team to 185-5 against the world’s leading T20 fast bowling pair of Shaheen Shah Afridi (1-39) and Haris Rauf (1-35). 











            Leg-spinner Imran Tahir (0-23) then squeezed Lahore in the middle overs before fast bowlers Akif Javed (4-28) and Ben Cutting (2-12 in one over), playing their first game for Karachi this season, claimed the last four wickets in the space of five balls. Lahore was bowled out for 118 in 17.3 overs.

            Vince and Wade put on a 70-run opening stand off 43 balls against some scratchy Lahore bowling as Afridi started with two successive wide balls. Lahore hit back briefly in the middle overs as Karachi slipped to 124-4 when Zaman Khan clean bowled Vince off a perfect yorker in the 14th over.

            But skipper Imad Wasim (35 not out off 19) provided a late flurry as Karachi, which won only one out of 10 league games in a disappointing last season, added 55 runs in the last five overs.

            At Multan, half centuries by David Miller (52) and captain Mohammad Rizwan (50) formed the cornerstone of Multan’s formidable total of 190-4 after Islamabad skipper Shadab Khan won the toss and chose to field.

            The pace trio of Abbas Afridi (4-22), Ihsanullah (2-19) and Mohammad Ilyas (2-12) was ably supported by some superb catching by Multan players as Islamabad was bowled out for 138 with 13 balls left.

            Afridi claimed the wickets of top-scorer Rassie van der Dussen (49), Faheem Ashraf (4) and Mohammad Wasim (0) in the 17th over that included a splendid catch of Ashraf’s mistimed pull shot off his short-pitched delivery. 

            The tournament’s early leading wicket-taker Ihsanullah wrapped up the game by dismissing Tom Curran and Abrar Ahmed as Islamabad lost the last five wickets for seven runs. 

            Fast bowler Ilyas — drafted into the Multan squad after Pakistan international Shahnawaz Dahani was ruled out from the PSL due to a hand injury in the first game against Lahore Qalandars — bowled brilliantly upfront. He removed openers Paul Stirling and Hassan Nawaz during the batting powerplay.

            Earlier, Miller hit his blistering knock off 25 balls that featured three successive sixes in an over from Shadab (1-42) which went for 24 runs, as Multan kept pushing the scoring rate in the latter half of the innings.

            Rizwan and Rilee Rossouw (36) laid a solid base with a second-wicket stand of 91 runs after Shan Masood (4) yet again fell early for the fourth successive game. 

            Rossouw and Rizwan were out in successive overs before Miller took charge. Rossouw was brilliantly taken in the deep by van der Dussen, who timed his jump to perfection, while Rizwan was trapped leg before wicket by Shadab off a fuller delivery as the Multan skipper misjudged a sweep.

            Kieron Pollard provided a perfect finish with a breezy 32 not out off 21 balls that included three successive boundaries against expensive fast bowler Mohammad Wasim (1-49) in the final over.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815265,"Blinken tours Turkey's earthquake zone, pledges $100M in aid","ISTANBUL (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken took a helicopter tour Sunday of one of the provinces worst-affected by the Feb. 6 earthquake in southern Turkey and northern Syria and pledged a further $100 million in aid to help the region. 

            “This is going to be a long-term effort,” Blinken said at Incirlik Air Base, a joint U.S.-Turkish facility that has coordinated the distribution of disaster aid. “The search and rescue, unfortunately, is coming to an end. The recovery is on, and then there will be a massive rebuilding operation.”

            President Joe Biden announced $85 million for Turkey and Syria days after the earthquake that has killed more than 44,000 people in the two countries. The U.S. has also sent a search and rescue team, medical supplies and equipment.











            The additional aid includes $50 million in emergency refugee and migration funds and $50 million in humanitarian assistance, Blinken said.

            The secretary of state is making his first trip to NATO ally Turkey since he took office two years ago. Blinken arrived at Incirlik Air Base, near Adana, on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

            He toured Turkey’s toured Hatay province from the air with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. He was expected to meet with U.S. and Turkish service personnel, as well as Turkish military families affected by the earthquake.

            “When you see the extent of the damage, the number of buildings, the number of apartments, the number of homes that have been destroyed, it's going to take a massive effort to rebuild,” the top U.S. diplomat said after the helicopter tour. 

            “The most important thing right now is to get assistance to people who need it, to get them through the winter and to get them back on their feet,"" Blinken said as troops nearby unloaded boxes of aid... We’ll stick with it until we get the job done.”

            Incirlik, home to the U.S. Air Force’s 39th Air Base Wing, has been a crucial logistics center for aid distribution. Supplies from around the world have been flown into the base and sent by truck and helicopter to those in need, including in difficult to reach villages.

            Blinken is set to fly to Ankara, Turkey's capital, later Sunday for discussions with Turkish officials on Monday, including an anticipated meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. As well as the effects of the earthquake, Blinken is expected to discuss Sweden and Finland's efforts to join NATO, which Turkey has delayed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815266,UN ocean treaty talks resume with goal to save biodiversity,"United Nations members gather Monday in New York to resume efforts to forge a long-awaited and elusive treaty to safeguard the world's marine biodiversity. 

            Nearly two-thirds of the ocean lies outside national boundaries on the high seas where fragmented and unevenly enforced rules seek to minimize human impacts. 

            The goal of the U.N. meetings, running through March 3, is to produce a unified agreement for the conservation and sustainable use of those vast marine ecosystems. The talks, formally called the Intergovernmental Conference on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction, resume negotiations suspended last fall without agreement on a final treaty. 











            “The ocean is the life support system of our planet,” said Boris Worm, a marine biologist at Canada’s Dalhousie University. “For the longest time, we did not feel we had a large impact on the high seas. But that notion has changed with expansion of deep sea fishing, mining, plastic pollution, climate change,” and other human disturbances, he said.

            The U.N. talks will focus on key questions, including: How should the boundaries of marine protected areas be drawn, and by whom? How should institutions assess the environmental impacts of commercial activities, such as shipping and mining? And who has the power to enforce rules?

            “This is our largest global commons,” said Nichola Clark, an oceans expert who follows the negotiations for the nonpartisan Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C. “We are optimistic that this upcoming round of negotiations will be the one to get a treaty over the finish line.”

            The aim of the talks is not to actually designate marine protected areas, but to establish a mechanism for doing so. “The goal is to set up a new body that would accept submissions for specific marine protected areas,” Clark said.

            Marine biologist Simon Ingram at the University of Plymouth in England says there's an urgent need for an accord. “It’s a really pressing time for this — especially when you have things like deep-sea mining that could be a real threat to biodiversity before we’ve even been able to survey and understand what lives on the ocean floor,” Ingram said.

            Experts say that a global oceans treaty is needed to actually enforce the U.N. Biodiversity Conference's recent pledge to protect 30% of the planet's oceans, as well as its land, for conservation. 

            “We need a legally binding framework that can enable countries to work together to actually achieve these goals they've agreed to,” said Jessica Battle, an expert on oceans governance at World Wide Fund for Nature

            U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Monica Medina said the treaty was a priority for the country. “This agreement seeks to create, for the first time, a coordinated approach to establishing marine protected areas on the high seas,” she said. ""It’s time to finish the job.”

            Officials, environmentalists and representatives of global industries that depend on the sea are also watching negotiations closely.

            Gemma Nelson, a lawyer from Samoa who is currently an Ocean Voices fellow at the University of Edinburgh, said that small Pacific and Caribbean island countries were “especially vulnerable to global ocean issues,” such as pollution and climate change, which generally they did not cause nor have the resources to easily address. 

            “Getting the traditional knowledge of local people and communities recognized as valid” is also essential to protect both ecosystems and the ways of life of Indigenous groups, she said.

            With nearly half the planet's surface covered by high seas, the talks are of great importance, said Gladys Martínez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America. 

            “The treaty should be strong and ambitious, having the authority to establish high and fully protected areas in the high seas,” she said. “Half of the world is at stake these weeks at the United Nations.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815267,Japanese bid farewell to beloved panda returning to China,"TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of Japanese fans, some wiping away tears, bid farewell to a beloved Japanese-born giant panda that made her final public appearance Sunday before flying to her home country, China.

            The panda fans gathered at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo for one last look at Xiang Xiang, the park's idol since her birth in June 2017.

            Sunday's viewing was limited to 2,600 lucky ones who won their tickets in an extremely competitive lottery. But many others who didn't win came anyway to say their goodbyes from outside of the panda house.











            “Xiang Xiang is not only cute but charming and funny. She’s so attractive that if you see her once, you want to see her more. I don’t think there is any panda like her in the universe,” said a visitor who only gave her first name, Yukie. “I’ve made friends here by sharing it, and that is also her attraction.”

            Though she was born and grew up at the Tokyo zoo, Xiang Xiang, whose parents Ri Ri and Shin Shin are on loan from China, must return to that country.

            China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce. The animals are native to southwestern China and are an unofficial national mascot.

            Divided into groups of about 10, the visitors were given only a few minutes to quietly say goodbye to Xiang Xiang as she nonchalantly nibbled on bamboo sticks. Viewers held up their mobile phones and cameras to capture her every move. 

            “I wish Japanese-born pandas could stay in Japan,"" said Takamichi Masui, an auto parts maker who traveled from Mie, in central Japan. ""So many people who came today and fans are sad to see her go. When I saw (Xiang Xiang), I got teary. I wish Xiang Xiang could stay, though I understand it’s difficult.” 

            He said he worries if Xiang Xiang can smoothly adapt to her new life in China.

            Natsuki Mizuguchi, a graphic designer, wore a parka, socks and shoes decorated with Xiang Xiang's head photo that she had taken. 

            Mizuguchi said she first saw Xiang Xiang when she was recovering from health issues but has since gotten better. “I wanted to express my appreciation to Xiang Xiang,"" Mizuguchi said. “I'm certain she will be an idol in China too and I hope she serves the friendship between our two countries.”

            Her friend, Akane Hiramoto, a nurse, said she could not win a slot Sunday and her visit Saturday became her last. 

            ""I would love to go see her in China,” Hiramoto said. “I hope Japan and China can deepen friendship through pandas like Xiang Xiang and also environmental issues, for instance.""

            Despite strained political ties between Japan and China, pandas have connected people in both countries and contributed to the friendship, Japanese fans say.

            Xiang Xiang, accompanied by two Ueno Zoo staff, will be flown to China on Tuesday. She'll join other pandas at a facility in Sichuan province, close to the original panda habitat. 

            “I became emotional when I saw may people shedding tears saying goodbye to her,"" said Ueno Zoo spokesperson Naoya Ohashi. 

            But there is one more day before her departure, and, “as zoo keepers, we will fulfill our responsibility and do utmost to safely send her to China,” he said.

            “I hope she will get used to a new environment quickly, find a good partner and have children,” Ohashi said.

            Three other pandas at another park, the Adventure World, in central Japan — elderly male Eimei, sent from China in 1994, and his Japanese-born twin daughters Ouhin and Touhin — will head to China on Wednesday mainly to find suitable partners for the reproductive-age twin pandas. Four female pandas will remain after the handover and the park is seeking a male panda to be sent from China. 

            Pandas, which reproduce rarely in the wild and rely on a diet of bamboo, remain among the world’s most threatened species. An estimated 1,800 pandas live in the wild, while another 500 are in zoos or reserves, mostly in Sichuan.TOKYO (AP) — Thousands of Japanese fans, some wiping away tears, bid farewell to a beloved Japanese-born giant panda that made her final public appearance Sunday before flying to her home country, China.The panda fans gathered at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo for one last look at Xiang Xiang, the park's idol since her birth in June 2017.Sunday's viewing was limited to 2,600 lucky ones who won their tickets in an extremely competitive lottery.

            The two giants of European soccer meet in a repeat of last year's final and the standout match of the round of 16. 

            While Liverpool and Real Madrid share 20 Champions League titles between them, Manchester City continues its quest to win the trophy for the first time and Napoli has emerged as a surprise contender after an outstanding start to the season. 











            LIVERPOOL’S REVENGE MISSION

            Liverpool has the chance to avenge the 1-0 loss to Real in the final in Paris last May and goes into the first leg in much-improved form after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League.

            It has been a season of struggle for a team that was competing for an unprecedented quadruple of trophies last year. So much so that, up until the past week, winning the Champions League looked like its best chance of qualifying for next season's competition. 

            But there have been encouraging signs in those morale-boosting wins that leave Jurgen Klopp's team just six points off the top four and a Champions League-qualifying spot. 

            Real is aiming to be crowned champion of Europe for a record extending 15th time and is fresh from winning the Club World Cup earlier this month. 

            But it faces a fight to hold onto its Spanish league title, with Barcelona leading the way at the top of the standings. 

            MAN CITY'S YEAR?

            The Champions League is the one major trophy City has failed to win since being taken over by Abu Dhabi's ruling family in 2008. 

            While the arrival of Erling Haaland last summer looked like a potential game-changer in Europe, question marks hang over Pep Guardiola's team in the Premier League. 

            A 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest on Saturday saw Arsenal overtake City at the top of the table and highlighted vulnerabilities that have been evident for much of the season. 

            But City has looked strong in the Champions League, cruising through the group stages and is the overwhelming favorite to win when it travels to RB Leipzig on Wednesday. 

            But Guardiola's time in charge at City has been punctuated by surprise exits in Europe, so the potential for an upset is real. 

            The City manager is still waiting to win his first Champions League title with a team other than Barcelona featuring Lionel Messi, having lifted it twice with the Catalan club in 2009 and 2011.

            THE SURPRISE PACKAGE

            Napoli was the most impressive team of the group stages and is racing away at the top of the Italian league, leading by 15 points. It faces Eintracht Frankfurt away on Tuesday on the back of a five-game winning run. 

            Striker Victor Osimhen looks unstoppable in front of goal, with 19 this season and nine in his last nine games.

            His performances have seen him linked with a summer move to Manchester United and he can further enhance his reputation as the Champions League returns. 

            Based on form, Napoli looks like one of the leading contenders to win the trophy and will take some stopping if it can maintain it. 

            LUKAKU'S BACK

            Inter Milan, which is the closest challenger to Napoli in Italy, is also in action in the Champions League this week when it hosts Porto on Wednesday. 

            If it is to stand a chance of going far in the competition, much could rely on Romelu Lukaku staying fit and getting his goal-scoring form back.

            In that sense, it was encouraging to see him score for the first time since October in Inter's 3-1 win against Udinese on Saturday - even if it did come from the penalty spot. 

            World Cup winner Lautaro Martinez has been lethal in front of goal since returning from Argentina's success in Qatar, scoring eight in his last 10 games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815281,US warns China about providing 'lethal support' to Russia,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that any attempt by China to supply Russia with ""lethal support"" for use in Ukraine would have serious implications.In an interview with US network CBS News, Blinken said that, to date, Chinese companies had been providing non-lethal support to Russia.Blinken pointed out that Washington had been watching developments between China and Russia very closely.""Just weeks before the aggression, you will remember that President Xi and President Putin had a meeting in which they talked about a partnership with no limits, and we were concerned that among the lack of limits would be Chinese support for Russia in the war,"" Blinken said.""The concern that we have now is, based on information we have, that they're considering providing lethal support,"" Blinken told CBS news anchor Margaret Brennan. ""We've made it very clear to them that would cause a very serious problem for us and in our relationship.""The top US diplomat said, ""There's a whole gambit of things that fit in that category, everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves.""The issue of providing lethal support is not the only matter impacting relations between the two states.On Saturday, Blinken and China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the first high-level meeting since a spat erupted between Washington and Beijing over a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down after it was discovered drifting over the US.Blinken had canceled a scheduled trip to Beijing earlier this month over to the balloon incident, which has become a major point of contention between the two countries.Wang accused the US of violating international norms with ""hysterical"" behavior by shooting down the balloon, which Beijing claims was monitoring weather conditions and had blown off course.kb/sms (Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815282,Germany pledges more aid for Syrian earthquake victims,"Germany has promised to increase aid to people in northern Syria who were affected by the deadly earthquakes that struck in early February.""Even though the (Syria's) Assad regime is putting one obstacle after another in the path of the aid organizations: We will not leave the people there alone,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told German tabloid Bild am Sonntag.Baerbock spoke of the mothers, children and grandparents who had been caught up in more than 10 years of war — with many being forced to flee a number of times — only to now have to mourn loved ones who were under the rubble.""They now lack even the most basic necessities for survival: a roof over their heads, clean drinking water, something to eat and medicine. That is why we are once again increasing our aid to the region by over €22 million,"" around $23.5 million, Baerbock told the Sunday edition of Bild newspaper. That brings Germany's aid for Syria to just under €50 million.Powerful earthquakes struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on February 6, leading to thousands of deaths and widespread damage. More than 46,000 people have been confirmed killed, while many are still believed to be missing.The UN said Sunday that the earthquakes had impacted some 8.8 million people in Syria.UN deputy envoy to Syria Najat Rochdi said that the majority of those impacted were in need of ""some form of humanitarian assistance,"" and that the UN ""is fully committed to doing more to help all Syrians.""Here are other updates from Sunday February 19, on the aftermath of the deadly earthquakes:US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Turkey for an official visit and discussions on how Washington can further assist the earthquake-hit country.He landed at the US's Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, where he was set to take a helicopter tour of the quake-struck area with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu.The United States has sent rescue teams and contributed an initial $85 million relief for Turkey and Syria.Blinken was expected to meet Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Monday.During Blinken's first visit to Turkey as secretary of state, the issue of Sweden and Finland's bids to join NATO would also likely come up.Last month Erdogan said he was open to ratifying only Finland's application.Sweden needs all NATO countries to ratify its application before it could join the block.Doctors Without Borders, known by their French name Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said a convoy of 14 of its trucks had entered northwestern Syria to assist in earthquake rescue operations.The medical charity said the convoy carried tents and winter kits to insulate tents from the cold.Other MSF convoys are scheduled to follow to deliver medical and other equipment.Meanwhile, the World Food Program (WFP) said it has been pressuring authorities in that region of Syria to stop blocking access as it seeks to help victims of the earthquake.WFP Director David Beasley said the Syrian and Turkish governments had been cooperating very well but that its operations were being hampered in northwestern Syria.The agency last week said it was running out of stocks there and called for more border crossings to be opened from Turkey.The head of Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said that search and rescue efforts would largely end on Sunday night, nearly two weeks since the devastating earthquakes struck the region.The earthquakes prompted a mammoth search and rescue effort involving local and international agencies.Rescue teams had been using search dogs and thermal cameras to detect signs of life at sites where it had been hoped survivors would still be found. But those hopes of finding any more survivors have faded.""No one is alive,"" said AFAD member Mujdat Erdogan from one rescue site in Antakya in southern Turkey. ""I don't think we can rescue people anymore.""The body of former Ghanaian football star Christian Atsu, who was found under the rubble of the building where he lived in southern Turkey, is being repatriated, according to Ghana's Foreign Ministry.""The remains will be accompanied by his family and Ghana's ambassador to Turkey on a Turkish airlines flight and will arrive in Accra (Ghana's capital) at 19:40,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.A day after the earthquakes there were initial reports that Atsu had been rescued but these turned out to be false.Thirty-one-year-old Atsu spent four seasons at Chelsea as well as spells at Newcastle, Everton and Bournemouth.In September, he signed for the Turkish Super Lig side Hatayspor and scored the last of his 33 career goals hours before the quake struck.kb/nm (dpa, Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/02/19,107,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815283,Can Wagner head Prigozhin challenge Vladimir Putin?,"Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian private military company Wagner Group, became one of the prominent figures in Russia's war against Ukraine. His harsh and unprecedented criticism of Russia's military command has caused him to be seen as a potential threat to Vladimir Putin. But is he as influential as he appears to be?The Wagner Group is notorious for its cruelty and brutal tactics on the battlefield. It also demonstrated its ruthlessness off the battlefield in videos of alleged executions of its fighters who defected to Ukraine. On Monday, a video published on the Telegram channel Grey Zone, widely believed to be affiliated with the group, showed a Wagner fighter and ex-convict, who identified himself as Dmitry Yakushchenko, apparently being beaten to death with a sledgehammer. But Wednesday, Prigozhin appeared in front of military bloggers and state media with the ""executed fighter,"" referring to him as ""a fine fellow, who brought a big amount of important information from Ukrainian captivity.""Wagner has adopted the sledgehammer as its symbol after reportedly using it to execute a defector from its ranks last year.""Ostentatious cruelty is part of what Prigozhin offers. Whatever it is — a staged piece, trolling or immersive performance — it does not stop being part of an advertising campaign that promotes a cult of violence,"" Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in the independent media outlet Novaya Gazeta.Born in 1961 in what was then Leningrad and is now St. Petersburg, Yevgeny Prigozhin reportedly spent his twenties in a Soviet prison where he served nine years for robbery and fraud. His release from prison and the fall of the Soviet Union allowed Prigozhin to embark on an entrepreneurial path. He started with hot dog carts in his hometown and later moved to bigger projects, such as a luxurious restaurant in St. Petersburg, which became a hub for Russian elites, including then-deputy mayor Vladimir Putin.Having benefited from close ties with political elites, Prigozhin's business expanded further after Putin became president. His catering company Concord, founded in the 1990s, was awarded exclusive and lucrative government contracts for state dinners, including cooking for Putin's inauguration ceremony and US President George W. Bush's visit to St. Petersburg. The contracts earned Prigozhin the nickname ""Putin's chef.""However, Prigozhin did not limit his ambitions to the catering industry.On Tuesday, Prigozhin admitted he was behind the Internet Research Agency, better known as a network of troll factories. According to the FBI, the agency launched a widespread disinformation campaign to influence the results of the 2016 US presidential elections. The allegations were previously fiercely denied by Prigozhin and his lawyers, who have taken legal action against journalists writing about his connection to Russian troll farms.In 2014, Prigozhin set up a private military company Wagner Group. As with the troll factories, he long denied any involvement with the group until September 2022, when he admitted to forming the unit.Alexandra Prokopenko, an independent Russian analyst, told DW that Prigozhin's mercenary outfit was providing ""gray services"" for Putin.""He was making his boss' and his inner circle's life easier in the regions where they did not want to be involved publicly and officially,"" Prokopenko said. ""For instance, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine, as well as Africa and Syria, where Wagner mercenaries not only participated in combat actions but also guarded some oil facilities.""Wagner mercenaries first became involved in Ukraine in 2014 when they helped Russian-backed separatists illegally annex the Crimean peninsula. After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Wagner fighters' ability to make progress in fierce battles in eastern Ukraine became an important military asset for the Kremlin. Last month, Wagner claimed it took control of the Ukrainian city of Soledar, which was seen as one of Moscow's rare victories since the beginning of the war.The Wagner Group's efficiency and the rising importance on the battlefield allowed Prigozhin to launch an embarrassing campaign against Russia's top military officials.Amid public outcry over the lack of ammunition for Russian soldiers, he accused military leaders of incompetency and personally attacked Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and top Russian General Valery Gerasimov, who was responsible for the modernization of the army. In one of his latest critiques, he blamed Russian military bureaucracy for unsuccessful attempts to capture Bakhmut, which for several months has been at the center of the conflict with severe Russian and Ukrainian casualties.""Bakhmut would have been taken before the New Year, if not for our monstrous military bureaucracy ... and the spokes that are put in the wheels daily,"" Prigozhin told Russian state media.According to Kolesnikov, only Vladimir Putin has a mandate to criticize military officials in Russia's autocratic system.""Putin needs Prigozhin for the function of keeping military generals on their toes,"" she said. ""That is how Putin balances the 'weights' of the various figures, pushes them against each other, keeps an eye on them so that none of these figures is excessively strengthened.""Despite Prigozinh's dressing down of military officials, the Russian president promoted Gerasimov earlier in January, making him an overall commander in Ukraine. The move, analysts argued, showed the limited significance of Prigozhin's rhetoric on Putin's decision-making.The formerly media-shy Prigozhin has become the face of Russia's war against Ukraine. His rising publicity has given rise to speculation of possible political ambitions. According to the independent Russian website Meduza, Prigozhin was planning to found a patriotic and conservative movement that would eventually evolve into a political party — an idea he has publicly denied.As Tatyana Stanovaya wrote in the article for Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Prigozhin's ambitions in the political arena may damage his relations with the Kremlin. ""The domestic policy overseers don't like his political demagogy, his attacks on official institutions, or his attempts to troll Putin's staff by threatening to form a political party, which would be a headache for everyone in the Kremlin.""The Kremlin's desire to tighten the reins on Prigozhin was seen in the move to strip him of the right to recruit convicts who, according to the US National Security Council, make up 80% of Wagner troops. In an interview with Russian military bloggers and state media this week, he acknowledged that after the downsizing, the Wagner Group would have a more limited role in Russia's war effort in Ukraine.Prigozhin's only path is to become a politician, given the responsibilities that he has been assigned, according to Kolesnikov.""However, Putin doesn't want to bring him into the legal field, which would mean strengthening him as a politician,"" the analyst told DW. ""As long as Vladimir Putin is able to subtly control political forces, he can withdraw Prigozhin from the chessboard at the right time and put him back to his usual place — in underground politics.""Edited by: Sean Sinico",2023/02/19,120,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815285,Illinois poised to mandate paid leave for nearly all workers,"CHICAGO (AP) — When Joan Van is sick, she doesn't get paid. 

            The East St. Louis-area restaurant server and single mother of three said she works doubles to make up the money when she or one of her children gets sick.

            “You can't let your kids see you break down because you're tired and exhausted, 'cause you gotta keep pushing. You got to. And if you don't, then who's gonna do it?” she said.











            She may not have to for much longer. Expansive paid leave legislation requiring Illinois employers to give workers time off based on hours worked, to be used for any reason, is ready for action by Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who said he will sign it.

            Requiring paid vacation is rare in the U.S. — just Maine and Nevada have similar laws — although common in other industrialized nations. 

            Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., require employers offer paid sick leave via similar laws, although employees may only use it for health-related issues. What sets Illinois' new legislation apart is workers won’t have to explain the reason for their absence as long as they provide notice in accordance with reasonable employer standards. 

            Maine and Nevada also allow workers to decide how to use their time, but substantial exemptions apply. Maine’s Earned Paid Leave law only applies to employers with more than 10 employees, and Nevada’s exempts businesses with less than 50. Illinois’ will reach nearly all employees and has no limit based on the business size.

            Seasonal workers such as lifeguards will be exempt, as will federal employees or college students who work non-full-time, temporary jobs for their university.

            The legislation would take effect on Jan. 1, 2024. Employees will accrue one hour of paid leave for every 40 hours worked up to 40 hours total, although the employer may offer more. Employees can start using the time once they have worked for 90 days.

            “Working families face enough challenges without the concern of losing a day’s pay when life gets in the way,” Pritzker said on Jan. 11, when the bill passed both chambers.

            Ordinances in Cook County and Chicago already require employers to offer paid sick leave, and workers in those locations will continue to be covered by the existing laws rather than the new bill.

            Johnae Strong, an administrative worker at a small media company in Chicago, said paid sick time helps her take care of her two children, a 10-year-old and a 6-year-old. But expanding the time to be used for any reason would be helpful. 

            “Life happens,” she said, adding that she hopes Chicago will update its law to be more flexible, like the state bill.

            The Chicago and Cook County ordinances served as pilot programs for the statewide legislation, and assuaged critics who predicted mass business closures that didn’t come to fruition, said Sarah Labadie, director of advocacy and policy at Women Employed, a nonprofit that has fought for paid leave since 2008 and helped push through the legislation.

            “Obviously we had some strange things happen during the pandemic, but pre-pandemic that was not the case. Chicago was a thriving economic engine,"" she said.

            Peoria Democratic Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth sponsored the bill, which she said will ""help to uplift working families” and “immediately help people.”

            Newly-elected House Republican Leader Tony McCombie said the mandated benefits could have a “detrimental effect” on small businesses and nonprofits “in an already unfriendly business climate.”

            ""We all want a great working environment with an equitable work/life balance,"" she said in an emailed statement. “However, Senate Bill 208 failed to address the concerns of those providing that work environment.”

            For Leslie Allison-Seei, who runs a promotion and sweepstakes management company with her husband in DuPage county, taking care of their three full-time employees is a priority, but it is ""difficult"" to compete with corporate paid time off policies.

            “We’re thrilled that this is getting passed and that it’s going to be signed. But it’s also a little bit frightening because, you know, a week’s worth of time — I don’t know what that would do to our business,"" Allison-Seei said. “I think a lot of businesses are just doing the very best that they can to stay afloat.”

            Small business advocacy organization National Federation of Independent Business opposes the bill, saying that it “imposes a one-size fits all mandate on all employers.” 

            Small business owners face steep inflation, increased fuel and energy costs and an absence of qualified workers, and the requirement will be an ""additional burden,"" NFIB state director Chris Davis said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “The message from Illinois lawmakers is loud and clear, ‘Your small business isn’t essential.’""

            However, the potential burden on small businesses clashes with the needs of their workers, particularly those with children.

            Van, a parent leader with Community Organizing and Family Issues said she has no paid leave until she has worked for one year. Knowing she will miss a day of pay when she or one of her kids gets sick is a constant stress for the Belleville mom, but guaranteed PTO “would be awesome,” offering her peace of mind and alleviating some financial worries.

            Molly Weston Williamson, paid leave policy expert and senior fellow at think tank Center for American Progress, called the Illinois legislation “a huge step in the right direction.""

            In addition to establishing workers’ right to paid time off, the bill forbids employers from retaliating against employees for using it. This is key to making sure “low-income workers or other folks who are more vulnerable are really, practically able to take the time,” Williamson said.

            Paid leave is both a labor rights issue and a public health issue, Williamson said. Service workers like Van who handle food and beverage without paid time off are more likely to go to work sick and to send their children to day care sick, “at which point they get everyone else sick,” she said.

            “Especially now that we are three-plus years into a global pandemic, I think all of us have a much more visceral understanding of the ways that all of our health is tied together,"" Williamson said. ____

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815287,"Mbappe, Messi inspire PSG to 4-3 win against Lille","PARIS (AP) — Paris Saint-Germain was only minutes away from a fourth consecutive loss on Sunday when Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi came to the rescue to avert a major crisis at the Qatari-backed club. 

            The French league leaders gave away a two-goal lead and were trailing by one goal with four minutes left before Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi turned things around to transform a fiasco in the making into a 4-3 win against Lille. 

            As PSG looked headed for yet another setback, Mbappe snatched a late equalizer at the Parc des Princes. Messi then slotted home the winner deep in added time from a free kick, with a lethal left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.











            “I will simply say that it's a great relief,"" PSG coach Christophe Galtier said.

            The hard-fought win followed a 1-0 defeat at home midweek against Bayern in the Champions League that came after a 3-1 defeat to Monaco in the league and another loss against bitter rival Marseille in the French Cup.

            PSG kept a five-point lead over second-place Marseille, which kept the pressure on the leaders with a 3-2 win at Toulouse ahead of their clash next week at the Stade Velodrome in the biggest match in French soccer.

            After playing just half an hour against Bayern after returning from a thigh injury, Mbappe was back in Galtier's starting lineup. His impact throughout made up for PSG's defensive inadequacies and lapses of concentration.

            PSG led 2-0 after 17 minutes with goals by Mbappe and Neymar but the French champions then conceded three times — with Bafode Diakite, Jonathan David and Jonathan Bamba all scoring — and lost Neymar through injury. 

            There were obvious signs of nerves amid the PSG ranks from the start.

            The hosts were immediately under pressure as Tim Weah's shot took a deflection and Gianluigi Donnarumma was forced into a reflex save to stop the ball with his feet. PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe then put Donnarumma in a difficult situation when he headed the ball back toward the keeper, only to set up David for a one-to-one. The Lille forward appeared surprised by the unintended assist and his right-footed shot was not good enough to beat the Italy keeper. 

            Looking fragile, PSG relied on Mbappe to lead the way. 

            Set up by Neymar, the France forward burst down the left and cut inside to come face to face with Tiago Djalo and Diakite. Mbappe nutmegged Djalo and forced his way between the pair, then beat goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier with a low shot in the 11th minute.

            PSG doubled its lead with a quick collective move ignited and concluded by Neymar, who slotted the ball into an empty net. Neymar was forced off the field on a stretcher in the second half after twisting his right ankle.

            Despite the comfortable cushion, PSG looked shaky and could not dictate the play. The hosts often found themselves pegged back in their half and did not hold onto their lead for long. 

            Lille was rewarded for its efforts from a set piece in the 23rd minute, with Diakite heading the ball home from Andre Gomes' cross after a corner.

            Things took a turn for the worse for PSG after Marco Verratti pulled Djalo's jersey in the box, prompting the referee to signal a penalty amid protests from PSG players and staff. David took the kick and coolly wrongfooted Donnarumma to level.

            Bamba then put Lille in the driving seat with a superb strike from a tight angle into the top corner, leaving Mbappe shaking his head in disbelief.

            Mbappe did not give up, though, and put PSG back in the match when he latched onto a back pass from Juan Bernat to slot the ball into the back of the net before Messi delighted PSG fans with his free kick.

            Elsewhere, goals from Aleksandr Golovin and Myron Boadu gave third-place Monaco a 2-1 win at Brest and Lens beat Nantes 3-1 to remain in fourth place, eight points behind PSG.

            Lorient beat Ajaccio 3-0, Rennes forward Arnaud Kalimuendo scored twice in a 2-0 defeat of Clermont while Wahbi Khazri scored a late winner to lead Montpellier to a 1-0 win at Troyes.

            The 75th annual DGA Awards, held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday evening, denied Steven Spielberg a record-extending four wins for the guild's top honor. Spielberg had once been expected to cruise through awards season with his autobiographical “The Fabelmans,” but the strong affection for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — the Oscar favorite with a leading 11 nominations — has come to dominate Hollywood's Oscar run-up. 

            In the past 10 years, all but once has the DGA winner gone on to win at the Academy Awards. (In 2020, Sam Mendes won at the DGA for “1917,” while Bong Joon Ho won the Oscar for “Parasite.”) Last year, Jane Campion (“The Power of the Dog”) won at each. In 75 years, only 10 times have the DGA winner and the Oscar winner not aligned. 











            The other nominees were: Todd Field (“Tár”), Martin McDonagh (“The Banshees of Inisherin”) and Joseph Kosinski (“Top Gun: Maverick”). The same filmmakers are nominated for best director at the March 12 Oscars, with one exception. The academy picked Ruben Östlund (“Triangle of Sadness”) rather than Kosinski. 

            Kwan and Scheinert, the filmmaking pair known as “The Daniels,” are just the third duo to win the DGA's top award, following Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins for “West Side Story” (1961) and Joel Coen and Ethan Coen for “No Country for Old Men” (2007). They're also uncommonly young (both are 35) and early in their careers (this is just their second feature film) to win with the guild — especially over a veteran like Spielberg. He holds the record for most DGA nominations with 13. 

            No women were nominated by the DGA or the film academy for best director this year. But both of the guild's other top awards went to female filmmakers. Best first feature went to Charlotte Wells for the father-daughter drama “Aftersun.” Best documentary was awarded to Sara Dosa for “Fire of Love,” about an adventurous French volcanologist couple.The Directors Guild of America handed its top prize for feature filmmaking to Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” putting them on course to win at the Academy Awards next month.The 75th annual DGA Awards, held at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday evening, denied Steven Spielberg a record-extending four wins for the guild's top honor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815324,Three teenage girls and gunman dead in Texas shooting,"GALENA PARK, Texas (AP) — Authorities say three teenage girls, including one who was pregnant, were fatally shot by man who also sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl who later escaped then fatally shot himself. 

            No names have been released.

            The killings occurred at the home of the gunman's girlfriend in the Houston suburb of Galena Park at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday.











            The girls who were killed were 19, 14 and 13, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.

            The 38-year-old man then attacked the 12-year-old and then told her to run out of the house, Gonzalez said. She grabbed a 1-year-old baby girl and fled.

            “She ran out of the residence without any clothing” to the home of a neighbor, who called Galena Park police.

            “When she ran out she managed to think about it, thankfully, and was able to grab the 1-year-old and ran away,” Gonzalez said.

            Both girls were hospitalized for treatment of injuries that were not life-threatening, according to a statement from Galena Park police. The investigation has been turned over to the sheriff's department.

            Authorities did not immediately return messages to The Associated Press for additional comment on Sunday.

            Gonzalez said the man’s girlfriend was the mother of the 12-year-old and the 19-year-old. The older victim was the mother of the baby and was pregnant. The sheriff said the girlfriend was not at home at the time of the shootings.

            The sheriff said authorities were working to determine the relationships of the other two teenagers who were shot but described them as family members.

            Gonzalez offered no suspected motive for the shooting, saying it “makes no sense, it's all tragic.”

            The U.S. has seen a deadly start to 2023, including six mass killings in a three-week period in January, according to an Associated Press/USA Today database. It defines a mass killing as four or more people dead, not including the perpetrator.

            Six people were killed in a mass shooting Friday in Mississippi and there have been a number of mass shootings in which fewer people were slain, such as Monday’s shooting at Michigan State University in which three people were killed and five were wounded.GALENA PARK, Texas (AP) — Authorities say three teenage girls, including one who was pregnant, were fatally shot by man who also sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl who later escaped then fatally shot himself.No names have been released.The killings occurred at the home of the gunman's girlfriend in the Houston suburb of Galena Park at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday.The girls who were killed were 19, 14 and 13, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.The 38-year-old man then attacked the 12-year-old and then told her to run out of the house, Gonzalez said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815325,"Moldova protesters want energy subsidies, president to quit","CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Several thousand protesters rallied in Moldova’s capital Sunday to demand that the country's new pro-Western government fully cover citizens' winter heating bills amid a cost-of-living crisis and skyrocketing inflation.

            The protest was organized by a recently formed group called Movement for the People and supported by members of Moldova’s Russia-friendly Shor Party, which holds six seats in the former Soviet republic’s 101-seat legislature. 

            Some of the demonstrators who converged on Chisinau called for the resignation of the country's president, chanting “Down with Maia Sandu!” Others held placards with the faces of some Moldova’s leaders and politicians placed next to photographs of large homes and fancy cars.











            ""They have millions. We are dying of hunger,” they said. 

            Sandu on Feb. 13 outlined what she claimed was an alleged plot by Moscow to overthrow the government in order to put the nation “at the disposal of Russia,” and to derail it from its course to one day join the European Union. 

            “Through violent actions, masked under protests of the so-called opposition, the change of power in Chisinau would be forced,” she said. “In carrying out the plan, the authors rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups such as the Shor formation and all of its derivatives.""

            Russia strongly denied her claims.

            A series of anti-government protests initiated by the Shor Party rocked Moldova during the fall as a severe energy crisis gripped the country after Russia dramatically reduced natural gas supplies.

            Around the same time, Moldova’s government asked the country’s Constitutional Court to declare the Shor Party illegal. The country's anti-corruption prosecutors’ office alleged the protests were partly financed with Russian money. 

            On Saturday, the office said more than 20 searches were carried out at the homes of party members who were “actively and systematically involved in receiving and distributing money ... for the transport and remuneration” of citizens to the protests. 

            Eight people were arrested, authorities said. 

            The Shor Party accused authorities of mobilizing thousands of police officers to thwart Sunday's demonstration and ""stop people from entering” the capital.

            The party’s leader, Ilan Shor, is a Moldovan oligarch currently in exile in Israel. He is implicated in a $1 billion bank theft and was recently named on a U.S. State Department sanctions list as working for Russian interests.

            The U.S. says Shor worked with “corrupt oligarchs and Moscow-based entities to create political unrest in Moldova” and to undermine the country’s bid to join the EU. 

            The Movement for the People's website says the group was formed in early February and consists of “several political forces, public associations, local elected officials and civic activists” to address the “unprecedented crises” Moldova and its citizens face.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815326,Mexican musician finds refuge in saxophone after acid attack,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — María Elena Ríos has conflicting feelings about her saxophone: She once blamed the instrument for bringing her to the brink of death — but it also has been her salvation.

            Ríos, 29, thought her career as a musician and her devotion to her saxophone were what led her former boyfriend — an influential politician — to hire the men who splashed acid onto her face and body, disfiguring her. Later, she learned he simply couldn't accept that she had broken off their relationship.

            Some of the attackers and the ex-boyfriend are in jail, but Ríos still had to come to terms with her instrument. Her love of the saxophone, in the end, is helping heal the psychological scars left by the terrifying attack. 











            “We are reconciling, little by little,” Ríos said of the musical instrument. “I hated it, because I thought it was responsible” for the 2019 attack in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca. She's performed live since then, but still wears a mask covering her lower face. 

            “It bothered my attacker a lot that I was a musician,"" Ríos recounts, ""because he said we musicians were vagrants, poverty stricken, that we just took drugs and that when I went to concerts I probably participated in orgies.” 

            The ex-politician who allegedly ordered the attack is being held in jail while awaiting trial, as are two other men, but another remains at large. 

            Meanwhile, Ríos has joined a movement calling for greater punishments for acid attacks and says the saxophone is her “sword” in that battle on behalf of victims. 

            Mexico City legislators have proposed a bill bearing her nickname, “Malena,” which would classify acid attacks as a distinct, serious crime equivalent to attempted femicide. Currently they are treated as simple assault or bodily injury. 

            Acid attacks are most common in South Asia, but also have been documented in many other parts of the world, including Latin America. 

            The Carmen Sánchez Foundation, started in 2021 to highlight the issue in Mexico, says government health data from 2022 suggests more than 100 women were attacked by chemicals or some kind of corrosive agent, though only 28 were reported to authorities. 

            Ríos remembers having to choose, at age 9, between playing soccer and joining one of the musical bands that are a popular community activity in the rural villages in Oaxaca.

            “I am not her anymore. I am not the beautiful young woman who played the saxophone anymore,” said Ríos. “Today I can say I have been forced to become a defender of my own rights, and a defender of the rights of other fellow women survivors.”

            She was hospitalized for five months after the attack, and still recalls the sadness in her parents’ eyes when she awoke in hospital.

            She now attends musical classes in Mexico City, where she has taken refuge since the attack. The federal government has provided her with bodyguards because her attacker was wealthy and influential.

            Ríos said she and her family were harassed before the attack, when she tried to break off the relationship. She says the harassment continues, and that she lives in constant fear for her life.

            The man accused of ordering the attack, Juan Manuel Vera Carrizal, was a local legislator and businessman. He has declared himself innocent and his lawyers deny he had any involvement.

            Even though he was jailed and expelled from his political party in 2020, Ríos says he still has influence. 

            In January he was almost released to house arrest after a judge tried to reclassify the crime, applying rules for a lesser offense. But because her case has gained has gained national attention, the attempt failed. 

            Music is now a refuge for Ríos. “When I begin to assemble my saxophone, I feel like I am putting myself together,” she says.

            Last year she was invited to play on stage for the first time after the attack. It was at the annual Vive Latino music festival in Mexico City with the rock group Maldita Vecindad. 

            She says it made her feel “eternal.""MEXICO CITY (AP) — María Elena Ríos has conflicting feelings about her saxophone: She once blamed the instrument for bringing her to the brink of death — but it also has been her salvation.Ríos, 29, thought her career as a musician and her devotion to her saxophone were what led her former boyfriend — an influential politician — to hire the men who splashed acid onto her face and body, disfiguring her.

The federal government has provided her with bodyguards because her attacker was wealthy and influential.Ríos said she and her family were harassed before the attack, when she tried to break off the relationship. She says the harassment continues, and that she lives in constant fear for her life.The man accused of ordering the attack, Juan Manuel Vera Carrizal, was a local legislator and businessman. He has declared himself innocent and his lawyers deny he had any involvement.Even though he was jailed and expelled from his political party in 2020, Ríos says he still has influence.In January he was almost released to house arrest after a judge tried to reclassify the crime, applying rules for a lesser offense. But because her case has gained has gained national attention, the attempt failed.Music is now a refuge for Ríos. “When I begin to assemble my saxophone, I feel like I am putting myself together,” she says.Last year she was invited to play on stage for the first time after the attack. It was at the annual Vive Latino music festival in Mexico City with the rock group Maldita Vecindad.She says it made her feel “eternal.""",2023/02/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815327,"Rashford scores twice, Man United beats Leicester 3-0","MANCHESTER, England (AP) — In this kind of form Marcus Rashford might just fire Manchester United to the Premier League title and more. 

            The striker scored twice to set up a 3-0 win against Leicester on Sunday as Erik ten Hag's team closed in on second-place Manchester City and kept the pressure on table-topping Arsenal. 

            That’s 16 goals in 17 games for Rashford since returning from the World Cup in a run that has prompted fans to label him the best player in the world right now. 











            Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe – and a certain Cristiano Ronaldo – might have something to say about that, but United’s four-pronged trophy pursuit has been energized by Rashford’s outstanding form. 

            The England international fired his team in front on 25 minutes at Old Trafford after United withstood an early onslaught from Leicester. 

            He scored a second in the 56th and substitute Jadon Sancho added a third five minutes later. 

            Rashford has scored in seven straight Premier League games at home, which is the longest run for a United player since Wayne Rooney’s eight-game streak in the 2009-10 campaign. Ronaldo had a sequence of scoring in 10 straight games in 2008, but it is a measure of Rashford’s form that he is keeping company with such iconic names.

            He now has a career-best 24 goals this season and is showing no signs of slowing down, no matter what the opposition. 

            His latest strikes came after he scored in the 2-2 draw with Barcelona in the Europa League on Thursday to further enhance his reputation around the world. 

            After that epic at the Nou Camp, it was back to the league for United and the chance to continue its push toward the top. 

            As unlikely as a title bid looked at the start of the season, there is growing belief that United can force its way into serious contention as the leading two falter. 

            City’s surprise 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest on Saturday meant third-place United was able to cut the gap to Pep Guardiola’s team to three points. And while Arsenal came from behind to beat Aston Villa 4-2 and move back to the top of the table, it was the Londoners’ first win in five games. 

            United has stumbled itself in recent weeks when given the chance to really put the pressure on at the top, with dropped points against Leeds and a loss to Arsenal.

            For 25 minutes it looked like United was in for another slipup as Leicester twice threatened to go ahead and only the efforts of David de Gea kept the visitors at bay.

            The United goalkeeper stuck out a foot to stop Harvey Barnes when the Leicester forward went through on goal after eight minutes and was down sharply to push away Kelechi Inheanacho’s header shortly after.

            United sparked into life when Bruno Fernandes’ quick through ball with the outside of his boot sent Rashford away. The forward simply doesn’t look like missing at the moment and he fired low past Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward with a clinical finish. 

            He raced clear again in the second half to beat Ward, with VAR eventually giving the goal after the offside flag was raised. 

            Sancho put the game beyond doubt at the end of a sweeping move. 

            United is now five points behind leader Arsenal but has played one game more. 

            United will play Newcastle in the League Cup final next Sunday. It faces West Ham in the fifth round of the FA Cup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815328,Yankees INF LeMahieu feels great after injury-marred season,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — New York Yankees infielder DJ LeMahieu is feeling great as the two-time batting champion looks to put an injured-marred 2022 behind him.

            LeMahieu was limited to 125 regular-season games and sat out the postseason because of a right toe injury. He has been working out at the Yankees' minor league complex since December.

            “I'm so excited (with) where I'm at right now,” LeMahieu said Sunday, a day before Yankees position players are to report to spring training. “How the season ended for me last year and our team — just where I'm at physically and mentally and to be back — I'm really in a good place and really excited to be around the guys again.”











            LeMahieu said missing the playoffs, where the Yankees were swept in a four-game AL Championship Series by the eventual World Series champion Houston Astros, was the worst feeling.

            “Just kind of gets you motivated,” he said.

            LeMahieu, a three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, went into a 2-for-38 slide through Sept. 4 before going on the injured list. He returned on Sept. 30 and was 4 for 13 with two walks, no extra-base hits and no RBIs. He finished the season with a .261 batting average, his lowest since 2011.

            “I'm very confident going into this season,” LeMahieu said. “When you're banged up, it's frustrating. It's so limiting that I couldn't be myself.""

            LeMahieu, who had a cortisone injection during the All-Star break, opted not to have surgery after consulting with specialists.

            “It was definitely under consideration, but I think I made the right decision,” he said. “There was a lot of conversions there for about a month after the season.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815332,Germany looks to tackle extremism in the civil service,"Yes, there are right-wing extremists among Germany's armed forces, the police and judiciary. And even if they make up a comparatively small minority, they could undermine confidence in German rule of law.That's why Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, of the center-left Social Democratic Party, is pushing for a change in disciplinary law to make it easier to fire extremist civil servants.At present, disciplinary procedures to remove such civil servants take, on average, four years to complete, during which the accused receive their full salary.""We will not allow our democratic constitutional state to be sabotaged from within by extremists,"" said Faeser on Wednesday. If the integrity of the state is damaged, it is particularly dangerous for the rule of law and democracy, she said.Faeser's planned action has been motivated by cases such as that of former Bundeswehr soldier Franco A.*, a far-right extremist accused of plotting a terrorist attack while posing as a Syrian refugee. He has since been sentenced to prison.There have also been recent plots to overthrow the state by so-called Reichsbürger, or Reich Citizens, a right-wing extremist conspiracy movement, while Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, has also deemed one judge, Jens Maier, to be an adherent of right-wing extremist ideology. All of these cases have involved people who have taken an oath to uphold the constitution.Faeser said ""anyone who rejects the state should not work for it, and every case of extremism must have consequences.""If the German parliament approves Faeser's bill, authorities will be able to remove anyone seeking to undermine the constitution from office by administrative act. Until now, they have had to take legal action to do so.However, many experts have little faith in the planned change in disciplinary law.""It is doubtful whether the goal of accelerating disciplinary proceedings can actually be achieved,"" said the German Alliance of Administrative Judges.Germany's Civil Service Association, which has some 1.3 million members, is similarly skeptical.The German Trade Union Confederation even believes the reform could backfire, because those affected may take legal action against their removal from the civil service — a constitutionally guaranteed right.Faeser appears to have recognized this, acknowledging that ""nothing will be changed in this respect; administrative courts can still review the decisions."" And that, in turn, can mean lengthy court cases.The interior minister also said the proposed bill is not about casting doubt on all civil servants. Instead, she said, it is aimed solely at accelerating legal action against suspected enemies of the constitution, with the same legal standards still applying.Faeser said the reform also serves to protect ""the vast majority of civil servants who act correctly."" German civil servants are obliged to support the country's democratic order and to stand up for its preservation at work, but also when they are off the clock. When engaging in political activism, they are expected to exercise moderation and restraint.The interior minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Thomas Strobl, supports Faeser's initiative. The southwestern state has allowed the swift removal of extremist civil servants since 2008.""We rightly expect our civil servants to stand up for freedom, democracy and our constitutional state,"" Strobl, a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, told DW. ""Action must be taken quickly and decisively when right-wing extremists are at work.""Faeser's draft law is explicitly modeled on the way things are done in Baden-Württemberg, where regulations have ""proven effective for over 10 years.""Strobl's spokesman was unable, however, to say how many civil servants had so far been removed from their posts for unconstitutional actions. He also said the state does not collect data on such removals, adding that ""the Interior Ministry has not held any disciplinary proceedings over extremist activities in recent years.""Statements like these are likely to reinforce the skepticism of those who oppose Faeser's plans.The Civil Service Association has referred to figures from the draft bill showing that 373 disciplinary measures were carried out at the federal level in 2021. This corresponds to 0.2% of the approximately 190,000 German civil servants. In the same period, only 25 cases came before an administrative court, equivalent to 0.01%.""Even by multiyear comparison, the number of disciplinary proceedings remains at a very low level,"" according to the draft bill. It goes on to say that ""only in a few cases is confidence in the dutiful exercise of office and in the integrity of the public service so permanently shaken that relevant measures have to be taken.""At worst, this can mean people losing their status as civil servants or having their state pensions canceled. Yet the example of Baden-Württemberg shows these consequences may not be faced by extremists alone. A Baden-Württemberg police officer was dismissed from the civil service due to a conviction for fraud. He filed a lawsuit against his dismissal, yet the case was rejected by Germany's top court.The Civil Service Association has accused Faeser of undermining trust in state employees and sowing distrust among citizens. Similarly, the Trade Union Confederation fears civil servants could be ""stigmatized.""The bill will now be debated in parliament, where the Green Party — part of the governing coalition with Faeser's Social Democrats — has already announced it will welcome the draft law. However, the Greens have called for revisions.This article was originally published in German.*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and obliges us to refrain from revealing full names in such cases.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815339,Dortmund moves level on points with Bundesliga leader Bayern,"BERLIN (AP) — Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus scored to help his team join Bayern Munich and Union Berlin at the top of the Bundesliga with a 4-1 win over Hertha Berlin on Sunday.

            Reus effectively sealed the result with a brilliant free kick in the 76th minute, before Jamie Bynoe-Gittens set up Julian Brandt for Dortmund’s fourth goal in the 90th.

            It was Dortmund's eighth win from eight games across all competitions in 2023 and it lifted Edin Terzić's side above Union and into second place on goal difference from Bayern, which slumped to a 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday. 











            “We've put ourselves in a very good position but we haven't reached our goals yet,” Terzić said.

            All three teams have 43 points, but 10-time defending champion Bayern’s goal difference is vastly superior.

            Dortmund’s win came at the expense of an injury to the in-form Karim Adeyemi, who scored and then got injured while setting up the second goal. The Germany forward went off in the 35th minute with what looked like a left ankle injury.

            The 21-year-old Adeyemi had opened the scoring with his heel eight minutes before. He then seemed to twist his ankle when he delivered a perfectly weighted cross for Donyell Malen to score Dortmund’s second.

            Lucas Tousart hammered the ball in off the crossbar for the visitors right after the break, but it was as good as it got for Hertha, which dropped to second from bottom after its fifth defeat from six games this year.

            UNION'S MISSED OPPORTUNITY

            Union Berlin missed the chance to capitalize on Bayern's defeat and take over as leader earlier Sunday after being held 0-0 by last-place Schalke.

            It was Schalke’s fourth consecutive 0-0 draw and the first league game in six that Union did not win this year. 

            “I can live with it quite well,” Union coach Urs Fischer said. ""We had a harder time starting the match than we imagined. At times I thought we lacked conviction. Logically, we would have liked to have won this game.”

            Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fährmann stopped Rani Khedira’s effort toward the end of a first half of few highlights as both teams frustrated each other.

            Fischer brought on speedy Dutch forward Sheraldo Becker with just over half an hour of normal time remaining and American forward Jordan Pefok shortly afterward but neither could force a breakthrough against Schalke’s stubborn defense.

            Bayern hosts Union next Sunday.

            LEVERKUSEN LOSES AGAIN

            Marcus Ingvartsen's late penalty earned Mainz a 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen, enough to move ninth at the home team's expense. 

            Leverkusen's Amine Adli was sent off for conceding the spot kick in the 80th by hauling down Silvan Widmer, who was through on goal.

            Leverkusen's scorers were Nadiem Amiri and Patrik Schick, the latter after recovering from injury for his first Bundesliga appearance since November.

            It was Leverkusen's 10th league defeat and its second 3-2 loss at home in four days after Thursday's defeat to Monaco in the first leg of their Europa League playoff.

            Ko, the No. 1 player in women's golf, held off Aditi Ashok of India to capture the richest prize among regular Ladies European Tour events. She won $750,000 from the $5 million prize fund at Royal Greens Golf & Country Club.

            Ko ended last year by winning the LPGA Tour finale and $2 million, the richest payoff in women's golf, which elevated her to No. 1 in the world.











            The Kiwi got married in December, skipped the LPGA Tour's season opener in Florida last month and then showed she still was on top-ranked form. It was her 26th victory worldwide.

            “I’m playing with the world’s best. The field this week was really good, so I knew it was going to be a challenge,"" Ko said. ""The first one of the year, it’s really hard because you don’t have anything to base yourself off.

            “You don’t know if you’re going to play well or bad. But the start definitely helped, and I think I stayed really patient and I was not as nervous as I thought I would be, which is definitely good.”

            Lilia Vu, who had a one-shot lead going into the final round, slipped to a 71 and tied for third with Manon De Roey of Belgium (63) and Lexi Thompson (66).

            Sao Paulo's state government said in a statement that 35 died in the city of Sao Sebastiao and a 7-year-old girl was killed in neighboring Ubatuba. On Monday morning, more than 500 people were continuing search and rescue efforts. 

            Some of the hardest-hit cities that are under a state of emergency, including Sao Sebastiao, Ubatuba, Ilhabela and Bertioga, canceled their Carnival festivities as rescue teams contined a search for the injured and missing under the rubble. 











            “Our rescue teams are not managing to get to several locations; it is a chaotic situation,” said Felipe Augusto, the mayor of Sao Sebastiao. Later, he added there are dozens of people missing and that 50 houses collapsed in the city due to the landslides.

            Augusto posted on social media several videos of widespread destruction in his city, including one of baby being rescued by locals lined up on a flooded street. 

            Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said on Twitter he will visit the region Monday.

            Sao Paulo state government said in a statement that precipitation in the region has surpassed 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) in one day, one of the highest amounts ever in Brazil in such a short period. 

            Bertioga alone had 687 millimeters during that period, the state government said.

            Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas said in a statement he requested support from the army, which sent two airplanes and rescue teams to the region. 

            TV footage showed houses flooded with only the roof visible. Residents are using small boats to carry items and people to higher positions. A road that connects Rio de Janeiro to the port city of Santos was blocked by landslides and floodwaters.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815357,Love picks Miami; AP source says Heat also to sign Zeller,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Kevin Love says he has picked the Miami Heat.

            Love said Sunday that he will sign with the Heat for the remainder of the season once he clears waivers, a major add for a Miami team that is looking to move up in the Eastern Conference before the postseason begins.

            “Miami it is, yes,"" Love said in a text message to The Associated Press.











            Also Sunday, a person with knowledge of the matter said the Heat are finalizing plans to add another big man in free agent center Cody Zeller, with that deal expected to be completed before the team gathers in Miami to begin practice following the All-Star break. That person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because Zeller's contract has not been signed.

            Love’s decision was first reported by ESPN.

            The 6-foot-9 forward and the Cleveland Cavaliers agreed to buyout terms on Saturday, ending his nine-year run with the team that he helped win the 2016 NBA championship.

            Over parts of 15 NBA seasons with Cleveland and Minnesota, Love has averaged 17.2 points and 10.5 rebounds. He averaged career-lows of 8.5 points, 6.8 rebounds and 20 minutes per game in 41 games, almost all as a reserve, this season for Cleveland and didn’t play in the team’s final 12 games before the All-Star break.

            That prompted buyout talks, and once they were done, Love chose Miami.

            “It would give us another vet, another guy who’s been through the playoffs, another guy who knows what it takes to win and get to where we want to go,” Heat center Bam Adebayo said.

            Love is a five-time NBA All-Star, an Olympic champion and FIBA World Cup champion as part of USA Basketball, and his combination of size and 3-point shooting ability would seem to fit perfectly into the Heat system.

            The Heat will come out of the All-Star break seventh in the Eastern Conference at 32-27, five games back of Cleveland for the No. 4 spot. The top four teams in each conference will have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs, and the top six in each conference will avoid the play-in tournament to determine the seventh and eighth seeds.

            Miami will become Zeller’s third NBA city. He has averaged 8.5 points and 6.0 rebounds in 494 games with Charlotte and Portland. The 6-foot-11 center was the fourth pick in the 2013 draft.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815359,"Mac McClung, now the NBA dunk champ, wasn't an unknown","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Mac McClung was not exactly an unknown.

            Long before he won the dunk contest at NBA All-Star Saturday, he was a YouTube phenomenon. It’s impossible to add up all the views that videos of McClung — everything from dunks to documentaries — had gotten, but it was in the hundreds of millions.

            Yet it all seems different now, after this 6-foot-2 boyish-looking guard from a small town in Virginia with trampolines for legs and only two NBA games on his resume became the league’s dunk champion and finally brought buzz back to an event that had been more criticized than celebrated over the last few years.











            “He saved the dunk contest,” Shaquille O’Neal said, and countless others echoed those sentiments.

            Time will tell if they’re right. But an event that is designed to create unforgettable moments — Michael Jordan taking off from the foul line, Vince Carter saying “it’s over” after a dunk, Aaron Gordon jumping over the Orlando Magic mascot, Dwight Howard donning the Superman cape — got a massive shot in the arm from a guy who now has more dunks in the contest (four) than he does in actual NBA games (one).“It’s a cliche, but you can really do whatever you want to do,” said McClung, who is on a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers and playing in the G League. “I’ve had so many people even at the highest level ... if you are a young kid, and someone who is an inspiration to you, someone that you respect so much tells you that you can’t do it, it doesn’t matter. Literally, if you manifest and put your mind to it, you can literally make your life and reinvent yourself every day.”

            The reactions from NBA players watching the show, both in Salt Lake City and elsewhere, were amazing.

            “Tough,” Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell shouted as he watched courtside, while several other All-Stars like Giannis Antetokounmpo — with his mouth open in disbelief — filmed the action on their phones.

            
                Golden State’s Stephen Curry said on Twitter: “Man was a viral (House of Highlights) high school dunk phenom, still working his way to the League, but lemme go get that dunk contest trophy right quick and bring it back to life!!! Unreal.”

            McClung knows he is an underdog story. He grew up playing football and baseball in Gate City, Virginia, before deciding sometime around sixth or seventh grade — standing barely 5 feet tall at that point — that basketball would be his priority.

            He started going viral in high school for his array of dunks, and he has handled all the attention that comes with internet fame as well as he can for years.

            “One thing with this game is you have to learn how to adapt,” McClung told The Associated Press last year. “I want to be known as someone who can help a team, help a championship team, be a good energy guy and a good culture guy and a good locker room guy.”

            So if he was an unknown to NBA fans, that’s maybe understandable. He had the final basket of the 2021-22 NBA season, breaking free for an uncontested reverse dunk to cap the Los Angeles Lakers’ overtime win over the Denver Nuggets last April. That was his third, and most recent, field goal in the NBA.

            But, even if he hasn’t gotten to establish himself at the NBA level yet, there’s no question that he can play. He broke records held by Allen Iverson and J.J. Redick in high school. He had big numbers at Texas Tech and Georgetown in college.

            And now, he’s a dunk champion. He’s viral, again. Maybe this time the NBA door will open.

            “I’m not really worried what other people think, good or bad,” McClung said. “I’m just staying the course. My goal is to make an impact in the NBA, and I’m just going to keep working until that happens.”

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Mac McClung was not exactly an unknown.Long before he won the dunk contest at NBA All-Star Saturday, he was a YouTube phenomenon. It’s impossible to add up all the views that videos of McClung — everything from dunks to documentaries — had gotten, but it was in the hundreds of millions.Yet it all seems different now, after this 6-foot-2 boyish-looking guard from a small town in Virginia with trampolines for legs and only two NBA games on his resume became the league’s dunk champion and finally brought buzz back to an event that had been more criticized than celebrated over the last few years.“He saved the dunk contest,” Shaquille O’Neal said, and countless others echoed those sentiments.Time will tell if they’re right. But an event that is designed to create unforgettable moments — Michael Jordan taking off from the foul line, Vince Carter saying “it’s over” after a dunk, Aaron Gordon jumping over the Orlando Magic mascot, Dwight Howard donning the Superman cape — got a massive shot in the arm from a guy who now has more dunks in the contest (four) than he does in actual NBA games (one).“It’s a cliche, but you can really do whatever you want to do,” said McClung, who is on a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers and playing in the G League. “I’ve had so many people even at the highest level ... if you are a young kid, and someone who is an inspiration to you, someone that you respect so much tells you that you can’t do it, it doesn’t matter. Literally, if you manifest and put your mind to it, you can literally make your life and reinvent yourself every day.”The reactions from NBA players watching the show, both in Salt Lake City and elsewhere, were amazing.“Tough,” Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell shouted as he watched courtside, while several other All-Stars like Giannis Antetokounmpo — with his mouth open in disbelief — filmed the action on their phones.Golden State’s Stephen Curry said on Twitter: “Man was a viral (House of Highlights) high school dunk phenom, still working his way to the League, but lemme go get that dunk contest trophy right quick and bring it back to life!!! Unreal.”McClung knows he is an underdog story. He grew up playing football and baseball in Gate City, Virginia, before deciding sometime around sixth or seventh grade — standing barely 5 feet tall at that point — that basketball would be his priority.He started going viral in high school for his array of dunks, and he has handled all the attention that comes with internet fame as well as he can for years.“One thing with this game is you have to learn how to adapt,” McClung told The Associated Press last year. “I want to be known as someone who can help a team, help a championship team, be a good energy guy and a good culture guy and a good locker room guy.”So if he was an unknown to NBA fans, that’s maybe understandable.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815360,Paolo's Diary: His 1st All-Star weekend is in the books,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — (EDITOR’S NOTE — Orlando Magic rookie and No. 1 overall draft pick Paolo Banchero is doing a periodic diary with The Associated Press this season to chronicle his first year in the NBA. This is his fourth installment. The first chronicled him getting ready for the season, the second discussed the learning curve for the Magic, and the third revolved around Orlando seeing improvement on the floor. )

            My first All-Star weekend was awesome.

            Coming in, I didn’t know really what to expect. I knew it was going to be a lot going on, but I didn’t really know how I was going to handle it or what it was really going to be like. I’ve enjoyed myself, on and off the court, making a lot of appearances and whatnot, interacting with fans. And it’s just a blessing to be a part of this. I grew up watching every single All-Star game, every single skills competition, dunk contest. I always looked forward to that.











            And now I was part of it.

            Our team that was named for and coached by Pau Gasol won the Rising Stars games on Friday night. And our Rooks team was in the Skills Challenge on Saturday night. Didn’t win that one, but had a blast being back out there and being part of that atmosphere.

            But when it was over, I was officially on my All-Star break. A couple of days off before we get back to work at the AdventHealth Training Center with practice starting again Tuesday afternoon. Let me tell you, a couple days off means a lot. That goes a long way.

            I’m a young guy, but I’ve definitely got some aches and pains. I’m going to try and take advantage of these next couple days as much as I can. Get off my feet, relax my mind as well. I think also taking time to get your mind off basketball is big, just so when you come back, you feel much more refreshed and focused. Some guys, some people, even myself, we can get caught up in just wanting to be so much better all the time. Just constantly thinking about the work. You’re thinking about basketball all the time and you don’t let yourself ever breathe. But you have to. And that’s why I definitely need to take some time off. Just relax. I’m looking forward to that.

            I expected a lot of stars to be out here in Salt Lake City. I think what surprised me the most was all the non-basketball stars that are here. Musicians, other sports stars. Guy Fieri was here, the Food Network guy. I mean, everybody’s here. So just seeing all these people come out just to watch the NBA All-Star Weekend puts in perspective just how much the NBA means to everybody, and it’s a blessing to be a part of this.

            I even met Oprah Winfrey’s best friend. Gayle King of “CBS Mornings.” I met her in the hotel lobby. Maybe everybody doesn’t think that’s a huge deal, but that’s a huge deal. My grandma loves her, so I’ve seen her a lot on television. Meeting her, that was one where I was like, ‘Oh, wow.’ I’m usually not up at 7 in the morning to watch her show. But my grandmother is. And I know this was a big deal for her.

            Everybody knows how we started our season in Orlando. We were 5-20 and we’ve gone 19-15 since then. We’ve given ourselves a chance. It’s really exciting. Games are meaningful now. We got to win more than we lose, for sure, the rest of the way. And I think we’re ready to accept that challenge and go for it. I think guys are taking the time off right now, getting charged up, and I think we’re going to come back motivated. I’m excited. I’m excited. I think we’re going to make a strong push. Not going to guarantee anything, but I think we’re going to be able to make a strong push.

            We’ve got goals. I’ve got more goals now as well. I was part of All-Star Friday this year, part of All-Star Saturday. Next year, I want to be part of All-Star Sunday and be in the All-Star Game. We’re trying to get there. We’ll try to be a starter, but obviously that’s for down the road. Right now, I’ve just got to keep working. Stay focused, and things will take care of themselves, but All-Star Game next year, that’s definitely a goal for sure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815362,Critics reject changes to Roald Dahl books as censorship,"LONDON (AP) — Critics are accusing the British publisher of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s books of censorship after it removed colorful language from works such as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Matilda” to make them more acceptable to modern readers.

            A review of new editions of Dahl’s books now available in bookstores shows that some passages relating to weight, mental health, gender and race were altered. The changes made by Puffin Books, a division of Penguin Random House, first were reported by Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper.

            Augustus Gloop, Charlie’s gluttonous antagonist in “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” which originally was published in 1964, is no longer “enormously fat,” just “enormous.” In the new edition of “Witches,” a supernatural female posing as an ordinary woman may be working as a “top scientist or running a business” instead of as a “cashier in a supermarket or typing letters for a businessman.” 











            The word “black” was removed from the description of the terrible tractors in 1970s “The Fabulous Mr. Fox.” The machines are now simply “murderous, brutal-looking monsters.”

            Booker Prize-winning author Salman Rushdie was among those who reacted angrily to the rewriting of Dahl’s words. Rushdie lived in hiding for years after Iran’s Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989 issued a fatwa calling for his death because of the alleged blasphemy in his novel “The Satanic Verses.” He was attacked and seriously injured last year at an event in New York state.

            “Roald Dahl was no angel but this is absurd censorship,’’ Rushdie wrote on Twitter. “Puffin Books and the Dahl estate should be ashamed.’’

            The changes to Dahl’s books mark the latest skirmish in a debate over cultural sensitivity as campaigners seek to protect young people from cultural, ethnic and gender stereotypes in literature and other media. Critics complain revisions to suit 21st century sensibilities risks undermining the genius of great artists and preventing readers from confronting the world as it is.

            The Roald Dahl Story Company, which controls the rights to the books, said it worked with Puffin to review the texts because it wanted to ensure that “Dahl’s wonderful stories and characters continue to be enjoyed by all children today.” 

            The language was reviewed in partnership with Inclusive Minds, a collective which is working to make children's literature more inclusive and accessible. Any changes were “small and carefully considered,” the company said.

            It said the analysis started in 2020, before Netflix bought the Roald Dahl Story Company and embarked on plans to produce a new generation of films based on the author's books.

            “When publishing new print runs of books written years ago, it’s not unusual to review the language used alongside updating other details, including a book’s cover and page layout,’’ the company said. “Our guiding principle throughout has been to maintain the storylines, characters, and the irreverence and sharp-edged spirit of the original text.”

            Puffin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. 

            Dahl died in 1990 at the age of 74. His books, which have sold more than 300 million copies, have been translated into 68 languages and continue to be read by children around the world.

            But he is also a controversial figure because of antisemitic comments made throughout his life.

            The Dahl family apologized in 2020, saying it recognized the “lasting and understandable hurt caused by Roald Dahl’s antisemitic statements.”

            Regardless of his personal failings, fans of Dahl’s books celebrate his use of sometimes dark language that taps into the fears of children, as well as their sense of fun.

            PEN America, a community of some 7,500 writers that advocates for freedom of expression, said it was “alarmed” by reports of the changes to Dahl’s books. 

            “If we start down the path of trying to correct for perceived slights instead of allowing readers to receive and react to books as written, we risk distorting the work of great authors and clouding the essential lens that literature offers on society,” tweeted Suzanne Nossel, chief executive of PEN America.

            Laura Hackett, a childhood Dahl fan who is now deputy literary editor of London’s Sunday Times newspaper, had a more personal reaction to the news.

            “The editors at Puffin should be ashamed of the botched surgery they’ve carried out on some of the finest children’s literature in Britain,” she wrote. “As for me, I’ll be carefully stowing away my old, original copies of Dahl’s stories, so that one day my children can enjoy them in their full, nasty, colorful glory.”LONDON (AP) — Critics are accusing the British publisher of Roald Dahl’s classic children’s books of censorship after it removed colorful language from works such as “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” and “Matilda” to make them more acceptable to modern readers.A review of new editions of Dahl’s books now available in bookstores shows that some passages relating to weight, mental health, gender and race were altered.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815364,Blinken pledges more US aid to earthquake-struck Turkey,"United States Secretary of State Antony announced $100 million (€93 million) in fresh humanitarian aid to Turkey in Syria, almost two weeks after a devastating earthquake killed more than 44,000 people there.He arrived in Turkey on Sunday to support the quake-hit country and try to unblock Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's objections to Finland and Sweden joining NATO.Blinken and his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, took a helicopter tour to view the damage wrought by the earthquake in Hatay province.""When you see the extent of the damage, the number of buildings, the number of apartments, the number of homes that have been destroyed, it's going to take a massive effort to rebuild,"" he said afterward.The new US aid includes $50 million in emergency refugee and migration funds and $50 million in humanitarian assistance, Blinken said.""The most important thing right now is to get assistance to people who need it, to get them through the winter and to get them back on their feet,"" Blinken said.""We'll stick with it until we get the job done,"" he vowed.The additional aid is on top of the $85 million the US promised days after the earthquake. The US has also sent search and rescue teams, medical supplies and equipment.Blinken's trip had been planned before the earthquake and is his first to the NATO ally since taking office in 2021.That is in stark contrast with some of his predecessors, including Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson, who made the visit within the first three months of their terms.It shows the strained nature of the relations between the US and Turkey.Besides talks with Cavusoglu, Blinken was also set to meet Erdogan in Ankara on Monday.Turkey's refusal to ratify Sweden and Finland's NATO membership applications is likely to be discussed.Erdogan has complained that the Finns and, more particularly the Swedes, are too lenient toward groups it deems terror organizations or existential threats, including Kurdish groups.All existing NATO members' legislatures must ratify the entry of any potential new member.At the same time, Turkey wants to buy more F-16 fighter jets, but the sale is being blocked in Congress due to concerns over Turkey's human rights record and threats to Greece.Blinken would head to Greece late on Monday, where he will discuss Greek-Turkish tensions.lo/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/19,,

Formal identification of the body is pending.

            The search for Nicola Bulley, 45, has riveted Britain since she went missing on Jan. 27 while walking her dog along the River Wyre. It also generated a circus of sorts in the tiny community of St Michael’s on Wyre as speculation on social media spurred unofficial searches and attracted amateur sleuths.

            Would-be rescuers broke into derelict buildings despite police assurances that exhaustive searches were taking place. Some launched nighttime patrols, challenging locals who came face-to-face with strangers rattling their gates and prowling through their front gardens.











            Confidence in the police plummeted amid criticism that police had botched the search for Bulley, a mortgage adviser who was last seen shortly after taking her daughters, ages 6 and 9, to school on a Friday morning.

            The Lancashire police department, which dedicated 40 detectives to the investigation, came under increasing criticism the longer the case went unsolved. 

            In an apparent effort to respond, the force said Bulley was classified as a “high-risk” missing person “based on a number of specific vulnerabilities.” It later revealed she had struggled with alcohol and perimenopause before she vanished.

            The disclosure prompted a further backlash, with senior members of the government, opposition leaders and victims rights advocates decrying the release of such personal information.

            The police department said Friday that it would conduct an internal review of the investigation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815366,Kwan relying on steady approach in 2nd season with Guardians,"GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Steven Kwan is among several chess players on the Cleveland Guardians. He went over some moves with Bo Naylor on Sunday, and then watched Naylor take on Hunter Gaddis.

            Kwan has been playing for a couple of years, both in person and on a chess app. Asked who is the best player on the team, Kwan said he heard Josh Bell is pretty good.

            “But I would say, I think you have to assume that you're the best,” he continued.











            That's the mentality that took Kwan from a fifth-round pick in the 2018 amateur draft out of Oregon State to a surprising rookie season with Cleveland a year ago. The outfielder hit .298 with 52 RBIs, 19 steals and a .373 on-base percentage, helping the Guardians to the AL Central title.

            This spring training is a much different feeling for the 25-year-old Kwan, who counted Ichiro Suzuki as one of his favorite players while growing up in Northern California.

            “Not feeling like you're walking on pins and needles is definitely a much better place to be,” he said.

            If Kwan is feeling any more pressure after breaking out last season, it's hard to tell. He said he looks at every year in the majors as a challenge.

            “I make it a big point to never stay too high or too low. Just stay kind right in the middle, stay neutral,” he said. “I think that's going to be really important because I think once that I accept that oh, I'm this big leaguer, I've made it already, blah, blah, blah, then things start getting too comfortable and then things start slipping.”

            That mindset helped Kwan stay focused after he got off to a historic start last year. He reached base 18 times in his first five games, the most for a player in that span since 1901. He also went 116 pitches before he swung and missed, the most of any player to start a career since at least 2000, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

            After struggling in May, batting just .173 in 21 games, Kwan hit .341 in June, .314 in July, .296 in August and .325 in September, showing impressive consistency for a rookie. He scored 89 runs in 147 games and finished with more walks (62) than strikeouts (60).

            “He's got a lot of ways to impact us winning,” manager Terry Francona said. “Whether it's his legs, his defense, occasional home run, he's got a lot of ways to help us win.”

            Whether it's Kwan or any of Cleveland's young players that had a hand in the team's 2022 division title, Francona doesn't buy the idea that duplicating its success last year will be any more difficult than what it accomplished last season.

            “I think if you put pressure on yourself, it can become harder,” he said. “Try to tell our guys all the time, man, don't chase numbers. ... If you're a good player, show up and try to do something every day to help us win. You look up at the end of the year, you'll be where you're supposed to be.”

            In many ways, Kwan's first big league season looked a lot like what he accomplished in college and in the minors. He batted .328 and scored 96 runs in 156 games for Oregon State. After the 2020 minor league season was canceled because of COVID-19, he hit .328 with 12 homers and 44 RBIs over two minor league stops in 2021.

            He can hit, and he doesn't see any reason why that would change anytime soon.

            “I think just understanding where I come from, kind of my mindset last year, and continuing it forward,” he said.

            AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsGOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Steven Kwan is among several chess players on the Cleveland Guardians. He went over some moves with Bo Naylor on Sunday, and then watched Naylor take on Hunter Gaddis.Kwan has been playing for a couple of years, both in person and on a chess app. Asked who is the best player on the team, Kwan said he heard Josh Bell is pretty good.“But I would say, I think you have to assume that you're the best,” he continued.That's the mentality that took Kwan from a fifth-round pick in the 2018 amateur draft out of Oregon State to a surprising rookie season with Cleveland a year ago. The outfielder hit .298 with 52 RBIs, 19 steals and a .373 on-base percentage, helping the Guardians to the AL Central title.This spring training is a much different feeling for the 25-year-old Kwan, who counted Ichiro Suzuki as one of his favorite players while growing up in Northern California.“Not feeling like you're walking on pins and needles is definitely a much better place to be,” he said.If Kwan is feeling any more pressure after breaking out last season, it's hard to tell. He said he looks at every year in the majors as a challenge.“I make it a big point to never stay too high or too low. Just stay kind right in the middle, stay neutral,” he said. “I think that's going to be really important because I think once that I accept that oh, I'm this big leaguer, I've made it already, blah, blah, blah, then things start getting too comfortable and then things start slipping.”That mindset helped Kwan stay focused after he got off to a historic start last year. He reached base 18 times in his first five games, the most for a player in that span since 1901. He also went 116 pitches before he swung and missed, the most of any player to start a career since at least 2000, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.After struggling in May, batting just .173 in 21 games, Kwan hit .341 in June, .314 in July, .296 in August and .325 in September, showing impressive consistency for a rookie. He scored 89 runs in 147 games and finished with more walks (62) than strikeouts (60).“He's got a lot of ways to impact us winning,” manager Terry Francona said. “Whether it's his legs, his defense, occasional home run, he's got a lot of ways to help us win.”Whether it's Kwan or any of Cleveland's young players that had a hand in the team's 2022 division title, Francona doesn't buy the idea that duplicating its success last year will be any more difficult than what it accomplished last season.“I think if you put pressure on yourself, it can become harder,” he said. “Try to tell our guys all the time, man, don't chase numbers. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815367,No. 2 Indiana beats Purdue to clinch share of Big Ten title,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Indiana’s celebration began hours before tipoff Sunday as throngs of students and fans gathered outside Assembly Hall.

            Inside, the party continued as the program's first home sellout crowd finally watched a long-awaited net-cutting ceremony. It could be just the start for the Hoosiers.

            Mackenzie Holmes scored 20 points, Grace Berger added 14 points and 10 assists and No. 2 Indiana routed Purdue 83-60 to clinch a share of its first Big Ten regular-season championship since 1982-83, the first season of league play.











            Indiana has never won an outright title — yet — but players and coaches basked in the moment as they collected the trophy with music blaring in the background.

            “I was just so focused on the game, I didn’t even realize when I came out that we had won the championship,” Berger said. “I think Mackenzie told me. Once I realized it, it was really special.”

            The scene was yet another significant step Indiana's nine-year ascent under coach Teri Moren.

            Indiana (26-1, 16-1) already has broken the single-season school record and now, with 14 straight victories, it's also tied the second-longest streak in school history. They’ve won 18 consecutive home games and Moren, who became the Hoosiers’ career wins leader earlier this season, is two wins away from No. 200 with the Hoosiers and three away from No. 400 overall.

            But what Sunday revealed most about these Hoosiers (26-1, 16-1) is that they've done more than win games.

            On the day they honored the 40th anniversary of the only other women's regular-season championship team, Indiana also played in front of a fourth record crowd this season, 17,222. And they did it the pep band blaring, with fans repeatedly bouncing up and down, wearing players’ numbers and a deafening roar as the final seconds ticked off the clock.

            The combination doomed Purdue’s party-crashing hopes.

            
                Lasha Petree scored 23 points and joined the 2,000-point club. Abbey Ellis added 12 for the Boilermakers (17-8, 8-7). It wasn't nearly enough to avoid a ninth consecutive loss in this rivalry and second-year coach Katie Gearlds is looking to the Hoosiers as a model for her own program.

            “Teri, in nine years, what she’s done here ahs been remarkable, something we’d like to duplicate in West Lafayette,” the second-year coach said. “We understand it’s going to take some time, but huge congrats to Indiana today.”

            The Boilermakers still made it tough on Indiana.

            They closed the first half on a 7-0 run to cut a 10-point deficit to 37-34 and were still down five early in the second half.

            Then Berger and Holmes combined for six straight points and Chloe Moore-McNeil added a midrange jumper to make it 52-39 with 4:19 left in the third quarter.

            Purdue threatened to keep it close by answering with five straight only to give all those points backs back on one play — with Moore-McNeil making a 3-pointer and a foul called as the ball went through the net. Sydney Parrish hit both throws to give Indiana a 60-44 with 1:15 left in the third quarter and the only lingering question was long the postgame celebration would last.

            “We knew this was going to be another test, another challenge but there was this mindset of if we can do it in front of our home crowd what a great moment that would be,” Moren said after twirling the net toward the crowd. “To do it in front of 17,000 fans, our friends, our families makes it extra special.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Purdue: Gearlds has revived the Boilermakers program. Despite hanging around for a half, Purdue ran into a perfect second-half storm. Better days are ahead Gearlds and her program, maybe even this week, as they try to make their NCAA Tournament case. 

            Indiana: It's been a dream season for the Hoosiers. They've broken records on and off the court and now they've ended their title drought. But they insist they're not finished yet. Winning their first outright conference crown should set up Indiana for a deep run in the conference tourney and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Nobody can quibble with the Hoosiers' ranking. They're 9-0 against ranked teams, perfect at home and one win away from matching the school's longest winning streak. But unless defending national champion South Carolina's perfect season ends, Indiana will remain No. 2.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815368,Ant-Man opens big at box office with $104M for 'Quantumania',"NEW YORK (AP) — Phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe may have gotten off to a rocky start, but Ant-Man is bigger than ever at the box office. 

            
                “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" opened with $104 million in domestic ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday, easily surpassing the box-office debuts of the previous two Ant-Man films. The Walt Disney Co.'s “Quantumania” added another $121.3 million overseas to give the pint-sized hero a $225 million global launch. 

            It's easily the largest opening of the year so far. And “Quantumania” did so despite an atypically poor reception for the 31st MCU film. “Quantumania,"" starring Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Evangeline Lilly as the Wasp and Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, sits at 48% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the only MCU film to rank as rotten beside “Eternals” (47%). 











            Audiences also weren't thrilled with “Quantumania,” giving it a “B” CinemaScore. “Eternals” is the only other MCU film to receive a CinemaScore that low. 

            Those scores will pose the biggest concern for Marvel as it continues to unroll phase five of the MCU, following mixed reviews for the post-""Avengers: Endgame"" phase four of the comic-book franchise. Up next is “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” in May. 

            But good reviews or not, theaters hope “Quantumania” — the first blockbuster of the year — is a sign of things to come. After the turmoil of the past three years, there are some 30 more wide releases planned for 2023. 

            “It will feel almost in the coming weeks like a pre-pandemic moviegoing environment in terms of the marketplace,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. “That's very good news coming off a very tumultuous past two, three years. This is the start of a big many months for this industry. We've sort of been in the waiting room with holdovers like ‘Avatar’ and others."" 

            The first “Ant-Man” launched with $57.2 million domestically in 2015, the smallest opening for any movie in the MCU. It ultimately earned $519.3 million worldwide. Its sequel, “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” debuted three years later with $75.8 million and went to collect $622.7 million globally. 

            China was vital for both of those releases, with each topping $100 million there. But in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, fewer American movies have secured major releases in the heavily regulated Chinese market. Not since “Avengers: Endgame” in 2019 has a Disney release opened simultaneously in the U.S. and China. 

            Whether China will ever go back to those pre-pandemic numbers for U.S. movies, however, remains to be seen — especially as tensions continue to fester over the Chinese balloon surveillance program. “Quantumania” took in $19 million over the weekend in China. 

            In its 10th weekend of release, James Cameron's “Avatar: The Way of Water” remained in second place with $6.4 million. With $2.243 billion globally, Cameron's sci-fi sequel has now just surpassed Cameron's own “Titanic” — currently back in theaters for its 25th anniversary — as the third-highest grossing film ever. Now, only the 2009 “Avatar” and “Avengers: Endgame” rank above “The Way of Water.” 

            Last week’s top film, “Magic Mike’s Last Dance” slid to third place with $5.5 million. The Channing Tatum sequel has collected $18.1 million in two weeks. 

            Landing in fourth was Universal's “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which has enjoyed an unusually long run in theaters as the top family option since late December. With $5.3 million over the weekend, it has totaled $167 million domestically and more than $400 million worldwide. 

            Only one new film went into wide release against “Quantumania."" Open Road and Briarcliff Entertainment debuted “Marlowe,” with Liam Neeson playing Raymond Chandler's classic private eye, in 2,281 locations. “Marlowe,"" though, only mustered $1.9 million. 

            Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

            1. “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,” $104 million. 

            2. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $6.1 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815370,"Richard Belzer, stand-up comic and TV detective, dies at 78","NEW YORK (AP) — Richard Belzer, the longtime stand-up comedian who became one of TV's most indelible detectives as John Munch in ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and “Law & Order: SVU,” has died. He was 78. 

            Belzer died Sunday at his home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, in southern France, his longtime friend Bill Scheft said. Scheft, a writer who had been working on a documentary about Belzer, said there was no known cause of death, but that Belzer had been dealing with circulatory and respiratory issues. The actor Henry Winkler, Belzer's cousin, tweeted, “Rest in peace Richard.” 

            For more than two decades and across 10 series — even including appearances on “30 Rock” and “Arrested Development” — Belzer played the wise-cracking, acerbic homicide detective prone to conspiracy theories. Belzer first played Munch on a 1993 episode of “Homicide” and last played him in 2016 on “Law & Order: SVU.” 











            Belzer never auditioned for the role. After hearing him on “The Howard Stern Show,” executive producer Barry Levinson brought the comedian in to read for the part. 

            “I would never be a detective. But if I were, that's how I'd be,"" Belzer once said. ""They write to all my paranoia and anti-establishment dissidence and conspiracy theories. So it's been a lot of fun for me. A dream, really.” 

            From that unlikely beginning, Belzer's Munch would become one of television's longest-running characters and a sunglasses-wearing presence on the small screen for more than two decades. In 2008, Belzer published the novel “I Am Not a Cop!” with Michael Ian Black. He also helped write several books on conspiracy theories, about things like President John F. Kennedy's assassination and Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

            “He made me laugh a billion times,” his longtime friend and fellow stand-up Richard Lewis said Sunday on Twitter. 

            Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Belzer was drawn to comedy, he said, during an abusive childhood in which his mother would beat him and his older brother, Len. He would do impressions of his childhood idol, Jerry Lewis. “My kitchen was the toughest room I ever worked,"" Belzer told People magazine in 1993. 

            After being expelled from Dean Junior College in Massachusetts, Belzer embarked on a life of stand-up in New York in 1972. At Catch a Rising Star, Belzer became a regular performer and an emcee. He made his big-screen debut in Ken Shapiro's 1974 film “The Groove Tube,"" a TV satire co-starring Chevy Chase, a film that grew out of the comedy group Channel One that Belzer was a part of.

            Before “Saturday Night Live"" changed the comedy scene in New York, Belzer performed with John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray and others on the National Lampoon Radio Hour. In 1975, he became the warm-up comic for the newly launched “SNL."" While many cast members quickly became famous, Belzer's roles were mostly smaller cameos. He later said “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels reneged on a promise to work him into the show. 

            But Belzer became one of the era's top stand-ups. He was known especially for his biting, cynical attitude and his witty, sometime combative banter with the audience. As one of the most influential comedians of the '70s, Belzer was a master of crowd work.

            ""My style evolved from dealing with drunken people at twelve, one, two in the morning and trying to be like an alchemist and get the lead of their lives and turn it into golden jokes,"" Belzer told Terry Gross on “Fresh Air.” 

            Belzer would later write an irreverent self-help book titled “How to Be a Stand-Up Comic” with advice on things like how to to apologize to Frank Sinatra when you made fun of him onstage or how to deal with hecklers. One of his favorite lines was: “I have a microphone. You have a beer. God has a plan and you’re not in on it.” 

            Belzer often played a stand-up comic in film, including in 1980s' “Fame"" and 1983's “Scarface.” He had small roles here and there, including in ""Night Shift"" in 1982, and “Fletch Lives” in 1989. But Munch would change Belzer's career. 

            As ”Homicide"" co-creator Tom Fontana said, ""Munch was the spice in these dishes,"" Belzer told the AV Club. “Munch was based on a real guy in Baltimore who was a star detective, in a way. He would come onto grisly murder scenes, start doing one-liners, because someone had to break the tension. So Munch served a very important function. Not only was he a dissident who said what was on his mind, he kind of had the gallows humor that’s needed in a homicide squad.”

            When “Homicide” wrapped in early 1999, Munch called Dick Wolf to see if the character could join another NBC series, “Law & Order,"" where Munch had popped up in a few previous episodes. Wolf already had his leads for “Law & Order,” but he wanted Belzer to star in a spinoff. That fall, “Law & Order: SVU” premiered, with Belzer starring alongside Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni in a storyline written as though Munch had transferred from Baltimore to New York. 

            “Richard Belzer’s Detective John Munch is one of television’s iconic characters,"" Wolf said in a statement.

            “I first worked with Richard on the ‘Law & Order’/‘Homicide’ crossover and loved the character so much,"" Wolf said. ""I wanted to make him one of the original characters on ‘SVU.’ The rest is history. Richard brought humor and joy into all our lives, was the consummate professional and we will all miss him very much.”

            Belzer is survived by his third wife, the actress Harlee McBride, whom he married in 1985. For the past 20 years, they lived mostly in France, in homes he purchased partially from the proceeds of a lawsuit with Hulk Hogan. In 1985, Belzer had Hogan as a guest on his cable TV talk show “Hot Properties” to perform a chin-lock on him. Belzer passed out, hit his head and sued Hogan for $5 million. They settled out of court. ___

            This story has been corrected to reflect that Belzer died in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France, not Bozouls, as Scheft originally told The Hollywood Reporter.NEW YORK (AP) — Richard Belzer, the longtime stand-up comedian who became one of TV's most indelible detectives as John Munch in ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and “Law & Order: SVU,” has died. He was 78.Belzer died Sunday at his home in Beaulieu-sur-Mer, in southern France, his longtime friend Bill Scheft said. Scheft, a writer who had been working on a documentary about Belzer, said there was no known cause of death, but that Belzer had been dealing with circulatory and respiratory issues. The actor Henry Winkler, Belzer's cousin, tweeted, “Rest in peace Richard.”For more than two decades and across 10 series — even including appearances on “30 Rock” and “Arrested Development” — Belzer played the wise-cracking, acerbic homicide detective prone to conspiracy theories. Belzer first played Munch on a 1993 episode of “Homicide” and last played him in 2016 on “Law & Order: SVU.”Belzer never auditioned for the role. After hearing him on “The Howard Stern Show,” executive producer Barry Levinson brought the comedian in to read for the part.“I would never be a detective. But if I were, that's how I'd be,"" Belzer once said. ""They write to all my paranoia and anti-establishment dissidence and conspiracy theories. So it's been a lot of fun for me. A dream, really.”From that unlikely beginning, Belzer's Munch would become one of television's longest-running characters and a sunglasses-wearing presence on the small screen for more than two decades. In 2008, Belzer published the novel “I Am Not a Cop!” with Michael Ian Black. He also helped write several books on conspiracy theories, about things like President John F. Kennedy's assassination and Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.“He made me laugh a billion times,” his longtime friend and fellow stand-up Richard Lewis said Sunday on Twitter.Born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Belzer was drawn to comedy, he said, during an abusive childhood in which his mother would beat him and his older brother, Len. He would do impressions of his childhood idol, Jerry Lewis. “My kitchen was the toughest room I ever worked,"" Belzer told People magazine in 1993.After being expelled from Dean Junior College in Massachusetts, Belzer embarked on a life of stand-up in New York in 1972. At Catch a Rising Star, Belzer became a regular performer and an emcee. He made his big-screen debut in Ken Shapiro's 1974 film “The Groove Tube,"" a TV satire co-starring Chevy Chase, a film that grew out of the comedy group Channel One that Belzer was a part of.Before “Saturday Night Live"" changed the comedy scene in New York, Belzer performed with John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray and others on the National Lampoon Radio Hour. In 1975, he became the warm-up comic for the newly launched “SNL."" While many cast members quickly became famous, Belzer's roles were mostly smaller cameos. He later said “SNL” creator Lorne Michaels reneged on a promise to work him into the show.But Belzer became one of the era's top stand-ups.

            Second-half goals from Emerson Royal and substitute Son Heung-min saw Spurs move ahead of top four rival Newcastle, which has played one game less. 

            Newcastle's 2-0 loss to Liverpool a day earlier gave Antonio Conte's side the chance to take the advantage in the race for Champions League qualification.











            Son delivered the perfect response to being dropped after a poor run of form by coming off the bench at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to seal the win in the absence of Conte, who remains in Italy after gallbladder surgery.

            The loss for West Ham ended the relegation-fighting team's three-match unbeaten run in the league and left it in 18th place. 

            Tottenham opened the scoring in the 56th minute when Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg unlocked the West Ham defense with a ball for Ben Davies, who cut inside and teed up fellow wing back Emerson to slot home from 14 meters.

            Emerson, who had been booed in last month’s loss to Aston Villa, continued his resurgence with a second goal in five league games.

            Spurs assistant Cristian Stellini introduced Son in the 68th and he needed just four minutes to make his mark.

            Harry Kane played into the path of Son, who took the ball in his stride and slotted beyond Lucasz Fabianski to score for the eighth time against West Ham.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815388,"Joiner, No. 23 NC State pull away late to beat rival UNC","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — DJ Burns Jr. knew North Carolina State teammate Jarkel Joiner was ready for a big moment.

            “He came out of a timeout, he looked me dead in my face and he said, ‘Set me some ballscreens, I’m hot,'"" Burns said.

            Joiner backed it up, too.











            The graduate transfer took over for No. 23 N.C. State during a critical second-half stretch, matching his season high with 29 points to lead the Wolfpack past rival North Carolina 77-69 on Sunday.

            Joiner had 20 of his points after the break for the Wolfpack (21-7, 11-6 Atlantic Coast Conference). That included an impressive flurry in a tight game that finally gave N.C. State some breathing room that turned into a strong finishing kick.

            “Just confidence, man,” Joiner said of his big second half. “My teammates and my coaches trust in me.”

            Joiner's arrival from Mississippi has been a critical piece to Kevin Keatts' sixth-season surge, providing scoring and heady veteran play for a team needing an infusion of experience. It's why N.C. State (21-7, 11-6) has bounced back from last year's 21-loss season and took Round 2 with the Tar Heels (16-11, 8-8) after losing last month's meeting in nearby Chapel Hill.

            “It's tough in this league when you don't have a quarterback, when you don't have a point guard,” Keatts said. ""And he makes us better.”

            The Tar Heels didn't have an answer for him, with Joiner making 8 of 11 shots after the break. That included a huge transition 3-pointer from right in front of the Wolfpack bench — which pushed N.C. State to a 67-60 lead with 4:47 left, the largest lead by any team to that point.

            He followed a bit later with a tough stepback jumper against Caleb Love that pushed the lead to nine, capping a 12-1 that had given the Wolfpack control and turned PNC Arena into a screaming frenzy of unleashed rivalry spite from the Wolfpack crowd.

            Burns added 14 of his 18 points after halftime for N.C. State, which shot 64.5% in the second half and had just three turnovers for the game.

            Love scored 23 points to lead UNC, while Armando Bacot had 16 points and 14 rebounds. But the Tar Heels continued a February crash that has put their NCAA Tournament chances in growing jeopardy, falling for the fifth time in six games after shooting just 35.5%.

            “They got hot, Joiner got hot, and it kind of erupted the crowd,"" Love said. ""Playing in a place like this, it's tough. you've got to execute at the highest level and we didn't do that.”

            BIG PICTURE

            UNC: The Tar Heels have gone from preseason No. 1 in the AP Top 25 to scrapping for an NCAA bid. They entered Sunday with an 0-8 record in Quadrant 1 games, the top tier on a postseason resume. This one could've helped, but it instead ended with Wolfpack fans chanting at them in the final seconds: “NIT! NIT!”

            “Coach (Hubert) Davis said he's not giving up on us and we're going to continue to battle,” said R.J. Davis, who had seven points on 2-for-13 shooting. “I mean, that's the only thing you can do right now.”

            N.C. State: In the AP Top 25 for the first time in four years, Keatts' squad is pursuing its first NCAA berth since 2018. Sunday was about staying on that track and, of course, beating a rival that has largely owned the series of late by winning 36 of 41 meetings entering Sunday.

            CELEBRATORY MOMENTS

            The Wolfpack eventually went up 75-63 when Ernest Ross ran down a long pass ahead and saved it behind him to a trailing Casey Morsell for a layup that elevated the ear-ringing noise even more with only 89 seconds left.

            The Tar Heels called timeout, and N.C. State players began to celebrate, with Terquavion Smith walking near the baseline with arms raised to motion for more noise from courtside fans. Burns stood a few feet away, popping the front of his jersey to the roaring fans in the end zone.

State (21-7, 11-6) has bounced back from last year's 21-loss season and took Round 2 with the Tar Heels (16-11, 8-8) after losing last month's meeting in nearby Chapel Hill.“It's tough in this league when you don't have a quarterback, when you don't have a point guard,” Keatts said. ""And he makes us better.”The Tar Heels didn't have an answer for him, with Joiner making 8 of 11 shots after the break. That included a huge transition 3-pointer from right in front of the Wolfpack bench — which pushed N.C. State to a 67-60 lead with 4:47 left, the largest lead by any team to that point.He followed a bit later with a tough stepback jumper against Caleb Love that pushed the lead to nine, capping a 12-1 that had given the Wolfpack control and turned PNC Arena into a screaming frenzy of unleashed rivalry spite from the Wolfpack crowd.Burns added 14 of his 18 points after halftime for N.C. State, which shot 64.5% in the second half and had just three turnovers for the game.Love scored 23 points to lead UNC, while Armando Bacot had 16 points and 14 rebounds. But the Tar Heels continued a February crash that has put their NCAA Tournament chances in growing jeopardy, falling for the fifth time in six games after shooting just 35.5%.“They got hot, Joiner got hot, and it kind of erupted the crowd,"" Love said. ""Playing in a place like this, it's tough. you've got to execute at the highest level and we didn't do that.”BIG PICTUREUNC: The Tar Heels have gone from preseason No. 1 in the AP Top 25 to scrapping for an NCAA bid. They entered Sunday with an 0-8 record in Quadrant 1 games, the top tier on a postseason resume. This one could've helped, but it instead ended with Wolfpack fans chanting at them in the final seconds: “NIT! NIT!”“Coach (Hubert) Davis said he's not giving up on us and we're going to continue to battle,” said R.J. Davis, who had seven points on 2-for-13 shooting. “I mean, that's the only thing you can do right now.”N.C. State: In the AP Top 25 for the first time in four years, Keatts' squad is pursuing its first NCAA berth since 2018. Sunday was about staying on that track and, of course, beating a rival that has largely owned the series of late by winning 36 of 41 meetings entering Sunday.CELEBRATORY MOMENTSThe Wolfpack eventually went up 75-63 when Ernest Ross ran down a long pass ahead and saved it behind him to a trailing Casey Morsell for a layup that elevated the ear-ringing noise even more with only 89 seconds left.The Tar Heels called timeout, and N.C. State players began to celebrate, with Terquavion Smith walking near the baseline with arms raised to motion for more noise from courtside fans. Burns stood a few feet away, popping the front of his jersey to the roaring fans in the end zone.UP NEXTUNC: At Notre Dame on Wednesday.N.C.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815389,Guardians' Francona feeling good after recent health issues,"GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — Cleveland Guardians manager Terry Francona is feeling much better these days. He has a rod in his left foot that bothers him when he wears his beloved flip-flops, but that's a breeze compared with what he experienced in the past.

            The former big league infielder dealt with gastrointestinal problems and blood-clotting issues in 2020. Following surgeries on his hip and toe, he also had to step away from the team in 2021. But his outlook has stayed the same throughout.

            “Everybody says, ‘Do you have perspective?’” Francona said Sunday as he continued preparations for his 11th season with Cleveland. “I hate when we lose. I really enjoy when we win. But I love doing what we do, but I always have. I've always enjoyed it.











            “If I wasn't in baseball, all I'd be doing was wishing I was in baseball.”

            Francona, 63, is thankful that he isn't limping as much as before, making it easier for him to do his job. And it doesn't look as if he has lost anything on that front.

            The two-time World Series winner with Boston directed a young group of Guardians to the AL Central title in 2022. He has led Cleveland to four division titles, six postseasons and one World Series since 2013.

            “We're coming off a year where we kind of maximized our input and our output, and a lot of that has to do with Tito,” Guardians ace Shane Bieber said. “To see him smiling and happy and healthy, he was always smiling and happy regardless of what he was going through. So he's a consistent driving factor in here, and his energy's always infectious and contagious.”

            Outfielder Steven Kwan said Francona is “extremely important” when it comes to the team's success.

            “I think just him being in the clubhouse, it breeds confidence, first of all,” he said. “I mean you kind of just feel a little easier when he's walking around, you know that the big dog is at the top, at the helm.”

            STICKING AROUND

            Baltimore Orioles CEO John Angelos is hoping to complete a new lease for Camden Yards with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore at some point this summer.

            The current lease for the ballpark expires at the end of this year. The Orioles and Moore released a statement on Feb. 1 that touted a “multi-decade, public-private partnership” to revitalize the Camden Yards sports complex.

            Speaking on Sunday at Baltimore's spring training complex in Florida, Angelos said he thinks the new lease will be finished in the next six months.

            “I mean, I’d love to have that as an All-Star break gift for everybody, really, in the community,"" Angelos said. ""There’s just no there there other than we’re going to get that done. And that’s always been one of the things I committed to. I have no intention of not seeing that happen, and I know the governor and his folks are just as keen on it as we are.”

            Angelos declined to discuss the length of general manager Mike Elias' contract, but he praised the work of both Elias and manager Brandon Hyde.

            ""I’m here for the long haul. Mike is here for the long haul. Brandon's here for the long haul,” Angelos said. “We are all fully vested. We’re not going anywhere. And nobody is a short-timer. Nobody is expiring in a year or two years or anything like that.”

            RIZZO READY

            New York Yankees first baseman Anthony Rizzo spent the offseason getting his troublesome back ready for the new season.

            Although he is feeling great, the slugger knows it’s a problem that could return.

            “It’s just something that you have to manage,” Rizzo said in Florida. “I think anyone who’s had back pain, it kind of comes out of nowhere. I think I’d be crazy to sit here and say I won’t have any back issues this year because every year it seems like a little something pops up. I definitely feel confident with the daily preparation and routine.”

            Rizzo hit just .224 in 130 games last year, which was 41 points under his career average.

            New York manager Aaron Boone thinks the back issues and the now-restricted defensive shifts impacted Rizzo’s batting average.

            “There were certainly moments in the season, or little weeks here, where he was kind of grinding through it, battling it and it probably did have an impact on him” Boone said. “I think he’s one of those guys that will significantly benefit from the shift rules. He was shifted on as much as a lot of people. He faced a lot of four-man outfields with the shift, so those things kind of hurt him a little.”

            WORTH NOTING

            Major League Baseball announced that San Diego Padres pitcher Nick Martinez will replace Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw on the 30-man roster for the United States for the World Baseball Classic.

            Martinez went 4-4 with a 3.47 ERA in 47 games for San Diego last season, making 10 starts and collecting eight saves. He finalized a $26 million, three-year contract with the Padres in November.

            Kershaw announced Friday that he wouldn't be able to participate in the WBC. The three-time Cy Young Award winner didn’t specify the reasons that would prevent him from participating.

            ANNOUNCEMENT

            Anderson Comas, a minor leaguer in the Chicago White Sox organization, says he is gay.

            The 23-year-old Comas made the announcement in an Instagram post.

            “Being a professional baseball player is the best thing that happened to me,” Comas wrote, “so I just wanna say something to those people that says that gay people can not be someone in this life, well look at me I’m Gay and I’m a professional athlete so that didn’t stopped me to make my dreams come true.”

            Comas signed with Chicago as a free agent in July 2016. He started off as an outfielder, but he was converted to a pitcher before last season. He went 1-0 with a 6.35 ERA in 11 appearances last year for the organization's rookie-level team in the Arizona Complex League.

            Chris Getz, an assistant general manager for the White Sox in charge of player development, said Comas told the organization last year.

            “With his social media post today, we are all so proud of Anderson and that he is comfortable sharing such an important personal part of his life so openly,” Getz said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815390,Blackhawks C Toews dealing with long COVID-19 symptoms,"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews announced Sunday that he is dealing with symptoms of long COVID-19 and chronic immune response syndrome.

            Toews hasn't played since Jan. 28. The Blackhawks placed the 34-year-old center on injured reserve on Wednesday with what they said was a non-COVID-19-related illness.

            “It has been really challenging to play through these symptoms,” Toews said in a statement released by the team. ""In the last few weeks, it has reached the point where I had no choice but to step back and concentrate on getting healthy. I am thankful for the patience and support of my teammates, the coaching staff, and the entire Blackhawks organization.”











            Toews missed the 2020-21 season with what he described as chronic immune response syndrome.

            Toews has spent his entire career with Chicago, winning three Stanley Cup titles. But he is eligible for free agency after this season.

            “We're going to work with him and support him in whatever he needs to make sure he's feeling good and feeling strong and in a spot where he can come back on the ice,"" general manager Kyle Davidson said. ""We'll take it day by day, but the hope is that he can still play some games here down the stretch.”

            Asked about moving Toews by the March 3 trade deadline, Davidson said he isn't thinking about that.

            “We're trying to help him get back to full strength and that's totally secondary,” he said.

            Toews had 12 goals and 25 assists in 71 games when he returned to action last year, and he had looked stronger this season. He has 14 goals and 14 assists in 46 games for the last-place Blackhawks.

            “We feel for him and just supporting him right now,” coach Luke Richardson said. “He was back this week, first steps of getting back and working out and skating, and unfortunately he wasn't getting the results that he wanted.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815391,League leader Barcelona beats Cadiz 2-0 after turbulent week,"MADRID (AP) — With yet another win, Barcelona left its problems off the field after a turbulent week.

            Barcelona defeated Cadiz 2-0 on Sunday as it extended its winning streak and lead over Real Madrid in the Spanish league.

            Sergi Roberto and Robert Lewandowski scored late in the first half to give Barcelona its seventh straight league win and get its lead over second-place Madrid back to eight points. 











            Madrid had cut the gap to five points with a 2-0 win at Osasuna on Saturday.

            “We played well in the first half,” Barcelona coach Xavi said. “There was a bit of a letdown in the second, but it was expected. We have been playing a lot, the team is tired.”

            Barcelona's home game at Camp Nou came after it became publicly known that a state prosecutor is probing Barcelona’s payment of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of the Spanish federation’s refereeing committee. Barcelona has been heavily criticized but denied any wrongdoing, saying it paid for reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.

            On the field, Roberto opened the scoring in the 43rd with a shot from the middle of the area after Lewandowski’s header off a cross by Ferran Torres was cleared by a defender on the goal line.

            Lewandowski added to the lead before halftime with a low shot from just inside the area for his league-leading 15th goal – and first overall after three scoreless matches in all competitions.

            It was the 17th clean sheet for Barcelona in the league this season.

            Cadiz, coming off two wins in its last three matches, thought it had opened the scoring in the 19th but the goal by Roger was disallowed for offside. The club from southern Spain dropped to 17th place, two points from the relegation zone.

            Xavi made some changes to the lineup ahead of Thursday’s trip to England to face Manchester United in the Europa League. The teams drew 2-2 in Barcelona last week. 

            GRIEZMANN THRIVES

            Antoine Griezmann made a great run from near the halfway line to score for Atletico Madrid in a 1-0 victory against Athletic Bilbao, allowing Diego Simeone’s team to strengthen its hold on the final Champions League place.

            The goal saw Griezmann speeding past two defenders before entering the area and firing a low shot into the net in the 73rd minute, giving Atletico its fourth win in five league matches. 

            The victory left the team four points ahead of fifth-place Real Betis, which won 2-1 against Valladolid on Saturday. Atletico is two points behind third-place Real Sociedad, which drew 1-1 with Celta Vigo on Saturday.

            Atletico is 10 points behind city rival Real Madrid and 18 points behind league leader Barcelona.

            Bilbao, which was trying to win its third league game in a row, stayed in seventh place and missed a chance to move closer to the European places.

            “It was a very important match,” Griezmann said. “We have to keep this going, keep getting the victories and the three points.”

            It was Griezmann’s second goal in the last 17 matches with Atletico in all competitions. 

            “I was looking forward to scoring again,” Griezmann said. “These are streaks, and I hope I can keep this one going.”

            SEVILLA HELD

            Sevilla lost some momentum after being held to a 1-1 draw at Rayo Vallecano. 

            Suso scored in the 29th for 12th-place Sevilla, which was looking to win its third in a row in the league. 

            The result kept Sevilla unbeaten in seven straight league games at Rayo, which equalized with Florian Lejeune in the 65th. 

            Rayo, which has drawn two in a row, stayed in sixth place and missed a chance to move closer to the Champions League places.

            LATE WIN

            Sergi Darder scored two minutes into stoppage time as 13th-place Espanyol defeated last-place Elche 1-0 to end a three-game winless streak and move further away from the relegation zone.

            Elche won its first league match of the season two rounds ago, but has two consecutive defeats since then.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815392,Edey has 21st double-double as No. 3 Purdue tops Ohio State,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Zach Edey had 26 points and 11 rebounds for his 21st double-double this season to lead No. 3 Purdue past Ohio State 82-55 on Sunday.

            Trey Kaufman-Renn scored 11 points and David Jenkins Jr. added nine points for the Boilermakers (24-4, 13-4 Big Ten). Mason Gillis contributed seven points and 10 rebounds for Purdue, which had a 44-21 rebounding advantage.

            “It not just Edey, their (power forwards) really go to the glass,” said Ohio State coach Chris Holtmann, whose team lost its eighth consecutive game. “We had a couple missed block-outs. But we got shoved underneath a lot. They’re always active. They're the third-ranked offensive rebounding team in the country. They’re an elite offensive rebounding team.”











            The Boilermakers were motivated after being outrebounded 35-23 in host Maryland's 68-54 victory on Thursday. That was just the third time Purdue was outrebounded this season.

            Gillis said the team worked on more mental reps than physical reps to regain its rebounding form.

            “It's more about getting our minds right and prepared for the game,” he said.

            Purdue coach Matt Painter said his team did a good job being quick to the basketball.

            “In our game at Ohio State, I don't think we did as good a job on our box-outs,” Painter said. “I thought we did a pretty good job there. Being able to outrebound someone by 23 is pretty impressive.”

            Brice Sensabaugh led the Buckeyes (11-16, 3-13) with 20 points. Sean McNeil added 10 points for Ohio State.

            Purdue shot 50% while holding Ohio State to 40%.

            The Boilermakers pulled away in the second half by outscoring the Buckeyes 44-26, leading by as many as 31 points.

            Edey said playing the first 5 minutes of each half is always a point of emphasis.

            “We wanted to come out in the second half and set the tone,"" Edey said. “Leads can evaporate in the first five minutes. We want to take those first five minutes and control them.""

            Edey scored 16 points on 7 of 11 shooting in the first half to help Purdue to a 38-29 halftime lead. He had a rebound dunk just before intermission.

            Purdue did most of its damage from the foul line in the first half as Ohio State committed 13 fouls. The Boilermakers made 15 of 19 free throws and 10 of 23 shots in the opening half.

            “I thought our guys competed,” Holtmann said. “We just had too many scoring droughts.”

            The Buckeyes were without starting forward Zed Key, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury.

            BIG PICTURE

            Ohio State: The Buckeyes’ free fall continues as they lost for the 13th time in the last 14 games. The slide started with a 71-69 loss to Purdue on Jan. 5.

            Purdue: After dropping three of their last four games, the Boilermakers were able to get back on track. With his eighth rebound on Sunday, Edey became the second Purdue player after Joe Barry Carroll to have at least 1,250 points and 750 rebounds by the end of his junior season.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Following the 14-point loss at Maryland, Purdue rebounded with a victory over Ohio State. However, Purdue likely will drop a couple of spots when the new rankings are released Monday.

            PROVINDING SPARK

            With Purdue's Braden Smith picking up two fouls in the first half, Jenkins played more than usual. Jenkins, a graduate transfer from Utah, played 22 minutes and hit two 3-pointers.

            Painter said Jenkins has been a great teammate and a great leader.

            “There are a lot of games where you want more minutes and how you handle that is so important,"" Painter said. ""He's been very positive even though it's been frustrating for him.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815393,Man United anticipates new owners and a fresh era of success,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — It has been a week to remember for Manchester United. 

            After an epic encounter with Barcelona and at least two takeover bids, a 3-0 win against Leicester on Sunday kept Erik ten Hag's team firmly in the race for the Premier League title. 

            It's fair to say there is a lot happening both on and off the field at a club that is entering the dawn of a new era. 











            With bids from Qatar and billionaire fan Jim Ratcliffe confirmed after Friday's deadline for initial offers, Old Trafford was already in a celebratory mood, with many fans eagerly anticipating the departure of unpopular current American owners, the Glazer family. 

            But Ten Hag is also giving them much to cheer with the impact he has had on a team that has gone 10 years since it last won the league title under iconic former manager Alex Ferguson. 

            No wonder that one leading fan group insisted before before kickoff that the Dutchman must be integral to any new owner's plans. 

            “After the frustrations of the last decade, it is clear that enormous strides are being taken,” United’s Supporters’ Trust said Sunday. “Any prospective bidder needs to explicitly commit to backing Erik and his plans to restore United to glory.”

            Both Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani and Ratcliffe have vowed to return United to its former glories and it is not yet known how many other bids were submitted to merchant bank Raine Group by the time of Friday’s deadline. 

            But Ten Hag is doing an impressive enough job of turning the club’s fortunes around even without the aid of new owners as his team remains in contention to win four trophies in his first season in charge.

            The win against Leicester kept the pressure on Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the table and Ten Hag says the takeover will not be allowed to become a distraction. 

            “We are committed with this club, it is our club, in our heart, but it is not our job (to talk about the sale),” he said. “We focus on football and perform and that is what the players and staff have to do.”

            Whether Ten Hag likes it or not, the topic of United's next owner is not going away. 

            There were repeated chants of “We want Glazers out” during the Leicester match and one fan had a message of opposition to Sheikh Jassim, with a sign which simply read “No to Qatar”.

            Qatar was criticized for its treatment of migrant workers in the buildup to hosting last year's World Cup and its human rights record.

            After United's LGBTQ supporters’ group, the Rainbow Devils, raised “deep concern” about some bids, the Supporters' Trust added it noted “the importance that any owner respects the rights of all people, particularly women and the LGBTQ+ community.”

            On the field, Ten Hag’s team is on a roll and faces a crunch week, which includes the second leg of the Europa League playoff against Barcelona at Old Trafford on Thursday and then the League Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley three days later. 

            The 2-2 draw with Barca at the Nou Camp was the latest indication that United is ready to challenge Europe’s elite again and the second leg was on Ten Hag's mind as he spoke to supporters on his way to the locker room after Leicester. 

            “I say come Thursday. It is a big game, make sure you are there and we beat Barcelona together,” he said afterward. 

            If Rashford continues his current run of form then there is every chance the fans will be celebrating again after that match. 

            The striker has scored 16 goals in his last 17 games and a career-best 24 for the season. 

            Jadon Sancho also showed signs that he is on the way back to top form by coming off the bench to seal the win that leaves United three points behind second-place Manchester City and five off leader Arsenal. 

            Not that Ten Hag was pleased with his team’s first-half performance, which saw Leicester twice come close to taking the lead before Rashford scored. 

            “We have to follow the rules and principles from our way of playing. When you don’t, it is getting a mess,” Ten Hag said. “When you face a good opponent like Leicester you will concede chances. It was only due to David de Gea that we don’t concede a goal. We were really lucky at halftime we were one goal up — great pass from Bruno (Fernandes), great finish from Rashy. But the rest is rubbish.”

            FIGHT FOR TOP FOUR

            Newcastle's recent slump is proving costly and Tottenham took full advantage on Sunday by moving up to fourth in the table. 

            It looks set to be a fierce contest for the last of the Champions League qualifying spots, but Spurs lead the way after Emerson Royal and Son Heung-min scored in a 2-0 win against West Ham.

            The Londoners are now one point ahead of Newcastle, having played a game more.

            Liverpool can also be considered serious contenders after beating Newcastle 2-0 on Saturday.

            Newcastle has now failed to win any of its last four games in the league. 

            Liverpool, meanwhile, is seven points off Tottenham with two games in hand and looks to have its confidence back after a season of struggle.

            Reese had her ninth first-half double-double,  Carson had a career-high five 3-pointers before the break, and No. 5 LSU raced past Florida 90-79 Sunday.

            
                Reese finished with 25 points and 16 rebounds for her 25th double-double of the season, two shy of Sylvia Fowles' LSU single-season record. She also had five assists, three blocks and two steals.











            Carson is the one who busted out, also scoring 25 points, a career-high for the West Virginia graduate transfer.

            “She had a rough last game but ... she’s a really great 3-point shooter,” Reese said. “To be able to have her make key shots, she was the key today for us to get the victory.”

            Carson went 7 of 14 behind the arc, helping the Tigers to a season-best 11 3s on 20 attempts. The last time LSU had a player hit seven 3-pointers was in 1997.

            LSU coach Kim Mulkey said her team was well prepared.

            “We knew if we just reversed the ball we were going to get any shot we wanted,” Mulkey said. “Jazmine got a lot of good open looks and thank goodness she was hitting them.”

            LaDazhia Williams added 15 and 10 and Flau’jae Johnson scored 12 points for LSU (25-1, 13-1 Southeastern Conference), which let a 16-point halftime lead dwindle to 59-50 after a dismal third quarter. The Tigers were 4 of 15 in the third with seven turnovers with Reese not attempting a shot. 

            After the third quarter woes, LSU was 13 of 19 in the fourth, which was enough to stay in front of the hot-shooting Gators, who were 9 of 10 with four 3s, and made 7 of 8 free throws. Reese had nine points in the first five minutes of the quarter to push the lead back to 16 of 73-57 and scored 11 overall.

            “Angel's contributions in every quarter matter but ... we just didn't get her touches in the third quarter,"" Mulkey said. “We try to spread the wealth around, we want everybody to score, but when you come out and have five or six empty possessions, find who needs to touch the ball. In the third quarter we didn't do a good job.”

            KK Deans, a West Virginia transfer, matched her career high with 30 points, for the Gators (14-13, 3-11), who have lost five straight. Jordyn Merritt and Ra Shaya Kyle both added 12.

            Overall LSU shot 53% to 43% for Florida, which was 17 of 20 from the foul line, outscoring the Tigers by 12.

            Reese, who made all four of her shots and Carson, who hit a couple of 3s, both had eight points for a 27-23 lead after one quarter. 

            In the second quarter Florida was just 3 of 17 and was outscored 20-6 to trail 47-31. Carson had 17 points and Reese had 14 with 13 rebounds as the duo combined to match Florida's total.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815398,Kneepkens scores 22; No. 4 Utah stops Arizona State 74-69,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Gianna Kneepkens scored 22 points and Jenna Johnson added 15 to push No. 4 Utah to a 74-69 Pac-12 victory over stubborn Arizona State on Sunday afternoon.

            The Utes (23-3, 13-3), who had a seven-game winning streak stopped at No. 18 Arizona on Friday, struggled to put away Arizona State without post player Alissa Pili.

            Pili, the Pac-12’s leading scorer at 20.7 points per game, did not play after suffering a right ankle sprain in the final minutes of the loss at Arizona. It was the first game she has missed.











            “It was one of those games that was just hard,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “We kind of had to do it by committee. It wasn't a pretty game. It wasn't our best game. Coming off that game Friday ... we wanted that badly, and we were a little flat coming out of the gates. But we found way.”

            Sydney Erikstrup had 15 points, Treasure Hunt had 13 and Kayla Mokwuah had 11 for the Sun Devils (7-18, 0-16), who lost their 16th straight game despite leading most of the way.

            The Utes did not get their first lead until Kneepkens’ 3-pointer made it 29-27 with 2:19 remaining in the first half and did not lead for good until Kneepkens made two free throws to break a tie at 65 with 1:29 left. She had eight points in the final 6:38.

            “In the Pac-12, the best conference in the country, you always have to be ready,” Kneepkens said. ""Any team can beat anybody any night of the week. It makes it a lot of fun. Obviously (Pili) brings a lot. Scoring. Rebounding. Just her presence on the inside. We just all had to buy in to giving more, score a little more and get a couple more rebounds.""

            Johnson made two free throws with 40.8 seconds left for a 69-65 lead and Kennady McQueen and Ines Vieira made three fouls shots to complete a late 7-0 run. 

            Utah shot 44.2% and made 6 of 21 3-point attempts. They ranked fifth in NCAA Division I in both scoring at 84.2 points per game and in field goal percentage (49.0) coming in.

            “To win without shooting the three well, to win without Alissa Pili, I'll take it,” Roberts said.

            Erikstrup's third 3-pointer gave Arizona State a 59-57 lead with 6:58 left, and Hunt's layup with 1:51 remaining tied it at 65 before Kneepkens was fouled on a drive to the basket and made both foul shots. The Sun Devils missed their next four field goal attempts while Utah extended its lead at the foul line.

            “We're fighters,” Arizona State coach Natasha Adair said. “We will not hang our head. We do not talk about circumstances.”

            ALISSA PILI UPDATE

            Pili was ruled out of the game after receiving extensive treatment Saturday, but she said she expects to be ready for the final regular season series next weekend. The Pac-12 tournament begins March 1.

            “I just woke up not feeling so well so I decided to take a rest and get ready for next week and the tournament,” Pili said. Roberts was not as upbeat about Pili's availability this weekend. “We'll do our best to try to make it happen, but it might not,” she said.

            SEASON SWEEP

            Utah won the first scheduled game between the two this season by forfeit, when injuries and illness forced the Sun Devils to cancel the Feb. 3 meeting in Salt Lake City.

            BIG PICTURE

            Utah: The Utes assured themselves of a top-four league finish and a first-round bye in the Pac-12 postseason tournament with the victory, another program first for a team that has achieved its highest national ranking. They remain in the running for a host site in the NCAA regionals and will finish the regular-season at home against No. 3 Stanford next Saturday.

            Arizona State: The Sun Devils have had injury and illness issues during a difficult season, but they have persevered. They led late into the third quarter against Utah, which was their fifth AP Top 25 opponent in the last six games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815400,West Indies and NZ win to cling to SF hopes at T20 World Cup,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — West Indies kept alive its slim hopes of making the semifinals at the Women's T20 World Cup with a last-over win over Pakistan on Sunday, while Sri Lanka went from the brink of the knockouts to out of the tournament.

            New Zealand's huge 102-run win over Sri Lanka put it in position instead to follow defending champion Australia into the semis from Group 1.

            West Indies' victory gave it a chance in Group 2 and also meant England was confirmed as the first team through from that group.











            West Indies won the toss and struggled to a below-par 116-6 in Paarl but managed to restrict Pakistan to 113-5 in its 20 overs, thanks in part to the efforts of captain Hayley Matthews, who took 2-14 in four overs and snatched a fantastic diving catch at short mid-wicket.

            Pakistan needed 18 off the last over, an equation that appeared out of reach until Fatima Sana and Aliya Riaz hit three fours off the first four balls.

            With five needed off the last two, Riyaz chopped a delivery onto her own stumps to dramatically change the course of the game again. 

            New batter Omaima Sohail couldn't find the boundary on the last ball to take the game to a Super Over and West Indies stayed alive at the tournament, although that could be short-lived if India beats Ireland on Monday in Gqeberha.

            That would take India through behind England.

            West Indies has played all its group games and is level on points with India but behind on net run rate, so needs the Irish, who are winless at this World Cup, to pull off a big surprise to have any chance of going through. Even then, the West Indies would have to wait for the final Group 2 game between England and Pakistan on Tuesday.

            New Zealand moved second behind Australia in Group 1, but that could also be temporary as a win for host South Africa over Bangladesh on Tuesday would see it snatch the semifinal place from the New Zealanders.

            New Zealand gave itself a chance with a dominant performance to end Sri Lanka's tournament.

            Bernadine Bezuidenhout (32), Suzie Bates (56) and Amelia Kerr (66) all made big contributions at the top of the order to see New Zealand to an impressive 162-3 after choosing to bat first.

            Sri Lanka, which would have been into the semis with a win, collapsed under the pressure and was 60 all out after being one batter down with Achini Kulasuriya not coming out because of an injury.

            New Zealand pacer Lea Tahuhu took 2-12 in four overs to join Megan Schutt of Australia as the joint leading wicket-takers at the tournament with eight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815402,"No. 10 Notre Dame races to quick lead, cruises by Pitt 83-43","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey's voice can get raspy from time to time, one of the hazards of her job.

            Typically, though, it recovers between games. Only it didn't following a last-second win over Louisville last week. When Ivey walked onto the floor at the Petersen Events Center on Sunday as the Irish faced Pittsburgh, her voice still had no juice.

            Ivey's team, however, had no such problems.











            Maddy Westbeld and Sonia Citron scored 13 points each and 10th-ranked Irish used a huge first-quarter push to race by the Panthers 83-43 on Sunday.

            Ten days removed from a taut six-point win over the Panthers, Notre Dame had no trouble in the rematch. The Irish (22-4, 13-3 ACC) went on an 18-3 burst over the final 6:47 of the opening frame to build a 16-point lead that Pitt (10-17, 3-13) never really threatened.

            “I thought this was going to be a really hard game coming after an emotional win like (the one over Louisville),” Ivey said. ""So I just talked to this team about not being complacent, to come out locked in and they were from the beginning.”

            Notre Dame needed a game-winning jumper by Olivia Miles at the buzzer to escape the Cardinals. No such heroics were necessary this time around.

            Though Miles got off to a rough start — missing seven of her first eight shots before recovering a bit in this second half to finish with 10 points, 11 rebounds and five assists — her teammates had little trouble picking up the slack. Citron knocked down all three 3-pointers she took in the first half and Notre Dame's defense suffocated the Panthers when it mattered.

            Irish guard KK Bransford started the game with a steal and a layup in a sequence that set the tone for their biggest win over a conference opponent this season. 

            The margin allowed Ivey to substitute liberally. Nine Irish played at least 12 minutes. Center Lauren Ebo had 10 points and six rebounds as she makes her way back from a lower-body injury that forced her to miss five games before returning briefly against Louisville.

            “She’s still (on a minutes restriction) and she’s going to progress as she continues to heal,” Ivey said. “But she had a chance to get more minutes today, which was great.”

            Pitt shot just 28% (16 of 57) from the field overall and missed 10 straight shots in the first quarter as Notre Dame took control. Amber Brown led the Panthers with 13 points but Pitt's bid for its first three-game winning streak in ACC play since 2015 vanished quickly.

            The Panthers' 43 points were a season low and 21 below their average coming in. 

            “They’re big and they really can make plays and you have to match that whenever you play them and today we just didn’t match that,” Pitt coach Lance White said. “I thought we got too carried away with missing shots that then we couldn’t defend and rebound.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Notre Dame: The Irish avoided any sense of a letdown and will head into the final week of the regular season with a chance at winning the ACC regular season title.

            Pitt: The Panthers have shown progress after a miserable start in conference play but were overwhelmed early by the Irish, a step back considering how well Pitt played in South Bend.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The Irish could tick up a spot in the poll on Monday after No. 9 Duke lost this week, though it's uncertain how much Notre Dame will be rewarded for winning a pair of games it was expected to win.

            BRUCE HONORED

            Pitt honored former star Jennifer Bruce by retiring Bruce's No. 12 at halftime. Bruce scored 2,295 points during her career with the Panthers from 1981-85, the second-highest total in program history.

            Bruce is the second women's player to have her number retired by the Panthers. Pitt retired all-time leading scorer Lorri Johnson's No. 24 in 2019.

            UP NEXT

            Notre Dame: Hosts Georgia Tech on Thursday night in its home finale before a rematch against Louisville at the KFC Yum! Center next Sunday.

            Pitt: Welcomes Syracuse to the Petersen Events Center on Thursday before finishing up the regular season at N.C. State next Sunday.

            The Wildcats (21-6, 11-5 Pac 12 Conference) held the Buffaloes to their lowest total of the season and their worst shooting game, 28.3% overall (15 of 53), 1 of 12 from 3-point range (8.3%).

            Esmery Martinez had 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting and seven rebounds for the Wildcats, who were coming off a 10-point win over No. 4 Utah and have won five of six.











            Tameiya Sadler led the Buffaloes with 12 points and Quay Miller added 10 with 10 rebounds. Other than an early 86-85 loss to Texas Tech, Colorado has failed to reach 60 points in its five other losses and in four of those shot less than 32%. 

            Cate Reese hit a 3-pointer to kick off a 10-0 run late in the first quarter, which put the Wildcats on top 17-10. Colorado missed its last four shots and had two turnovers in the last four minutes. The Buffaloes were 4 of 14 and Arizona went 3 of 5 behind the arc.

            Colorado missed its first six shots of the second quarter, made four and then missed five, but only trailed 31-20 despite shooting 28% for the half.

            Shooting woes continued for Colorado in the third quarter when the Buffs went 3 of 12 while the Wildcats were 7 of 16 to stretch the lead to 48-27. Pellington had a pair of three-point plays in a 15-0 run that left the lead at 48-25. 

            Colorado opened the fourth quarter with a 10-1 run to get within 49-37 with six minutes to go but went 1 of 7 the rest of the way.

            Arizona closes the regular season with its Oregon trip, starting Thursday at Oregon. Colorado is home Thursday against No. 13 Stanford.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815407,US averts UN diplomatic crisis over Israeli settlements,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Biden administration has averted a potential diplomatic crisis over Israeli settlements at the United Nations that had threatened to overshadow Western efforts for the world body to spotlight Russia’s war with Ukraine during the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion this week.

            Multiple diplomats familiar with the situation said Sunday that the U.S. had successfully managed to forestall a contentious U.N. Security Council resolution pushed by the Palestinians and their supporters that would have condemned Israel for settlement expansion and demanded a halt to future activity.

            To avoid a vote and a likely U.S. veto of the draft resolution, which would be legally binding, the diplomats said the administration managed to convince both Israel and the Palestinians to agree in principle to a six-month freeze in any unilateral action they might take. 











            On the Israeli side, that would mean a commitment to not expanding settlements until at least August, according to the diplomats.

            On the Palestinian side, the diplomats said it would mean a commitment until August not to pursue action against Israel at the U.N. and other international bodies such as the World Court, the International Criminal Court and the U.N. Human Rights Council.

            Instead of a resolution, the diplomats said the Security Council will adopt a weaker presidential statement along the lines of the resolution, probably on Monday. Presidential statements, which require support from all 15 council nations, become part of the council's record but are not legally binding.

            The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the highly sensitive negotiations. 

            A veto of the settlements resolution would have been a political headache for President Joe Biden as he approaches the 2024 presidential election. 

            Biden is struggling to balance his opposition to Israeli settlements and his support for a two-state resolution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict with moves to improve ties with the Palestinians that have wide backing among his progressive supporters. 

            And, although the administration has already denounced Israel's latest settlement expansion and called the Palestinian resolution “unhelpful,"" top congressional Republicans have warned Biden that a veto would have severe consequences for his legislative agenda. 

            A veto would also alienate U.N. member countries supportive of the Palestinians, like the United Arab Emirates, which was sponsoring the resolution in the Security Council, as the West seeks support for Ukraine in the war with Russia..

            The U.S. will be looking to the UAE and other countries sympathetic to the Palestinians to vote in favor of a resolution in the 193-member General Assembly on Thursday condemning Russia for invading Ukraine and calling for a cessation of hostilities and the immediate withdrawal of all Russian forces.

             The deal was arrived at on Sunday after days of frantic talks by senior Biden administration officials with Palestinian, Israeli and UAE leaders. Diplomats said the intensive effort including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Sullivan's deputy Brett McGurk, the top diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, and special envoy for Palestinian affairs Hady Amr.

            The Palestinian push for a resolution came as Israel’s new right-wing government has reaffirmed its commitment to construct new settlements in the West Bank and expand its authority on land the Palestinians seek for a future state.

            Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The United Nations and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements illegal and an obstacle to ending the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

            In December 2016, the Security Council demanded that Israel “immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.” It stressed that halting settlement activities “is essential for salvaging the two-state solution.”

            That resolution was adopted after President Barack Obama’s administration abstained in the vote, a reversal of the United States’ longstanding practice of protecting its close ally Israel from action at the United Nations, including by vetoing Arab-supported resolutions.

            Yet, the Ukraine war looms large, especially this week.

            On Wednesday, Ukraine is holding a meeting focusing on human rights violations, prisoners and abducted children. More than 20 ministers are expected to be among the dozens of speakers in the General Assembly starting Wednesday afternoon and continuing ahead of Thursday's vote. On Friday’s anniversary, the Security Council will hold a ministerial meeting on the invasion and its impact.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815419,Wild top Preds 4-3 on Hartman rebound with 21 seconds left,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Wild led Nashville by two with less than five minutes to go. When they lost it with 47 seconds left, captain Jared Spurgeon gave his teammates a calm word of encouragement.

            Then, just like that, Spurgeon helped set up the go-ahead goal.

            
                Ryan Hartman knocked in a rebound of Jonas Brodin's shot with 21 seconds left, a mere 26 seconds after Nino Niederreiter tied the game for Nashville, and the Wild beat the Predators 4-3 on Sunday.











            “Just looking for one opportunity,” said Spurgeon, who held a loose puck in the offensive zone before feeding Brodin. The assist moved Spurgeon past Ryan Suter for the most career points by a defenseman in Wild history.

            Kirill Kaprizov scored twice and Brandon Duhaime had the first goal for Minnesota, which won — barely — in regulation for the first time in 13 games since Jan. 17.

            “There was no frustration. There was no panic. There was no slamming the door. There was no breaking a stick. There was no yelling,” Wild coach Dean Evason said. “We were just saying, ’Well, OK, here we go.'”

            Tommy Novak and Roman Josi each scored for Nashville and assisted on Niederreiter's goal, but Filip Gustavsson — who stopped 23 shots — still managed to improve to 9-1-1 in his last 11 home starts despite the late lapse. 

            Josi scored with 4:56 remaining to pull the Predators within 3-2. Novak also got them within one goal by scoring late in the second period.

            Kaprizov reignited the crowd at the 1:23 mark of the third period when he tracked down an outlet pass from Hartman to start a breakaway and snapped a shot past the glove of Juuse Saros.

            Kaprizov, who scored earlier on a power-play rebound after Joel Eriksson Ek redirected a slap shot by Mats Zuccarello, is eighth in the NHL with 33 goals. He had a game-high six shots on goal.

            “Obviously it kind of gives everyone confidence so that — not just me — everyone can start scoring, the team starts playing better, and more wins will come,” Kaprizov said through his Russian translator. ""Live and see what happens.”

            The Wild sharpened up their game this week after an ominous stretch when they lost six of eight without any regulation wins. After backstopping a 2-1 shootout win over Central Division leader Dallas on Friday, Gustavsson got the call over veteran Marc-Andre Fleury for his fifth start in seven games. The 24-year-old is 13-4-1 in his last 18 turns.

            The Predators badly needed this win for a boost in the Western Conference wild card race, now trailing the Wild (30-21-5) by seven points for the last spot with Calgary in between.

            “Every game is so huge, especially a division game like tonight,” Niederreiter said. “It’s tough to find words for tonight. Just frustrating we didn’t get it done.”

            The Predators played at home the day before, posting a 7-3 win over Florida, and they were sluggish after the short turnaround. After Kaprizov was called for hooking to trigger a power play in the first period, they yielded two different short-handed breakaways to the Wild.

            Saros saved them with a pair of pad saves to deny Eriksson Ek and later Connor Dewar. Mason Shaw's one-timed rebound of Dewar's shot on that second breakaway was blocked in traffic.

            The Wild's reward came just 9 seconds into the second period. Frederick Gaudreau's shot was deflected by a screening Duhaime, sending the puck scraping across the shoulder of Saros and into the net. That tied a Wild record for the fastest goal in a second period in team history.

            GAME NOTES

            Novak, one of two Predators playing in their native city of St. Paul along with defenseman Ryan McDonagh, had two goals for Nashville on Saturday. ... Niederreiter got a double minor in the third period for a high stick that drew blood on Brodin, his former teammate. ... Saros made 31 saves. ... Hartman's goal was the third-latest go-ahead goal in Wild history. Marcus Foligno has the record with 8 seconds left on Oct. 15, 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815420,Tottenham's Son subjected to online racist abuse,"LONDON (AP) — Son Heung-min was subjected to “utterly reprehensible” online racist abuse, Tottenham said Sunday. 

            The Premier League club called for social media companies to take action after Son was targeted during the 2-0 win against West Ham. 

            The forward scored four minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute. 











            After the match, Spurs posted on Twitter: “We have been made aware of the utterly reprehensible online racist abuse directed at Heung-Min Son during today’s match, which has been reported by the club.

            “We stand with Sonny and once again call on the social media companies and authorities to take action.”

            Anti-racism group Kick It Out earlier this month demanded “meaningful reforms” after Brentford striker Ivan Toney was subjected to racial abuse on Instagram.

            The abuse occurred after Toney’s controversial equalizer against Arsenal, which should have been ruled out by VAR for offside against team-mate Christian Norgaard.

            Toney also revealed in October last year that he had been targeted on Instagram after scoring both goals in a 2-0 league victory over Brighton.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815421,Alcaraz beats Norrie on clay for 1st title since U.S. Open,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz won his first title since his milestone U.S. Open triumph by beating Cameron Norrie in straight sets at the Argentina Open on Sunday.

            The world No. 2 overcame No. 12 Norrie 6-3, 7-5 in the clay-court final. 

            “I felt very comfortable,” Alcaraz said. “This is the level that I have to play in a final. It is really special, I struggled in these four months.”











            A right leg injury sidelined Alcaraz from the Australian Open, with Novak Djokovic reclaiming the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz after winning the title there. 

            The 19-year-old Alcaraz dropped only one set — to Serbia’s Laslo Djere — in his first tournament of the year.

            After winning the first set in 36 minutes, Alcaraz quickly broke second-seeded Norrie in the second set but the Briton hit back when the Spaniard was serving for the championship at 5-4. Alcaraz broke Norrie with a drop shot to win the title. 

            Norrie lost his second final of the year after Auckland in January.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815422,"Balogun, Corosdale lead No. 9 Duke past Virginia, 56-52","CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) — Elizabeth Balogun scored 12 points, Taya Corosdale had 10 and No. 9 Duke survived a stern test from Virginia, 56-52, on Sunday. 

            The Blue Devils (22-4, 13-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) led only 47-45 with just over eight minutes left, but Celeste Taylor hit a 3-pointer from right in front of the Duke bench to make it a five-point game, starting a 7-2 run that gave them some breathing room and they held on.

            “I thought Virginia made things really hard for us,” Blue Devils coach Kara Lawson said. “I don’t really know what to say, to be honest with you. ... This one wasn’t easy, but at the end they did enough to finish it with a win.”











            Taylor Valladay led Virginia (15-12, 4-12) with 19 points and McKenna Dale had 10. The Cavaliers had split their last six meetings with the Blue Devils after ending a 26-game losing streak in the series, but still lost for the 30th time in the last 33 meetings.

            “A game like this one hurts, obviously, to be four points away and that’s a top 10 team in the country,” first-year Virginia coach Amaka Agugua-Hamilton said. “There’s a lot to be proud of, but at the same time, we knew we had an opportunity right there and it kind of slipped away.”

            The victory assured Duke of maintaining at least a share of first place in the conference. They are tied with No. 10 Notre Dame, which beat Pittsburgh. 

            The Blue Devils started the third quarter with a trio of 3-pointers in a 9-2 run that built their lead to 42-29, but they then went nearly five minutes without scoring as the Cavaliers ran off 10 straight. The Blue Devils had four of their 18 turnovers during the drought.

            “Ball security, I can't say, has been a great strength of ours. If you look at just us, statistically, it’s something we struggle with,” Lawson said. “I thought we tried to squeeze the ball into too tight of windows and tried to make home run passes when we just needed to make the simple play.”

            The Cavaliers played with just eight available players because their second- and third-leading scorers (Mir McLean, 12.2, and Sam Brunelle, 10.0) are out for the rest of season with injuries.

            “You just can’t get down to teams like that, good teams like that. But I was proud of our fight,” Agugua-Hamilton said. 

            OOPS

            Duke’s last turnover came with 16 seconds left when, after a timeout, they were whistled for a five-second call for failing to inbound the ball. Lawson's message to the team during the timeout?

            “Not to get a five second call,” she said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Duke: The Blue Devils were sometimes very sloppy with the ball, committing 18 turnovers that the Cavaliers turned into 22 points. They made up for it by hitting eight of 18 3-point tries and their reserves outscored Virginia's 19-7.

            Virginia: The university honored letter-winners from its first three women's teams, including the 1973-74 basketball team, with a luncheon before the game and during a halftime ceremony as part of National Girl and Women in Sports Day.

The Cavaliers had split their last six meetings with the Blue Devils after ending a 26-game losing streak in the series, but still lost for the 30th time in the last 33 meetings.“A game like this one hurts, obviously, to be four points away and that’s a top 10 team in the country,” first-year Virginia coach Amaka Agugua-Hamilton said. “There’s a lot to be proud of, but at the same time, we knew we had an opportunity right there and it kind of slipped away.”The victory assured Duke of maintaining at least a share of first place in the conference. They are tied with No. 10 Notre Dame, which beat Pittsburgh.The Blue Devils started the third quarter with a trio of 3-pointers in a 9-2 run that built their lead to 42-29, but they then went nearly five minutes without scoring as the Cavaliers ran off 10 straight. The Blue Devils had four of their 18 turnovers during the drought.“Ball security, I can't say, has been a great strength of ours. If you look at just us, statistically, it’s something we struggle with,” Lawson said. “I thought we tried to squeeze the ball into too tight of windows and tried to make home run passes when we just needed to make the simple play.”The Cavaliers played with just eight available players because their second- and third-leading scorers (Mir McLean, 12.2, and Sam Brunelle, 10.0) are out for the rest of season with injuries.“You just can’t get down to teams like that, good teams like that. But I was proud of our fight,” Agugua-Hamilton said.OOPSDuke’s last turnover came with 16 seconds left when, after a timeout, they were whistled for a five-second call for failing to inbound the ball. Lawson's message to the team during the timeout?“Not to get a five second call,” she said.BIG PICTUREDuke: The Blue Devils were sometimes very sloppy with the ball, committing 18 turnovers that the Cavaliers turned into 22 points. They made up for it by hitting eight of 18 3-point tries and their reserves outscored Virginia's 19-7.Virginia: The university honored letter-winners from its first three women's teams, including the 1973-74 basketball team, with a luncheon before the game and during a halftime ceremony as part of National Girl and Women in Sports Day.UP NEXTDuke: Plays N.C.

It described the strike as a ""sudden launching drill.""The test came after Pyongyang warned of an ""unprecedentedly persistent, strong"" response to planned joint military drills by the United States and South Korea.On Sunday, the US and South Korea held a joint air exercise in response to the intercontinental ballistic missile launch.The latest missile launch is North Korea's third major weapons test this year.Pyongyang's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs are banned under United Nations Security Council resolutions.But the North's leaders say the weapons development is necessary to counter ""hostile policies"" by Washington and its allies.rmt/ar (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/19,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815429,Bundesliga title race shows Premier League there is another way,"Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin capitalized on a Bayern Munich defeat this weekend to draw level on points with the Bavarians at the top of the Bundesliga in the closest title race Germany has seen in years.After Bayern's 3-2 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, Sunday saw Dortmund beat Hertha Berlin 4-1 to go level on 43 points, while Union could even have gone top outright had they beaten Schalke, instead settling for a goalless draw and a point against the struggling Royal Blues.It's the first time that three teams have been tied on points at the top at this stage of the season since the introduction of three-points-per-win in 1995/96 and, with Union playing Bayern next week and Dortmund also still to play both, there is cautious hope that the Bavarians' ten-year stranglehold on the league could perhaps be broken.The desire for a serious challenger and a genuine title race is understandably strong in Germany – even among some Bayern supporters, if they're truly honest with themselves. But the debate about how exactly to go about achieving that has split German football for a decade.Powerful voices at certain clubs and in certain media – most recently Bayern Munich's honorary president Uli Hoeness – claim that German football's restrictions on club ownership discourage the sort of investment which could help Bundesliga clubs challenge Europe's elite abroad and Bayern at home.But a significant body of German supporters remain adamant that they'd rather see twenty consecutive Bayern championships than sell majority stakes in their clubs to outside investors.Indeed, England's Premier League may have had five different champions since anyone other than Bayern last won the Bundesliga, but the identities and ownership structures of those clubs tend to be cause for warnings in Germany, rather than envy.Manchester City, winners in four of those seasons, are 88% controlled by the Abu Dhabi-owned City Football Group and are currently the subject of an investigation into financial irregularities by the Premier League. Chelsea, champions in 2015 and 2017, were recently the subject to a forced sale by the British government following Russia's invasion of Ukraine due to former owner Roman Abramovich's ties to Vladimir Putin.Even Leicester City's ""fairytale"" of 2016 was bankrolled by Thailand's Srivaddhanaprabha family and their King Power group, while Liverpool's American owners, Fenway Sports Group, were forced to back-track over their role in the attempted European Super League coup of 2021, and have since put the club up for sale.And now this weekend, investors linked to the state of Qatar launched an official bid for record champions Manchester United, who themselves have been stripped of over £1 billion ($1.2bn/€1.12bn) by the Glazer family since 2005.A successful Qatari bid for United would follow last year's takeover of Newcastle United by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia and effectively complete the transformation of English football's top flight into a geopolitical tool for a group of middle-eastern states.This weekend, however, the Bundesliga has shown that there is another way.The entire top four (Bayern, Dortmund, Union and, three points further adrift, Freiburg) all adhere, to varying degrees, to Germany's 50+1 rule, which stipulates that the parent clubs retain majority voting rights in the companies which operate the professional teams, preventing the sort of majority takeovers by external investors seen in England.Indeed, Union Berlin and Freiburg go even further, being two of only four current Bundesliga clubs which are 100% owned by their members. The recent successes of both (Freiburg reached the German Cup final last season, while Union's latest step on their incredible journey came with a goalless draw away at European giants Ajax in the Europa League this week), vindicates their approach.Another member-controlled German club, Eintracht Frankfurt, even won the Europa League last year, knocking out Premier League West Ham United en route.Now, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are hardly volunteer-run, not-for-profit charities themselves (Bayern have sold 8.33% stakes to Allianz, Audi and Adidas respectively while Dortmund are listed on the German stock exchange) but, in both cases, club members still retain ultimate control.And those members – the fans – know how exert that control. Back in 2021, the threat of serious consequences at annual general meetings played a role in keeping Bayern and Dortmund out of those ill-fated Super League plans.Even on Sunday as Dortmund strolled to a 4-1 win – their eighth win in a row in all competitions – their supporters unfurled banners criticizing examples of what they perceive to be over-commercialization both at their own club and within the league as a whole.""You adorn yourselves with the symbols of the working class,"" read one banner as Dortmund's players took to the field wearing all-black kits rather than their traditional yellow as part of a club initiative to honor the industrial heritage of the city in coal mining and steel. The one-off kits are available to buy for €90 ($96), but the monetization the club's working class traditions is seen as hypocritical.""But don't forget them with your ticket prices!"" continued the message, a reference to the fact that, while match tickets at German clubs may be extremely fairly priced in comparison to the Premier League, standing season tickets at Dortmund are still the most expensive in the Bundesliga at €240 ($256) per season.Next, there was a political criticism of the German Football League (DFL)'s latest plan to boost investment in the league by potentially selling shares in the league as a whole, rather than in individual clubs. ""[You want to] strengthen the league's ability to compete?"" asked one banner. ""Sustainable solutions, not a total sell-out!"" demanded the next. ""No to the sale of DFL shares!""In England, on the other hand, opposition to state takeovers at Manchester City and Newcastle United was conspicuous by its absence. It's unlikely to be much different on the red side of Manchester should United be sold to Qatar.Indeed, rather than resist, fans appear to actively welcome their new overlords, concerns over human rights abuses or sportswashing glossed over by promises of reflected glory, which they'll tell themselves is theirs. But it's not.In Germany, however, the successes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin this season do belong to their supporters, who have a legal stake in their clubs. With all three now level on points at the top of the Bundesliga, however, it's just a question of which way it's going to go.Whatever happens, it's proof that the German model can work, and proof that there is another way.",2023/02/19,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815430,"Chechnya's Kadyrov plans mercenary group, praises Wagner","Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Sunday that he intends to form his own group of professional mercenaries once he no longer serves in a state office.On his Telegram channel, Kadyrov, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, praised the Wagner Group of mercenaries and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, for ""impressive results"" amid the war in Ukraine.""We can say confidently that Wagner has shown its mettle in military terms and drawn a line under discussions about whether or not such private military companies are needed,"" the 46-year-old Chechen leader said.The ascent of the Wagner Group, along with Prigozhin and other mercenary forces outside the traditional Russian military command structures, is something Kadyrov said he is keen to emulate once he leaves office.""When my service to the state is completed, I seriously plan to compete with our dear brother Yevgeny Prigozhin and create a private military company. I think it will all work out.""Kadyrov and Prigozhin both lead forces in Ukraine that operate outside of Russia's military command. The men are also both staunch allies of Putin, though they have also spoken out in public against the Moscow forces' operations since the invasion began almost exactly a year ago.The Wagner Group has played an increasingly important role in Russia's war against Ukraine, leading months of fighting in the Donetsk region's town of Bakhmut.Putin has relied on Kadyrov to keep the North Caucasus republic of Chechnya stable and repress any unrest. Kadyrov has vowed to ""fulfill any military command from Russia's commander-in-chief Vladimir Putin.""In return for his unwavering loyalty, Kadyrov has enjoyed considerable freedom in governing Chechnya and speaking his mind.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815431,Fact check: How propaganda denigrates Ukrainian refugees,"Since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine began almost a year ago, other European countries have received and registered more than 8 million people from Ukraine as refugees, according to UN figures.In many places, they have been received with widespread compassion. But false news, hate and disinformation campaigns have also been waged against them, said Julia Smirnova of the UK-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue. ""These were false reports about alleged crimes or attacks attributed to the refugees,"" she said.According to an analysis by the institute in October that examined Russian-language discussions about refugees on Telegram in particular, the narratives differ depending on the target group. Audiences in Russia are primarily told that people from Ukraine are fleeing from supposed ""Nazis"" who allegedly rule the country.Audiences in the rest of Europe, on the other hand, are led to believe that refugees are ungrateful, prone to violence and dangerous, Smirnova explained. Numerous examples of this have also been collected by the fact-checking community of the European Digital Media Observatory, a European association of fact checkers and media experts, to which DW's fact-checking team also belongs.Examples such as these can be used to show how certain narratives are disseminated and seemingly substantiated — and how to check whether they are true or not.Claim: Ukrainians are fleeing NazisEven before the attack on Ukraine, Russian propagandist media repeatedly claimed that Ukraine was run by Nazis who wanted to banish everything Russian from Ukraine. According to this narrative, it would be a logical conclusion that Ukrainians — especially Russian speakers — would flee to Russia; according to the UNHCR, about 3 million Ukrainians have left the country for Russia since the war began.In this report from the news site NewsFront (screenshot above), a Ukrainian soldier is quoted as telling The New York Times: ""We are liberating land, but without people on it."" It is then suggested that Ukrainians had fled the recaptured land to escape the ""Nazi regime.""DW fact check: Misleading.The quote itself, which The New York Times uses in two articles, is correctly reproduced. However, in neither of them is there mention of Nazis as a reason for fleeing.One of them states that Ukrainians who had lived under Russian occupation fled to Russia for fear of being mistaken for collaborators. The other article states that even before the Russian army arrived, 80% of the population from the eastern Donbas region had fled from the Russians to western Ukraine or other countries in Europe. In addition, it said, the Russian army had killed an unknown number of Ukrainian civilians in fighting or extrajudicial execution-style murders.Of course, it is conceivable that there are indeed Ukrainians who believe the Russian propaganda and want to escape to safety from the alleged Nazi regime. But this is unlikely to apply to the vast majority of Ukrainian refugees, or to the 3 million who are now in Russia, either. That is because the story that Ukraine is ruled by Nazis is simply made-up. DW already proved this in a fact check on Putin's ""reasons"" for the war.In addition, human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International report that many Ukrainian refugees — the US government speaks of hundreds of thousands — have gone to Russia against their will. According to the reports, Russian or pro-Russian soldiers have brought busloads of Ukrainian civilians to Russia from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine without their prior knowledge or even under duress. In addition, an unknown number has used Russia as a transit country to the West.DW showed in another fact check at the end of November how there are efforts in some social media to substantiate the fictitious narrative about Ukrainian Nazis.Citing media outlets that enjoy a high reputation in the West is a recurring pattern. Smirnova of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue said established media are even copied outright to deceive the audience and make disinformation campaigns credible. This technique, called media spoofing, has also been used to defame Ukrainian refugees.Claim: Ukrainians blackmail people in host countries.Among others, an alleged DW video claimed that a young Ukrainian man had blackmailed numerous German women.DW fact check: False.Since DW reported on this in detail in an earlier fact check, we'll keep it short here: The Federal Criminal Police Office is not aware of any such case. And we were able to prove, by identifying small deviations in font and layout, that the video is not from DW but a fake.Fake news expert Tommaso Canetta of European Digital Media Observatory said ""[Ukrainian refugees] are the target of disinformation on many levels. [They are portrayed as] Nazis, violent, parasites. So they basically exploit the countries that host them."" To push this narrative, stories are sometimes freely invented and brought to public attention in various ways.Claim: Polish children with cancer must give up places to Ukrainian refugeesA tweet claimed: ""Polish children are thrown out of oncology clinics. Today my neighbor called me; they threw her 4-year-old son out of the oncology clinic because Ukrainian children needed a place. She asked me to arrange treatment for her son because she knows I have doctors in my family.""DW fact check: Unproven.The Polish fact-checking platforms ""FakeHunter"" and ""Demagog"" investigated this claim. They say the Polish Health Ministry and the Polish Society of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology had denied the allegation. Apart from the tweet, there were no references to the alleged incident in Polish media. It is therefore possible that the story is completely fictitious.The source is also fishy: The Twitter profile @aga34686913 has a bio saying ""Catholic. Conservative."" It was created in March 2021 and has since been blocked for policy violations. However, the web archive shows that nearly 100 tweets were sent or retweeted via this profile between March 21 and March 28, 2022, alone — a large portion with nationalist and anti-Ukrainian content.Many tweets originated from the account @Michali49393358, which has similar characteristics. All these are indications that it could be a troll, i.e. a social media account that is only used to anonymously spread certain content. Often, such accounts are controlled by bots, computer programs that automatically identify and redistribute relevant content. In this fact check, the DW team showed how to detect bots, fake accounts and trolls.Polish fact checkers found out that the profile photo first appeared on the Instagram account @annikaboron in 2017. The account, which has 139,000 followers, belongs to Annika Boron, who works as a real estate agent in Toronto. Asked about the Polish Twitter profile with her photo, she replied to DW: ""I definitely have nothing to do with this account! My photo is often used for fake profiles.""Another fake news technique uses authentic images placed in a new context. A video of a firefighting operation in Krakow shows how easily this can be done.Claim: A Ukrainian refugee family is forcibly removed by police from their unpaid apartment.DW fact check: Misleading.A video that circulated on Russian, Polish and German social media accounts in early December 2022 purportedly shows how a refugee family from Ukraine had to be forcibly removed from an illegally occupied and vandalized apartment in Krakow by police with the assistance of firefighters after they allegedly failed to pay their rent. All that can be seen is two firefighters in a ladder truck trying to break through a window on the second floor of an old building under the gaze of onlookers. Voices in Polish and Spanish can be heard in the background.Research by the Kyiv-based journalism platform Stop Fake has revealed that the full video was uploaded to YouTube in early October 2021, a good four months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So this incident has nothing to do with Ukrainian war refugees.The German account may seem quite authentic at first glance. However, it is noticeable that the Twitter address @Stadler05922751 has the same pattern as the two previously mentioned profiles: a name with a long sequence of digits. On closer inspection, the photo also looks rather too posed for a private social media account. It's a frequently used image on the internet; its trail can be traced back to an advertisement for a haircut. The GETTR account of the alleged ""Max Stadler"" given in the Twitter profile shows a completely different man in the profile picture.To further this type of narrative, made-up stories are spread in which Ukrainians allegedly commit crimes against locals. These may perhaps use ""old images of what might be an actual Ukrainian citizen beating up someone in Rome, Paris or Berlin, only this time with the note: This is a Ukrainian war refugee,"" Canetta explained. Such propaganda looks especially authentic when carelessly spread by accounts of real people out of genuine outrage or even fear.Claim: Ukrainians beat Russian-born refugee helper to death.In a TikTok video, a woman reported in Russian that a 16-year-old Russian speaker who was helping refugees was beaten up by Ukrainian refugees in Euskirchen near the western German city of Cologne and later succumbed to his injuries.DW fact check: False.DW picked up and analyzed this story in an earlier fact check as well. It turned out to be a fake. The woman had heard it from an acquaintance and spread it on TikTok. The police denied that there had been such an assault, and the surrounding hospitals were also unable to confirm any such case. Shortly thereafter, the woman apologized in another video, saying she had apparently been the victim of misinformation.This article was translated from German.",2023/02/19,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815433,Buttigieg warns Norfolk Southern to support Ohio community,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg sent a letter Sunday to the CEO of Norfolk Southern, warning that the freight rail company must “demonstrate unequivocal support for the people” of East Palestine, Ohio, and surrounding areas after a fiery train derailment led to the release of chemicals and residents expressing concerns about their health.

            “Norfolk Southern must live up to its commitment to make residents whole — and must also live up to its obligation to do whatever it takes to stop putting communities such as East Palestine at risk,” Buttigieg wrote. “This is the right time for Norfolk Southern to take a leadership position within the rail industry, shifting to a posture that focuses on supporting, not thwarting, efforts to raise the standard of U.S. rail safety regulation.”

            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday that the chemicals that spilled into the Ohio River are no longer a risk, even as people in the community say they have constant headaches and irritated eyes. The state plans to open a medical clinic in the village of 4,700 to analyze their symptoms, despite repeated statements that air and water testing has shown no signs of contaminants.











            Still, uncertainty persists about the consequences of a derailment that occurred roughly two weeks ago.

            Peter DeCarlo, a professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News on Sunday that more testing is needed to determine which chemicals are present.

            “We just don’t have the information we need to understand what chemicals may be present,” DeCarlo said. “We know it started as vinyl chloride, but as soon as you burn that all bets are off. You have a lot of chemical byproducts that can happen from a combustion process like that.""

            Asked if he would move back to East Palestine if he were already living there, DeCarlo said: “I have two little boys. I would not.”

            
                Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw issued a statement on Saturday that he “returned to East Palestine today to meet with local leaders, first responders, and a group of Norfolk Southern employees who live in the area.”

            ""In every conversation today, I shared how deeply sorry I am this happened to their home,” Shaw said. The Atlanta-based company has created a website with updates, NSMakingItRight.com.

            The transportation secretary's letter on Sunday came across as a stern warning to Norfolk Southern, saying: “It is imperative that your company be unambiguous and forthright in its commitment to take care of the residents — now and in the future.”

            Buttigieg said the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the derailment and that the Federal Railroad Administration is also analyzing whether safety violations occurred and will hold Norfolk Southern accountable if violations did occur.

            The Environmental Protection Agency has said the company must document the release of hazardous contaminants and outline cleanup actions.

            But Buttigieg also said that Norfolk Southern and other rail companies “spent millions of dollars in the courts and lobbying members of Congress to oppose common-sense safety regulations, stopping some entirely and reducing the scope of others.” He said the effort undermined rules on brake requirements and delayed the phase-in for more durable rail cars to transport hazardous material to 2029, instead of the “originally envisioned date of 2025.”

            The transportation secretary said the results of the investigation are not yet know, but “we do know that these steps that Norfolk Southern and its peers lobbied against were intended to improve rail safety and to help keep Americans safe.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg sent a letter Sunday to the CEO of Norfolk Southern, warning that the freight rail company must “demonstrate unequivocal support for the people” of East Palestine, Ohio, and surrounding areas after a fiery train derailment led to the release of chemicals and residents expressing concerns about their health.“Norfolk Southern must live up to its commitment to make residents whole — and must also live up to its obligation to do whatever it takes to stop putting communities such as East Palestine at risk,” Buttigieg wrote. “This is the right time for Norfolk Southern to take a leadership position within the rail industry, shifting to a posture that focuses on supporting, not thwarting, efforts to raise the standard of U.S. rail safety regulation.”Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday that the chemicals that spilled into the Ohio River are no longer a risk, even as people in the community say they have constant headaches and irritated eyes. The state plans to open a medical clinic in the village of 4,700 to analyze their symptoms, despite repeated statements that air and water testing has shown no signs of contaminants.Still, uncertainty persists about the consequences of a derailment that occurred roughly two weeks ago.Peter DeCarlo, a professor of environmental health and engineering at Johns Hopkins University, told ABC News on Sunday that more testing is needed to determine which chemicals are present.“We just don’t have the information we need to understand what chemicals may be present,” DeCarlo said. “We know it started as vinyl chloride, but as soon as you burn that all bets are off. You have a lot of chemical byproducts that can happen from a combustion process like that.""Asked if he would move back to East Palestine if he were already living there, DeCarlo said: “I have two little boys. I would not.”Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw issued a statement on Saturday that he “returned to East Palestine today to meet with local leaders, first responders, and a group of Norfolk Southern employees who live in the area.”""In every conversation today, I shared how deeply sorry I am this happened to their home,” Shaw said. The Atlanta-based company has created a website with updates, NSMakingItRight.com.The transportation secretary's letter on Sunday came across as a stern warning to Norfolk Southern, saying: “It is imperative that your company be unambiguous and forthright in its commitment to take care of the residents — now and in the future.”Buttigieg said the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the derailment and that the Federal Railroad Administration is also analyzing whether safety violations occurred and will hold Norfolk Southern accountable if violations did occur.The Environmental Protection Agency has said the company must document the release of hazardous contaminants and outline cleanup actions.But Buttigieg also said that Norfolk Southern and other rail companies “spent millions of dollars in the courts and lobbying members of Congress to oppose common-sense safety regulations, stopping some entirely and reducing the scope of others.” He said the effort undermined rules on brake requirements and delayed the phase-in for more durable rail cars to transport hazardous material to 2029, instead of the “originally envisioned date of 2025.”The transportation secretary said the results of the investigation are not yet know, but “we do know that these steps that Norfolk Southern and its peers lobbied against were intended to improve rail safety and to help keep Americans safe.”",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815436,North Korea fires 2 missiles in tests condemned by neighbors,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea east of the country Monday in its second test launch in three days, prompting Japan to request an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.

            The launches continue a tit-for-tat exchange that began Saturday, and follow a year in which North Korea launched more than 70 missiles, the most ever. Pyongyang has recently escalated nuclear threats and threatened an “unprecedentedly"" strong response to annual U.S.-South Korea military drills, which it views as preparation for an invasion.

            South Korea’s military said it detected two missile launches Monday morning from a town on North Korea’s west coast, which were later confirmed by North Korean official media. Japan said both missiles landed in waters outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone and that no damage to aircraft or vessels in the area was reported, but they flew distances that suggest most of South Korea is in range.











            The tests follow an intercontinental ballistic missile launch Saturday, the country's first since Jan. 1, and a U.S. bomber flight over the Korean peninsula conducted in response Sunday. 

            Both South Korea and Japan condemned recent North Korean launches as threats to international peace and violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban any ballistic activities by North Korea. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that Tokyo was requesting an emergency Security Council meeting to respond to recent North Korean launches.

            An initial Security Council briefing led by Assistant Secretary-General for political affairs Khaled Khiari was set for later Monday.

            Further council action against North Korea is unlikely. China and Russia, both veto-wielding powers embroiled in confrontations with Washington, opposed U.S.-led attempts to add fresh sanctions last year. 

            “The frequency of using the Pacific as our firing range depends upon the U.S. forces’ action character,” Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said in the official translation of a statement carried by state media. “We are well aware of the movement of U.S. forces’ strategic strike means, (which are) recently getting brisk around the Korean Peninsula.""

            She likely referred to Sunday's U.S. flight of B-1B long-range, supersonic bombers for separate training with South Korea and Japan, conducted in response to North Korea’s Saturday ICBM test.

            North Korea typically responds to U.S. B-1B flights, which can carry a huge payload of conventional weapons, with aggressive statements or military demonstrations of its own. 

            Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said that North Korea may make further provocations, such as more missile launches and nuclear tests.

            In her statement earlier Sunday, Kim Yo Jong threatened to take additional “powerful” steps over upcoming military drills between the United States and South Korea.

            North Korea has said many of its previous weapons tests were warnings over U.S.-South Korean military drills.

            The South Korean and U.S. militaries have conducted larger and more frequent drills this year, in response to escalating missile tests, and because concerns about COVID-19 are receding. The two militaries plan to hold a table-top exercise this week to hone a joint response to use of nuclear weapons by North Korea. The allies also plan to conduct a joint computer simulated exercise and field training in March.

            North Korea has repeatedly condemned regular South Korea-U.S. military drills as practice for an invasion, though the allies say their exercises are defensive in nature. Some observers say North Korea often uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to test and improve its weapons systems. Many experts believe that North Korea ultimately plans to win international recognition as a legitimate nuclear state to get international sanctions lifted and receive other outside concessions.

            Hours after Monday's launches, South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Seoul placed unilateral sanctions on four individuals and five institutions it said were involved in illicit activities supporting the North’s nuclear arms development and evasion of sanctions. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s government has placed sanctions on 31 individuals and 35 organizations, mostly from North Korea, for supporting the North’s nuclear ambitions, but these steps are mostly symbolic since the two countries do not have business ties.

            The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the new launches highlight “the destabilizing impact” of North Korea’s unlawful weapons programs. It said the U.S. commitments to the defense of South Korea and Japan “remain ironclad.”

            The North said the tests involved the new 600-millimeter multiple rocket launcher system, which could be armed with “tactical” nuclear weapons for battlefield use. South Korean defense officials describe the weapons system as a short-range ballistic missile.

            The official Korean Central News Agency said the tests simulated strikes on targets up to 395 kilometers (245 miles) away.

            According to Japanese and South Korean assessments, the North Korean missiles flew at a maximum altitude of 50-100 kilometers (30-60 miles) and a distance of 340-400 kilometers (210-250 miles).

            North Korea has claimed to have missiles capable of striking both the U.S. mainland and South Korea with nuclear weapons, but many foreign experts have said North Korea still has not mastered some key technologies, such as building warheads small enough to be mounted on missiles and ensuring those warheads survive atmospheric reentry.

            In her statement Monday, Kim Yo Jong reiterated that North Korea has reentry vehicle technology. She also hit back at South Korean experts who questioned whether North Korea’s ICBMs would be functional in real-war situations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815440,"Stutzle, Tkachuk power Senators to 7-2 win over Blues","OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Tim Stutzle and Brady Tkachuk had three-point games to lead the Ottawa Senators to a 7-2 win over the St. Louis Blues on Sunday.

            Stutzle had two goals and an assist and extended his point streak to four games (four goals, six assists). 

            “I just try to play my game every night and get better every day at practice, too, and I think as a team we’re playing way better than we did,” Stutzle said. “We’re holding on to pucks making plays and it’s a lot of fun playing.”











            Stutzle’s teammates are enjoying his development.

            “You guys can see it, his confidence is very high right now,” Thomas Chabot said. “He’s such a talented player. Anytime he gets the puck something happens and I think we’ve all seen that since he’s been here.

            “Obviously, it’s taken to another level, but I think he’s going to keep that going.”

            Tkachuk extended his career-best point streak to seven games (5 goals, 6 assists) with a goal and two assists.

            Shane Pinto, Alex DeBrincat, Drake Batherson and Ridley Greig also scored for Ottawa. Mads Sogaard made 30 saves.

            The Senators were coming off a disappointing 4-3 overtime loss to Chicago on Friday. They also wanted to take advantage of the fact the Blues were coming off a 4-1 loss to the Avalanche on Saturday and traveled from Colorado, not to mention the trade of some key players in the past 48 hours.

            “I think people on the outside made so much noise about losing to Chicago, but any team can beat any team, we’re witness to that,” Senators coach D. J. Smith said. “I think our guys knew we didn’t play the right way, they turned the page, which is a good sign because if you win a game you’re not going to be too high either and I think that’s where the leadership has gotten a lot better.”

            Colton Parayko and Tyler Pitlick scored for the Blues. Thomas Greiss stopped 27 shots.

            “They have to figure it out,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. “You’ve got to get over what’s going on. We have veterans in there that are good players and they’ve got to take control of the team and they’ve got to understand the situation we’re in.”

            Stutzle scored his second goal of the game early in the second period, beating Greiss through the pads to make it 6-0. 

            The Blues spoiled Sogaard’s shutout bid when Parayko got a shot off through traffic, and Pitlick scored his third of the season, tipping in Justin Faulk’s shot from the blue line two minutes later.

            Greig scored his first career NHL goal with just over one minute remaining in regulation, picking up a loose puck in front.

            Leading 1-0 to start the second, the Senators scored four consecutive goals and raced out to a 5-0 lead.

            DeBrincat scored a one-timer on the power play to make it 2-0. Stutzle had a great move to get Greiss moving for his 25th of the season and Tkachuk made it by 4-0 tipping a shot by Claude Giroux. Batherson got in on the action, beating Greiss.

            Pinto opened the scoring late in the first period, taking a pass from Batherson and scoring a one-timer for his 14th of the season.

            TRADE

            The Senators acquired forward Julien Gauthier and a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2023 from the New York Rangers in exchange for Tyler Motte. Should the Rangers advance past the first round of the playoffs, the pick will improve to the lower of the Rangers’ or the Winnipeg Jets 2023 sixth-round selection.

            NOTES: Ottawa recalled defenseman Dillon Heatherington from AHL Belleville. ... After missing Saturday’s game against Colorado with an undisclosed injury Torey Krug was back in the lineup for the Blues.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Tim Stutzle and Brady Tkachuk had three-point games to lead the Ottawa Senators to a 7-2 win over the St. Louis Blues on Sunday.Stutzle had two goals and an assist and extended his point streak to four games (four goals, six assists).“I just try to play my game every night and get better every day at practice, too, and I think as a team we’re playing way better than we did,” Stutzle said. “We’re holding on to pucks making plays and it’s a lot of fun playing.”Stutzle’s teammates are enjoying his development.“You guys can see it, his confidence is very high right now,” Thomas Chabot said. “He’s such a talented player. Anytime he gets the puck something happens and I think we’ve all seen that since he’s been here.“Obviously, it’s taken to another level, but I think he’s going to keep that going.”Tkachuk extended his career-best point streak to seven games (5 goals, 6 assists) with a goal and two assists.Shane Pinto, Alex DeBrincat, Drake Batherson and Ridley Greig also scored for Ottawa. Mads Sogaard made 30 saves.The Senators were coming off a disappointing 4-3 overtime loss to Chicago on Friday. They also wanted to take advantage of the fact the Blues were coming off a 4-1 loss to the Avalanche on Saturday and traveled from Colorado, not to mention the trade of some key players in the past 48 hours.“I think people on the outside made so much noise about losing to Chicago, but any team can beat any team, we’re witness to that,” Senators coach D. J. Smith said. “I think our guys knew we didn’t play the right way, they turned the page, which is a good sign because if you win a game you’re not going to be too high either and I think that’s where the leadership has gotten a lot better.”Colton Parayko and Tyler Pitlick scored for the Blues. Thomas Greiss stopped 27 shots.“They have to figure it out,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. “You’ve got to get over what’s going on. We have veterans in there that are good players and they’ve got to take control of the team and they’ve got to understand the situation we’re in.”Stutzle scored his second goal of the game early in the second period, beating Greiss through the pads to make it 6-0.The Blues spoiled Sogaard’s shutout bid when Parayko got a shot off through traffic, and Pitlick scored his third of the season, tipping in Justin Faulk’s shot from the blue line two minutes later.Greig scored his first career NHL goal with just over one minute remaining in regulation, picking up a loose puck in front.Leading 1-0 to start the second, the Senators scored four consecutive goals and raced out to a 5-0 lead.DeBrincat scored a one-timer on the power play to make it 2-0. Stutzle had a great move to get Greiss moving for his 25th of the season and Tkachuk made it by 4-0 tipping a shot by Claude Giroux. Batherson got in on the action, beating Greiss.Pinto opened the scoring late in the first period, taking a pass from Batherson and scoring a one-timer for his 14th of the season.TRADEThe Senators acquired forward Julien Gauthier and a conditional seventh-round draft pick in 2023 from the New York Rangers in exchange for Tyler Motte. Should the Rangers advance past the first round of the playoffs, the pick will improve to the lower of the Rangers’ or the Winnipeg Jets 2023 sixth-round selection.NOTES: Ottawa recalled defenseman Dillon Heatherington from AHL Belleville. ...

            A free throw by Zakiyah Franklin drew Kansas within 82-80 with 3:12 remaining. Neither team would score another field goal as Kansas missed its last nine shots and Oklahoma's last field goal came with 5:12 remaining.

            Williams made two free throws with 37 seconds left and Ana Llanusa added two more with nine seconds left to wrap up Oklahoma's sixth consecutive victory.











            Scott had 15 points and 10 rebounds for the Sooners (22-4, 12-3 Big 12). She and Williams were two of five players in double-figures scoring for Oklahoma. Llanusa scored 18 points, Aubrey Joens 12, and Taylor Robertson 11.

            The Jayhawks got 73 of their 80 points from the trio of Franklin, Holly Kersgieter and Taiyanna Jackson. Franklin led with a career-high 30 points, Kersgieter added 24 and Jackson 19 for Kansas (16-9, 6-8). Jackson added 13 rebounds.

            The Sooners, tied with Texas for first place, are chasing their seventh Big 12 regular-season championship and their first since 2009. The tie will be broken on Saturday when Oklahoma hosts the No. 17 Longhorns, after which there will be two conference games remaining for both teams.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815445,"Roberts, Sasser score 20, No. 2 Houston beats Memphis 72-64","HOUSTON (AP) — J’Wan Roberts had a career-high 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Marcus Sasser also scored 20 points as No. 2 Houston held off Memphis 72-64 on Sunday.

            Jamal Shead added 10 points for Houston (25-2, 13-1 American Athletic Conference). The Cougars shot 45% but struggled from deep, going 3 of 17 on 3-pointers.

            The Cougars forced 18 turnovers, which they converted into 22 points. Houston has won seven straight games.











            “The makeup of this team is winners,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “These kids know how to win. … Do they look great every night? I never thought it was a beauty contest. Last time I checked, you don’t put an asterisk beside anything. Just go win the game. Can we play better? Absolutely. That wasn’t our A-game tonight for sure.”

            Elijah McCadden had 20 points and six rebounds, DeAndre Williams added 18 points and Damaria Franklin scored 10 for Memphis (20-7, 10-4). The Tigers shot 44%, including 6 of 15 on 3-pointers.

            “I am encouraged because that team is going to be No. 1 in the nation tomorrow,” Memphis coach Penny Hardaway said. “I think we know that we can play with them. I think this group now has seen and been in the fire in a hostile environment against those guys, so I’m definitely encouraged.”

            Memphis was without leading scorer Kendric Davis, who averages over 21 points. Davis went through warmups but was out of the lineup with an injury.

            After trailing 32-21 at the half, Memphis opened the second half by shooting 5 for 7 and cutting the lead to 38-34 on a 3-pointer by Franklin with 16 minutes remaining, which capped a 6-0 run.

            Houston responded with a 9-2 spurt to regain an 11-point lead at 47-36 on a layup by Roberts with 12 minutes remaining.

            “Basketball is a game of runs, so I just felt like we just had to keep our composure,” Sasser said. “I feel like that was adversity during the game, and I felt like we did a good job of staying composed and handling their run and coming back and getting our run.”

            The Tigers closed within 63-58 with 2:24 remaining on a layup by Williams, but that was as close as Memphis would get as Houston made nine of its last 10 free throws to put away the game.

            “Not big on moral victories,” Hardaway said. “We had our opportunities right there three times with the ball down five. We didn’t seize the moment. Just got to take the good from this game and keep it moving.”

            Houston used a 17-3 run over a five-minute stretch of the first half to open up a 30-16 lead on Sasser’s jumper with 3:47 left in the half. Sasser scored seven points in the run.

            BIG PICTURE

            Memphis: The Tigers fell to 1-2 against ranked opponents this season. … Memphis missed a chance to help its NCAA Tournament resume, falling to 7-6 in Quad 1 and 2 games, including 2-3 in Quad 1 games. … Memphis outrebounded Houston 34-30.

            Houston: The Cougars improved to 12-1 in Quad 1 and 2 games. … Houston shot 23 of 26 from the free throw line, including making 13 straight at one point in the second half. … The Cougars held a 38-32 advantage in points in the paint.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Following losses to No. 1 Alabama and No. 3 Purdue last week, Houston could regain the top spot in the AP Top 25 for a third time this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815450,Rantanen's goal late in OT lifts Avalanche past Oilers 6-5,"DENVER (AP) — Mikko Rantanen scored with 21 seconds remaining in overtime, and the Colorado Avalanche rallied to beat the Edmonton Oilers 6-5 on Sunday.

            J.T. Compher had a goal and three assists, Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and an assist and Artturi Lehkonen, Valeri Nichushkin and Logan O’Connor added goals for Colorado, which won its third straight. Alexandar Georgiev stopped 35 shots.

            The Avalanche were playing for the second consecutive day; they won at St. Louis 4-1 on Saturday afternoon.











            “It was ugly game, on our side of it anyway,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “We had a bunch of guys that looked really tired and mentally tired.” 

            After the Oilers iced the puck to set up a faceoff in their zone, Rantanen made them pay with his 36th goal of the season.

            Edmonton lost its third straight game after regulation and its fourth in a row overall. The Oilers, who haven’t won in Denver since Dec. 11, 2018, have blown three-goal leads in consecutive games and have dropped six straight to the Avalanche.

            “Normally I’d like dress it up and say it’s good to get a point but I’ve got to say that that was utterly disappointing for us,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said.

            Warren Foegele scored twice, Mattias Janmark had a goal and an assist and Tyson Barrie and Leon Draisaitl also scored for the Oilers. Jack Campbell had 36 saves.

            “We score enough goals and the mentality has to be to defend,” Foegele said. “It’s just having the right mindset. We’re up three so we got to take shorter shifts and stay above guys, and for some reason we’re just not doing that.”

            The Oilers jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the second period on two goals by Foegele and Draisaitl’s 33rd of the season. Colorado got goals 4:14 apart from MacKinnon and Nichushkin to make it 3-2, but Barrie’s goal late in the period made it 4-2 heading into the third.

            MacKinnon scored his second of the game and 20th of the season 26 seconds into the third period. Janmark answered at 3:58 to make it 5-3, and O’Connor made it a one-goal game at 9:30. Lehkonen’s tip at 15:48 completed the comeback and sent it to overtime.

            “It’s easy to nitpick every single night, we play so many games we’re going to have off periods sometimes,” MacKinnon said. “Lately it’s been really good in the third.”

            TRADING PLACES

            Colorado swapped defensemen for Sunday’s game, with Josh Manson in and Cale Makar out. Manson didn’t make the trip to St. Louis on Saturday — a planned day off after he missed 31 games with an lower-body injury — and Makar was out Sunday after taking a hit to the head in the win over the Blues.

            Makar missed three games in early February after he took a hit in the head from Pittsburgh’s Jeff Carter.

            KANE OUT

            Edmonton scratched left-winger Evander Kane (upper-body injury) and recalled Devin Shore from Bakersfield of the AHL. Kane’s injury is considered day to day. The Oilers played with 11 forwards.

            JOHNSON UPDATE

            Bednar confirmed that defenseman Erik Johnson suffered a broken ankle and will be out for an extended time. Johnson hasn’t played since Feb. 11 with what the team classified as a lower-body injury but multiple reports Sunday said Johnson has a broken ankle.

            “I don’t have a tight timeline on him, but he’s out indefinitely,” Bednar said.

Alexandar Georgiev stopped 35 shots.The Avalanche were playing for the second consecutive day; they won at St. Louis 4-1 on Saturday afternoon.“It was ugly game, on our side of it anyway,” Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. “We had a bunch of guys that looked really tired and mentally tired.”After the Oilers iced the puck to set up a faceoff in their zone, Rantanen made them pay with his 36th goal of the season.Edmonton lost its third straight game after regulation and its fourth in a row overall. The Oilers, who haven’t won in Denver since Dec. 11, 2018, have blown three-goal leads in consecutive games and have dropped six straight to the Avalanche.“Normally I’d like dress it up and say it’s good to get a point but I’ve got to say that that was utterly disappointing for us,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said.Warren Foegele scored twice, Mattias Janmark had a goal and an assist and Tyson Barrie and Leon Draisaitl also scored for the Oilers. Jack Campbell had 36 saves.“We score enough goals and the mentality has to be to defend,” Foegele said. “It’s just having the right mindset. We’re up three so we got to take shorter shifts and stay above guys, and for some reason we’re just not doing that.”The Oilers jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the second period on two goals by Foegele and Draisaitl’s 33rd of the season. Colorado got goals 4:14 apart from MacKinnon and Nichushkin to make it 3-2, but Barrie’s goal late in the period made it 4-2 heading into the third.MacKinnon scored his second of the game and 20th of the season 26 seconds into the third period. Janmark answered at 3:58 to make it 5-3, and O’Connor made it a one-goal game at 9:30. Lehkonen’s tip at 15:48 completed the comeback and sent it to overtime.“It’s easy to nitpick every single night, we play so many games we’re going to have off periods sometimes,” MacKinnon said. “Lately it’s been really good in the third.”TRADING PLACESColorado swapped defensemen for Sunday’s game, with Josh Manson in and Cale Makar out. Manson didn’t make the trip to St. Louis on Saturday — a planned day off after he missed 31 games with an lower-body injury — and Makar was out Sunday after taking a hit to the head in the win over the Blues.Makar missed three games in early February after he took a hit in the head from Pittsburgh’s Jeff Carter.KANE OUTEdmonton scratched left-winger Evander Kane (upper-body injury) and recalled Devin Shore from Bakersfield of the AHL. Kane’s injury is considered day to day. The Oilers played with 11 forwards.JOHNSON UPDATEBednar confirmed that defenseman Erik Johnson suffered a broken ankle and will be out for an extended time. Johnson hasn’t played since Feb. 11 with what the team classified as a lower-body injury but multiple reports Sunday said Johnson has a broken ankle.“I don’t have a tight timeline on him, but he’s out indefinitely,” Bednar said.UP NEXTOilers: Host Philadelphia on Tuesday night.Avalanche: At Winnipeg on Friday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/20,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815451,Trea Turner settling in for long future in Philadelphia,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — The past few years have been a bit of a whirlwind for Trea Turner. They included a World Series title in Washington, a trade to Los Angeles — and then an 11-year, $300 million contract that brought him back to the NL East.

            The one constant amid all that: Turner has played with some pretty impressive teammates. And that's not about to change.

            “I've been on some really, really good teams with some great players — last year being one of them,"" Turner said Sunday. ""That's kind of the beauty and the difficult thing about baseball. The best teams don't always win. Just because we got a lot of talent in here and a lot of good guys, and they made it to the World Series last year, doesn't mean it's going to happen again. You've got to put in the work.”











            The Phillies seemed to understand that this offseason. Yes, they won the National League pennant last year, but they were also an 87-win wild card appearing in the postseason for the first time in over a decade. And Philadelphia shares a division with teams in Atlanta and New York that appear formidable for the foreseeable future. 

            
                Signing Turner, a 29-year-old shortstop who has been an All-Star the past two years, showed the Phillies are willing to stay aggressive, too.

            It also gave Turner some stability. Washington declined quickly after winning the World Series in 2019. The Nationals eventually dealt both Turner and Max Scherzer to the Dodgers two seasons later. That put Turner right back in the postseason for a couple years.

            All that moving — plus a pandemic and a lockout that created doubts about whether baseball would be played at all — could wear on anyone. But now Turner has a long-term deal with another strong team.

            “That's something that me, my wife and my family wanted, was just, not have to rent anymore, not have to move around, not have to worry about getting traded,"" he said. ""A lot of guys, probably overwhelming majority, don't get to choose where they get to play for their career. Luckily enough, I was in a situation where I could pick. I'm stuck here, and nobody can tell me otherwise, so I think I'm really happy about that, that security.”

            Turner's deal included a full no-trade provision.

            In Philadelphia's clubhouse at spring training, Turner's locker is right next to Bryce Harper's. The two played together in Washington before Harper signed with the Phillies before the 2019 season.

            Harper, who had elbow surgery in the offseason, is not in camp yet. Turner says they've texted. There are quite a few former Nationals stars scattered around the majors. Juan Soto is with San Diego, and Scherzer is now with the Mets.

            “We had a lot of talent over there,"" Turner said. ""It’s fun seeing guys still compete and be good — at a lot of different points in their career.”

            Scherzer has remained effective into his late 30s. Harper is 30 and still has nine years left on a contract that's similar to Turner's.

            “For me, you kind of bet on the person,"" Turner said. ""Betting on Bryce, betting on Max, you're not going to go wrong. They put in the work, they take care of themselves. They may have an injury here or there, but that's part of the game, but you know that over the long period of time, that they're going to bring a lot to the table, on and off the field. I would bet on both those guys any day of the week.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815452,The great Bill Russell remembered at NBA All-Star weekend,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — This was the first All-Star weekend since the death of 11-time champion, Hall of Fame player and Hall of Fame coach Bill Russell.

            He was not forgotten.

            The entire season has been a tribute to Russell, with all teams putting his No. 6 at midcourt and all players wearing it on their jerseys. And at Sunday’s Legends Brunch — one of the best events of All-Star weekend, not to mention one of the toughest tickets to secure — Russell was honored with remarks from Boston All-Star Jaylen Brown, former on-court rivals Julius Erving and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Hall of Famer Grant Hill.











            Abdul-Jabbar called Russell “my friend, my mentor, my role model.” He was 14 when he first met Russell and the initial greeting wasn’t overly friendly; the Celtics were using the gym at Power Memorial in New York, Abdul-Jabbar’s high school, for practice. Russell was reading The New York Times, and Celtics coach Red Auerbach suggested he meet the player then known as Lew Alcindor.

            How Abdul-Jabbar remembered Russell's response: “I’m not getting up to meet some kid.”

            They met anyway, and became very close over the years, with Russell — notorious for disliking autographs — even signing a Celtics jersey for Abdul-Jabbar a few years ago. And that day, just as he did in that high school gym a half-century earlier, Russell called Abdul-Jabbar “kid.”

            “There’s a whole lot more truth and love and respect for my 60-year relationship with Bill Russell,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “Not just as one of the greatest basketball players to ever live, but as the man who taught me how to be bigger as a player, and as a man.”

            Hill spoke of how he had heard plenty about Russell — his commitment to social justice and civil rights, an unwillingness to be deterred by threats, and his pride in standing alongside other athletes committed to the same, everyone from Muhammad Ali to Colin Kaepernick.

            “And then I got to meet Bill Russell. It wasn’t at all what I expected,” Hill said. “While I had read about his strength and his seriousness, what I saw with my own eyes was his happiness and his humor. He was all of those things. And that’s what made Bill Russell great. Great for the game. Great for the country. Just great to be around.”

            Erving told the story of how he played golf with Russell, and how neither was very good. Golf was merely an excuse to get together and tell stories, ones that would often bring Russell’s loud and distinct cackle when he found something humorous.

            “Everybody knew when William Felton Russell was in the room,” Erving said. “I cherish those times.”

            PERFORMERS

            There was a huge crowd of fans on the floor for the halftime show. And a whole lot of players, too.

            The halftime concert featured three Nigerian artists — Grammy-winning singer, songwriter and producer Burna Boy, Grammy-winning and Oscar-nominated singer Tems and rapper Rema — doing an Afrobeats-themed performance. Several players were on the court for the performance, including Pascal Siakam and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

            Jewel, a Utah native, performed “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the game, Post Malone did a medley after LeBron James and Antetokounmpo drafted their teams, and Jully Black sang the Canadian national anthem before the game.

            CELEBRITIES

            As always, the stars were out for All-Star.

            Among the many in attendance: retired skiing great Lindsey Vonn, EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) winner Jennifer Hudson, actor-director Spike Lee, retired baseball star Albert Pujols, tennis standouts Frances Tiafoe and Naomi Osaka, snowboarding’s Shaun White and, of course, Utah Jazz Hall of Famers John Stockton and Karl Malone.

            ZHURI'S MOMENT

            LeBron James always said that he wasn't chasing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring record, so there was no sense of relief when he actually took over the top spot on the NBA points list.

            To him, the best moment within that moment was the reaction of his daughter Zhuri to the record-breaking jumper earlier this month. James posted the clip on his social channels.

            “The Lakers’ social media post, they posted the one with my whole family on there that I actually posted I believe yesterday or the other day,"" James said. “It’s hard for me to stop watching that because watching Zhuri’s reaction to that is, like, the greatest — it’s so cool.

            “If I’m having a bad day, I know exactly where I can go to fix my day,"" he added. “Seeing Zhuri’s reaction to that moment was pretty, pretty cool.""

            SILVER’S ANNIVERSARY

            Not only was this weekend the 30th anniversary of Utah’s first time hosting the All-Star Game, but it was also the 30th anniversary of Adam Silver’s first All-Star Game as part of the NBA.

            Back then, he was special assistant to Commissioner David Stern. Now, Silver is the NBA Commissioner.

            “It’s interesting to think about the contrast between then and now,” Silver said.

            It’s all different.

            All-Star ballots were on paper then and distributed in arenas; Michael Jordan was the leading vote-getter with just over 1 million votes. Voting is electronic now; LeBron James got about 8 million votes this year.

            There’s been about a 500% increase in the number of international players in the NBA over the last 30 years, from around 20 in 1993 to around 120 now. And no All-Star Game will mean more to a local economy than this one, Silver said, with a $280 million estimated impact from the weekend on Salt Lake City businesses.

            “In terms of the magnitude of All-Star, this is our largest in our history,” he said.

            MCCLUNG EFFECT

            The NBA said Sunday that the video of All-Star Saturday Night — highlighted by Mac McClung’s win in the dunk contest — generated more than 520 million views in the first 12 hours following the competition.

            That was the most ever for an All-Star Saturday night, the league said, and the figure is obviously just going to keep rising.

(AP) — Roommates Elizabeth Kitley and Georgia Amoore both had double-doubles and No. 11 Virginia Tech won its fifth straight, defeating North Carolina State 75-62 on Sunday.

            Kitley had 24 points and 10 rebounds for her 50th career double-double and had seven blocks. Amoore had 15 points and 11 assists, which tied her career high. 

            Virginia Tech has won six straight, the previous three against ranked teams, starting with a 73-61 win over the Wolfpack. That marked the Hokies' first-ever win in Raleigh and now they have their first-ever sweep of NC State.











            D'asia Gregg matched her career-high with 13 points for the Hokies (22-4, 12-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) and Taylor Soule had 12. Before a season-high crowd of 6,413. They have road games remaining at North Carolina on Thursday and Georgia Tech on Sunday.

            Soule was 6-of-8 shooting and Gregg 5-of-6 as Virginia Tech shot 56% (31 of 55). Gregg made half of the Hokies' six 3s. 

            Aziaha James scored a career-high 20 points in her first start for the Wolfpack (18-9, 8-8), who are out of the poll for the first time in 96 weeks dating to February of 2018. James started for leading scorer Diamond Johnson, who has been battling an ankle injury and missed the game. Mimi Collins added 12 points.

            James hit a pair of 3-pointers to close the first quarter with the Wolfpack on top 19-18.

            Amoore had back-to-back buckets in a 10-0 to put the Hokies on top 31-25 in the middle of the second quarter and Kitley scored five quick points, among her 11 in the quarter, as Virginia Tech pushed the lead to 11. It was 47-36 at the half. 

            After North Carolina State opened the second half with a 3-pointer, the Hokies reeled off 12 straight, five by Kitley, for a 59-39 lead. It was 60-47 enter the fourth quarter after River Baldwin hit her first 3 of the season for the Wolfpack just before the buzzer.

            Six NC State points early in the fourth quarter made it a nine-point game but that was as close as the Wolfpack, who play at No. 9 Duke on Wednesday, could get.

            Gonzales made half of her six 3-pointers and all seven of her free throws for the Longhorns (21-7, 12-3 Big 12 Conference). Harmon sank 10 of 12 fouls shots and added six rebounds and six assists. Faye finished with 12 points on 6-of-8 shooting and 11 rebounds.

            Ja'Haiya Quinerly had 16 points before fouling out to pace the Mountaineers (16-9, 7-7). Madisen Smith hit three 3-pointers and scored 12. Jayla Hemingway pitched in with nine points and seven rebounds.











            Faye scored 10 points on 5-of-6 shooting and grabbed seven rebounds, to lead Texas to a 25-14 lead after one quarter. Gonzales added nine points as the Longhorns sank 9 of 19 shots from the floor. 

            Texas went cold in the second quarter, missing 12 of 14 shots. The Mountaineers didn't fare much better, making 3 of 14 attempts, and still trailed by 11 at halftime, 34-23.

            West Virginia was down 41-31 at the 7:44 mark of the third quarter after a Quinerly basket. Faye answered with a layup, Gonzales buried a 3-pointer to cap an 8-0 run and Texas pushed its lead to 18.

            The Longhorns shot 41% overall but made 5 of 9 tries from beyond the arc. They finished 21 of 27 at the foul line.

            West Virginia shot 27% overall and hit only 6 of 21 shots from distance (29%). The Mountaineers sank 12 of 16 free throws.

            Texas out-rebounded West Virginia 53-27, grabbing 20 off the offensive glass that led to a 20-14 advantage in second-chance points. 

            The Longhorns have won 12 straight at home, eight of them in conference play, and improved to 14-1 in Austin this season. Texas is 17-0 this season when holding opponents to 59 points or less.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815470,No. 1 South Carolina survives 64-57 in overtime at Ole Miss,"OXFORD, Miss. (AP) — Pushed to the brink, Zia Cooke and South Carolina finally exerted control once the game went into overtime.

            Cooke scored five of her 24 points in overtime to help the No. 1 Gamecocks remain unbeaten with a 64-57 victory over Mississippi on Sunday.

            The defending national champion Gamecocks (27-0, 14-0 Southeastern Conference) got one of their biggest scares of the season before winning their 33rd straight game. The Rebels (20-7, 9-5) never trailed by more than six points in regulation and flirted with their first win over a No. 1 team in 46 years.











            “They were locked in,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “They played their zone and were committed to it, and we didn’t handle it well until we actually had to. So it was a good gameplan.”

            She called the Rebels “an NCAA Tournament team,” and they certainly looked the part.

            Cooke had six rebounds and four assists to help off-set a 7-of-18 shooting performance. Aliyah Boston added 13 points and 11 rebounds on 4-of-14 shooting and didn’t score in the first quarter.

            The deep Gamecocks didn’t get their usual supply of scoring help for the two stars, though Kamilla Cardoso had eight points and 11 boards.

            Angel Baker led Ole Miss with 17 points. Snudda Collins added 11 while Marquesha Davis had nine points and seven rebounds. Rita Igbokwe blocked six shots.

            Ole Miss coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin began her postgame news conference with a big sigh.

            “Tough one. Man, today was an incredibly emotional game for me, our players, everybody,” she said. “I just grew up looking up to Dawn Staley. I just have so much respect for her as a person. She has become a mentor of mine.

            “To be able to take them into overtime and have an opportunity to win after being our third game of the week was incredible.”

            It was only the third single-digit margin and second overtime game for the defending national champions, who had been winning by an average of 33.5 points. The first two came against No. 3 Stanford (76-71 in overtime) and No. 6 UConn (81-77). South Carolina dominated overtime, 9-2.

            Cooke's second basket of overtime matched South Carolina's biggest lead to that point, 63-57, with 1:33 left. The teams swapped turnovers but Ole Miss missed three shots trying to stay alive, including two straight 3-point tries by Baker after offensive rebounds.

            Cooke, who had scored South Carolina's first eight points of the game, then made one of two foul shots.

            Ole Miss had rallied from a six-point deficit over the final 7 minutes to force overtime. 

            Baker had a steal and layup and then gave Ole Miss its first lead since the opening minutes with a jumper to go up 55-54 with 1:20 left. Then Igbokwe blocked two shots by Boston to preserve the edge.

            With 30 seconds left, Boston made 1 of 2 free throws to tie it up. Ole Miss turned it over without getting a shot off, and Boston couldn't make one at the buzzer as South Carolina finished regulation on a 1-of-11 slump.

            Overtime was a different story.

            “I thought we just were calculating in where we wanted the ball to go and our posts (players) came through,” Staley said.

            BIG PICTURE

            South Carolina: Made only 23 of 61 shots (37.7%) but outrebounded the Rebels 49-36. The nation's top scoring defense put the clamps on in overtime.

            Ole Miss: Has dropped 17 in a row against South Carolina. ... Had six players with two points in the first quarter, trailing 16-12. ... The 1977 team had beaten eventual national champion and No. 1 Delta State 73-72 in Oxford.

            LOOK BACK

            Ole Miss has come a long way since McPhee-McCuin remembers about 500 fans (officially, 1,225) on hand for her first time hosting Staley's Gamecocks. It was an 87-32 Gamecocks win, but the score was 32-2 at the half.

            “Nobody was in the Pavillion and the only reason I remember is because I was embarrassed because I looked up to Dawn,” the Rebels coach said. ""And I know she built something and I'm trying to build something. 

            “And today to hear the fans, they were so engaged and they almost took us to the 'W'.”

(AP) — Pushed to the brink, Zia Cooke and South Carolina finally exerted control once the game went into overtime.Cooke scored five of her 24 points in overtime to help the No. 1 Gamecocks remain unbeaten with a 64-57 victory over Mississippi on Sunday.The defending national champion Gamecocks (27-0, 14-0 Southeastern Conference) got one of their biggest scares of the season before winning their 33rd straight game. The Rebels (20-7, 9-5) never trailed by more than six points in regulation and flirted with their first win over a No. 1 team in 46 years.“They were locked in,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “They played their zone and were committed to it, and we didn’t handle it well until we actually had to. So it was a good gameplan.”She called the Rebels “an NCAA Tournament team,” and they certainly looked the part.Cooke had six rebounds and four assists to help off-set a 7-of-18 shooting performance. Aliyah Boston added 13 points and 11 rebounds on 4-of-14 shooting and didn’t score in the first quarter.The deep Gamecocks didn’t get their usual supply of scoring help for the two stars, though Kamilla Cardoso had eight points and 11 boards.Angel Baker led Ole Miss with 17 points. Snudda Collins added 11 while Marquesha Davis had nine points and seven rebounds. Rita Igbokwe blocked six shots.Ole Miss coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin began her postgame news conference with a big sigh.“Tough one. Man, today was an incredibly emotional game for me, our players, everybody,” she said. “I just grew up looking up to Dawn Staley. I just have so much respect for her as a person. She has become a mentor of mine.“To be able to take them into overtime and have an opportunity to win after being our third game of the week was incredible.”It was only the third single-digit margin and second overtime game for the defending national champions, who had been winning by an average of 33.5 points. The first two came against No. 3 Stanford (76-71 in overtime) and No. 6 UConn (81-77). South Carolina dominated overtime, 9-2.Cooke's second basket of overtime matched South Carolina's biggest lead to that point, 63-57, with 1:33 left. The teams swapped turnovers but Ole Miss missed three shots trying to stay alive, including two straight 3-point tries by Baker after offensive rebounds.Cooke, who had scored South Carolina's first eight points of the game, then made one of two foul shots.Ole Miss had rallied from a six-point deficit over the final 7 minutes to force overtime.Baker had a steal and layup and then gave Ole Miss its first lead since the opening minutes with a jumper to go up 55-54 with 1:20 left. Then Igbokwe blocked two shots by Boston to preserve the edge.With 30 seconds left, Boston made 1 of 2 free throws to tie it up. Ole Miss turned it over without getting a shot off, and Boston couldn't make one at the buzzer as South Carolina finished regulation on a 1-of-11 slump.Overtime was a different story.“I thought we just were calculating in where we wanted the ball to go and our posts (players) came through,” Staley said.BIG PICTURESouth Carolina: Made only 23 of 61 shots (37.7%) but outrebounded the Rebels 49-36. The nation's top scoring defense put the clamps on in overtime.Ole Miss: Has dropped 17 in a row against South Carolina. ... Had six players with two points in the first quarter, trailing 16-12. ... The 1977 team had beaten eventual national champion and No. 1 Delta State 73-72 in Oxford.LOOK BACKOle Miss has come a long way since McPhee-McCuin remembers about 500 fans (officially, 1,225) on hand for her first time hosting Staley's Gamecocks. It was an 87-32 Gamecocks win, but the score was 32-2 at the half.“Nobody was in the Pavillion and the only reason I remember is because I was embarrassed because I looked up to Dawn,” the Rebels coach said. ""And I know she built something and I'm trying to build something.“And today to hear the fans, they were so engaged and they almost took us to the 'W'.”UP NEXTSouth Carolina visits Tennessee on Thursday night.Ole Miss hosts Missouri on Thursday night.___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll",2023/02/20,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815472,Rahm holds on to win at Riviera and return to No. 1 in world,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jon Rahm is playing at such a high level he felt he didn't need the Official World Golf Ranking to tell him he was the No. 1 player in golf.

            Rahm earned another trophy Sunday in the Genesis Invitational, his fifth in his last nine tournaments worldwide, and this was a big one. He won on a course like Riviera, at a tournament hosted by Tiger Woods and after a tense battle with Max Homa that required Rahm's best golf.

            And now he's officially No. 1.











            “I don't need a ranking to validate anything,” Rahm said. “Having the best season of my life, and hopefully, I can keep it going.”

            In a back-and-forth final round — Rahm went from a three-shot lead to a one-shot deficit at one point — the Spaniard pulled away with a pivotal recovery for par, a 45-foot birdie putt and an 8-iron to 2 feet on the par-3 16th. 

            That carried him to a 2-under 69 and a two-shot victory over Homa (68), with Patrick Cantlay (67) another shot behind.

            “I wanted to push him. He is a spectacular golfer,” said Homa, who got choked up twice speaking to the media because of how much his hometown event means to him. ""I’ve known him since college and he’s been like this since then — No. 1 amateur in the world, No. 1 player in the world, all the accolades.

            “I wanted to make him beat me and I think I did that.”

            Woods could claim a small consolation. He finished a 72-hole event for the first time since the Masters last April, though he was quick to joke, “Unfortunately, my streak continues.” He now has played 12 times as a pro at Riviera without winning.

            Under the circumstances, this wasn't a bad week.

            Woods played only three times last year because of a fused back and battered legs from surgeries (left) and a car crash (right). This was a rare appearance, and Woods doesn't know if he'll play again before the Masters.

            He still had the largest gallery to the end, thousands of fans packed on the hill over the 18th green to watch him close out with a par in that familiar red shirt under a black vest.

            And then the spectators turned their attention to a terrific duel between Rahm and Homa that wasn't really decided until Homa tried to chip in for birdie on the 18th and fell to his knees when the ball banged off the pin.

            Rahm has not finished out of the top 10 in his last 10 tournaments. It was his third win in five starts on the PGA Tour this year, and he already has earned more than $9 million the last two months.

            This wasn't as easy as it looked at the end, when all he had to do was tap in for par and scoop up his two young sons.

            “That was a tough week and a tough Sunday,” Rahm said.

            Homa, who won at Riviera two years ago, began the final round three shots back. He quickly closed to within one shot, only for the Spaniard to come within inches of holing out from the fairway at No. 8 for a tap-in birdie, while Homa made bogey from behind the green to slip three shot behind again.

            And then it changed quickly. 

            After Homa birdied the ninth from 15 feet, he drove to the far edge of the 10th green and got down in two for a birdie. Rahm went well left. His pitch was short and rolled down the back of the green, behind a bunker. He pitched onto — and then over — the green into another bunker, and he had to make a 6-footer for bogey.

            Two holes later, Homa took the lead for the first time when Rahm three-putted for bogey, only for Homa to give it back with a bogey from a bad tee shot.

            “If you tell me on the ninth tee after that tee shot that I was going to be one back on 13 tee, I wouldn’t believe you because I was feeling that good,” Rahm said. “But it’s golf and this golf course — especially this golf course — can get you.”

            He steadied himself with a 6-iron for a dirt lie left of the 13th fairway that set up a long two-putt par, and then the par 3s won it for him.

            Rahm holed a 45-footer on the 14th, and then hit 8-iron — “Probably the best swing of the week,"" he said — over the bunker to tap-in range for birdie on the 16th.

            He finished at 17-under 267 and earned $3.6 million from the $20 million purse, the second straight elevated event on the PGA Tour. Rahm now has won just over $9.4 million in the last two months on the PGA Tour. 

            Golf now has had three players at No. 1 in the last three weeks — Scottie Scheffler won in Phoenix last week to replace Rory McIlroy, and now Rahm is back on top.

            “It's the beauty of the year that we’re living right now,” Rahm said. “It’s exciting for us to play and exciting for the golf fans because things like this can happen.”

            For the last six months, dating to that 62 in the final round at Wentworth, they seem to be happening mostly to him.

Geopolitical tensions were ever present with North Korea firing more missiles and talk of Russia ramping up attacks in Ukraine before Friday's one- year anniversary of the invasion.
There were reports the White House planned new sanctions on Russia, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday warned Beijing of consequences should it provide material support, including weapons, to Moscow.

S&P 500 futures eased 0.2%, while Nasdaq futures lost 0.3%. The S&P touched a two-week low on Friday as a run of strong U.S. economic news suggested the Fed might have more to do on interest rates even after hiking a huge 450 basis points in 11 months.

The latter means figures on U.S. personal consumption expenditures (PCE) due this Friday are expected to show a 1.3% jump in January, more than recovering from weakness in the prior two months.
The Fed's favoured inflation indicators, the core PCE index, is seen rising 0.4%, the biggest gain in five months, while the annual pace may have slowed just a fraction to 4.3%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815484,"North Korea fires ballistic missiles, warns of turning Pacific into 'firing range'","SEOUL, Feb 20 (Reuters) - North Korea fired two more ballistic missiles off its east coast on Monday, as the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un warned U.S. forces to halt military drills, saying the reclusive nuclear state could turn the Pacific into a ""firing range"".The launches come just two days after North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea off Japan's west coast, prompting the United States to hold joint air exercises with South Korea and separately with Japan on Sunday.North Korea's state media confirmed it fired two projectiles from a multiple rocket launcher, aiming at targets 395 km (245 miles) and 337 km (209 miles) away, respectively.""The 600mm multiple rocket launcher mobilised in the firing... is a means of tactical nuclear weapon,"" capable of ""paralysing"" an enemy airfield, state news agency KCNA said.Japan's Defense Ministry said the two ballistic missiles, fired around 2200 GMT, reached a maximum altitude of about 100 km and 50 km, travelling a distance of about 350-400 km before falling outside Japan's EEZ.There were no reports of damage to aircraft or vessels.In a statement, the ministry said it would continue to gather and analyse information in close cooperation with the United States.""North Korea's series of actions, including its repeated ballistic missile launches, threaten the peace and security of Japan, the region, and the international community,"" the ministry said. ""Japan lodged a strong protest and forcefully condemned North Korea.""TENSIONS RISINGNorth Korean leader Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned against increased presence of U.S. strategic assets on the Korean peninsula after the United States held the joint air drills with its Asian allies over the weekend.""We are carefully examining the influence it would exert on the security of our state,"" she said in a statement. ""The frequency of using the Pacific as our firing range depends upon the U.S. forces' action character.""Kim Yo Jong also challenged experts' assessment of its missile capabilities after some pointed out that it took over nine hours for the ""sudden"" missile launch to take place following an order from leader Kim, and said South Korea didn't even fly reconnaissance planes at the time of its launch.""We have possessed satisfactory technology and capability and, now will focus on increasing the quantity of their force,"" she said. ""We affirm once again that there is no change in our will to make the worst maniacs escalating the tensions pay the price for their action.""Analysts say tensions in the region are expected to further heighten as South Korea and the United States plan a range of expanded field exercises, including live fire drills, in the coming weeks and months.The two countries are also set to hold simulated nuclear drills, called the Deterence Strategy Committee Tabletop Exercise, at the Pentagon on Wednesday.Park Won-gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said Monday's missile launch and statement are in line with the North Korean foreign ministry's recent threat to take ""unprecedentedly persistent, strong"" responses to the allies' joint military drills.""North Korea seems to be trying to stoke tension in the region and reinforce its nuclear capability by raising issue over the drills, and the statement by Kim Yo Jong signals there would be additional provocations,"" Park said.Monday's missile launch is the North's third major weapons test this year after it fired an unprecedented number of missiles last year, including ICBMs capable of striking anywhere in the United States.",2023/02/20,275,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815490,Ricky Stenhouse Jr. wins longest Daytona 500 in history,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Ricky Stenhouse Jr. has had a roller coaster career in which he had to fight to keep a job, lost his seat at a NASCAR powerhouse team and opened his 14th season mired in a five-year losing streak.

            To say this Daytona 500 was a milestone race was an understatement — for Stenhouse and for NASCAR.

            Stenhouse won the Daytona 500 in double overtime and under caution Sunday night in the longest running of “The Great American Race.” The two overtimes pushed the 65th running of the race to a record 212 laps — a dozen laps beyond the scheduled distance and a whopping 530 miles (850 km).











            It provided anxious moments before a landmark celebration: the first Daytona 500-winning team co-owned by a Black man and a woman.

            Stenhouse’s win for JTG Daugherty Racing was the third of his career. JTG is the first single-car team to win the Daytona 500 since The Wood Brothers Racing did it with Trevor Bayne in 2011.

            The team is owned by Tad and Jodi Geschickter along with former NBA player Brad Daugherty.

            Daugherty, who left the track earlier Sunday with an eye irritation, is the first Black car owner to win the race, and Jodi Geschickter joined Teresa Earnhardt as female car owners to win the Daytona 500. Earnhardt ran Dale Earnhardt Inc. when Michael Waltrip and Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the Daytona 500 in 2003 and 2004.

            To get to victory lane Sunday, JTG stuck with Stenhouse and even reunited him this season with the crew chief who led him to a pair of Xfinity Series titles years ago.

            Mike Kelly's biggest task was convincing Stenhouse that he can indeed win races. So ahead of the Daytona 500, he taped a note inside the Chevrolet. The message? The team believes in the driver.

            “When I woke up today I told myself that I was going to do something that I used to do for Ricky when we had tough days,” Kelly said. “I just wrote him a note that only he would see. It was on top of the roll bar in front of him, and it just said, ‘We believe.’ That's been our motto the whole offseason — that we believe.

            “We're trying to get people to believe in Ricky Stenhouse Jr. again.”

            Stenhouse's only other victories came in 2017, at Talladega and the summer race at Daytona.

            Now, the 35-year-old from Olive Branch, Mississippi, has a repeat win at Daytona in NASCAR's biggest race of the season.

            “I think this whole offseason Mike just preached how much we all believed in each other. They left me a note in the car that said they believe in me and to go get the job done,” Stenhouse said. ""Man, this is unbelievable. This was the site of my last win back in 2017. We’ve worked really hard. We had a couple shots last year to get a win and fell short.

            “It was a tough season, but man, we got it done, Daytona 500.”

            Kyle Larson was collected in the race-ending crash after he jumped out of line too early in an attempt to win. His disappointment was alleviated by Stenhouse's victory.

            “Happy that Ricky won. I’m super happy. That’s all I could think about after I crashed, waiting to hear that he won,"" Larson said. ""He’s one of my best friends, so I was like yelling into my helmet when I helped push him to the lead there. I was hoping it was going to stay green so it would have been me or him win.

            ""I can’t wait to go get changed and go give him a big hug because he is one of my great buddies.”

            Reigning Cup champion Joey Logano finished second in a Ford for Team Penske, which won the race last year with Austin Cindric.

            “Second is the worst, man,” Logano said. “Congratulations to Ricky. There’s nothing like winning the Daytona 500. That’s why it stings so much finishing second.”

            Christopher Bell was third in a Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing and followed by Chris Buescher in a Ford for RFK Racing and pole sitter Alex Bowman of Hendrick Motorsports in a Chevrolet. It marked the first time the pole sitter has finished in the top five since Bill Elliott in 2001.

            AJ Allmendinger was sixth for Kaulig Racing, Daniel Suarez seventh for Trackhouse Racing and Ryan Blaney eighth for Team Penske. Ross Chastain of Trackhouse and Riley Herbst of Rick Ware Racing rounded out the top 10.

            Action sports star Travis Pastrana finished 11th in his Daytona 500 debut, and Kevin Harvick was 12th in his final Daytona 500. Harvick is retiring at the end of the year.

            
                Kyle Busch dropped to 0 for 18 in the Daytona 500 but contended for his new Richard Childress Racing team. He was the leader ahead of teammate Austin Dillon with three laps remaining in regulation when a spin by Daniel Suarez brought out the caution and sent the race to overtime.

            “Back in 1998, that would be the win, boys,” Busch radioed his team in a reference to how the late Dale Earnhardt won his only Daytona 500. There was no overtime then and Earnhardt won under caution.

            Busch wound up 19th after the race-ending crash in second overtime.

            “I think this is the first time I led lap 200, so I wish it was 1998 rules. But, no, it’s just par for the course, just used to it and come down here every year to just find out when and where I’m going to crash and what lap I come out of the care center,"" Busch said. ""Who won? I don’t even know who lucked into it.”

            Busch was told Stenhouse was the victor.

            “There you have it,"" he replied. 

            Seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson made his return to the series and ran inside the top 15 for most of the race. He was collected in one of the crashes in overtime and finished 31st. Johnson has returned from two years of racing in the IndyCar Series as part owner of Legacy Motor Club and he plans to enter a handful of races.

            
                Brad Keselowski led a race-high 42 laps but finished 22nd. He declined to speak to reporters after dropping to 0 for 14 in a race he desperately wants to win.

            The Cup Series races at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California, next Sunday in the final race of the track's current configuration. It will be renovated into a short track after the race — a project that will prevent the track from hosting any racing in 2024. Kyle Larson won last year's race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815492,Rahm wins at Riviera; Langer ties Irwin's victory record,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jon Rahm returned to No. 1 in the world Sunday by winning the Genesis Invitational with a performance that left no doubt who’s playing the best golf.

            Caught in a battle with hometown favorite Max Homa at Riviera, Rahm delivered two big moments with a 45-foot birdie putt from the fringe on the par-3 14th and then a tee shot to 2 feet for birdie on the par-3 16th.

            He closed with a 2-under 69 for a two-shot victory over Homa, finishing at 17-under 267.











            “Pretty incredible,” Rahm said. “(To win) at a golf course with this legacy, this history and hosted by Tiger Woods, is such an honor.”

            Patrick Cantlay got within one shot on the back nine until two bogeys. He had a 67 to finish alone in third, moving him to No. 4 in the world.

            Woods had four bogeys in an eight-hole stretch and shot 73 to tie for 45th.

            His success was measured in progress. It was his first time playing 72 holes since the Masters last April — Woods only played twice more since then as he tries to cope with leg and back injuries that will make PGA Tour appearances rare. He did not know if he would play again before the Masters.

            Woods still had the largest gallery all the way to the end, thousands of fans packed on the hill over the 18th green to watch him close out with a par in that familiar red shirt under a black vest.

            And then the spectators turned their attention to a terrific duel between Rahm and Homa, each with two victories on the PGA Tour this season.

            Rahm now has five wins in his last nine starts worldwide, dating to his win in the Spanish Open. He has not finished out of the top 10 in his last 10 tournaments. It was his third win in five starts on the PGA Tour this year, and he already has earned more than $9 million the last two months.

            PGA TOUR CHAMPIONS

            NAPLES, Fla. (AP) — Bernhard Langer matched Hale Irwin’s PGA Tour Champions victory record of 45, winning the Chubb Classic for the fifth time.

            The 65-year-old Langer matched his age with a closing 7-under 65 for a three-stroke victory over Steve Stricker and Padraig Harrington.

            Langer finished at 17-under 199 on Tiburon Golf Club’s Black Course. At 65 years, 5 months, 23 days, the German star extended his record as the oldest winner. He holds the top three spots on the list.

            Langer also won Chubb titles in 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2022.

            Stricker shot a 66, and Harrington closed with a 65.

            LADIES EUROPEAN TOUR

            KING ABDULLAH ECONOMIC CITY, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Lydia Ko, the No. 1 player in women’s golf, made her 2023 debut by closing with a 4-under 68 for a one-shot victory Aditi Ashok of India in the Aramco Saudi Ladies International.

            Ko finished last year by winning the $2 million prize at the LPGA Tour finale. She got married, skipped the LPGA Tour season opener in Florida and then showed at Royal Greens Golf & Country Club that she was still it form.

            Ko, who finished at 267, won $750,000 from the largest purse among regular Ladies European Tour events. It was her 26th victory worldwide.

            Lilia Vu, who had a one-shot lead going into the final round, slipped to a 71 and tied for third with Manon De Roey of Belgium (63) and Lexi Thompson (66).

            EUROPEAN TOUR

            CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark won his seventh European tour title by closing with a 6-under 66 for a four-shot victory in the Thailand Classic.

It was his first time playing 72 holes since the Masters last April — Woods only played twice more since then as he tries to cope with leg and back injuries that will make PGA Tour appearances rare. He did not know if he would play again before the Masters.Woods still had the largest gallery all the way to the end, thousands of fans packed on the hill over the 18th green to watch him close out with a par in that familiar red shirt under a black vest.And then the spectators turned their attention to a terrific duel between Rahm and Homa, each with two victories on the PGA Tour this season.Rahm now has five wins in his last nine starts worldwide, dating to his win in the Spanish Open. He has not finished out of the top 10 in his last 10 tournaments. It was his third win in five starts on the PGA Tour this year, and he already has earned more than $9 million the last two months.PGA TOUR CHAMPIONSNAPLES, Fla.

            The Trojans, back in the rankings for the first time since 2016, had their chances to win this one after falling to No. 3 Stanford 50-47 on Friday.

            From the final four minutes of regulation until Destiny Littleton hit a 3-pointer with 1:08 to go in overtime, USC missed eight straight shots. After Littleton tied the game at 78 and Leilani McIntosh put the Golden Bears on top with two free throws with 44 seconds to go, the Trojans came up empty on their next possession despite two offensive rebounds.











            Onyiah made 1 of 2 from the line with eight seconds to go and Littleton's late 3 was off the mark.

            Kemery Marson scored 15 points and Evelien Lutje Schipholt added 14 with eight rebounds for the Golden Bears (13-14, 4-12 Pac-12 Conference). Onyiah finished with nine, including the first basket in overtime and a three-point play that made it 78-75 with 1:37 to go.

            Kadi Sissoko, a graduate transfer, scored 30 points for the Trojans (19-8, 9-7), two shy of her career high from Minnesota. Rayah Marshall added 14 points, Littleton and Kayla Williams both had 13.

            Both team shots 60 percent in the first quarter, which ended tied at 24 but trailed off dramatically from there, with the Golden Bears taking a 45-42 lead at the half.

            Both teams scored 25 points in the third quarter before struggling again in the fourth.

            It appeared Curry would have a chance to win the game at the end of regulation when a foul was called on her desperation attempt from the top of the key, but after a long review the officials changed the call.

            The Golden Bears honored their 2012-13 Final Four team before the game. That team was coached by Lindsay Gottlieb, who is in her second season at USC after a stint as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA.

            USC closes the regular season next weekend against Washington on Thursday and Washington State on Saturday while Cal travels to No. 4 Utah and No. 21 Colorado.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815510,"All-Star top picks: Lillard (reserves), Embiid (starters)","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Damian Lillard was the first reserve taken by captain Giannis Antetokounmpo on Sunday in the All-Star Game draft, and Joel Embiid was the first starter taken by fellow captain LeBron James for the matchup.

            It was the sixth time captains chose their teams, but the first time that it was done just minutes before the All-Star Game.

            The draft took place just off the back of the court, with James and Antetokounmpo on one level of a stage and the other All-Stars who will be in the game seated behind them, waiting to hear when they'd be picked.











            Once they heard their names, they descended down five stairs and were handed their Team LeBron or Team Giannis jersey. The reserves were chosen first, followed by the starters.

            “It’s taken me back to grade school, when you lined everybody up across the free throw line and you had two captains and you picked,"" James said.

            He took a 5-0 record as a captain into the game. Two of those five wins entering Sunday were against teams captained by Antetokounmpo.

            “We’re going to play hard, and hopefully we can enjoy the game and try to take them down this time,"" Antetokounmpo said.

            Antetokounmpo had a small notebook with him for the draft, suggesting he'd done a more than little bit of homework and strategizing coming into the night. James had his notes on a sheet of paper.

            “It's tissue,"" James said, as Antetokounmpo suggested he'd like a look at those notes.

            Antetokounmpo tried to take Memphis' Ja Morant with the No. 5 pick in the reserve round, evidently forgetting that Morant was a starter and would be drafted later.

            He wound up getting Morant anyway, with the No. 4 pick in the starters' round. Morant went one pick before Luka Doncic, the NBA's leading scorer this season taken by Team LeBron.

            With Nikola Jokic — playing on his 28th birthday — and Lauri Markkanen left on the stage as the last two picks, Jokic didn't even wait for James to make his choice. He simply walked toward James, who took the hint and selected the two-time reigning MVP.

            And that left Markkanen as the last pick, for Team Giannis.

            RESERVE ROUND

            Team Giannis: Damian Lillard (1), Jrue Holiday (3), Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (5), DeMar DeRozan (7), Pascal Siakam (9), Bam Adebayo (11), Domantas Sabonis (13).

            Team LeBron: Anthony Edwards (2), Jaylen Brown (4), Paul George (6), Tyrese Haliburton (8), Julius Randle (10), De'Aaron Fox (12), Jaren Jackson Jr. (14).

            STARTERS ROUND

            Team LeBron: Joel Embiid (1), Kyrie Irving (3), Luka Doncic (5), Nikola Jokic (7).

            Team Giannis: Jayson Tatum (2), Ja Morant (4), Donovan Mitchell (6), Lauri Markkanen (8).

(AP) — Derrick Walker had 23 points, seven rebounds and six assists, Keisei Tominaga scored 20 and Nebraska beat Maryland 70-66 in overtime Sunday for the Cornhuskers' third consecutive win. 

            Sam Griesel made a driving layup, but missed the and-1 free throw, to give Nebraska (14-14, 7-10) the lead for good with 1:23 left in overtime. Sam Hoiberg stole the ball from Jahmir Young but Walker missed a shot at the rim. Hoiberg then picked off a pass from Hakim Hart for a coast-to-coast layup to make it 67-64 with 31 seconds to go. Walker blocked Hart's shot and Hoiberg made two free throws with 14 seconds left to make it a two-possession game. 

            Walker, who made 7 of 12 from the field and 9 of 11 from the free-throw line, finished with three blocks. Griesel scored 12 points for the Cornhuskers, who have won four of their last five following a four-game skid. Hoiberg finished with nine points and six rebounds. 











            Julian Reese had 16 points, 16 rebounds and three blocks for Maryland (18-10, 9-7 Big Ten), which lost for just the second time since a 58-55 defeat at No. 3 Purdue on Jan. 22. Young also scored 16 and Hart hit four 3-pointers and added 14.

            Griesel picked up his fourth personal when he fouled Jahari Long on a 3-point shot with about 13 minutes left in regulation. Long hit all three free throws to cap an 11-0 run and give Maryland its first lead since 16-15. After Walker made two free throws for the Huskers to make it 38-all, Ian Martinez missed a 3-point shot but Patrick Emilien tracked down the offensive rebound and, as he fell out of bounds, found Hart for a wide-open 3 from the left wing. Hart added another from behind the arc and Young hit one before Reese made a layup to give Maryland its biggest lead at 50-42 with seven minutes remaining in regulation. 

            Tominaga hit two free throws and then, as he was boxing out on a shot at the other end, drew a foul and made two more foul shots to make it 56-all with a minute left in the second half. Young made a pull-up jumper on the baseline for the Terrapins with 43 seconds left but Walker scored inside 14 seconds later. 

            Young missed a potential winning step-back jumper from the free-throw line as time expired in regulation. 

            Walker scored the final six points in a 15-3 run that gave Nebraska a nine-point lead midway through the first half, Hart sandwiched a pair of 3-pointers around two layup by Emilien as the Terrapins scored 10 consecutive points to take a 16-15 lead less than three minutes later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815517,'No credible chance' US wins war with China over Taiwan: Strategists,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Four of Australia’s most experienced military strategists have all said they do not believe the U.S. can win a war against China, with or without Australian assistance.As U.S.-China tensions rise, ABC Australia interviewed four military strategists that have all previously worked for the Australian Department of Defence, including the former head of its international policy and strategy divisions and Australia’s former most senior military figure. Professor Hugh White was formerly a senior strategy and intelligence official in the Australian defense department, and said a U.S. war with China over Taiwan would result in a Chinese victory, regardless of U.S. expectations of air and naval support from Australia.“I do not think there is any credible chance that America, with or without Australia’s support, could win a war with China over Taiwan,” White said. ""Ultimately, I do not see how America could inflict enough damage on China to force Beijing to concede over Taiwan, without using nuclear weapons,” he said.White said he does not believe the U.S. would be willing to risk Chinese nuclear retaliation for the sake of protecting Taiwan. ""That is why I think it would be a mistake for America, or Australia, to go to war with China over Taiwan,"" he said.However, White said he does not believe that a U.S.-China war over Taiwan is the most likely option, saying that an air and naval blockade would be China’s first choice for gaining control over the country.""(A blockade) would be a far cheaper and less risky way to achieve its objectives. It would be relatively easy for China to establish a credible air and sea exclusion zone around Taiwan, and thereby put immense pressure on the Taiwanese to accept Beijing’s terms,” White said. ""America would then have to decide whether to go to war to break the blockade.""Ships from Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Indian Navy sail in formation with Royal Australian Navy HMAS Warramunga and USS Barry in 2021. (AP photo)Former intelligence officer in the Australian military and current professor of International and Political studies Clinton Fernandes agreed with White’s analysis. “China’s leaders could discreetly offer negotiations to Taiwan’s leaders during a blockade before the risky step of ordering an amphibious invasion,” Professor Fernandes said.He said that if China thought the blockade was failing, they may then choose to attack U.S. forces protecting Taiwan, or simply withdraw the blockade and claim that the damage inflicted constituted a victory. ""For China, the worst-case scenario is to have to conduct high-intensity operations against Taiwan, the United States, Japan and other U.S. allies and partners simultaneously,” Fernandes said.Former head of the International Policy and Strategy Divisions of the Department of Defence Allan Behm is now the head of the international and security program at the Australia Institute, and was similarly skeptical of a positive outcome. ""(Australia has a) fundamental strategic pathology: to support the interests of the U.S. at the expense of our own,"" Behm said.A worker puts up the words ""For Peace"" for an exhibition on International Military Cooperation by the Chinese military in 2019. Beijing's rapidly modernizing military is getting closer to matching Washington and other powers in weapons technology. (AP photo)Admiral Chris Barrie, formerly Australia’s most senior military leader, agreed. Speaking about the possibility of war, he said “economically, financially and personally it is likely to impoverish us all; it may even kill most of us if it goes nuclear.” He pointed out the danger of increasing rhetoric about war, and said politicians should not forget that war is a last resort option.“The contemplation of war can only be justified after all other means of settling differences have failed, and we are a long way from reaching this position (over Taiwan),"" he says. ""I worry when politicians start to think it is acceptable to use the media to make threats about war.”The opinions come as Australia conducts a conducts a parliamentary enquiry into its executive’s powers to unilaterally declare war. Currently, sole powers to declare war rest with Australia’s cabinet, the government’s executive branch, made up of the prime minister and about 19 ministers who have the power to make decisions behind closed doors.",2023/02/20,7645,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815532,"Champs Keselowski, Busch, Truex miss again in Daytona 500","DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Brad Keselowski trudged out of the infield care center, climbed into a waiting golf cart and sped toward his motorhome.

            No interviews. No autographs. Just another Daytona 500 disappointment.

            Keselowski was one of three former NASCAR champions — along with Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr. — who failed to end lifetime droughts in “The Great American Race” on Sunday. The most frustrating part? All of them had cars good enough to end double-digit skids in NASCAR’s signature event.











            “It’s just par for the course, just used to it,” Busch bemoaned. “Come down here every year to just find out when and where I’m going to crash and what lap I come out of the care center.”

            Busch is now winless in 18 starts in the Daytona 500, a baffling losing streak for a guy who has won 224 times across NASCAR’s top three series. The two-time series champ (2015, ’19) was caught in a late crash and finished 19th. 

            But he took solace in leading Lap 200 — the scheduled last lap before several crashes forced two overtimes — for the first time. 

            “I wish it was 1998 rules,” he said, referring to seven-time NASCAR champion Dale Earnhardt’s Daytona 500 win in his 20th try under caution 25 years ago. “I don’t think you’re ever confident. Who won? I don’t even know who lucked into it.”

            Ricky Stenhouse Jr. won the race for the first time in 12 tries, one of five drivers in the 40-car field with double-digit skids heading into the opener.

            “There you have it,” Busch quipped.

            Truex was evaluating the numbers and thought this was his day. He was driving the No. 19 Toyota in his 19th Daytona 500 and on February 19th. Maybe he was onto something because he crashed with 19 laps to go and ended up 16th.

            Truex, the 2017 champ, also left Daytona International Speedway without stopping to talk about his night.

            Keselowski, the 2012 champ, finished 22nd and fell to 0 for 14 in the 500, despite leading a race-high 42 laps. He was out front on a restart with 13 laps to go in regulation before fading along with several other Fords.

            It was Keselowski’s third consecutive gut-wrenching finish in the 500. 

            Last year, Keselowski led a race-high 67 laps before getting shuffled back late. In 2021, he was running second and had a huge run down the backstretch before teammate Joey Logano blocked him and crashed both of them.

            “You just feel like you’re in position and it doesn’t happen and, yeah, it’s super painful,” Keselowski said Saturday after posting the fastest lap in final practice. “The closer you are to winning the race, the more painful it is.”

            Hall of Famers Tony Stewart, Rusty Wallace and Mark Martin are the most notable drivers who never won the Daytona 500.

            Truex, Busch and Keselowski were looking for a breakthrough Sunday, and each of them led laps. Truex was out front for 13 trips around the 2 1/2-mile superspeedway; Busch led six laps.

            The trio still should be hopeful coming back in 2024. After all, Hall of Famer David Pearson needed 15 tries to win the Daytona 500. Busch’s older brother, Kurt, needed 16. And Earnhardt’s long-awaiting breakthrough is revered as an iconic moment in racing history.

            “You know that it’s just barely out of reach and so that certainly builds a frustration,"" Keselowski said. ""We came down here a couple of years where we weren’t even close, and you left here going, ‘Well, that sucked,’ and it didn’t hurt as bad. It hurts a lot worse to be close.

            “The Olympic saying is the worst thing you can do is get a silver. Bronze, you’re happy you get a medal and gold, of course, you’re happy to leave. But silver, you know you’re that close and it just didn’t happen, and I feel like I have a lot of Daytona 500 silvers.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815533,Buie leads Northwestern over Iowa 80-60 for 5th straight win,"EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Boo Buie finished with 23 points and eight assists and Northwestern cruised to a wire-to-wire 80-60 victory over Iowa on Sunday to up its win streak to five.

            Buie made 6 of 11 shots from the floor with three 3-pointers and all eight of his free throws for the Wildcats (20-7, 11-5 Big Ten Conference). Ty Berry hit three 3-pointers and scored 16. Brooks Barnhizer came off the bench to score 12 and grab a team-high seven rebounds.

            Kris Murray finished with 14 points and five rebounds to pace the Hawkeyes (17-10, 9-7). Tony Perkins scored 11 and Filip Rebraca pitched in with 10 points and seven boards.











            Buie sank 4 of 6 shots with two 3-pointers, scoring 14 to guide Northwestern to a 37-26 lead at halftime. Murray had nine points at intermission for Iowa, but he missed all four of his 3-pointers as the Hawkeyes made just 2 of 17 from beyond the arc. Robbie Beran had a layup 13 seconds into the game and the Wildcats never trailed.

            Murray had a three-point play to pull the Hawkeyes within 47-40 with 13:47 remaining, but they would get no closer. Brooks Barnhizer answered with a 3-pointer and two free throws to spark a 10-2 run and Northwestern cruised from there. Berry scored six straight on a four-point play and two free throws to give the Wildcats their biggest lead 71-47 with 4:52 to go.

            Northwestern, which has won eight of its last 10 to move into second place in the Big Ten behind Purdue, entered play with back-to-back wins over the then-No. 1 Boilermakers and No. 14 Indiana. 

            The Wildcats have five wins over ranked teams this season. Their 20 wins are the most since the 2016-17 season when they won a program-record 24. The Wildcats have won 10 or more Big Ten games for only the fourth time in program history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815535,"Kane has hat trick, Blackhawks beat Maple Leafs 5-3","CHICAGO (AP) — Patrick Kane had his ninth career regular-season hat trick, rookie Cole Guttman scored the game-winner and the Chicago Blackhawks beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 Sunday night.

            Max Domi had a goal and three assists for the Blackhawks, who won their second straight following a three-game losing streak and climbed out of last place in the NHL. The Maple Leafs had won two straight, including a 5-2 romp over the Blackhawks on Wednesday in Toronto.

            Guttman scored his first NHL goal by beating Ilya Samsonov over the blocker with a hard wrist shot from right wing with 8:18 remaining to break a 3-all tie.











            “A dream come true,” said Guttman, who was playing for Denver University this time last year. “My initial thought was pass, but I think the D took it away.”

            Mitch Marner had tied it at 3 on a set play 7:38 into the third period. He raced into the Chicago zone when Morgan Rielly sent a hard dump-in off the boards. Marner picked it up, cut hard to the net, and swung a backhand past Jaxson Stauber before he could react.

            Kane has been the subject of trade rumors all season as the Blackhawks try to position themselves to win the draft lottery. He had been goalless in seven games before scoring twice at Ottawa on Friday, and followed that up with his ninth three-goal game in regular-season play. He has 14 goals in 52 games.

            “I’ve only seen vintage Patrick Kane on TV,” Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said. “Good to see it live. He’s definitely been playing with confidence and swagger.”

            Kane opened the scoring with a 70 mph wrist shot 10:44 into the first period beating Samsonov from the left-wing circle.

            It was the Blackhawks’ eighth shot on goal, and they didn’t get another until 7:57 of the second period, when Kane took a pass from Domi and beat a screened Samsonov from 20 feet.

            Kane completed the hat trick 12:49 into the second, corralling a puck behind the Toronto net and caroming it off Samsonov’s backside. A replay review proved the puck crossed the goal-line completely, which set off a cascade of hats from the standing-room crowd of 20,979 at United Center.

            “The last couple of games I’ve been getting some looks, and it’s nice to capitalize on them,” Kane said. “A couple times out there, you just get chills with the way the crowd’s into it with the position we’re in. They want us to win.”

            Of his gut feeling on a possible trade, Kane said, “I don’t know. If I knew that, I think I’d make a decision already.”

            Domi, who scored an empty net goal with 1:16 to play, matched a career high with his assists on Kane’s three goals. Kane set up the empty-netter.

            “Obviously the key component to that game was giving up way too many odd-man rushes, giving them too many clean looks to our net,” Marner said.

            Toronto’s John Tavares tied the game at 1 on a power play 2:08 after Kane’s first goal, tipping in Rielly’s shot from the left point past Stauber.

            “I just thought we were clearly a very tired group right from the start and made tired mistakes,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said, noting the Leafs played Saturday night. “When you’re tired, you’ve got to be really smart and structured and all of that. Some of the clean looks we gave up tonight are the result of not being smart.”

            Stauber made 31 saves, Samsonov 23.

            Noel Acciari, picked up by Toronto on Friday in a three-way trade with Minnesota and St. Louis, scored from the left slot to pull the Leafs within 3-2 with 2:14 left in the period. Former Blackhawk David Kampf grabbed a high pass from Alexander Kerfoot, threw it to the ice and fed Acciari.

            TOEWS OUT INDEFINITELY

            Chicago captain Jonathan Toews, who missed his seventh straight game Sunday, said he was suffering from both long COVID-19 and chronic immune response syndrome, the latter having sidelined him for the shortened 2020-21 season.

            “In the last few weeks, it has reached the point where I had no choice but to step back and concentrate on getting healthy,” Toews said. He had skated on his own earlier in the week but had to stop.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815536,Pastrana adds one more motorsports thrill in Daytona 500,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Travis Pastrana needed to stick his Toyota with all four wheels on the track -- not hurled through the air in a death-defying stunt in much the same way he made his name — to pull off one more thrill in his motorsports career.

            For a moment, Pastrana had a run at a Daytona 500 victory in his grasp.

            But for all his X Games gold and motocross triumphs, it’s Pastrana’s highlight-worthy crashes, laundry list of broken bones and frightening falls that stamped him as a no-limits action star favorite.











            So, it seemed fitting Pastrana’s Daytona 500 ended Sunday night in a wreck.

            “Did someone get into me or did I spin on my own,” Pastrana asked nearby fans from a golf cart.

            The fans who waited for Pastrana in the garage let him know, another driver smacked into his Toyota.

            Good to know, Pastrana assured them. Then he pondered his circumstances from this week -- ones that took Pastrana from having to qualify just to make the Daytona 500, to a shot at the checkered flag, to a solid 11th in a one-off race -- and it felt almost as good as gold.

            “Dude, how cool was that? Coming to the line with one lap to go and in the hunt,” Pastrana said.

            Pretty cool, indeed. The 39-year-old Pastrana made the hard-charge after he started last in his first NASCAR start in a decade. Pastrana deftly avoided trouble in his No. 67 Toyota and even led a couple of laps.

            “Yeah! I led a lap at the Daytona 500,” Pastrana gushed.

            Pastrana make his long-coveted attempt to race the Daytona 500 this year in an entry fielded by 23XI Racing and sponsored by Black Rifle Coffee. The Toyota was a third entry for the NASCAR team owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin, and gave the decorated driver the chance to fulfill his career dream.

            “He survived, I guess,” Hamlin said. “But I think I saw some sparks there at the end. But, yeah, it was what we wanted him to do: Get a bunch of laps and enjoy the day, and I think he ran all of them.” 

            With massive fan appeal that stretches back to his X Games glory, Pastrana was a rock star around the track this week. Sure enough, bros flocked to greet him in the garage and mingled around a Toyota about as mangled as some of his body parts after a stunt gone awry.

            Pastrana couldn’t stay for long. He had a mandatory trip to the medical center.

            “Can I have your hat now?” one fan asked

            “How about your water bottle?” another wanted.

            How about a sigh of relief Pastrana finished in one piece. His wife, Lyn-Z, a skateboarder, snowboarder and also an X Games medalist, said the entire Daytona experience was “an unknown” for the family.

            “Exciting but very nerve-wracking,” she said. “I was all about it. It’s always been on his bucket list, so I was like, ‘OK, here we go.’ I was surprised that he could make it happen this year, so it was fun.”

            Pastrana had won all there was to win in supercross, motocross, freestyle motocross, rally racing and, most recently, offshore powerboat racing. But as his groundbreaking career started to creep toward the finish — the father of two turns 40 this year — Pastrana couldn’t let go of his desire to race the Daytona 500.

            Pastrana attempted a NASCAR career a decade ago and raced the full Xfinity Series schedule in 2013 for Roush Fenway Racing. But he struggled far more than he expected and sponsorship dried up.

            So, he put the Daytona 500 on the backburner.

            Craving one more run at NASCAR glory, Pastrana landed sponsorship and took a deal to 23XI because of an existing friendship with Kurt Busch and others inside the organization.

            He even joked he had to spend his kids’ college fund to cover some of the expense.

            “The car’s not a complete write-off, so the kids’ college fund should be intact,” he said, laughing. “This exceeded all my expectations as far as result.”

            Saying he was “not good enough to be the best at this sport,” Pastrana insisted his Cup career was a one-and-done venture.

            “The amount of time it would take right now, I’m trying to slow down,” Pastrana said. “The reason I’m here is because I felt like this was the best I’ve ever been as a driver. We’ve been winning championships in the dirt. I just wanted to experience the whole Daytona speedweeks.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815537,Canada downs Brazil 2-0 in SheBelieves Cup,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Vanessa Gilles and Evelyne Viens each scored for Canada in a 2-0 victory over Brazil in the SheBelieves Cup on Sunday. 

            
                The United States won the earlier match 1-0 against Japan to take the lead in the SheBelieves standings heading into the final games in Frisco, Texas, on Wednesday. 

            Gilles scored on a header in the 31st minute to give Canada the lead. It was her third international goal. Viens added Canada's second goal in the 71st. 











            Canada, which fell 2-0 to the United States in its tournament opener on Thursday, was second in the standings with the win over Brazil. 

            All four teams are using the SheBelieves tournament as preparation for the Women's World Cup this summer in Australia and New Zealand. 

            
                Canada is in the midst of a labor dispute with its federation. The team initially planned to boycott team activities during the SheBelieves Cup and sat out of a practice before the start of the tournament. Canada Soccer said the action amounted to an illegal strike and the players acquiesced, but said they would play in protest. 

            The Canadian men's and women's teams have been in negotiations since last year for a new contract. The Canadian women are seeking equal pay to their male counterparts. 

            Players on the Canadian squad wore purple T-shirts during the anthem that read “Enough is Enough"" and purple armbands during the game. 

            Players on Japan's national team wore purple armbands in solidarity during their match against the United States earlier in the day, and England's national team wore them in a Sunday match against Italy. 

            “I think it’s such an important time to be a part of this fight and an important time to be a part of women’s sport. You always say sport is an avenue for change. And I think to be able to continue to use our voices and try and ignore the trolls as much as possible and kind of push forward in this fight is really important,” said Janine Beckie, who made her 100th career appearance for Canada.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815546,Air pollution from China triggers 50 orange alerts in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Over 50 weather stations in Taiwan on Monday (Feb. 20) flashed an orange alert signaling unhealthy air quality for sensitive groups as northeasterly winds blow in high concentrations of air pollutants from China.On Sunday evening (Feb. 19), Central Weather Bureau (CWB) Director-General Cheng Ming-dean (鄭明典) warned on Facebook that there was a serious incident of air pollution entering Taiwan from China. Cheng posted an image from the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) air monitoring website showing the air quality at nine stations flashing a red alert, representing air that is unhealthy for the general public, with six in Greater Taipei, two in Taoyuan City, and one in Kinmen County.Cheng, at 9:45 p.m. on Sunday, said the rains had not been enough to disperse pollutants arriving from China and that ""dirty air has arrived."" He urged the public to close their windows and not to venture out and be exposed as he described the situation as a ""serious air pollution incident arriving from overseas.""At 7:39 a.m. on Monday, Cheng posted an update on his Facebook page in which he warned all members of the public in Kaohsiung's Daliao, Qianjin, and Fengshan districts, Pingtung County, and Kinmen County to reduce outdoor activities due to red alerts in those areas. In addition, he called on residents in western Taiwan, Yilan County, and Penghu County to reduce strenuous outdoor activities due to orange alerts in those areas.As of 8 a.m. on Monday, 50 weather stations in Taiwan flashed an orange alert, including in New Taipei City, Changhua County, Yunlin County, Chaiyi County, Tainan City, and Kaohsiung City. Six weather stations in Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, and Kinmen County also flashed a red alert.The EPA said on Monday the northeasterly winds and continental cold air mass will continue to affect the environment. The northeasterly winds are expected to continue to bring in air pollution from China.During the day, diffusion conditions in central Taiwan and areas north are considered adequate to gradually disperse the pollutants. However, from Yunlin County and Chiayi County and areas south, diffusion conditions will be poor and pollutants are likely to accumulate.Coastal areas from Changhua County to Yunlin and Chiayi will see strong winds which cause dust from the ground to mix with the pollution, affecting both air quality and visibility. The EPA forecasts that the air quality in eastern Taiwan will be ""good,"" while the air quality in northern Taiwan, Yilan County, Lienchiang County, and Penghu will be ""moderate,"" although parts of Hsinchu County, Miaoli County could see orange alerts.Central Taiwan, Yunliin, Chiay, and Kinmen are likely to see orange and even red alerts during the day, while Kaohsiung and Pingtung will be prone to red alerts.As for Tuesday (Feb. 21), the EPA predicts that the northeast monsoon and continental cold air mass will continue to bring polluted air. Central and southern parts of the country are likely to continue to see accumulations of pollutants, with visibility still hampered from Changhua to Chiayi.From Feb. 22-25, the winds are expected to shift from northeast to east-northeast, improving pollution diffusion conditions across the country and improving air quality.",2023/02/20,2803,Environment

(Taiwan News, Lyla Liu photo)“Artificial intelligence has an impact on the world, but the show aims at addressing elements to interact with our daily life and providing scenarios for the audience to think,” Letze said on Friday at the opening press event.Some of the exhibition pieces view technological progress positively, while others are more critical. Letze said that he does not have a particular view about technology. “Our body is an interface for how we interact with the world and that also means our mind and soul.”The exhibition covers a range of diverse issues and turns heads with its aesthetic centerpieces, which also challenge people’s ideas of modern-day beauty. From deserted lands, cyberpunk societies, to monstrous plants, the works of art represent artists' imagination in a post-human world.Sam Jinks’""Doghead."" (Taiwan News, Lyla Liu photo)Australian sculptor Sam Jinks’ demi-human work “Doghead” pays tribute to Greek mythology. “The sculpture lies there in a rather vulnerable position. It shows that there is a part of an animal inside us and we are vulnerable as humans at the same time,” Letze explained.In order to create a vivid human-shaped sculpture, Jinks created it layer by layer using silicone and stuck hair to the skin.Australian artist Patricia Piccinini worked with The Royal Melbourne Hospital to bring “Graham” to life. “Graham” is a version of a human body made to prevent car accident injury. It was made with more giant bone structures, more ribs, and thicker skin.Patricia Piccinini's ""Graham.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815585,"Zetterlund, Wood score in 3rd, Devils rally past Jets 4-2","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Fabian Zetterlund and Miles Wood scored in a two-minute span of the third period and Mackenzie Blackwood made 23 saves as the New Jersey Devils rallied to beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 on Sunday night.

            The Jets led 2-1 heading into the third period on the strength of first-period goals by Cole Perfetti and Neal Pionk. The Devils rallied with three goals in the third and extended their home winning streak to six games.

            Zetterlund scored his sixth at 5:02 to tie the game, before Wood beat Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck for his ninth at 6:53 to give New Jersey the lead. 











            “We know that we’re a good team and we play the right way,'' said Blackwood, who improved to 8-5-2 this season. ”If we get down a goal or two or whatever it is, there’s a lot of confidence in here that we’re going to be able to get that goal back.""

            Dawson Mercer scored twice for the Devils, including an empty-netter. Erik Haula added two assists for the Devils, who were coming off a 5-2 road win over Pittsburgh on Saturday. New Jersey is 21-4-3 on the road and 16-10-2 at home. 

            “We’re never out of a game and we’re responsible as a team,'' Mercer said. ”We play right until the end.""

            Mark Scheifele had two assists for the Jets, who had won six straight games at Prudential Center and hadn’t lost in regulation in Newark since January 2012 — with an 8-0-2 record over that span entering Sunday’s game. 

            “It just got away from us,"" Scheifele said. ""You play a skilled team like that and they make you pay.” 

            Perfetti opened the scoring at 14:57 of the first, picking up a rebound and scoring past Blackwood for his eighth goal. The 21-year-old forward has 30 points overall in his second NHL season.

            The Devils answered quickly at 15:16 when Mercer scored off assists from Nico Hischier and Dougie Hamilton.

            Pionk put Winnipeg ahead 2-1 at 17:09, blasting the puck from the point past Blackwood for his eighth. 

            The Devils dominated the second and had their best chance to tie with just over five minutes left when Jesper Bratt broke in alone on Hellebuyck, but hit the post. New Jersey had another chance in the waning seconds of the middle period, but Hellebuyck poked the puck off the stick of a charging Zetterlund.

            Mercer added his 15th goal into a empty net at 19:04 of the third. 

            Devils coach Lindy Ruff praised his team's resolve in forging another comeback win at home.

             “We have individuals who have had great years but if you’re going to be a good team, we’re going to need everybody,'' Ruff said. ”Scoring needs to come from a lot of places. You need secondary scoring and you need other guys to get on the board.""

            Hellebuyck, who made 25 saves, fell to 6-2-1 in his career against the Devils.

            “Tonight was a couple of turnovers and they capitalized,'' Hellebuyck said. ”We were in control most of the game and we let it slip away.""

            The Jets, who were coming off 3-1 loss at Columbus on Thursday that ended a three-game winning streak, remained three points behind first-place Dallas in the Central Division.

            ""You can’t turn pucks over. We gave them those two goals,'' Jets coach Rick Bowness said. ”You have to play a full 60 minutes. Our puck management has to be better.”

            NOTES: Winnipeg hasn’t won a division title since moving from Atlanta for the 2011-12 season. They have finished second three times, 2012-13, 2017-18 and 2018-19. … The Devils scratched defenseman Kevin Bahl and forward Nathan Bastian. ... The Jets scratched forward Sam Gagner plus defensemen Logan Stanley and Kyle Capobianco. … The teams meet again Apr. 2 in Winnipeg.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815586,Gueye's double-double helps Washington St. beat Oregon 68-65,"PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) — Mouhamed Gueye had 18 points and 12 rebounds, Justin Powell scored 11 points, including a layup that capped the scoring, and Washington State beat Oregon 68-65 Sunday for the Cougars' third win in a row. 

            TJ Bamba also scored 11 points for Washington State (13-15, 8-9 Pac-12) but made just 5 of 17 from the field and Andrej Jakimovski added 10 points. 

            Justin Powell hit a 3-pointer before Gueye and Bamba each made a layup in a 7-2 run but Keeshawn Barthelemy hit a pull-up 3 to cut Oregon’s deficit to 66-65 with 1:20 left. Bamba missed a fade-away jumper in the lane, DJ Rodman grabbed the offensive rebound and was fouled before Powell missed a jumper and Jakimovski grabbed another offensive rebound. Following a WSU timeout, Powell went around a screen by Gueye on the left wing, patiently worked his way through the lane and finished high off the backboard on the other side of the rim to make it 68-65 with 23 seconds to go.











            Jermaine Couisnard missed a open look at a potential tying 3-pointer in the closing seconds. 

            Barthelemy scored 15 of his 17 in the final nine minutes for Oregon (15-13, 9-8) and Couisnard added 12 points. N'Faly Dante had 10 points and 11 rebounds — his seventh double-double of the season.

            Gueye has five double-double in the last seven games and his 12 this season. 

            Barthelemy made a jumper with 8:52 left and scored 12 points in 17-6 run that culminated when he made 1-of-2 free throws that gave Oregon a 60-59 lead with four minutes to play. 

            Oregon's Brennan Rigsby had two points, two rebounds and a steal in nine minutes before he left the game and did not return due to an apparent injury to his left ankle with about six minutes to play. 

            The Cougars tied their season low with six turnovers but committed four in the final 10-plus minutes. 

            Rodman announced in a Senior Night celebration prior to tipoff that he would return to Washington State for a fifth and final season with the Cougars. He finished with nine points and hit 3 of 5 from 3-point range.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815588,Taiwan set to roll out monthly passes for three regions,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Cabinet is expected to approve a proposal on Thursday (Feb. 23) that caps the cost of monthly travel passes at NT$1,200 (US$39) for residents in the northern, central, and southern parts of the country.A budget of NT$28.5 billion has been earmarked for transportation fee subsidies and incentives to woo international visitors post-COVID, said Minister of Transportation and Communications Wang Kwo-tsai (王國材). If passed by the legislature on Tuesday (Feb. 21), the fund will be partly used for the new monthly pass policy.According to the plan, those living in Taipei, New Taipei, Keelung, and Taoyuan will be able to enjoy a NT$1,200 monthly pass. They can take unlimited rides across the region’s public transportation networks, including buses, intercity buses, metro systems, Taiwan Railway, and public bicycles, per Liberty Times.For the central and southern parts of the country, the monthly pass is likely to be priced at no more than NT$1,000 as there are relatively fewer public transportation choices. The central region will comprise Taichung, Changhua, and Nantou, while the south involves Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung.The measure will be implemented for three years before new arrangements are made depending on future planning, the report quoted officials as saying. A similar program has been put in place jointly by Taipei and New Taipei since 2018, which allows EasyCard holders to take advantage of a monthly pass at NT$1,280 for access to Metro Taipei, YouBike, and other public transport.",2023/02/20,3074,Society

The two then started punching each other.Chiang (left) and Chen trade blows. (YouTube, T1 League screenshot)Players from both teams and referees managed to briefly separate the two. However, HeroBears assistant coach Lin Chieh-ho (林玠禾) ran onto the court, chased down Chen, and took a swing at his head, while Chen retaliated with a right cross that missed the mark.Players, coaches, and assistants cleared the benches. A scrum soon formed around Lin and Chen as multiple players and team staff tussled back and forth.Howard entered the fray but appeared to be attempting to break up the fight by pulling one of his teammates back. Cooler heads prevailed, and the players went to their respective benches.Players from both sides swarm around Lin and Chen. (YouTube, T1 League screenshot)The game was delayed for over 20 minutes as referees reviewed instant replay and assessed penalties. In the end, 12 individuals were ejected from the game, including five HeroBears and seven Leopards.The five members of the HeroBears team ejected included Chiang, Lin, Huang Chen (黃鎮), Liang Hao-zhen (梁浩真), and Tsao Xun-xiang (曹薰襄).

In the end, his Leopards emerged victorious with a score of 120-108.After the game, Howard complained that he was unfairly ejected because he said he was just trying to stop the fight. He also felt that he was wrongly singled out and that his ejection was unwarranted, reported Mirror Media.Mandarin version:English version:",2023/02/20,13059,Sports & Entertainment

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 20 February 2023 - Diversified industrial group Jebsen & Jessen today announces the acquisition of MHE-Demag's Industrial Products (IPD) Business, a member of Konecranes Group – a move which will expand the family enterprise's portfolio and position it to meet the need for engineered mechanical solutions in the rapidly urbanising South East Asia region. The deal is expected to close in April 2023.       Signing of the acquisition agreement between Jebsen & Jessen Pte. Ltd. and Konecranes                  at Jebsen & Jessen Group headquarters in Singapore.From bottom left: Per Magnusson (Group CEO, Jebsen & Jessen Group), Marko Tulokas (Senior Vice President, Region Asia-Pacific, Konecranes) Top: Fabio Fiorino (Executive Vice President, Industrial Service and Equipment, Konecranes).     The newly acquired IPD business will be known as ""MHE"", retaining the existing MHE branding, and form the material handling equipment division of Jebsen & Jessen Technology. It will cover manufacturing, engineering, renting, trading, supplying and servicing of MHE's complete range of industrial and material handling products, such as dock levellers and door systems; mechanical car park systems; building maintenance units; boom lifts and Aerial Work Platforms; warehouse trucks and lift systems, among others. The business spans Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.   ""We are excited to welcome the 300-people-strong MHE-Demag Industrial Products (IPD) team to the Jebsen & Jessen Group. The business is already the clear market leader in some segments, and our ambition is to attain market leadership across the portfolio. We are committed to investing in people and the business to achieve our growth ambitions,"" said Per Magnusson, Group CEO, Jebsen & Jessen Group. ""The acquisition aligns well with our Advance & Build strategy and builds upon our distinctive heritage as a trusted provider of quality industrial products and value-added solutions,"" Per Magnusson continues.   The IPD business to be acquired by Jebsen & Jessen Group is part of MHE-Demag, a member of the Konecranes Group, which was previously a joint venture between Jebsen & Jessen and Demag. Jebsen & Jessen's 50% stake in MHE-Demag was acquired by Konecranes in January 2020. Focusing on its core industrial service and lifting equipment business, Konecranes will, with this deal, be divesting its IPD business to Jebsen & Jessen Group. Since 1972, the business has provided systems for iconic buildings in the region, such as the Petronas Twin Tower, Merdeka 118 and KL Tower in Malaysia, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, BNI 46 in Indonesia, Bitexco Financial Tower in Vietnam and Okada Manila in the Philippines. It also provided the mechanism for the retractable roof of the Singapore Sports Hub – the largest free-spanning dome stadium in the world.   ""The divestment of our IPD business back to Jebsen & Jessen will allow Konecranes to fully focus on growth in our core businesses in the region and leverage the earlier acquisition of full ownership in MHE-Demag. During our strategic review, Jebsen & Jessen stood out as the right fit with a strong vision and strategy for the IPD business, and I am confident that the industrial product business will continue to flourish in its new home,"" said Marko Tulokas, SVP, Industrial Service & Equipment, Region APAC, Konecranes.   Upon finalisation of the acquisition, approximately 300 highly-skilled Konecranes' employees will join Jebsen & Jessen Group, alongside related assets including all MHE products and solutions. The acquired business will maintain its current commercial presence, and all operations and business will proceed as usual.   Hashtag: #JebsenandJessen

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815661,"Tatum scores All-Star record 55, Team Giannis wins 184-175","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Jayson Tatum put on a record-setting show, and made Giannis Antetokounmpo look like a genius.

            Tatum scored an All-Star Game-record 55 points on his way to winning MVP honors, and Team Giannis ended LeBron James’ hold on All-Star captain supremacy by beating Team LeBron 184-175 in the NBA's annual showcase exhibition on Sunday night.

            Tatum had 27 points in the third quarter, another All-Star Game record for any period. He was the first pick by Antetokounmpo in the starters’ portion of the All-Star draft, and in the end, that pick proved to be the right one.











            And the MVP award Tatum was given is named for Kobe Bryant, one of his heroes.

            “It means the world,"" Tatum said. “You think of all the legends and great players that have played this game, and in all honesty, records are made to be broken. I'll hold it for as long as I can, but I'm certain someone will come along in a couple years and try to break it.""

            Tatum broke Anthony Davis’ All-Star record of 52 points. He was 22 of 31 from the floor, plus had 10 rebounds and six assists.

            It was James’ first loss in six times as captain. Antetokounmpo improved to 1-2 in his All-Star captaincies, and became the first captain to hoist a new trophy presented to the winners of the All-Star Game.

            “Winner, winner, chicken dinner,"" Antetokounmpo said.

            Later, with a more serious tone, Antetokounmpo said he had a reason for choosing Tatum. 

            “I knew he would take it serious. It was a no-brainer,"" he said.

            Donovan Mitchell added 40 for Team Giannis, which got 26 points from Damian Lillard — including the game-winner to push his team past the target score.

            Jaylen Brown scored 35 points and had 14 rebounds for Team LeBron, while Kyrie Irving had 32 points and 15 assists and Joel Embiid finished with 32 points.

            Brown and Tatum — Boston teammates — were reveling in a back-and-forth duel during a stretch of the second half.

            “It was a normal day for us,"" Tatum said. “Just millions of people watching.""

            Lillard, the winner of the 3-point contest on All-Star Saturday Night, made eight 3s — including a halfcourt pullup in the third quarter.

            “That was the worst basketball game I've ever seen,"" Team LeBron coach Michael Malone said, clearly poking fun at the defense-optional event.

            Winning coach Joe Mazzulla of Team Giannis said he had a very simple strategy.

            “Stay out of the way, enjoy it, have fun, allow the guys to just be themselves,"" Mazzulla said. “I think it’s important, especially in this league, that guys are just able to be themselves.""

            The league had a ceremony before the second half to pay tribute to the three leading scorers in NBA history: No. 3 Karl Malone, No. 2 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James, now the game’s career leader after he passed Abdul-Jabbar earlier this month.

            Malone and Abdul-Jabbar were brought to the stage, and then Dwyane Wade — James’ former teammate in Miami and now a part-owner of the Jazz — introduced James to bring him onto the platform.

            “We’ve all been witnesses,” Wade said. “No matter the challenge, no matter the noise, he was relentless.”

            With the number 38,388 displayed behind him, James then raised his hand to thank the fans for their ovation, hugged Abdul-Jabbar and Malone. He didn’t return to the game, his night ending with a right hand contusion.

            He finished with 13 points, and said a chasedown block in the first half led to him getting a finger caught in the rim.

            “Precautionary reasons,"" James said.

            James played a half. The game’s other captain didn’t play a half-minute.

            Antetokoumpo drafted his team before the game, went through warmups (such as they were) and started the game as planned.

            But his right wrist was wrapped, and that was an ominous sign. The injury kept him out of All-Star Saturday’s skills event, limited him to 20 seconds in this one. He got an uncontested dunk to open the game, then took a foul and headed to the bench.

            “Whatever I have, I’m going to give,” Antetokounmpo said. “That’s who I am. That’s never going to change.”

            As in past years, the teams played for charity, with Team LeBron raising money for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Utah and Team Giannis for Raise the Future, which connects youth waiting in foster care with stable adults. Each team started with $150,000, with the first three quarters worth another $100,000 apiece and the All-Star Game winner getting another $150,000.

            The teams were tied at 46-46 in the first quarter, and Team Giannis took the second quarter 53-46. Team Giannis also won the third quarter 59-49, and the cumulative score to that point — 158-141, Team Giannis — meant 182 would be the score to reach in the untimed fourth quarter with a target-score ending.

            Team Giannis won $550,000 for its charity, and Team LeBron won $200,000. And Tatum, just as he vowed he would at his first All-Star Game in 2020 — when the award was named for Bryant — won the trophy that he's wanted for a while.

            “Icing on the cake,"" Tatum said.

            TIP-INS

            Team Giannis: Antetokounmpo’s two points kept him the all-time All-Star scoring average leader. He’s now averaging 25.1 points in All-Star Games, just ahead of Kevin Durant (25.0). Without that basket, he’d average 24.9. ... Jrue Holiday took Antetokounmpo’s spot in the starting lineup for the second half.

            Team LeBron: Denver’s Nikola Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP, became the first player to start an All-Star Game on his birthday; he turned 28 on Sunday. The only other player to appear in an All-Star Game on his birthday, the NBA said, was Larry Nance Sr. in 1989. ... Halftime lasted 42 minutes. ... Paul George started in place of James for the second half.

            214 COUNTRIES

            Last year’s All-Star Game was broadcast in 215 countries; this year, it was shown in 214 countries. The omission was Russia. The NBA isn’t showing its games in Russia and hasn’t for nearly a year. The league suspended its business activities with Russia in March 2022, just days after that country invaded Ukraine.

It was a no-brainer,"" he said.Donovan Mitchell added 40 for Team Giannis, which got 26 points from Damian Lillard — including the game-winner to push his team past the target score.Jaylen Brown scored 35 points and had 14 rebounds for Team LeBron, while Kyrie Irving had 32 points and 15 assists and Joel Embiid finished with 32 points.Brown and Tatum — Boston teammates — were reveling in a back-and-forth duel during a stretch of the second half.“It was a normal day for us,"" Tatum said. “Just millions of people watching.""Lillard, the winner of the 3-point contest on All-Star Saturday Night, made eight 3s — including a halfcourt pullup in the third quarter.“That was the worst basketball game I've ever seen,"" Team LeBron coach Michael Malone said, clearly poking fun at the defense-optional event.Winning coach Joe Mazzulla of Team Giannis said he had a very simple strategy.“Stay out of the way, enjoy it, have fun, allow the guys to just be themselves,"" Mazzulla said. “I think it’s important, especially in this league, that guys are just able to be themselves.""The league had a ceremony before the second half to pay tribute to the three leading scorers in NBA history: No. 3 Karl Malone, No. 2 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James, now the game’s career leader after he passed Abdul-Jabbar earlier this month.Malone and Abdul-Jabbar were brought to the stage, and then Dwyane Wade — James’ former teammate in Miami and now a part-owner of the Jazz — introduced James to bring him onto the platform.“We’ve all been witnesses,” Wade said. “No matter the challenge, no matter the noise, he was relentless.”With the number 38,388 displayed behind him, James then raised his hand to thank the fans for their ovation, hugged Abdul-Jabbar and Malone. He didn’t return to the game, his night ending with a right hand contusion.He finished with 13 points, and said a chasedown block in the first half led to him getting a finger caught in the rim.“Precautionary reasons,"" James said.James played a half. The game’s other captain didn’t play a half-minute.Antetokoumpo drafted his team before the game, went through warmups (such as they were) and started the game as planned.But his right wrist was wrapped, and that was an ominous sign. The injury kept him out of All-Star Saturday’s skills event, limited him to 20 seconds in this one. He got an uncontested dunk to open the game, then took a foul and headed to the bench.“Whatever I have, I’m going to give,” Antetokounmpo said. “That’s who I am. That’s never going to change.”As in past years, the teams played for charity, with Team LeBron raising money for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Utah and Team Giannis for Raise the Future, which connects youth waiting in foster care with stable adults. Each team started with $150,000, with the first three quarters worth another $100,000 apiece and the All-Star Game winner getting another $150,000.The teams were tied at 46-46 in the first quarter, and Team Giannis took the second quarter 53-46. Team Giannis also won the third quarter 59-49, and the cumulative score to that point — 158-141, Team Giannis — meant 182 would be the score to reach in the untimed fourth quarter with a target-score ending.Team Giannis won $550,000 for its charity, and Team LeBron won $200,000. And Tatum, just as he vowed he would at his first All-Star Game in 2020 — when the award was named for Bryant — won the trophy that he's wanted for a while.“Icing on the cake,"" Tatum said.TIP-INSTeam Giannis: Antetokounmpo’s two points kept him the all-time All-Star scoring average leader. He’s now averaging 25.1 points in All-Star Games, just ahead of Kevin Durant (25.0). Without that basket, he’d average 24.9. ... Jrue Holiday took Antetokounmpo’s spot in the starting lineup for the second half.Team LeBron: Denver’s Nikola Jokic, the two-time reigning MVP, became the first player to start an All-Star Game on his birthday; he turned 28 on Sunday. The only other player to appear in an All-Star Game on his birthday, the NBA said, was Larry Nance Sr. in 1989. ... Halftime lasted 42 minutes. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815662,Coyotes beat Blue Jackets 3-2 in OT to extend streak,"TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — The Arizona Coyotes coughed up a two-goal lead and allowed two breakaways in the final 30 seconds of regulation.

            Connor Ingram got the saves on the breakaways. Barrett Hayton scored the goal in overtime.

            Arizona's longest points streak in a decade is still alive.











            Hayton scored in overtime, Ingram stopped the breakaways and the Coyotes extended their points streak to nine games with a 3-2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets on Sunday night.

            “Iggy came up big and he is feeling it right now,” Coyotes coach Andre Tourigny said. ""And I think that’s a team. It’s not about who gets the credit as long as the team is playing well."" 

            Arizona jumped out to an early lead on first-period goals by Travis Boyd and Nick Schmaltz.

            Boone Jenner ended Ingram’s scoreless streak at 147 minutes with a second-period goal. The last-place Blue Jackets picked up the pressure in the third period and Patrick Laine tied the game on a power play with five minutes left.

            Ingram stopped a good chance in overtime after the two breakaways and finished with 34 saves. Hayton ended it two minutes into overtime, beating Elvis Merzlikins on a pass from Matias Maccelli to give the Coyotes their longest points (5-0-4) streak since a 12-game run in 2012.

            “We cleaned up some things in practice coming off the break, some breakout stuff,” Hayton said after his first overtime winner. “Our power play has been pretty good as of late, so I think those two things we just dialed in.”

            The Coyotes rallied from a four-goal deficit against the Los Angeles on Saturday night, earning a point in the 6-5 shootout loss. 

            Columbus also played Saturday night, beating the West-leading Dallas Stars 4-1.

            The Coyotes had plenty of jump early in the short turnaround and Boyd scored late in the first period, redirecting a pass from Troy Stecher past Merzlikins.

            Schmaltz scored a little over two minutes later, beating Merzlikins to the glove side after a shot by Keller caromed hard off the back boards. Schmaltz has eight goals and seven assists his last 11 games.

            Obviously, you want to have a little better start and a couple of the recent games we haven't had a good start,"" Jenner said. “But we found our game in the second and third.”

            Ingram was sharp in the first period and made some tough saves through traffic as the Coyotes killed off two penalties. He had no chance late in the second when a shot by Jenner appeared to pinball off several players into the goal, ending his scoreless streak at 147 minutes, 8 seconds.

            Laine tied it on a pass from Adam Boqvist, firing a shot from the left circle before Ingram could slide over. Columbus couldn't finish it off, but earned a point for the fourth time in five games.

            “We played two solid periods,” Columbus coach Brad Larsen said. “They're a dangerous team. You give them a little bit of room 3 on 3 and they made us pay for it.” 

            TESTY NIGHT

            Whether it was the teams getting tired of each other or the short turnaround, Sunday's game got real testy.

            It started at the opening faceoff of the second period when Columbus defenseman Erik Gudbranson and Coyotes defenseman Josh Brown dropped the gloves.

            It went on quite a while.

            Both players landed numerous punches in the fight that lasted over minute. It ended when they both grew tired from all the punching and the officials stepped in.

            Columbus’ Mathieu Olivier and Nick Ritchie also landed some good punches in a shorter fight late in regulation, and player had to be separated numerous times.

            “I really like the way it happened because it happened organically and the guys wanted to take care of their teammates,” Tourigny said. “Kudos to Browny and kudos to Nick Ritchie. I think the way Ritch reacted was really, really good.”

            NOTES: Merzlikins stopped 22 shots. ... Columbus leading scorer Johnny Gaudreau missed his second straight game due to a lower-body injury. ... Coyotes C Liam O’Brien and D JJ Moser each played in their 100th career NHL game, as did Columbus RW Mathieu Olivier. ... Coyotes D Shayne Gostisbehere returned after missing eight games with an upper-body injury.
