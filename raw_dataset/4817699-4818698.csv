https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817699,Primal Shares 2023 Digital Marketing Outlook After Winning Best In-House Team at APAC Search Awards 2023,"KUALA LUMUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 - Primal Digital Agency Malaysia, an industry-leading digital marketing agency, proudly announces their win of the Best In-House Team at APAC Search Awards 2023.            The APAC Search Awards 2023 acknowledges and celebrates the companies that demonstrate excellence in search marketing. This year's awards received a record number of entries from countries across the region.   The Best In-House Team award recognises the effectiveness of Primal's internal marketing efforts and cross-department collaboration that had catapulted the agency to its current position as an important industry leader in three short years, despite the economic downturn of the Covid-19 pandemic. It also recognises the agency as having an effective internal culture amongst staff that is reflected in countless success stories.   General Manager of Primal Digital Agency Malaysia, Ronnie Chin said: ""Our in-house team's expertise in data-driven strategies sets us apart and empowers us to revolutionise our clients' marketing, maximise their investment, and fuel their growth in a rapidly evolving marketplace.""   Primal Digital Agency entered the Malaysian market in 2020 and comprises experts in online paid advertising,  SEO services, content marketing, social media marketing, and digital consultancy. The  digital marketing agency in Malaysia has established itself as a trusted partner to over 60 clients in three years, delivering measurable results through tailored and comprehensive digital marketing solutions.   2023 Outlook for Digital Marketing   Despite the challenges posed by external factors such as the pandemic and economic instability, Primal Digital Agency Malaysia remains optimistic about the growth potential of businesses in the digital space.   Primal Digital Agency Malaysia's Team Lead for Content and Creative, Liew Shu Wen, believes that the year 2023 will bring an increased emphasis on personalisation: ""It's evident that content, especially human-centric content, plays a vital role in determining the success of digital marketing communications. It's the lifeblood that drives engagement, establishes brand authority, and ultimately inspires consumer action. Creating compelling and impactful content sets successful brands apart from the rest in a world where attention is scarce.""   Senior Ads Operations Specialist Yeap Xin May, added: ""Marketers should focus on personalised content and effective targeting to connect with their target audiences. The digital platform selection process is key and should be guided by a comprehensive understanding of the target consumer and marketing strategy. Simply put, to succeed in the digital arena, it's essential to know who you want to reach and create campaigns that resonate with them deeply.""   Speaking on SEO trends, Senior SEO Specialist Tan Shu Yeong said: ""For Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), the landscape is shifting to building a more people-centric user experience. This applies to the development of websites that focus on UX/UI and content.""   He added: ""Visuals, creative content and the website's architecture should be seen as a holistic approach rather than individual components. A website without human-centric content or visuals that speak to the audience will not attract traffic, much less attention.""   Primal Digital Agency Malaysia General Manager Ronnie Chin notes that as we move into an increasingly AI-automated time with AI applications and tools taking over a lot of the creative space in marketing and advertising, the year 2023 will see consumers searching for a more human touch in their consuming content.   ""We are already witnessing customers emphasising more human values like togetherness, tolerance, and corporate responsibility when making their purchase decisions,"" he said.   Primal's Effectiveness   The digital marketing agency in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, consists of specialists rather than generalists. Primal Digital Agency Malaysia hires trained talents in specific niches with first-hand insider knowledge to drive and lead effective client campaigns. Client campaigns are further enhanced with an in-house proprietary system called SENTR, which has successfully innovated how the agency carries out end-to-end digital marketing, from internal planning to budgeting to reporting of campaign results.   SENTR is a one-stop shop for clients and staff to view and keep track of all ongoing campaigns, taking live reporting and optimisation to the next level for the utmost convenience.   The agency prides itself on being pivotal to the development of Malaysia's Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by openly and earnestly working to help many small companies produce effective digital marketing strategies as part of digitalisation efforts.   Primal's Culture   Primal Digital Agency Malaysia General Manager Ronnie Chin believes in driving a sustainable future for the digital marketing industry in Malaysia. The focus is not solely on providing the best tailored digital marketing services, but also on developing a well-rounded digital marketing agency where staff development and health are paramount.   ""The culture at Primal Malaysia is conducive to clients and our employees - who are dominantly Gen-Z and millennials. We all embody Primal's five core values: Ownership, Collaboration, Never Stop Learning, Mastery, Openness and Respect, and Service Excellence. We believe companies are only as healthy as their employees, so we up-skill, train, and support our staff in whatever way possible,"" he said.   He said this positive internal culture had impacted the agency's success in many ways, as reflected in Primal's win for the Best In-House Team award.  Hashtag: #Primal

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817714,Alleged gang member pleads not guilty in California killings,"PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A man with alleged ties to a California prison gang pleaded not guilty Tuesday to killing six people, including a teenage mother and her baby, last month at a central California home connected to a rival gang, prosecutors said.

            Rural Goshen, a community of about 3,000 people in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley, was stunned by the Jan. 16 massacre. 

            Angel Uriarte, 35, pleaded not guilty Tuesday and remains held without bail. He had been hospitalized in custody after he was wounded in a shootout with federal agents more than two weeks after the killings. 











            Uriarte's co-defendant, 25-year-old Noah David Beard, pleaded not guilty earlier this month. Authorities say he shot Alissa Parraz, 16, and her 10-month-old baby, Nycholas Parraz, in the back of their heads.

            Both are charged with six counts of murder and other crimes, and they each face a potential sentence of the death penalty or life in prison without parole. The Tulare County District Attorney's Office hasn't decided yet whether to seek capital punishment.

            “The Tulare County sheriff and prosecutor have already poisoned the jury pool by announcing to anyone who will listen that this is a death penalty case, despite the fact that the governor announced some time ago that he was pausing executions in California,” Uriarte's attorney, Anthony Dell'Anno Sr., said in an email. “Sounds political to me.""

            Due to various legal challenges and court decisions, California has not executed anyone in years. In 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a moratorium on executions for as long as he is in office.

            Sheriff Mike Boudreaux has publicly called for Newsom to reinstate the death penalty for both men and other cases where children are killed.

            Beard's lawyer declined to comment Tuesday. 

            The defendants are scheduled to return to court March 15.

            Investigators believe the two suspects have ties to the Nuestra Familia prison gang. Uriarte was convicted in 2015 of assault with a firearm in association with a street gang, and Beard had juvenile convictions, prosecutors said in a court filing.

            Authorities have not disclosed the reason for the shooting, but the Los Angeles Times reported that it occurred after years of bad blood between two warring families in Goshen.

            The other victims were identified as: Rosa Parraz, 72; Eladio Parraz, Jr., 52; Jennifer Analla, 49; and Marcos Parraz, 19.PORTERVILLE, Calif.

SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 - With almost 100 different styles of premium stone slabs and a multitude of customisation options, Unix Furniture empowers homeowners with the ability to craft beautiful stone standing desks according to their specific visions and finally complete the home office of their dreams.            Whether they love the rich, gold veins of the Calacatta Gold tabletop or the mysterious majesty of Merke Marmo, there is a standing desk design to suit every aesthetic at Unix Furniture.    Unix furniture's Customisable Stone Standing Desks      Stone slabs make for the perfect materials for tabletops due to their remarkable designs, robust physical properties and near-effortless durability.   ""At Unix Furniture, we are proud to offer a superior tabletop material, extensive design options and customisability, and white-glove customer service at price points that are comparable to those of a premium wooden standing desk"", says Chris Goh, the Marketing Director of Unix Furniture. ""We aim to be the first and last stop for every homeowner looking for the perfect stone table for their dream home.""   Unix Furniture uses NSF-certified anti-bacterial quartz slabs. NSF-certification ensures that the quartz slabs have passed stringent tests for public health protection. This means that Unix Furniture's tabletops are of such a high quality that they can be used as a hygienic food preparation surface. In fact, Unix Furniture uses the same quality of quartz countertops for its tables as those that are commonly found in busy kitchens and high-end hotel lobbies.   Unix Furniture's quartz standing desks are also stain, impact, knock and heat resistant, making them more robust and durable than the typical wooden standing desks. Busy professionals will also appreciate that Unix's stone standing desks are easy to clean and maintain and will look pristine for years to come with minimal effort.   Each standing desk comes with a built-in touch-sensitive control panel with multiple height presets. This can be placed on either the left or right corners, making it a boon to left-handers. It also comes with an anti-collision system and can handle a maximum load capacity of 140 kilogrammes.   Unix Furniture has recently partnered with another homegrown Singaporean brand, Nexen, to offer its electric power track as an optional upgrade. This makes the standing desk even more personalisable as users can add different power adaptors to suit their requirements.   In terms of dimensions, Unix Furniture offers tables that can fit a cosy 1050mm corner all the way to majestic 1600mm spaces. There are also various finishing styles and edge profiles to choose from.   Where most standing desks come in a flat pack and may require additional installation fees, each standing desk from Unix Furniture is crafted from a single stone slab and expertly assembled on-location for free. Unix Furniture has its own experienced delivery and installation team that ensures everything is perfect from the moment a desk leaves the showroom to when is set up in each customer's workstation.   While Unix Furniture is well-known for its  quartz tables, it will also be offering sintered stone, granite and terrazzo tabletops. This extensive range of stone tabletops helps ensure that there is a fit for almost every design style and budget.   On top of Unix Furniture's in-house brands of  Aurastone (quartz),  Mysa (sintered stone),  Louve (terrazzo) and  Domus (granite), it also carries popular international brands such as Cosentino and Caesarstone.    15% Discount during Comex 2023      Unix Furniture will be participating in Comex 2023 at Suntec Singapore from 9 to 12 March 2023.   In conjunction with its participation, Unix Furniture will be offering 15% discounts on purchases in both its event booth and sales website,  unix.sg.   Customers can opt for a three-month holding period. This means that they can order their table during the event to take advantage of Unix's limited-time discount but request to have it delivered up to three months later. This makes it more convenient for customers who have yet to move to their new homes.

            A grand jury in Hardee County indicted Matthew Flores, 35, on charges of first-degree murder, grand theft auto, possession of a firearm by a felon and tampering with evidence, according to court records.

            The indictment relates to the Jan. 24 fatal shooting of 43-year-old Jose Carlos Martinez in Wauchula. Police were actively searching for Flores in that case by Jan. 30, when Lyft driver Gary Levin, 74, went missing after dropping off a customer in Okeechobee, a small city north of Florida’s Lake Okeechobee and about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east of Wauchula.











            Levin’s red 2022 Kia Stinger was spotted in Miami, Okeechobee and Gainesville in north Florida after his disappearance. The vehicle was stopped Feb. 2 in North Carolina, where a U.S. Marshals regional task force asked authorities to be on the lookout. Flores, who was driving the car, was arrested following a police chase through three counties, officials said. A dead body found in Okeechobee after Levin went missing was eventually identified as the driver.

            Flores was being held in North Carolina on a $2 million bond with a hearing scheduled for Wednesday. He will eventually be returned to Florida. It was not known whether Flores had a lawyer who can speak on his behalf.MIAMI (AP) — A man who police say was driving the car of a dead South Florida Lyft driver was charged with murder and other counts Tuesday in a separate case.A grand jury in Hardee County indicted Matthew Flores, 35, on charges of first-degree murder, grand theft auto, possession of a firearm by a felon and tampering with evidence, according to court records.The indictment relates to the Jan. 24 fatal shooting of 43-year-old Jose Carlos Martinez in Wauchula.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817729,Prosecutor gets case involving 6-year-old who shot teacher,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) — Detectives in the Virginia city where a 6-year-old shot his teacher have finished their criminal investigation and turned it over to the local prosecutor's office for review, the police chief for Newport News said Tuesday. 

            Chief Steve Drew spoke about the case during a Facebook live chat, although he offered few details. 

            The boy used his mother's 9mm handgun when he shot and wounded teacher Abby Zwerner as she taught her class at Richneck Elementary on Jan. 6, police have said. 











            Police said the mother's gun was purchased legally. The parents' attorney, James S. Ellenson, has said the weapon was secured on a top shelf in the mother’s closet and had a trigger lock. 

            Drew said his department's investigation was turned over Tuesday morning to the local prosecutor, known as the Commonwealth's Attorney, who will determine if any charges will be filed. 

            “I totally understand people would like to have a case open and shut — that’s just not what we have here,” Drew said. 

            Drew described a complicated investigation that involved coordinating interviews with first-graders, which required permission from their parents as well as the expertise of a child psychologist. Detectives also had to interview teachers and follow up on various leads as new information came to light. 

            Newport News Commonwealth’s Attorney Howard E. Gwynn told The Associated Press that the city's detectives handed over three binders of information to his office. Those files do not include the body camera footage of dozens of police officers who responded to the shooting. That video will also be reviewed. 

            “It's a lot of information and we’re going to carefully review it as we do in every case,” Gwynn said. 

            Legal experts have said that even though it is theoretically possible under Virginia law to criminally charge a 6-year-old child, there are numerous obstacles to doing so and it’s highly unlikely that any prosecutor would even try.

            But adults could be held accountable. For example, a Virginia law prohibits leaving a loaded gun where it is accessible to a child under 14, a misdemeanor crime punishable with a maximum one-year prison sentence and a $2,500 fine.

            The shooting has sent shockwaves through Newport News, a shipbuilding city of about 185,000 people near the Chesapeake Bay. The school system installed metal detectors in the school where the shooting occurred, while the superintendent and an assistant principal have resigned.

            Zwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital before coming home to continue her recovery. Her attorney has sent the school district a notice that she intends to sue. So have the families of two students at the elementary school.NEWPORT NEWS, Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817740,Bowtie’s Mission to Relieve Hong Kong Patients from Years-long Waiting Times,"Bowtie helps Hongkongers to access quality private healthcare services

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 - Hong Kong’s public health care system has always been top-of-mind for the city’s residents because of its lower cost, especially those seeing specialist doctors. However, given the shortage of specialist doctors, the waiting times for specialist doctors may go up to 4 years, as reported by Hospital Authority. In view of the overloaded public healthcare system,  Bowtie is committed to helping Hongkongers gain access to quality private healthcare services.    Waiting time for specialist outpatient clinics and surgery is up to 4 years    In Hong Kong, the longest waiting time for Eye Specialists can be up to 224 weeks. For specialist care in Medicine, Surgery, Orthopaedics & Traumatology, and Psychiatry, the longest waiting time can run up to 122 weeks, 109 weeks, 99 weeks, and 94 weeks respectively.   Be known that the consequences of long waiting times can be severe. Longer waiting time for treatment could lead to a deterioration in treatment outcomes and reduced remission rates. For example, in the context of psychosis treatment, researchers from Centre for Health Economics at University of York have found that longer waiting time is significantly associated with a deterioration in patient outcomes for patients that are in early intervention in psychosis (EIP) care. The deteriorated condition of the patient while waiting is very likely to take longer to recover or will not be reversed at all after a certain amount of time has passed.    Government introduces VHIS to ease pressure on public healthcare system      For years now, the Hong Kong SAR Government has spared no effort to shorten the waiting times for patients to receive specialist care. In order to provide the public with an additional choice of using private healthcare services through hospital insurance and relieve the pressure on the public healthcare system in the long run, the Hong Kong SAR Government launched a government-regulated  voluntary health insurance scheme, namely the VHIS, which combines the characteristics of private insurance with strong government regulation.   VHIS was officially implemented by the Health Bureau on 1 April 2019. Under the VHIS, consumers may choose to purchase Standard Plans as offered by the participating insurance companies. All  VHIS Standard Plans must meet the benefit requirements prescribed by the scheme, including standardised policy terms and conditions, benefit coverage and benefit amounts.    Keeping premiums low by exempting intermediary commissions    Bowtie was established as Hong Kong’s first  virtual insurer after having been approved by the Insurance Authority in December 2018. By harnessing the latest technology, Bowtie offers commission-free products without intermediaries and reduces operating costs. As a result, Bowtie can keep premiums at their lowest while offering the same level of protection, which explains why Bowtie  VHIS Standard has the most competitive premium* in the city.   In 2021, Bowtie and Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong announced their partnership, introducing the first-ever  “Medical Insurance + Wellness” Package (Bowtie & Gleneagles Hospital Hong Kong Wellness Package) in Hong Kong.   With the objective of providing a comprehensive healthcare experience to customers, this VHIS rider plan offers customers an affordable Full Reimbursement^ premium medical package, combined with wellness services of their own choice.   * According to the Health Bureau, Bowtie VHIS Standard plan for non-smoking insured aged 0 to 80 is the cheapest in the market, as of 20 March 2022,   ‍^ Full reimbursement of selected medical package is subject to the annual benefit limit of VHIS Flexi Plans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817754,"Moore scores 25, helps Villanova edge No. 16 Xavier 64-63","CINCINNATI (AP) — Justin Moore scored 25 points and Villanova edged No. 16 Xavier 64-63 Tuesday night for its biggest victory under first-year head coach Kyle Neptune.

            Cam Whitmore added 11 points for the Wildcats (14-14, 8-9 Big East), who dealt a big blow to the Musketeers’ conference title hopes.

            Villanova overcame a 13-point deficit in the second half. Neptune dismissed the notion that it was his team's top win.











            “We don't really look at it like that,” he said. “We always just want to be the best team we can be by the end of the season. That's our goal. Our guys are proud. We played extremely hard.”

            Souley Boum led the Musketeers (20-8, 12-5 Big East) with 17 points. 

            Two free throws by Boum got the Musketeers within one point with 36 seconds left. Eric Dixon was called for traveling, giving Xavier possession with 11 seconds left, but the Musketeers committed their 14th turnover. 

            Xavier had only four turnovers in the first half. Villanova finished with 19 points off Musketeers' turnovers. 

            “Our turnovers in the second half, it overwhelmed us,” Xavier coach Sean Miller said. “Villanova isn't a team that tries to turn you over. They were unforced. That was the difference in the game.”

            The Musketeers beat Villanova 88-80 on Jan. 7. It was their first true road win in the series since the 1955-56 season, but they fell short of a series sweep at home. 

            Xavier played its sixth game without second-leading scorer and leading rebounder Zach Freemantle, who scored 29 points in an 88-80 win at Villanova on Jan. 7. Freemantle has a foot injury and is expected to return by the postseason. The Musketeers are 4-3 without him. 

            “Our lack of depth is something we have to play through, and be smart with,” Miller said. “Did that play a role in us having 10 turnovers in the second half? No.”

            Villanova is 12-3 this season when allowing fewer than 70 points, but 1-11 when allowing 70 or more. 

            The game was played at Xavier's preferred pace early on. 

            Desmond Claude who returned after missing two games due to illness, hit a 3-pointer to spark a 6-0 run to put the Musketeers ahead 20-12. 

            “It took us a while to adjust to their speed on offense,” Neptune said. 

            Moore who returned in January after missing 10 months with a torn Achilles, hit a 3-pointer to spark a 10-0 run to get the Wildcats back in the game. 

            “They're a different team with Justin Moore,” Miller said. 

            Boum beat the halftime buzzer with a 3-pointer from near midcourt to give the Musketeers a 36-30 lead.

            Dixon's layup gave Villanova a 52-50 lead with 8:30 remaining. It was the Wildcats' first lead since the 18:50 mark of the first half. 

            Kunkel appeared to have tied the score with a layup and was fouled with 2:35 left, but the official called traveling. Moore followed with a 3-pointer to put Villanova up by five.

            “It’s a big win for us,” Moore said. “Not just that we got the win, but the way we won. We were down, we persevered and came back. We played tough.”

            TURNING POINT

            Villanova was trailing 40-30 early in the second half when the Wildcats players, led by Moore, had a spirited conversation during a media timeout. “It was just us talking to each other about what we needed to do,” Moore said. “It was me, and other guys who have been in this position.” Less than eight minutes later, Moore tied the score with a layup. “He's not just our best player,"" Neptune said, ""he's our leader. He's everything for our team.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Villanova: The Wildcats finally are getting healthy. After the Wildcats' top six scorers missed a combined 36 games to injury, the Feb. 11 win over Seton Hall was the first time all were available. Nova's top six scorers missed a combined five games all last season. 

            Xavier: Coming into this season, the Musketeers had defeated Villanova only twice since joining the Big East for the 2013-14 season.

The Musketeers are 4-3 without him.“Our lack of depth is something we have to play through, and be smart with,” Miller said. “Did that play a role in us having 10 turnovers in the second half? No.”Villanova is 12-3 this season when allowing fewer than 70 points, but 1-11 when allowing 70 or more.The game was played at Xavier's preferred pace early on.Desmond Claude who returned after missing two games due to illness, hit a 3-pointer to spark a 6-0 run to put the Musketeers ahead 20-12.“It took us a while to adjust to their speed on offense,” Neptune said.Moore who returned in January after missing 10 months with a torn Achilles, hit a 3-pointer to spark a 10-0 run to get the Wildcats back in the game.“They're a different team with Justin Moore,” Miller said.Boum beat the halftime buzzer with a 3-pointer from near midcourt to give the Musketeers a 36-30 lead.Dixon's layup gave Villanova a 52-50 lead with 8:30 remaining. It was the Wildcats' first lead since the 18:50 mark of the first half.Kunkel appeared to have tied the score with a layup and was fouled with 2:35 left, but the official called traveling. Moore followed with a 3-pointer to put Villanova up by five.“It’s a big win for us,” Moore said. “Not just that we got the win, but the way we won. We were down, we persevered and came back. We played tough.”TURNING POINTVillanova was trailing 40-30 early in the second half when the Wildcats players, led by Moore, had a spirited conversation during a media timeout. “It was just us talking to each other about what we needed to do,” Moore said. “It was me, and other guys who have been in this position.” Less than eight minutes later, Moore tied the score with a layup. “He's not just our best player,"" Neptune said, ""he's our leader. He's everything for our team.""BIG PICTUREVillanova: The Wildcats finally are getting healthy. After the Wildcats' top six scorers missed a combined 36 games to injury, the Feb. 11 win over Seton Hall was the first time all were available. Nova's top six scorers missed a combined five games all last season.Xavier: Coming into this season, the Musketeers had defeated Villanova only twice since joining the Big East for the 2013-14 season.UP NEXTVillanova: Hosts No. 19 Creighton on Saturday.Xavier: At Seton Hall on Friday.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/22,,World

The combined solution is set to deliver a leap forward in hybrid meetings, with remote delegates and satellite offices benefitting from a greatly enhanced experience.               The explosion in unified communications and video conferencing over the past three years has transformed the way teams connect. However, despite improvements in screen sharing, microphones and video capture technology, virtual guests still often feel disengaged from the physical meeting room.   Now, Lumens' CamConnect software synchronizes with Sennheiser's TCC 2's patented automatic dynamic beamforming technology to enable the in-room PTZ camera to track the position of the live presenter. This means that remote delegates can immediately identify and engage with the speaker, rather than watch a wide-angle view of the entire room.   ""We are very pleased that Lumens has added support for our TeamConnect Ceiling 2 microphone to their innovative CamConnect software,"" said Charlie Jones, Global Alliance & Partnership Manager, Business Communication, Sennheiser. ""It's incredibly important for meeting attendees to have the ability to easily follow the conversation they are hearing through our best-in-class ceiling microphones like the TCC 2. When you combine the TCC 2's dynamic beamforming technology with Lumens USB PTZ cameras you create a premium meeting experience that ensures everyone can be seen and heard.""   ""This is an exciting proposition for the market that brings together two leaders in meeting room technology. By adding accurate voice-tracking to our HD and 4K PTZ cameras, we are delivering a new level of meeting experience that we expect to become the new standard in the industry,"" commented Steven Liang, Head of Product Development at Lumens Digital Optics Inc.   Organizations that have already invested in Sennheiser's TCC 2 microphones can now, and for a very low cost, enable automatic voice detection in a wide range of Lumens PTZ cameras. The technology can also be deployed in classrooms and lecture rooms where voice tracked cameras transform a static presentation into a truly televisual experience. The entire process is automated, delivering significant operational costs.   CamConnect software can be downloaded at no cost from the Lumens website. The application runs in a standard Windows environment and supports all Lumens USB PTZ cameras.

            Danielle Patterson and Kadaja Bailey each scored 20 points and Jayla Everett added 17 in the 69-64 upset.

            It was St. John's it 20th win of the season (20-7, 11-7 Big East), and came three days after the team scored just 38 points in a 23-point loss to Marquette. 











            “It’s just an unbelievable win for our program and these kids,” coach Joe Tartamella said. “They’ve been waiting for a game like this all year and I’m just so proud of them.”

            Lou Lopez Senechal scored 18 points while Dorka Juhasz and Aaliyah Edwards each had 14 for UConn (24-5, 16-2), which was looking to secure a share of its 29th regular-season conference title and 10th in a row. 

            St. John's led the game for more than 28 minutes and by as much as nine points in the first half. 

            UConn had a chance to tie it at 62 late, but Caroline Ducharme missed her short jumper badly and Jayla Everett hit a baseline jumper to extend the lead to four points.

            UConn was then forced to foul and Bailey hit four key free throws down the stretch to secure the win. 

            ""We didn’t get down on ourselves,” Patterson said. “We just continued to play and see it through and then we were able to go to some really good people at the end and we were able to get it done.”

            St. John’s held UConn to 35.5% shooting and outrebounded the Huskies 42-37. 

            The Red Storm led 35-30 at the half. 

            But Nika Muhl’s 3-pointer to open the third quarter triggered an 13-0 run, giving the Huskies a 43-35 lead, their first advantage since it was 7-5 in the first quarter.

            A technical foul on Aaliyah Edwards after an offensive rebound attempt, led to a 4-point possession for St. John’s, which tied the game at 43.

            A conventional 3-point play by Everett gave St. John’s a 51-48 lead heading into the fourth and they pushed the lead to six points with six minutes to play.

            “It would have been a sin if they would have lost the game,” UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. “They played so well and so hard.”

            UConn won the first meeting between the two teams by 30 points in January.

            “This is it,” Auriemma said. “This is who we are right now.”

            “Obviously we've got more to do, but this certainly was a win that I think at least we can feel good about that's going to be on paper that I think people will extremely respect, especially on the road,” Tartamella said.

            UConn: The Huskies are still without star Azzi Fudd, who re-injured her right knee a game after returning from injury and scoring 14 points in the Huskies meeting with St. John's in January. Fudd, who has missed a total of 20 games this season, is hoping to return in time to help UConn make a run next month at a 12th national title. ... UConn needs one win in its final two games to secure the top seed in the conference tournament. 

            “All the emotions we’re feeling right now — anger, embarrassment, disappointment, that’s what’s going to help us bounce back,” said Muhl, who had 13 points, but was in foul trouble for most of the game.

            Dalce had 11 points and three blocks and Olsen added nine points, six rebounds and four assists for Villanova (24-5, 15-3 Big East). The school's record had stood since Lisa Ortlip had 65 blocks during the 1978-79 season. 

            Siegrist, leading the nation in scoring at 29.1 points per game, was 9 of 27 from the floor and 8 of 11 at the free-throw line to go with 16 rebounds in a battle with DePaul's Aneesah Morrow, who had 29 points and 19 rebounds. It was the sixth game since 2000 featuring two opposing players with 25-point, 15-rebound performances, according to ESPN Stats & Info.

            Siegrist scored 15 straight Villanova points in the second quarter before Bella Runyan capped the first-half scoring on a 3-pointer with 2:32 left. Siegrist was 7-of-16 shooting and the rest of her teammates combined to make 4 of 21. 

            Darrione Rogers scored 15 of her 17 points in the second half and Anaya Peoples finished with 10 points for DePaul (15-14, 8-10).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817792,Red Wings beat Capitals 3-1 for 6th win in 7 games,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After reeling off a recent winning streak, Detroit Red Wings players are feeling plenty confident. Just not confident enough to see how quickly they're climbing the standings.

            “I’m not checking every morning when I get up,” Pius Suter said.

            Beating the Washington Capitals 3-1 on Tuesday night behind two goals from Suter put the Red Wings one step closer to ending their six-year playoff drought. They've won six times in their past seven games and moved ahead of perennial contender Washington in the Eastern Conference wild-card race.











            ""We know we can win in this league, and we have the team that can win,"" said goaltender Ville Husso, who stopped 26 of the 27 shots he faced for the victory. ""It’s just day by day, have fun and move on.”

            Washington lost a fifth in a row in regulation — its longest stretch without a point since January 2014, the last time the team missed the postseason.

            “There’s no time to hang our heads here,” said winger Tom Wilson, who scored the Capitals' only goal. “It’s not easy to win in this league. We got to find a way here.”

            Detroit kept rolling despite Dylan Larkin getting ejected 12:43 in for cross-checking T.J. Oshie in the face. Larkin, a pending free agent and the Red Wings' captain, had been their best player during this run with seven goals and six assists in six games since the NHL All-Star break.

            Coach Derek Lalonde hopes Larkin avoids a suspension for the play, calling it not malicious and pointing out Larkin has no history of supplemental discipline.

            “We already lost him for an entire game, basically,” Lalonde said.

            No Larkin, no problem, with defenseman Robert Hagg scoring for the first time since Oct. 25, 2021 — two teams ago — and Suter getting one goal short-handed in the first period and another at even strength in the third. 

            Washington's Darcy Kuemper allowed three goals on 25 shots, and former Red Wings winger Anthony Mantha was knocked out of the Capitals lineup in the second period with an undisclosed upper-body injury.

            Jakub Vrana, traded to Detroit from Washington for Mantha at the 2020 deadline, got a video tribute and a standing ovation in his first time playing in his old home arena.

            ""Felt good to win here, especially,"" Vrana said. ""I had a lot of flashbacks in the arena, of course, but once the puck dropped it was all business. I’m happy that we got the win.”

            Vrana, who helped the Capitals win the Stanley Cup in 2018, played a game for the Red Wings for the first time since Oct. 15 after going into the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program and getting waived and sent to the minors. 

            ""I think a great step in the right direction for him,"" Lalonde said.

            Alex Ovechkin missed a fourth consecutive game for the death of his father. The Capitals got fourth-line center Nic Dowd back after missing more than a month, but that didn't help their offensive woes as they scored two or fewer goals for the fifth time in six games.

            “We’re pressing, pressing, pressing,” Dowd said. ""We had so many pucks that were sitting right in the crease and on the goal line and you’re kind of thinking, ‘Can we not get a bounce here?’ I think everything is magnified at this point in the season. Where we are in the standings, everything.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817793,Pitt hits 20-win mark sinking Georgia Tech 76-68,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Nelly Cummings scored 22 points and Blake Hinson scored 19 points and Pittsburgh beat Georgia Tech 76-68 on Tuesday night.

            Federiko Federiko scored 14 points and Jamarius Burton 12 for Pitt, which made 19 of 20 foul shots including all eight in the final two-and-a-half minutes. The Panthers owned a 34-24 rebounding edge.

            Miles Kelly scored 24 points shooting 6 of 13 from beyond 3-point range, Kyle Sturdivant scored 16 and Javon Franklin 15 for Georgia Tech.











            Federiko threw down a dunk with 9:09 left to put Pitt ahead 53-52 and the Panthers stayed ahead the rest of the way. Pitt led 33-32 at halftime.

            With the win, the Panthers (20-8, 13-4 ACC) reached the 20-win mark for the first time since the 2015-16 season when they went 21-12 and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Wisconsin. It was also the program's last trip to the NCAA Tournament.

            This is the first season in the five-year tenure under coach Jeff Capel that the Panthers have won 20 games. It's the 23rd season of 20-plus wins in program history.

            Pitt sits in third place in the conference behind idle Virginia (13-3) and Miami (14-4) with three games left.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817794,Johnson leads No. 14 K-State to 75-65 win over No. 9 Baylor,"MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) — Kansas State coach Jerome Tang leaped onto the courtside table and pumped his fists, then landed a spectacular dismount, before climbing into the student section and joining in the “Wabash Cannonball” dance to celebrate another ranked win.

            This one was as special as any of them.

            Keyontae Johnson scored 25 points, Markquis Nowell added 14 points and 10 assists, and the No. 14 Wildcats followed a long first-half slump with a big second-half run to beat ninth-ranked Baylor 75-65 on Tuesday night. 











            In doing so, they gave their first-year coach a season sweep of Tang's former team and his longtime mentor, Scott Drew.

            “I tried to tell y’all I’m athletic,” said Tang, who spent 19 years on the Baylor bench and helped bring a national title to Waco, Texas. “They were arguably the hottest team in the league, except the second half of the last game and this game.”

            Cam Carter added 10 points for the Wildcats (21-7, 9-6 Big 12), who trailed 34-31 at the break before their 18-4 charge gave them control. They coasted from there to a school record-tying seventh win over a ranked team this season.

            The last two — against Iowa State and Baylor — came after the Wildcats had lost four of five.

            “I thought it was another typical Big 12 game,” Drew said. “K-State played like you're supposed to on your home court. I thought Keyontae Johnson, we really had trouble matching up with him pretty much all night, and then Nowell struggled from the field but 10 assists, zero turnovers. That's why they're first-team all-leaguers.”

            Keyonte George hit six 3-pointers and scored 23 points to lead Baylor (20-8, 9-6), which had won seven of its last eight against the Wildcats and three straight in Manhattan. LJ Cryer added four 3s and finished with 16 points.

            “You know, it comes back to all of us. It's a team effort,” George said. “We just have to play harder, including myself.”

            Baylor was coming off an 87-71 loss at No. 3 Kansas on Saturday in which the Bears were phenomenal in the first half, building a 17-point lead, and dreadful in the second, when they were outscored 55-26 while looking listless and lost.

            The Bears' kept that Jekyll-and-Hyde act going Tuesday night.

            Their sluggish finish in Lawrence carried over to the opening 13 minutes in Manhattan, when the Wildcats were able to methodically build a 24-13 lead. But after Drew called a timeout, his guys answered with a 3-pointer fueled 21-3 run over the next 6-plus minutes, allowing Baylor to take a 34-31 advantage into the break.

            Cryer did most of the damage, going 4 of 5 from beyond the arc and scoring 11 first-half points.

            “We did a really good job early and we messed up on some ball-screen coverages and they were able to make some 3s,” Tang said. “At halftime the team said, ‘Coach, if we do this it’ll make it better for us.' And the fact that they were thinking about how the problems were taking place and they came up with the solution, that was big time.”

            Whatever the change, it certainly worked.

            The Bears still led 40-37 in the opening minutes of the second half when Johnson scored back-to-back baskets to give Kansas State the lead. David N'Guessan kept the charge going, and it eventually reached 18-4 when Carter took a turnover by the Bears' Caleb Lohner for a dunk that made it 55-44 with just over 8 minutes left in the game.

            “It's hard to stop transition offense, especially off turnovers,” Carter said. “We capitalized on that.”

            The Wildcats stretched their lead to as many as 14 points before wrapping up the season sweep of the Bears.

            “It started in practice,” Nowell said. “Whenever we're in practice, we come with that energy. We have a good scout, we play well. We've been focusing on practice a lot more, focusing on the defensive side, and we got two wins to show for it.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Baylor struggled to find some help for George and Cryer on offense. Adam Flagler missed his first nine shots and finished with four points on 1-for-13 shooting, and Jalen Bridges had just six points while dealing with foul trouble all night.

            Kansas State overcame a poor night from the 3-point arc (4 of 21) by dominating the guard-heavy Bears with a 42-16 edge in the paint. Many of those points came in transition, where the Wildcats had a 19-5 advantage off turnovers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817795,"Omier, No. 13 Miami beat Virginia Tech for 7th straight win","BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) — Norchad Omier had 17 points and 14 rebounds as No. 13 Miami beat Virginia Tech 76-70 on Tuesday night for its seventh straight win.

            Nigel Pack added 16 points for the Hurricanes (23-5, 14-4 Atlantic Coast Conference), who placed five players in double figures.

            “I’m very, very proud of my team and the way we hung in there in the first half,” Miami coach Jim Larranaga said. “And the way we played in the second half.”











            Sean Pedulla led Virginia Tech (16-12, 6-11) with 17 points. 

            Miami, which trailed by as many as nine in the first half, led the entire second half and built a 10-point lead with 9:58 remaining. 

            The Hokies closed to 64-60 on Grant Basile’s basket with 4:05 remaining. The Hurricanes sealed the win by making eight of 10 free throws in the final 1:02, connecting on 8 of 10 from the free-throw line.

            “Our practices have been terrific,” Larranaga said. “The energy level, the attention to detail, and at both ends of the court. The guys I would give credit to are our scout team. They’re freshmen, but they have to simulate what the opponents are doing, and they are doing a fabulous job of just creating game-like situations. … All those guys are practicing very hard and very well.”

            Isaiah Wong finished with 13 points and Jordan Miller had 11 for Miami, which shot just 42.2% (27 of 64) after leading the ACC at 48.7 percent coming into the game. 

            Hunter Cattoor finished with 15 points for the Hokies, who shot 46.7% (28 of 60), but allowed 14 offensive rebounds.

            “We didn’t get the rebounding from our guards that we typically get and need,” Virginia Tech coach Mike Young said. “I had a lot on their plate, getting to Wong, getting to Pack, getting to Jordan Miller is such a big deal, and they flat beat us to the ball a couple of times. That hurt.

            “We weren’t quite good enough, and they are playing great, great basketball. I thought we did some really, really good things, but needless to say, not enough against the Hurricanes here tonight.”

            TIP-INS

            Miami: The Hurricanes are tied with Pittsburgh with a league-high six road wins this season. They are a half-game behind Virginia in the standings.

            Virginia Tech: Last year’s ACC Tournament champion is probably looking at an NIT berth unless it again wins the ACC tourney. The Hokies have just three Quad 1 victories, played a weak nonconference schedule, and close losses -- five losses by five points or less -- have really hurt their NCAA Tournament chances.

The Hurricanes sealed the win by making eight of 10 free throws in the final 1:02, connecting on 8 of 10 from the free-throw line.“Our practices have been terrific,” Larranaga said. “The energy level, the attention to detail, and at both ends of the court. The guys I would give credit to are our scout team. They’re freshmen, but they have to simulate what the opponents are doing, and they are doing a fabulous job of just creating game-like situations. … All those guys are practicing very hard and very well.”Isaiah Wong finished with 13 points and Jordan Miller had 11 for Miami, which shot just 42.2% (27 of 64) after leading the ACC at 48.7 percent coming into the game.Hunter Cattoor finished with 15 points for the Hokies, who shot 46.7% (28 of 60), but allowed 14 offensive rebounds.“We didn’t get the rebounding from our guards that we typically get and need,” Virginia Tech coach Mike Young said. “I had a lot on their plate, getting to Wong, getting to Pack, getting to Jordan Miller is such a big deal, and they flat beat us to the ball a couple of times. That hurt.“We weren’t quite good enough, and they are playing great, great basketball. I thought we did some really, really good things, but needless to say, not enough against the Hurricanes here tonight.”TIP-INSMiami: The Hurricanes are tied with Pittsburgh with a league-high six road wins this season. They are a half-game behind Virginia in the standings.Virginia Tech: Last year’s ACC Tournament champion is probably looking at an NIT berth unless it again wins the ACC tourney. The Hokies have just three Quad 1 victories, played a weak nonconference schedule, and close losses -- five losses by five points or less -- have really hurt their NCAA Tournament chances.UP NEXTMiami: The Hurricanes host Florida State on Saturday.Virginia Tech: The Hokies play at Duke on Saturday.___AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817804,Taiwan official apologizes over egg shortage,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) on Tuesday (Feb. 21) apologized over the recent shortage of eggs and vowed efforts to boost industry resilience.Foxconn founder Terry Guo (郭台銘), who is rumored to have his eyes on the presidential race, lambasted the government on Tuesday for failing to solve the “egg crisis.”While offering his apologies for customers complaining about inadequate egg supplies, Chen Chi-chung explained that the latest egg strain could be attributed to multiple factors. He laid out the action being taken to address the woes and asked for understanding.According to Chen, avian influenza driven by the H5N1 strain is sweeping the globe, having affected more than 6,500 breeding farms. Culls are being conducted on a large scale in Taiwan, the U.S., France, Japan, South Korea, and beyond, exacerbating the availability of chickens.Previously, Taiwan saw a daily demand of 100,000 to 110,000 carts of eggs, each containing 200 units. The need has increased over the past four years to 120,000 carts, presenting a gap as the country is currently only able to produce 113,000 carts on a daily basis, he said.The country is seeking to stabilize the stock of chickens with continued imports and measures to cushion the impact of the rise in the cost of feed or diseases such as avian flu. A type of evaporative cooling system, for example, will be promoted to cut the risk of illness spreading in Taiwan’s poultry houses through better airflow.To that end, Chen said an upgrade of chicken farm facilities is being implemented to create a more sustainable, resilient egg industry.Some McDonald’s Taiwan stores have temporarily halted the sale of items including egg burgers and muffins as ""the sales have exceeded expectations."" Retailers from PX Mart to Carrefour are also restricting the number of egg cartons for each purchase.Taiwan experienced a similar egg shortage last year due to lagging chick restocking, cold fronts, and avian flu outbreaks.",2023/02/22,3512,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817817,Lightning score 4 in 2nd period; Ducks lose 6th straight,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Nick Paul scored the first of four Tampa Bay goals in a span of 5:55 in the second period, and Brayden Point scored his 200th NHL goal as the Lightning dealt the Anaheim Ducks their sixth straight loss, 6-1 on Tuesday night.

            Ross Colton, Anthony Cirelli and Zach Bogosian also scored during the second-period outburst for the Lightning, and Andrei Vasilevskiy finished with 24 saves. Tampa Bay, the only team in the NHL averaging more than four goals per game at home, is 14-0-1 in its last 15 games at Amalie Arena.

            “We dug in a little bit, played with a little more snarl in front of the net,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said of his team’s improved play in the second period. “It was more blue-collar hockey.”











            Anaheim’s Ryan Strome spoiled Vasilevskiy’s shutout bid, scoring 6:28 into the third period. Lukas Dostal made 38 saves for the Ducks, who are 0-5-1 in their last six games and have been outscored 36-15.

            “I think we played as a team, and unfortunately the way our team is this year we have to almost play a perfect game to beat a team like this,” Strome said. “When they turned it up a notch, we had a tendency to split up rather than come together. Obviously, they’re a great team and there are a lot of lessons we can learn from that.”

            Point and Corey Perry scored in the third period, and rookie defenseman Nick Perbix had three assists for Tampa Bay, which took the first 21 shots on goal in the second period before Vasilevskiy robbed Trevor Zegras with 1:09 remaining.

            Paul snapped his 11-game scoring drought when he beat Dostal with a snap shot from the right circle at 7:15 of the middle period, giving the Lightning a 1-0 lead with his career-high 17th goal of the season.

            A little advice from Hockey Hall of Famer Phil Esposito might have helped.

            “I was sitting on 16 for a little bit, clutching my stick a little bit,” Paul said. “I saw Phil at dinner the other day and he told me to shoot the puck more, and it ended up working.”

            Colton made it 2-0 at 9:48, scoring past Dostal with a shot from the right circle on a power play. Cirelli was left alone in front and slid a quick backhand shot past Dostal at 10:51. Bogosian scored his first of the season with a straightaway slap shot from just inside the blue line at 13:10.

            Point reached the 200-goal milestone when he scored a power-play goal at 1:06 of the third period.

            ""It’s something you never grow up thinking you’re going to do,” he said. “To do it is pretty cool. I’m getting the puck in good places.”

            Perry, who scored 372 goals during 14 seasons with Anaheim, made it 6-0 at 2:23, before Strome got the Ducks on the board.

            Anaheim went 0-1-1 on a two-day swing through Florida and is last in the NHL standings at 17-34-7.

            “We’re a rebuilding team,” coach Dallas Eakins said. “We played last night and we were starting to run out of gas after a really strong first period and we’ve got to play a perfect game to be in with teams like this right now. We weren’t able to sustain the game.”

            HOME COOKING

            Vasilevskiy improved to 12-0-0 in his last 12 games at Amalie Arena. He is 5-1-0 lifetime against Anaheim. … Kucherov’s assist on Point’s extended his points streak at home to 18 games. 

            GETTING SHELLED

            The Ducks, who entered the game allowing an NHL-high 39.5 shots against per game, saw Dostal face 44 shots one day after John Gibson faced 55 in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Florida Panthers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817818,Montembeault makes 37 saves as Canadiens stun Devils 5-2,"NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The way Sam Montembeault was playing in goal against the red-hot New Jersey Devils, the Montreal Canadiens certainly didn't look like one of the NHL's weaker teams.

            Montembeault stopped three breakaways and made 37 saves as the Canadiens stunned the Devils 5-2 on Tuesday night, snapping New Jersey's six-game home winning streak.

            “I felt good. I was seeing the puck well,” Montembeault said. “We blocked a lot of shots to help me out. The guys came up with big blocks, but I remember giving up two breakaway goals on my blocker side against Carolina and I worked on that a lot in the last few practices so I’m happy to get the stops tonight.”











            Defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic and Nick Suzuki scored in a 1:13 span in the second period to put Montreal ahead. Justin Barron, Rem Pitlick and Mike Matheson also scored for the Canadiens (24-29-4).

            The Canadiens, 15th in the 16-team Eastern Conference standings, had lost their last two games by a combined 11-3 score.

            “It’s definitely rewarding for a coach to see instant improvement and the buy-in,” coach Martin St. Louis said. ”I always say I think as coaches you’re trying to convince them to do things a certain way and when they do it and get rewarded I think it’s a lot easier to convince them through the success we’re having. It’s a buy-in and we have that.""

            Jesper Bratt and Dawson Mercer scored for New Jersey, which lost for only the third time in 18 games (13-3-2). Vitek Vanecek had 13 saves in losing for the sixth time (24-6-3).

            Devils defenseman Damon Severson wasn't sure if the team took Montreal lightly.

            “It was just we didn’t have it on the gas right from the start,” he said. ""So we like to say we didn’t take it for granted, but maybe we did. And they're still a really good hockey team. So it’s the NHL. You’re going to play good players, good teams every night. And they took advantage of us tonight.”

            Montembeault was the difference, stoning Brendon Smith, Miles Wood and Mercer on breakaways while making outstanding stops on Ondrej Palat an Bratt in close, the latter when he was looking the wrong way and the shot hit off his pad.

            Kovavcevic snapped a 1-all tie at 2:29 of the second period when he beat Vanecek from between the circles on a nice setup by Jesse Ylonen. It was his second goal of the season and first since Dec. 6.

            Suzuki, who also had an assist, stretched the lead to two goals with a shot to the corner on an odd-man rush after a New Jersey turnover in the offensive zone.

            “I can’t say enough good things about Sam,” Kovacevic said. “He’s been great for us all year and tonight he showed us again whey we really have to thank him on a lot of those breakaways ... I was out there for a few of them and he has my back. So I appreciated that.”

            Pitlick made it 4-1, capping a rush up the ice early in the third period. After Mercer scored on a power play to cut the lead to 4-2, Matheson scored into an empty net with 3:47 to go to ice the game.

            NOTES: The Devils recalled G Akira Schmid from Utica (AHL) on Tuesday. He served as the backup because Mackenzie Blackwood tweaked in his lower body earlier in the day. Ruff said he will know more about the goaltender's status on Wednesday ... Mercer has goals in a career-high four straight games. Matheson finished with a goal and an assist and Christian Dvorek had two assists. Ruff said the Devils are dealing with some illness and players need more rest so he gave the team off Wednesday. ..

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817819,Alexander leads No. 7 Maryland women to rout of No. 6 Iowa,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Brinae Alexander and Lavender Briggs were starters in the Southeastern Conference before transferring in the offseason to shore up a depleted Maryland team, and they've mostly come off the bench for the Terps.

            Against the potent offense of Caitlin Clark and Iowa, Alexander and Briggs showed how deep — and dangerous — coach Brenda Frese's team can be.

            Alexander scored a season-high 24 points and matched a career best with six 3-pointers, Briggs added a season-high 19 points while bottling up Clark, and No. 7 Maryland handed No. 6 Iowa its worst loss of the season, 96-68 on Tuesday night.











            “Really proud of those two,” Frese said. “When you look at our bench points, and the 43 bench points came from those two, it absolutely was the X-factor. It's the reason why we dominated this game.”

            The Hawkeyes' loss clinched the Big Ten regular-season title for No. 2 Indiana, which visits Iowa on Sunday in the regular-season finale for both teams.

            Shyanne Sellers had 17 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists for the Terrapins (23-5, 14-3 Big Ten), who held Iowa — the nation's top-scoring and best-shooting team — to season worsts in points and field-goal percentage (34.8%).

            Briggs was the primary defender on Clark, who had 18 points, her second lowest-scoring game of the season. Gabbie Marshall made five 3s and scored 15 points for the Hawkeyes (22-6, 14-3).

            “We really tried to take Caitlin out of the game. We played pressure for 40 minutes. I was chasing her around all over the court, picking her up full court,” Briggs said. “It was really just my focus to force her to the right because she likes to do everything going left.”

            Maryland has won five straight since falling 96-82 at Iowa on Feb. 2, a game that featured 42 points by Clark.

            “They denied the heck out of her, right?” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “They face-guarded her the whole time, so that was great. They did a really good job of that. That was really the best we've seen all year.”

            Alexander and Briggs, both reserves, were so dominant that Maryland didn't need much from leading scorer Diamond Miller, who picked up her second foul early in the second quarter and played only 8 minutes in the first half. 

            “I wanted to choke her, although I would never do that. I love Diamond,” Frese said. “I was waiting to see if we were going to get her back in and in that second quarter, her teammates just took over.”

            Maryland took control with a 22-2 run in the second, a burst that included three 3s by Alexander, and led by as many as 30 points in the fourth.

            “Once I started felling it, I got hot, the basket just felt so open, like anything I threw up was going to go in,” Alexander said.

            Miller came on strong late and finished with 16 points.

            The Terrapins held the Hawkeyes to 30.3% shooting overall and 20% (4 of 20) from 3-point range in the first half, including an airball by Clark that the Maryland student section taunted her about for the rest of the game. She didn’t make another 3 until the fourth quarter. Maryland also made Monika Czinano a nonfactor, holding her to four points.

            Maryland shot 47.9% overall and 53.8% (14 of 26) from 3-point range.

            BIG PICTURE

            Clark has never won at Xfinity Center, where she made a career best nine 3-pointers as a freshman two years ago.

            The Terps have won 10 of 11 overall and would finish second in the league if Indiana wins on Sunday. Maryland improved to 11-5 all-time against Iowa and 6-0 at home. The Terps are 11-2 at home this season and haven't lost in College Park since Nebraska beat them on Dec. 4.

            VETERANS RETURNING

            Clark, a junior who turned 21 in January, is not eligible for the WNBA draft until next year under the league's age requirement. Two key members of her supporting cast, Marshall and Kate Martin, announced this week they would return to play their fifth seasons for the Hawkeyes.

Gabbie Marshall made five 3s and scored 15 points for the Hawkeyes (22-6, 14-3).“We really tried to take Caitlin out of the game. We played pressure for 40 minutes. I was chasing her around all over the court, picking her up full court,” Briggs said. “It was really just my focus to force her to the right because she likes to do everything going left.”Maryland has won five straight since falling 96-82 at Iowa on Feb. 2, a game that featured 42 points by Clark.“They denied the heck out of her, right?” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said. “They face-guarded her the whole time, so that was great. They did a really good job of that. That was really the best we've seen all year.”Alexander and Briggs, both reserves, were so dominant that Maryland didn't need much from leading scorer Diamond Miller, who picked up her second foul early in the second quarter and played only 8 minutes in the first half.“I wanted to choke her, although I would never do that. I love Diamond,” Frese said. “I was waiting to see if we were going to get her back in and in that second quarter, her teammates just took over.”Maryland took control with a 22-2 run in the second, a burst that included three 3s by Alexander, and led by as many as 30 points in the fourth.“Once I started felling it, I got hot, the basket just felt so open, like anything I threw up was going to go in,” Alexander said.Miller came on strong late and finished with 16 points.The Terrapins held the Hawkeyes to 30.3% shooting overall and 20% (4 of 20) from 3-point range in the first half, including an airball by Clark that the Maryland student section taunted her about for the rest of the game. She didn’t make another 3 until the fourth quarter. Maryland also made Monika Czinano a nonfactor, holding her to four points.Maryland shot 47.9% overall and 53.8% (14 of 26) from 3-point range.BIG PICTUREClark has never won at Xfinity Center, where she made a career best nine 3-pointers as a freshman two years ago.The Terps have won 10 of 11 overall and would finish second in the league if Indiana wins on Sunday. Maryland improved to 11-5 all-time against Iowa and 6-0 at home. The Terps are 11-2 at home this season and haven't lost in College Park since Nebraska beat them on Dec. 4.VETERANS RETURNINGClark, a junior who turned 21 in January, is not eligible for the WNBA draft until next year under the league's age requirement. Two key members of her supporting cast, Marshall and Kate Martin, announced this week they would return to play their fifth seasons for the Hawkeyes.UP NEXTIowa: Hosts No. 2 Indiana on Sunday.Maryland: At No. 16 Ohio State on Friday night.___Follow Ben Nuckols at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/02/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817825,"Svechnikov ends drought with 2 goals, Hurricanes beat Blues","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Even as the only All-Star Game participant for the Carolina Hurricanes earlier this month, Andrei Svechnikov hadn’t produced star-like numbers lately.

            That changed in a hurry Tuesday night when Svechnikov scored twice in the first eight minutes to break a 19-game goal drought and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the St. Louis Blues 4-1.

            “I wasn’t worried,” Svechnikov said. “I know what kind of player I am. It just didn’t come for me. I was pretty happy it did (come in this game).”











            Sebastian Aho had a second-period goal, Seth Jarvis added a goal and two assists and Brent Burns had two assists. Svechnikov also had an assist as the Hurricanes won their fourth game in a row and for the 11th time in their last 12.

            Frederik Andersen stopped 35 shots for his fifth consecutive victory.

            “It has been a while for me,” Svechnikov said. “You score, it gives you a little bit confidence and you just try to create even more chances. That’s what I was doing.”

            Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said he wasn’t concerned about Svechnikov’s recent statistics.

            “He has been really good this year,” Brind’Amour said. “Even this last however many games he went without scoring, he was impactful pretty much every night and help making the team better. That’s really the main thing.”

            Justin Faulk scored for St. Louis. The Blues lost their third in a row and haven’t won a road game since Jan. 8. They’ve dropped five straight away from home.

            Jordan Binnington made 33 saves.

            “I thought we battled,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. “We got to score a couple more goals.”

            With the Carolina organization still basking in the glow of Saturday night’s Stadium Series game when about 57,000 fans watched a 4-1 win over the Washington Capitals at nearby Carter-Finley Stadium, the Hurricanes didn’t allow there to be a gap in the momentum.

            “You’re so amped up from the weekend,” Jarvis said. “It was definitely a fun week, but coming back here, the crowd is still loud as ever and fun to play in front of.”

            Brind’Amour said he expected challenges in building energy after the weekend.

            “I thought we were OK, and that was probably the best I was going to hope for,” he said. “I didn’t think we had a huge letdown at all. That was probably the thing I was most happy about.”

            Svechnikov scored 1:26 into the game. That ended what had been the longest goal drought in the winger’s 338-game NHL career. 

            “That was a rip,” Jarvis said of the shot. “So anytime he starts a game off like that, you know it’s going to be a good night.”

            Svechnikov’s second goal came at 7:57, converting a rebound of a Jarvis attempt.

            Faulk, a former Carolina defenseman, scored at 3:59 of the second period and threatened again later in the period.

            Then Aho’s goal at 16:36 of the second restored the two-goal cushion. It was his team-leading 25th goal this season, giving him 12 in the last 13 games.

            WELCOME BACK

            Defenseman Marco Scandella of the Blues played in his first game of the season. It was his 700th NHL game. 

            Scandella took a spot held by Jake Neighbours, who went on injured reserve Monday with an upper-body injury.

(AP) — Even as the only All-Star Game participant for the Carolina Hurricanes earlier this month, Andrei Svechnikov hadn’t produced star-like numbers lately.That changed in a hurry Tuesday night when Svechnikov scored twice in the first eight minutes to break a 19-game goal drought and the Carolina Hurricanes beat the St. Louis Blues 4-1.“I wasn’t worried,” Svechnikov said. “I know what kind of player I am. It just didn’t come for me. I was pretty happy it did (come in this game).”Sebastian Aho had a second-period goal, Seth Jarvis added a goal and two assists and Brent Burns had two assists. Svechnikov also had an assist as the Hurricanes won their fourth game in a row and for the 11th time in their last 12.Frederik Andersen stopped 35 shots for his fifth consecutive victory.“It has been a while for me,” Svechnikov said. “You score, it gives you a little bit confidence and you just try to create even more chances. That’s what I was doing.”Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said he wasn’t concerned about Svechnikov’s recent statistics.“He has been really good this year,” Brind’Amour said. “Even this last however many games he went without scoring, he was impactful pretty much every night and help making the team better. That’s really the main thing.”Justin Faulk scored for St. Louis. The Blues lost their third in a row and haven’t won a road game since Jan. 8. They’ve dropped five straight away from home.Jordan Binnington made 33 saves.“I thought we battled,” Blues coach Craig Berube said. “We got to score a couple more goals.”With the Carolina organization still basking in the glow of Saturday night’s Stadium Series game when about 57,000 fans watched a 4-1 win over the Washington Capitals at nearby Carter-Finley Stadium, the Hurricanes didn’t allow there to be a gap in the momentum.“You’re so amped up from the weekend,” Jarvis said. “It was definitely a fun week, but coming back here, the crowd is still loud as ever and fun to play in front of.”Brind’Amour said he expected challenges in building energy after the weekend.“I thought we were OK, and that was probably the best I was going to hope for,” he said. “I didn’t think we had a huge letdown at all. That was probably the thing I was most happy about.”Svechnikov scored 1:26 into the game. That ended what had been the longest goal drought in the winger’s 338-game NHL career.“That was a rip,” Jarvis said of the shot. “So anytime he starts a game off like that, you know it’s going to be a good night.”Svechnikov’s second goal came at 7:57, converting a rebound of a Jarvis attempt.Faulk, a former Carolina defenseman, scored at 3:59 of the second period and threatened again later in the period.Then Aho’s goal at 16:36 of the second restored the two-goal cushion. It was his team-leading 25th goal this season, giving him 12 in the last 13 games.WELCOME BACKDefenseman Marco Scandella of the Blues played in his first game of the season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817826,Taylor has 25 as No. 25 A&M downs No. 11 Tennessee 68-63,"COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — Early in Tuesday night’s game, someone on Tennessee’s bench reminded Texas A&M’s Wade Taylor IV of what happened the last time these teams met last season in the Southeastern Conference tournament title game.

            “One of the dudes on the bench said: ‘thanks for the ring last year in the tournament,’” Taylor said. “And that just kind of stuck with me throughout the game.”

            Taylor made sure the result would be different this time around, scoring 25 points, including four free throws down the stretch, and No. 25 Texas A&M extended its winning streak to six games with a 68-63 victory over No. 11 Tennessee. 











            “I thought that the fight and the togetherness and the spirit that they competed with … was as good as I’ve ever seen,"" coach Buzz Williams said. 

            The Aggies (21-7, 13-2) are off to their best start since joining the SEC in the 2012-13 season. 

            It’s the fourth loss in five games for the Volunteers (20-8, 9-6), with their only win in this stretch coming in a 68-59 victory over then-No. 1 Alabama on Wednesday. 

            Julius Marble made two free throws with 46 seconds left to push Texas A&M’s lead to 64-61. 

            A 3-point attempt by Olivier Nkamhoua bounced off the rim with 33 seconds remaining and the Aggies knocked the ball out of bounds to give the Volunteers the ball back.

            Zakai Zeigler made a layup to cut the lead to 1 with 25 seconds left. 

            Santiago Vescovi stole the inbounds pass after a timeout by A&M, but Taylor grabbed it right back before being fouled. He made both free throws to make it 66-63 with 17 seconds remaining. 

            Zeigler shot an air ball on his 3-point attempt after that and Taylor was fouled again and he made two more free throws to secure the win. 

            Marble was asked about the big plays the Aggies made in crunch time. 

            “It starts in practice,” he said. “The coaching staff prepares us for situations like this where we’ve got to get a stop. We practice that all the time so we were pretty poised in those situations.” 

            Vescovi and Zeigler had 14 points each for Tennessee. 

            “Overall I know our guys are disappointed. … We put ourselves into position to win, we just didn’t close it out at the end,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said. 

            Marble added 21 points and nine rebounds for the Aggies, who haven't lost since Jan. 21. 

            A free throw by Marble extended Texas A&M’s lead to four points with about three minutes left. But Zeigler got a steal and finished with a 3 on the other end to get Tennessee within 62-61 with less than two minutes to go to set up the wild finish. 

            The Aggies were down by 1 early in the second half before using a 10-0 run, with the help of two turnovers, to take a 50-41 lead with 12 minutes to go. 

            Dexter Dennis made four points in that stretch and Marble had four points, including a dunk. 

            The Volunteers got their first points in more than 3 ½ minutes after that when Vescovi made a 3-pointer to cut the lead to 50-44.

            Texas A&M led by 6 midway through the second half before Nkamhoua made a 3-pointer to start an 8-3 run that cut the lead to 57-56 with seven minutes remaining. 

            AT THE LINE

            The Aggies made 28 of 34 free throws while Tennessee had just 14 attempts, making 10. 

            Barnes was disappointed in his team's fouling overall, but particularly upset with the two times his players fouled the Aggies while they were attempting 3-pointers, which led to five points. 

            “We just can't do that,” Barnes said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817827,New Zealand hikes key interest rate to 4.75% despite cyclone,"CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point Wednesday to 4.75% as it continues trying to wrestle down inflation. 

            The increase, which can raise the borrowing costs for consumers on everything from credit cards to mortgages, comes despite the economic pain that a devastating cyclone is already inflicting on many people. The bank said that over time, the cyclone rebuild will only add to inflationary pressures.

            Cyclone Gabrielle hit New Zealand last week, killing 11 people and causing billions of dollars in damage to homes and infrastructure.











            Reserve Bank Governor Adrian Orr said the committee that makes interest rate decisions agreed the rate needed to increase to ensure that inflation returned to the bank's target of around 2% from its current level of 7.2%.

            Orr said that while there were some early signs price pressures are easing, core inflation remained too high and employment was at its maximum sustainable level, with the unemployment rate at a low 3.4%. 

            “Cyclone Gabrielle and other recent severe weather events have had a devastating effect on the lives of many New Zealanders,” Orr said. “It is too early to accurately assess the monetary policy implications of these weather events, given that the scale of destruction and economic disruption are only now becoming evident.”

            Orr said the committee believes that the disaster is likely to increase prices for some goods over the coming weeks, while having a negative impact on economic activity and exports. He noted that the government had yet to determine the scale and timing of its economic response to the cyclone.

            The 0.5% rate rise comes after a record 0.75% hike in November. At 4.75%, the official cash rate is at the highest level it has been since early 2009, soon after the global financial crisis.

            The rate increase was in line with market expectations, and the currency was little changed, with 1 New Zealand dollar trading at about US$0.62.

            New Zealand's key interest rate is now similar to the U.S. rate of 4.5% to 4.75% but is higher than in many other developed nations including neighboring Australia, where the rate is 3.35%.CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point Wednesday to 4.75% as it continues trying to wrestle down inflation.The increase, which can raise the borrowing costs for consumers on everything from credit cards to mortgages, comes despite the economic pain that a devastating cyclone is already inflicting on many people.

            McDavid also assisted on Leon Draisaitl’s tying goal early in the third, with McDavid picking up his 800th point and Draisaitl his 700th on the play.

            Playing in his 545th game, McDavid became the fifth-fastest player in NHL history to hit the mark, behind Wayne Gretzky (352 games), Mario Lemieux (410), Mike Bossy (525), and Peter Stastny (531).











            McDavid gave the Oilers the lead with 7:21 left when his pass deflected in off Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim. McDavid then scored a short-handed goal into an empty net with 2:25 remaining.

            McDavid leads the NHL in goals and points with 105.

            Playing his third game in four nights since being acquired from St. Louis, O’Reilly scored 37 seconds apart in the opening period and the Maple Leafs led 4-0 on goals in a span of 8:18.

            O’Reilly added two assists and sealed the win with the first five-point outing of his career by scoring into an empty net with 1:10 remaining — and after the Sabres scored three times to cut Toronto’s lead to 5-3.

            The Red Wings won for the sixth time in seven games, moving ahead of the Capitals in the Eastern Conference wild-card race and taking another step to ending their six-year playoff drought. Washington lost a fifth in a row in regulation — its longest stretch without a point since January 2014, the last time the team missed the postseason.

            Detroit kept rolling despite Dylan Larkin getting ejected 12:43 in for cross-checking T.J. Oshie in the face. Larkin, a pending free agent and the Red Wings’ captain, had been their best player during this run with seven goals and six assists in six games since the NHL All-Star break.

            No Larkin, no problem, with Hagg scoring for the first time since Oct. 25, 2021 — two teams ago — and Suter getting one goal short-handed in the first period and another at even strength in the third. Ville Husso made 26 saves.

            Washington’s only goal came on a major penalty to Larkin, when Tom Wilson redirected a shot from Erik Gustafsson past Husso. Alex Ovechkin missed a fourth consecutive game for the death of his father.

Animal control staff arrived on the scene and used a blowgun to fire a tranquilizer dart to sedate the animal, take it ashore, and notify the owner to retrieve it.Staff member uses blow gun to fire tranquilizer dart at Guaiguai. (Miaoli County Animal Care and Health Office)The Miaoli County Animal Care and Health Office received a notification from Xihu Township officials on Monday afternoon that a capybara had been spotted in a canal of the Longdong River, a tributary of the Xihu River. Because the native habitat of capybaras is tropical, there were concerns that low temperatures on Monday could harm the animal and a request was placed by local officials to have animal control staff retrieve the creature.However, because capybaras frequent the water, after animal control staff arrived, they had difficulty trying to grab Guaiguai. They then decided to use a tranquilizer dart to calm the animal before taking it to the bank of the tributary.Guaiguai struck with tranquilizer dart. (Miaoli County Animal Care and Health Office)The staff members first took Guaiguai back to the Animal Care and Health Office before contacting the owner. The owner said Guaiguai had been raised by humans and that he is featured at the farm.Because Guaiguai managed to escape from his enclosure, animal control officials admonished the farm operator to fulfill his responsibility as the pet's owner and strengthen the security of the animal's enclosure.Guaiguai lies on the ground after staff retrieve it from river. (Miaoli County Animal Care and Health Office)According to the Animal Care and Health Office, the capybara is an exotic animal that originates from South America and is considered the largest living rodent in the world. Because of their mild temperament, cute appearance, and the Japanese anime show ""Kapibarasank,"" capybaras have become a popular attraction at Taiwan's leisure farms.",2023/02/22,1578,Environment

            Bridges, who led Charlotte in scoring last season, has not played this season while under an NBA investigation.











            
                He pleaded no contest three months ago in Los Angeles to a felony count of injuring a child’s parent, agreeing to do so in exchange for three years probation and no jail time. Bridges also has to complete 52 weeks of parenting classes, 52 weeks of domestic violence counseling and 100 hours of community service as part of the agreement. The charges stemmed from accusations that he assaulted his girlfriend in front of their two children in June, the Los Angeles County district attorney said.

            Bridges may face disciplinary action from the league. 

            The restricted free agent spent his first four NBA seasons with the Hornets and was set to cash in on averaging 20.2 points, seven rebounds and 3.8 assists — all career highs — until his future with the team and in the league was put in doubt.

            Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak, earlier this month, offered little in the way of the team’s plans with Bridges moving forward

            “The NBA is conducting an investigation and I don’t know when that is going to end,” Kupchak said. “When it ends, we’ll have more information and we’ll go from there. I’ll leave it up to you to decide what kind of impact that had on our team this year.” 

            Bridges, who is from Flint, Michigan, averaged 17 points over two seasons with the Spartans before entering the NBA in 2018.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817855,New addition O'Reilly sparks Leafs in 6-3 win over Sabres,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Without the benefit of taking part in his first formal practice in the five days since being traded to Toronto, center Ryan O’Reilly has found instant chemistry with his new Maple Leafs linemates.

            O’Reilly scored twice on Toronto’s first two shots on net and added an empty-net goal to cap a career-best five-point outing in a 6-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night.

            “Yeah, it’s been crazy, though, I think a lot of adrenaline, too,” said O’Reilly, after playing his third game with Toronto since being acquired in a trade with St. Louis on Friday. 











            “It’s just still a little surreal putting on this sweater and being here with this team. I’ve still got to pinch myself at times. But, it’s very exciting,” he added. “I still haven’t had a full practice with the team yet, which is kind of weird. So kind of nice to get a feel for that.”

            O’Reilly scored 37 seconds apart in an opening period the Maple Leafs led 4-0 on goals scored in a span of 8:18. And after Buffalo surged by scoring three times to cut the lead to 5-3 on Jeff Skinner’s goal with 3:31 remaining, O’Reilly sealed the win when his shot dribbled into the net with 1:10 left.

            O’Reilly’s new linemates got in on the fun, with captain John Tavares scoring and adding three assists, and Mitchell Marner setting up five goals. Marner's five assists tied a franchise record for most in a road game, shared by Pep Kelly, Babe Pratt and Borje Salming.

            Michael Bunting and William Nylander also scored in a game played before a large contingent of “Go, Leafs! Go!”-chanting, blue-and-white clad fans who made the trip across the border.

            Ilya Samsonov, who didn’t face his first shot until halfway through the first period, finished with 29 saves. 

            Alex Tuch, with the 100th goal of his career, and Jack Quinn also scored for Buffalo.

            Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen allowed four goals on 10 shots before being yanked after getting beaten on the short side by Bunting 12:09 in. Struggling in his bid to win a three-way goalie competition, Luukonen has allowed 19 goals in dropping to 1-3-1 in his last five starts. He was replaced by Craig Anderson, who allowed one goal on 18 shots. 

            “We got to forget about this one. Yup, we can’t play like that in the first 10 minutes,” said Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, who was also bothered by seeing so many Maple Leafs fans celebrating O’Reilly’s third goal by littering the ice with hats.

            O’Reilly’s offensive outburst came in a homecoming for the two-way center, who spent two seasons playing for the Sabres before being traded to St. Louis in July 2018.

            The playoff MVP for the 2019 Stanley Cup-winning Blues opened the scoring 3:51 in by snapping in Marner’s centering pass into the open left side of the net. Set up by Marner again, O’Reilly broke in alone and backhanded a shot, beating Luukkonen on the short side 37 seconds later.

            Tavares then made it 3-0 at 7:14 by converting a loose puck after a shot by Marner from the right circle was blocked in front.

            “They were just at their best from the start,” Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said of a newly formed second line that features Tavares shifting to wing with O’Reilly taking over at center. “I thought that line, our team in general, our team game in that first period, that’s as dominant as we’ve been all season long, so it’s tremendous to see.”

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Without the benefit of taking part in his first formal practice in the five days since being traded to Toronto, center Ryan O’Reilly has found instant chemistry with his new Maple Leafs linemates.O’Reilly scored twice on Toronto’s first two shots on net and added an empty-net goal to cap a career-best five-point outing in a 6-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night.“Yeah, it’s been crazy, though, I think a lot of adrenaline, too,” said O’Reilly, after playing his third game with Toronto since being acquired in a trade with St. Louis on Friday.“It’s just still a little surreal putting on this sweater and being here with this team. I’ve still got to pinch myself at times. But, it’s very exciting,” he added. “I still haven’t had a full practice with the team yet, which is kind of weird. So kind of nice to get a feel for that.”O’Reilly scored 37 seconds apart in an opening period the Maple Leafs led 4-0 on goals scored in a span of 8:18. And after Buffalo surged by scoring three times to cut the lead to 5-3 on Jeff Skinner’s goal with 3:31 remaining, O’Reilly sealed the win when his shot dribbled into the net with 1:10 left.O’Reilly’s new linemates got in on the fun, with captain John Tavares scoring and adding three assists, and Mitchell Marner setting up five goals. Marner's five assists tied a franchise record for most in a road game, shared by Pep Kelly, Babe Pratt and Borje Salming.Michael Bunting and William Nylander also scored in a game played before a large contingent of “Go, Leafs! Go!”-chanting, blue-and-white clad fans who made the trip across the border.Ilya Samsonov, who didn’t face his first shot until halfway through the first period, finished with 29 saves.Alex Tuch, with the 100th goal of his career, and Jack Quinn also scored for Buffalo.Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen allowed four goals on 10 shots before being yanked after getting beaten on the short side by Bunting 12:09 in. Struggling in his bid to win a three-way goalie competition, Luukonen has allowed 19 goals in dropping to 1-3-1 in his last five starts. He was replaced by Craig Anderson, who allowed one goal on 18 shots.“We got to forget about this one. Yup, we can’t play like that in the first 10 minutes,” said Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, who was also bothered by seeing so many Maple Leafs fans celebrating O’Reilly’s third goal by littering the ice with hats.O’Reilly’s offensive outburst came in a homecoming for the two-way center, who spent two seasons playing for the Sabres before being traded to St. Louis in July 2018.The playoff MVP for the 2019 Stanley Cup-winning Blues opened the scoring 3:51 in by snapping in Marner’s centering pass into the open left side of the net. Set up by Marner again, O’Reilly broke in alone and backhanded a shot, beating Luukkonen on the short side 37 seconds later.Tavares then made it 3-0 at 7:14 by converting a loose puck after a shot by Marner from the right circle was blocked in front.“They were just at their best from the start,” Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe said of a newly formed second line that features Tavares shifting to wing with O’Reilly taking over at center. “I thought that line, our team in general, our team game in that first period, that’s as dominant as we’ve been all season long, so it’s tremendous to see.”UP NEXTMaple Leafs: Host the Minnesota Wild on Friday before departing for five-game trip.Sabres: Travel to play Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817898,"Hartman, Gustavsson lead Wild to 2-1 win against Kings","ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Ryan Hartman scored twice and Filip Gustavsson made 33 saves as the Minnesota Wild beat the Los Angeles Kings 2-1 on Tuesday night.

            Gustavsson, who started the day second in the NHL in goals-against average (2.16) and tied for second in save percentage (92.6%), was a winner for the fourth time in five games as Minnesota won its third straight. The Wild ended a seven-game homestand with points in five of the games.

            Hartman’s goal 13 seconds into the second period was the 100th of his career. He has three goals in two games, a good omen with Minnesota clinging to a playoff spot. The Wild are tied with idle Colorado for third place in the Central Division with 67 points. 











            “Gust has been unbelievable,” Minnesota defenseman Jake Middleton said. “I don’t know if we can talk about him enough and then even Hartzy today, it was kind of that slow game where the neutral zone was clogged and we scored on our opportunities and fortunately Harts, he had two of them.”

            Pheonix Copley made 18 saves for Los Angeles, which had won seven of nine. Anze Kopitar scored with 20.5 seconds remaining for the Kings in the opener of a four-game trip.

            “We’re leaving here without any points, but I thought we played a pretty good game,” Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said. “We played hard. We created a number of chances. I’m sure their goaltender was probably the first star. We just got to find a way to convert, and some nights it doesn’t go your way.”

            Two of the top-seven teams in the NHL on the power play went a combined 0 for 4 with the man advantage.

            Minnesota appeared to take an early advantage when rookie Adam Beckman seemingly scored his first NHL goal midway through the first. But McLellan challenged the play for offsides. Hartman’s skate was just over the line before the puck and the goal was waved off.

            Hartman, who has had a tough season after scoring a career-high 34 goals last season, capitalized with his first of the game off the opening faceoff of the second. He added his second of the game and ninth of the season with 4:48 remaining.

            Hartman, who was a mainstay on the top line with Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello last season, was reinstalled as the top center earlier this month. He lost his spot on the top line early in the season, ended up missing 21 games with an upper-body injury, and was a healthy scratch at one point due to his penchant for taking penalties.

            “I’m getting a lot more odd-man rushes than earlier in the year,” Hartman said. “We’re getting opportunities to score and shooting opportunities from good areas. So, that wasn’t really the case before.”

            SURPRISE SENSATION

            Gustavsson has taken over as Minnesota’s top netminder with Marc-Andre Fleury struggling. Acquired from Ottawa for former starter Cam Talbot, Gustavsson made his sixth start in eight games.

            After being given the lead by Hartman early in the second, the Swede held steady as Los Angeles outshot the Wild 14-4 in the period.

            “A win is a win,” Gustavsson said of losing the shutout. “I would have been a little more nervous if that was minute and a half left in the game. It was, like, only 12 seconds left. We’re fine. We got the win. We got the two points. That’s the most important thing.”

            The Kings had scored at least five goals in four straight games.

            “We got some good O-zone time,” Kopitar said. “We just couldn’t get it to go. Their goalie played good ... give them credit with where credit is due.”

Anze Kopitar scored with 20.5 seconds remaining for the Kings in the opener of a four-game trip.“We’re leaving here without any points, but I thought we played a pretty good game,” Los Angeles coach Todd McLellan said. “We played hard. We created a number of chances. I’m sure their goaltender was probably the first star. We just got to find a way to convert, and some nights it doesn’t go your way.”Two of the top-seven teams in the NHL on the power play went a combined 0 for 4 with the man advantage.Minnesota appeared to take an early advantage when rookie Adam Beckman seemingly scored his first NHL goal midway through the first. But McLellan challenged the play for offsides. Hartman’s skate was just over the line before the puck and the goal was waved off.Hartman, who has had a tough season after scoring a career-high 34 goals last season, capitalized with his first of the game off the opening faceoff of the second. He added his second of the game and ninth of the season with 4:48 remaining.Hartman, who was a mainstay on the top line with Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello last season, was reinstalled as the top center earlier this month. He lost his spot on the top line early in the season, ended up missing 21 games with an upper-body injury, and was a healthy scratch at one point due to his penchant for taking penalties.“I’m getting a lot more odd-man rushes than earlier in the year,” Hartman said. “We’re getting opportunities to score and shooting opportunities from good areas. So, that wasn’t really the case before.”SURPRISE SENSATIONGustavsson has taken over as Minnesota’s top netminder with Marc-Andre Fleury struggling. Acquired from Ottawa for former starter Cam Talbot, Gustavsson made his sixth start in eight games.After being given the lead by Hartman early in the second, the Swede held steady as Los Angeles outshot the Wild 14-4 in the period.“A win is a win,” Gustavsson said of losing the shutout. “I would have been a little more nervous if that was minute and a half left in the game. It was, like, only 12 seconds left. We’re fine. We got the win. We got the two points. That’s the most important thing.”The Kings had scored at least five goals in four straight games.“We got some good O-zone time,” Kopitar said. “We just couldn’t get it to go. Their goalie played good ... give them credit with where credit is due.”UP NEXTKings: Play at New Jersey on Thursday.Wild: Play at Columbus on Thursday.___More AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817912,"Hunter, Rice pace No. 8 Texas past No. 23 Iowa State 72-54","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A flurry of first-half 3-pointers had No. 8 Texas off and running to stay on top of the Big 12. 

            And with three games left in the regular season, the Longhorns can see what's coming: a chance to win a Big 12 championship that has eluded the program since 2008.

            Sir'Jabari Rice and Tyrese Hunter each scored 15 points and the Longhorns quickly raced away from No. 23 Iowa State for a 72-54 win Tuesday night. The victory kept the Longhorns (22-6, 11-4) tied with No. 3 Kansas for first place.











            “This was a great team win. We did a great job with our physicality. We guarded really hard tonight,” interim Texas coach Rodney Terry said. “This league is tough, man. Every night, it's an elite level (opponent).” 

            Texas shook off a sluggish start with a 16-0 run keyed by Hunter. The Longhorns made nine 3-pointers in the first half and shot 55% in taking a 19-point lead into halftime.

            The Cyclones (17-10, 8-7), who beat Texas in their first matchup, kept sagging off shooters in the corners and the Longhorns kept the shots swishing.

            The Longhorns led by four before Hunter started a run of six Texas 3-pointers over the final eight minutes of the first half.

            Hunter was the Big 12 freshman of the year last season at Iowa State before transferring to Texas. He led Texas' scoring punch in the early games of the season, but had been in double figures just twice in the previous 10 games. He didn't score in the second half in the earlier matchup this season with his old team. 

            “Tyrese has been working extremely hard. Glad to see he had some positive results,” Terry said.

            Texas cooled off in the second half and went nearly six minutes without a basket before Brock Cunningham made a 3-pointer. But Iowa State did little to cut its deficit, making just two baskets in the same span.

            Cunningham scored eight of Texas' first 10 points of the half to keep the Longhorns comfortably in control. Hunter's 3 from the right corner put Texas ahead by 20 midway through the period.

            The Longhorns needed that cushion. Texas scored only 16 points and eight turnovers over the first 15 minutes of the second half. Iowa State closed within 13 before Timmy Allen's breakaway dunk and a 3-pointer from Rice all but closed out the win.

            Osun Ossunniyi scored 12 points to lead Iowa State.

            HOME TURF

            Texas has been almost perfect in the Moody Center, the school's new campus arena that replaced the 45-year-old Erwin Center a half-mile away. Texas is 16-1 at Moody, the only loss coming against Kansas State on a night the Longhorns surrendered 116 points. Texas plays Baylor and TCU on the road before hosting Kansas on March 4.

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa State: The Cyclones' defense has been dependable all season and once again held an opponent under their season scoring average. But 11 Iowa State first half turnovers against just 10 baskets ignited Texas' fast start. Texas turned those miscues into 21 points in the half. 

            “Their pressure was terrific in that first half,"" Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “It got away from us quick.” 

            Texas: The Longhorns' deep backcourt got some of its best minutes yet this season from heralded but little-used freshman Arterio Morris. One of the top recruits in the country, Morris has struggled for playing time but poured in eight points in his first seven minutes of the first half on 3-of-3 shooting with a pair of 3-pointers. 

            “He’s had the best attitude the last couple of weeks, the ups and downs, some games not playing. He’s learning his niche at this level,” Cunningham said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817913,"Matt Duchene scores in shootout, Predators beat Canucks 5-4","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Matt Duchene scored the only goal in the shootout as the Nashville Predators held off the Vancouver Canucks 5-4 on Tuesday night. 

            Vancouver tied it twice when trailing by two goals, the last with two goals about 50 seconds apart in the final 1:06 of regulation. Conor Garland made it a one-goal game, and Andrei Kuzmenko tied it with his second goal of the night with 15.4 seconds left.

            Duchene beat goalie Collin Delia as Nashville's second shooter, and he improved to 4 of 5 in shootouts this season. Goalie Juuse Saros stopped Kuzmenko, J.T. Miller and Elias Petterson for the win. 











            “When you get to four, you’ve got to be able to close out the game,” Nashville coach John Hynes said. “They had some breaks. They did a good job, too. I think on the six-on-five, we had multiple shot blocks, couldn’t get the clear on it. Guys were exhausted. They wound up making a good play.” 

            Cole Smith, Philip Tomasino, Nino Niederreiter and Mikael Granlund each had a goal for Nashville, winners of two of its last three. The Predators also took the season series at 2-0 — both in shootouts — with one game left in Vancouver on March 6. 

            “There’s a lot of areas we got to be better,"" Niederreiter said. “But we found a way to win the game, which is all that matters right now.”

            Quinn Hughes had two assists, and Sheldon Dries also had a goal for Vancouver, which has lost four of five. Pettersson had an assist in his 300th career game.

            Miller said he thought the Canucks outplayed Nashville much of the game. 

            “Once you get past the end of regulation, it’s kind of a crapshoot from that point,” Miller said. 

            Smith put Nashville up 1-0 at 4:38 of the first period, tapping the puck in from the side of the net. Tomasino made it 2-0 on the power play at 7:57 of the second with his first goal since being called up to replace Filip Forsberg, out with an upper-body injury since Feb. 11. 

            
                Kuzmenko beat Saros over his glove at 12:47 of the second on the breakaway off a turnover by Nashville defenseman Mattias Ekholm for his third straight game with a goal. Kuzmenko extended his points streak to four games. 

            Vancouver tied it at 2 when Dries tapped in a puck Saros thought he had stopped before the net came off the pegs with 22 seconds left in the second. Nashville retook the lead 12 seconds later as Niederreiter got his 16th on a backhander past Delia. 

            Granlund provided what appeared to be the game-winner with a backhander at the left side of the net at 7:44 of the third before Vancouver's final push.

            INJURY ALERT

            Predators center Ryan Johansen was helped to the locker room late in the second after Hughes' skate appeared to clip the back of his right leg. Johansen left the arena on crutches with his right foot in a boot, putting no weight on that leg. 

            “It didn’t look good,” Hynes said. “I know that he got cut.”

            PROTECTING SCHENN

            The Canucks made defenseman Luke Schenn a healthy scratch, sending him back to Vancouver in advance of the March 3 trade deadline. 

            “It’s the world we live in right now, in that trade deadline world,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “I talked to Luke today. Guy’s a great pro. I was talking to J.T. about this, around the trade deadline, a lot of weird things happen. Other teams are going through the same thing.”

            HALL OF FAME SURPRISE

            Former Nashville captain Mike Fisher was surprised during the first intermission with the announcement he will be inducted into the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in July.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817914,"No. 10 Marquette survives wild finish, beats No. 19 Bluejays","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — No. 10 Marquette took a huge step toward its first Big East championship in a decade, surviving a wild finish against 19th-ranked Creighton on Tuesday night to pick up its biggest road win of the season.

            Tyler Kolek’s short jump shot gave the Golden Eagles the lead with 29 seconds left, and they left a sold-out and hostile CHI Health Center with a 73-71 victory after squandering the 10-point lead they held in the middle of the second half.

            Marquette (22-6, 14-3) is going for its first Big East title since sharing it in 2012-13. The Golden Eagles have three regular-season games left, all against opponents in eighth place or lower in the conference. They have a 1 1/2-game lead over Providence and two-game lead over Creighton and Xavier.











            “In terms of where we are in the standings, our motto is there is no finish line,” Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. “We want to get better over the course of the next week and we want to play our best as we move to the postseason.”

            Marquette, the second-highest scoring team in the league, turned to its defense. The Golden Eagles forced nine turnovers in the second half, and 15 for the game, and held Creighton (18-10, 12-5) to 42% shooting over the last 20 minutes.

            Oso Ighodaro limited Creighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner to just five shots, though Creighton's 7-footer still had 12 points.

            “We knew we had to defend better,” Smart said. “We got 11 deflections in the first 4-5 minutes of the second half. They have too many weapons and too good a system. First half they had too much comfort. They were getting where they wanted to go. Our guys made things more challenging on them in the second half.”

            Kam Jones, who finished with 19 points, and Ighodaro accounted for all the scoring during a 13-0 run that put Marquette up 63-53 with eight minutes left.

            But Kalkbrenner and Ryan Nembhard led the Bluejays back and Baylor Scheierman tied it with a driving layup with 1:19 left.

            It was 69-all when Kolek scored the go-ahead basket, moving into the lane and floating a left-handed shot over Kalkbrenner.

            After Trey Alexander missed a 3-pointer, Jones made two free throws to put Marquette up 73-69. Kalkbrenner scored on the other end to pull the Bluejays within two points with 1.9 seconds left.

            Marquette appeared to turn over the ball on the inbounds pass and Kalkbrenner laid it in, but the basket was wiped out because Nembhard was called for a foul while defending Jones on the play.

            Jones missed his two free throws and Scheierman, who led the Bluejays with 18 points, was well short with a shot from beyond half court.

            Kolek and Jones embraced as the buzzer sounded, and Jones raised his arms as the Golden Eagles began celebrating.

            The last foul call against Nembhard led to a number of Creighton fans behind the Marquette bench to engage with players and staff, and the public address announcer admonished fans for throwing items onto the court.

            “We don't act that way,"" Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “Getting upset with a call, that's my job. But we (Creighton fans) don't do that. That's not what we're about. It's disappointing that it happened and I don't ever want it to happen again. I hope that message gets to the people that let their emotions get the best of them because that can't happen.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Marquette: The Golden Eagles were picked ninth in the Big East in the preseason and are now closing in on their first regular-season title since it shared the championship in 2012-13.

            Creighton: The Bluejays looked to be in control late in the first half and led 40-32 at half. But they committed six turnovers in the first six minutes of the second half, setting the stage for Marquette's comeback.

(AP) — No. 10 Marquette took a huge step toward its first Big East championship in a decade, surviving a wild finish against 19th-ranked Creighton on Tuesday night to pick up its biggest road win of the season.Tyler Kolek’s short jump shot gave the Golden Eagles the lead with 29 seconds left, and they left a sold-out and hostile CHI Health Center with a 73-71 victory after squandering the 10-point lead they held in the middle of the second half.Marquette (22-6, 14-3) is going for its first Big East title since sharing it in 2012-13. The Golden Eagles have three regular-season games left, all against opponents in eighth place or lower in the conference. They have a 1 1/2-game lead over Providence and two-game lead over Creighton and Xavier.“In terms of where we are in the standings, our motto is there is no finish line,” Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. “We want to get better over the course of the next week and we want to play our best as we move to the postseason.”Marquette, the second-highest scoring team in the league, turned to its defense. The Golden Eagles forced nine turnovers in the second half, and 15 for the game, and held Creighton (18-10, 12-5) to 42% shooting over the last 20 minutes.Oso Ighodaro limited Creighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner to just five shots, though Creighton's 7-footer still had 12 points.“We knew we had to defend better,” Smart said. “We got 11 deflections in the first 4-5 minutes of the second half. They have too many weapons and too good a system. First half they had too much comfort. They were getting where they wanted to go. Our guys made things more challenging on them in the second half.”Kam Jones, who finished with 19 points, and Ighodaro accounted for all the scoring during a 13-0 run that put Marquette up 63-53 with eight minutes left.But Kalkbrenner and Ryan Nembhard led the Bluejays back and Baylor Scheierman tied it with a driving layup with 1:19 left.It was 69-all when Kolek scored the go-ahead basket, moving into the lane and floating a left-handed shot over Kalkbrenner.After Trey Alexander missed a 3-pointer, Jones made two free throws to put Marquette up 73-69.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817917,G-20 finance chiefs to tackle global economic threats,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — Top financial leaders from the Group of 20 leading economies are gathering in the south Indian technology hub of Bengaluru this week to tackle myriad challenges to global growth and stability, including stubbornly high inflation and surging debt. 

            
                India is hosting the G-20 financial conclave for the first time in 20 years. Later in the year it will convene its first summit of G-20 economies. The meetings offer the world’s second most populous country a chance to showcase its ascent as an economic power and its status as a champion of developing nations. 

            This week’s gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors takes place just a year after Russia invaded Ukraine, setting off a cascade of shocks to the world economy, chief among them decades-high inflation. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is expected to address the global economic impacts of the war while at the G-20 meetings. 











            India is among the countries treading lightly between the Western nations and Russia, eager to claim more global sway but wary of becoming embroiled in antagonisms as its economy benefits from purchases of discounted Russian crude oil. 

            “India has a growing leadership role globally,"" Information Minister Anurag Thakur, said Wednesday, reiterating Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's stance that “today’s era is not of war. Dialogues and discussions are the only way forward.” 

            As host of more than 200 G-20 meetings in 28 cities leading up to the summit in November, Modi is expected to use that role to burnish India's stature as a leader in fighting climate change and to act as a bridge between the interests of industrialized nations and developing ones.

            “We don’t have the resources that developed countries have but within minimum resources we have also achieved a lot in sectors such as space and renewable energies such as green hydrogen,” Thakur said. 

            It's an urgent priority, given the growing importance of emerging economies to global growth: the International Monetary Fund estimates that India and China alone will contribute more than half of global economic growth this year, with other Asian countries contributing another quarter of that expansion with annual growth rates of 6% to 7%.

            India's economy is forecast to expand at a 6.1% annual rate this year after growing 6.8% last year, the IMF said in a report issued Monday. 

            “The tough conditions at the macroeconomic level have somewhat eased but inflation rates are still high. In this situation coordination among major economies is vital,” Ajay Seth, a senior Finance Ministry official, told reporters Tuesday in Bengaluru. 

            Bengaluru is India’s start-up and technology powerhouse. First recognized as an outsourcing hub, it's now known for its entrepreneurs and information technology companies. But the city is plagued by poor planning. Last year, it experienced extreme flooding, partly due to global warming, that caused an estimated $30 million in damage. 

            Improving urban infrastructure will figure in this week's talks, the first of four G-20 finance minister meetings due to take place this year in India. 

            The G-20 includes the world’s largest economies and has a rolling presidency. Last year, Indonesia was host and next year Brazil will take over, followed by South Africa in 2025. 

            In countries like India, it's seen as a counterbalance to gatherings of wealthier economies such as the Group of Seven.

            At the meetings in Bengaluru, officials will discuss a range of issues related to climate finance, seeking consensus on regulating digital currencies, global tax issues and other financial priorities. 

            Yellen and other officials have indicated they will also be discussing risks of heavy debt burdens for many countries after costly efforts to cushion the worst impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those woes have deepened as countries' import bills surged due to sustained higher prices for food, oil and fertilizers and weakening currencies. 

            
                Yellen visited Zambia in January, in part to discuss the African country's $6 billion debt to China, its biggest creditor. Zambia became the site of Africa’s first coronavirus pandemic-era sovereign nation to default when it failed to make a $42.5 million bond payment in November 2020.

            But a slew of other countries have seen their finances deteriorate in the past year, including India's neighbor Sri Lanka and others in Asia. 

            “Several countries are facing huge debt problems. Finding lasting solutions for them will feature prominently in the discussions,” said Seth, the Finance Ministry official. 

            A senior Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview Yellen's travel plans, said she intends to urge fellow G-20 countries to reduce carbon emissions and invest more in developing renewable energy, infrastructure and agriculture. 

            At a U.N. climate conference last November, India — currently the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases — proposed a phaseout of all fossil fuels and repeatedly emphasized the need to revamp global climate finance.

            Those longstanding G-20 priorities, which also include building stronger public health systems, expanding use of sustainable energy and helping countries improve productivity often tend to be overshadowed by immediate concerns such as stalling global growth, debt crises and conflicts like the war in Ukraine. 

            Shocks from the war and from the pandemic have amplified disruptions to energy supplies, shipping and food security, complicating efforts to stabilize the world economy after the upheavals of the pandemic.

            Another priority in Bengaluru will be coordination on monetary policy as central banks assess whether to keep raising interest rates or to dial back on efforts to cool inflation.

The president obtained a master of law degree from the Cornell in 1980.Reacting to the reports, a MOFA spokesman said that arranging for government leaders to travel overseas was one of the ministry’s core tasks, but that if there were concrete plans for a visit, the Presidential Office and MOFA would make an official announcement.Late President Lee Teng-hui (李登輝), widely regarded as Tsai’s political mentor, graduated from Cornell in 1968 and spoke there in June 1995. The visit was seen as a diplomatic breakthrough, but also as one of the catalysts for Chinese missile tests the following year, per CNA.Since being elected in 2016, Tsai has made stopovers in the U.S. on her way to and from official diplomatic allies in the Caribbean and Latin America.",2023/02/22,1249,Politics

            Russia is now the world's most heavily sanctioned country, according to U.S. officials. The ruble did in fact take a temporary dive and has been slipping again in recent months. But as the war nears its one-year mark, it's clear the sanctions didn't pack the instantaneous punch that many had hoped.

            The ruble trades around the same 75-per-dollar rate seen in the weeks before the war, though Russia is using capital controls to prop up the currency. And while Russia's economy did shrink 2.2% in 2022, that was far short of predictions of 15% or more that Biden administration officials had showcased. This year, its economy is projected to outperform the U.K.'s, growing 0.3% while the U.K. faces a 0.6% contraction, according to the International Monetary Fund. 











            The West's export controls and financial sanctions appear, instead, to be gradually eroding Russia’s industrial capacity, even as its oil and other energy exports last year enabled it to keep funding a catastrophic war.

            Large American multinationals like McDonald's and General Electric fled the country, and some of the country's richest citizens are forbidden from traveling to the U.S. But if Muscovites can't get a latte at Starbucks, there's an imitation waiting for them at the knockoff Stars Coffee as Russia has adapted. 

            U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo stressed in an interview that the Western sanctions are only one “tool as part of a larger strategy"" and that the U.S. continues to adjust its sanctions to outmaneuver Russia's own shifts in strategy. 

            “You look at the exodus, the brain drain from Russia,” Adeyemo said. ""The Russian economy is far smaller, far more closed and will look more like Venezuela, North Korea and Iran than like a major G-7 economy.”

            Still, a December Congressional Research Service report drew an underwhelming conclusion from all the economic parrying, stating that “the sanctions have created challenges for Russia but to date, have not delivered the economic ‘knockout’ that many predicted.”

            A closer look at what's been done so far and what lies ahead:

            WHAT'S BEEN SANCTIONED, BY WHOM AND WHY?

            Biden last year called the West's sanctions “a new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might.”

            The sanctions, imposed largely through executive orders, are meant to punish Russia and block its access to the international financial systems and bank accounts that it needs to finance its war effort. Export controls also limit its access to computer chips and other products needed to equip a modern military.

            Simultaneously, the U.S. and its allies devoted billions to provide Ukraine with weapons, munitions and other military aid and direct financial assistance. 

            More than 30 countries, including the U.S., EU nations, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and others — representing more than half the world’s economy — are part of the unprecedented effort. They've imposed price caps on Russian oil and diesel, frozen Russian Central Bank funds and restricted access to SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.

            Beyond targeting key institutions and economic sectors, the West has directly sanctioned roughly 2,000 Russian firms, government officials, oligarchs and their families. The sanctions are depriving them of access to their American bank accounts and financial markets, preventing them from doing business with Americans and traveling to the U.S, and more.

            Unlike the countrywide sanctions on Iran and North Korea, the restrictions placed on Russia target specific industry sectors, firms and individuals. This approach was designed to keep Russian oil and natural gas flowing, in order to limit disruptions to the wider global economy. But energy exports also enabled Russia to replenish its finances and stave off a sharp decline.

            An industrialized country of its size — the 11th largest economy in the world in 2021 — has never faced such financial pressure. Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said that “policy making of this kind is always a shot in dark.""

            “You're looking for hits on the Russian economy, it doesn’t happen overnight,” Fried said, noting that military aid was far more important as Ukrainian troops have performed better in repelling Russian attacks than U.S. and European officials expected.

            DIFFERENCES EMERGE 

            While there has largely been unity among Western governments on the necessity to punish Russia, there have been differences in the lengths to which countries are willing to go.

            European and Asian countries are more dependent on Russian oil and natural gas than was the U.S. That made a ban on Russian exports hard for the alliance and forced compromises that took months to forge.

            Ultimately, the countries in December settled on a $60 price cap, which some critics said came too late and was too high to significantly hurt Russia.

            Experts and administration officials have said putting greater downward pressure on the sale of oil and other energy products from Russia would make sanctions more effective. 

            To Marshall Billingslea, assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing in the Trump administration, the sanctions were far from bulletproof and easy for the Kremlin to elude.

            “Russia has shot holes through the administration's sanctions,"" Billingslea said.

            Tom Firestone, a sanctions attorney, said more time is needed for the sanctions to take their course.

            “Anyone who expects massive sanctions on Monday, and on Tuesday the Russian regime would fall is not reasonable,"" Firestone said. ""It’s a large economy that has large reserves. It has a large variety of trading partners. What we're seeing and what the government is saying is they're on track and it's seriously curtailed Russia's ability to operate.""

            Russia is also seeking deeper ties with countries that have refused to join the sanctions effort. Its exports to Brazil, China, India and Turkey have increased by at least 50% since the war started compared with the previous year, according to the Congressional Research Service. 

            HOW RUSSIA HAS BEEN IMPACTED

            “Russia is a different country today than it was just a year ago,” says Adeyemo, “and they’ve given up almost 30 years of progress in terms of their economic policy in the course of one year.”

            But on a day-to-day consumer level, it’s a mixed picture. 

            Shopping centers have a lot of shuttered shops, but Russian entrepreneurs are helping fill the gaps. One Russian startup has created a reasonably convincing analogue of McDonald’s.

            Some sectors have suffered greatly from sanctions and the departure of foreign companies. 

            Russia's automobile sector, for example, has taken a particular hit. A market analysis from the Association of European Businesses, representing European companies in Russia, said sales of new cars in January were 63% lower than a year earlier. 

            Still, Russia continues to export some lumber, aluminum and other goods to the U.S., based on the need for the products in America.

            Russian goods imported to the U.S. totaled $14.5 billion in 2022. That’s less than 1% of all U.S. imports and about half the $30 billion imported from Russia in 2021.

            The Justice Department last year formed a task force to target the ill-gotten proceeds of Russian oligarchs, whom the U.S. sees as enabling Moscow’s war against Ukraine. 

            As part of that effort, the department has seized two luxury yachts — in Fiji and Spain — alleged to belong to oligarchs. Prosecutors have also brought criminal charges against oligarchs accused of sanctions violations, including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close Putin associate. Deripaska remains at large.

            WHAT COMES NEXT

            The U.S. government is not finished by any means. Biden, in Poland on Tuesday, promised “we’re going to announce more sanctions this week together with our partners.”

            The Treasury Department is expected to impose another large round of sanctions on Russia with a likely focus in 2023 on logistics and manufacturing firms.

            Daniel Pickard, a sanctions attorney, said it's a safe bet that sanctions ""will continue to be used with greater frequency with this administration and other administrations. It allows the president to take action without having to consult Congress and can be adjusted with regard to changing events on the ground.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817942,Biden shores up Western allies as Putin digs in on Ukraine,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — President Joe Biden closed out his wartime visit to Europe on Wednesday, working to shore up partnerships with allies on NATO's perilous eastern flank — even as Russia's Vladimir Putin was drawing closer to China for help as his invasion of Ukraine neared the one-year mark.

            Biden’s meeting with leaders of the Bucharest Nine nations in Warsaw came at the conclusion of a whirlwind, four-day visit to Ukraine and Poland meant to reassure allies that U.S. support in fending off Russia isn’t at risk of waning. 

            In dramatic counterpoint, Putin on Wednesday played host in Moscow to Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party’s most senior foreign policy official, as U.S. intelligence warned that Beijing is considering supplying arms and ammunition to the worn-down Russian military. 











            The flexing of alliances was a fresh indication that both sides are digging in for prolonged conflict in Ukraine with the fighting expected to intensify with the arrival of spring.

            Biden's trip had provided yet another moment of telling counterprogramming on Tuesday when he delivered a ringing speech on Western unity in Warsaw, a day after he swept into Kyiv unannounced for a visit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As Biden spoke in Poland, Putin announced that Russia was suspending its participation in the last remaining U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control treaty. 

            Biden called that departure “a big mistake.” The exit is expected to have an immediate impact on U.S. awareness of Russian nuclear activities. However, the pact — known as New START — was already on life support following Moscow’s cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that each side has accused the other of violating.

            Biden met Wednesday with leaders of the Bucharest Nine, the nations in the easternmost parts of the NATO alliance that came together in response to Putin’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. They include Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia.

            “You’re the frontlines of our collective defense,” Biden told them. “And you know, better than anyone, what’s at stake in this conflict. Not just for Ukraine, but for the freedom of democracies throughout Europe and around the world.”

            These countries have worried that Putin could move to take military action against them next if he’s successful in Ukraine. Biden responded to that anxiety by pledging that NATO’s mutual defense pact is “sacred” and that “we will defend literally every inch of NATO.”

            NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who attended the meeting, pointed to past Russian actions in Georgia and Ukraine and said, “We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression.” 

            It was unclear how the U.S. and its allies aimed to do that, other than by continuing to arm Ukraine’s military with the Western and aging Soviet arms that have allowed it retake about half of the territory it lost in the opening days of the war.

            Biden returned to Washington late Wednesday night.

            After the Russian military’s battlefield shortcomings were revealed at the start of the conflict, Putin, too, has been seeking rearmament, drawing on Iran and North Korea for assistance — and potentially China.

            Administration officials don’t yet have an indication that China has decided to move forward on sending Moscow weaponry, but Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week it would be a “serious problem” should Beijing follow through.

            Throughout the conflict, China has cautiously weighed the pros and cons of directly aiding Russia. But a year into the war, Beijing now seems increasingly concerned that Russia — one of its closest allies — is teetering toward something that could approximate a loss in Ukraine.

            The U.S. and its allies have threatened secondary sanctions on countries that support the Russian war effort. But there was no consensus this week on potentially steeper sanctions for China, which could have global economic implications, should it decide to rearm Putin’s forces.

            One European official described the intelligence regarding Chinese consideration of supplying Russia with weapons as “unambiguous.” Western officials do not know whether the possibility is currently being studied only by China’s military or some other single branch of the government, or by the Chinese government as a whole, the official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the West’s intelligence on the matter.

            Western intelligence indicates that the kind of supplies China is considering giving Russia would be aimed at backfilling stocks of weapons that Russia was losing, or wasting, on the battlefield in Ukraine, the European official said.

            From the intelligence signals thus far, Western officials don’t believe China’s supply of weapons to Russia would be sufficient to change the trajectory of the year-old war.

            But Chinese cooperation on military supplies for Russia’s war in Ukraine would be a significant sign of Beijing's current appetite for risk-taking when it comes to allying with Russia in a stand against the West. 

            Li Mingjiang, an associate professor in international relations at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said at an event hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace last week that Beijing was weighing the value of creating “a situation in which the U.S. will have to now deal with really two potential enemies and challengers and that will help divert a bit of America's attention and resources from the Asia Pacific region.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817943,"Haiti, Portugal qualify for Women's World Cup for 1st time","AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Haiti and Portugal qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup finals for the first time after winning playoff matches Wednesday in New Zealand.

            Carole Costa scored a 94th-minute clincher in Portugal's 2-1 win over the Cameroon “Lionesses” who have reached the round of 16 at the last two World Cups.

            Haiti beat Chile 2-1 earlier Wednesday in an historic match it hopes will bring joy and “a breath of fresh air” to a strife-torn homeland.











            Melchie Dumornay scored twice to ensure 55th-ranked Haiti will return to the southern hemisphere in July to play in Group D of the Women's World Cup alongside England, China and Denmark.

            Haiti and Portugal have taken two of the last three places at the World Cup which will be decided at the this 10-team inter-continental playoff in New Zealand. Paraguay will play Panama Thursday for the last place in the 32-team tournament which will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand in July and August.

            Haiti's Dumornay recently was signed by seven-time Champions League winners Lyon and showed why with two pieces of slick finishing. She won the race to a through ball from Roselord Borgella in first-half stoppage time to give Haiti a 1-0 lead at the break.

            Dumornay then seemed to make the game safe in the eighth of 11 minutes added on by the referee after Chile captain Christiane Endler had saved Nerilia Mondesir's attempt from the penalty spot.

            But Maria Jose Rojas scored in the 11th minute of stoppage time to keep Chile’s hopes alive and make the final moments nerve-wracking for Haiti’s Les Grenadiers, who held on to claim an historic victory.

            Players shed tears of joy when the final whistle blew, reflecting on success attained in the most difficult of circumstances.

            Haiti’s Les Grenadiers had to win two matches in New Zealand to qualify for their first World Cup. They beat Senegal 4-0 in their opening match and then beat 38th-ranked Chile for their first ever win over a South American opponent.

            Prior to the tournament midfielder Danielle Etienne told ESPN “there’s a lot of unhappiness in the country and football is the joy.""

            “Being able to qualify to the World Cup would be major,"" she said at the time. ""We want that for the country as a whole, to have a breath of fresh air and kind of step aside from anything going on.”

            While Portugal's win was sealed late it came at the end of a dominant performance. Portugal had 20 shots on goal, most of which were comfortably saved by Cameroon's 16-year-old goalkeeper Cathy Biya who was promoted after Ange Bawou was sent off against Thailand.

            Diana Gomes gave Portugal the lead after 22 minutes and the match seemed to be heading to extra time when Ajara Nchout Njoya equalized for Cameroon in the 89th minute.

            But an Estelle Johnson hand ball was spotted after a VAR check and Costa scored from the penalty spot.

She won the race to a through ball from Roselord Borgella in first-half stoppage time to give Haiti a 1-0 lead at the break.Dumornay then seemed to make the game safe in the eighth of 11 minutes added on by the referee after Chile captain Christiane Endler had saved Nerilia Mondesir's attempt from the penalty spot.But Maria Jose Rojas scored in the 11th minute of stoppage time to keep Chile’s hopes alive and make the final moments nerve-wracking for Haiti’s Les Grenadiers, who held on to claim an historic victory.Players shed tears of joy when the final whistle blew, reflecting on success attained in the most difficult of circumstances.Haiti’s Les Grenadiers had to win two matches in New Zealand to qualify for their first World Cup. They beat Senegal 4-0 in their opening match and then beat 38th-ranked Chile for their first ever win over a South American opponent.Prior to the tournament midfielder Danielle Etienne told ESPN “there’s a lot of unhappiness in the country and football is the joy.""“Being able to qualify to the World Cup would be major,"" she said at the time. ""We want that for the country as a whole, to have a breath of fresh air and kind of step aside from anything going on.”While Portugal's win was sealed late it came at the end of a dominant performance. Portugal had 20 shots on goal, most of which were comfortably saved by Cameroon's 16-year-old goalkeeper Cathy Biya who was promoted after Ange Bawou was sent off against Thailand.Diana Gomes gave Portugal the lead after 22 minutes and the match seemed to be heading to extra time when Ajara Nchout Njoya equalized for Cameroon in the 89th minute.But an Estelle Johnson hand ball was spotted after a VAR check and Costa scored from the penalty spot.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817944,Philippine police hunting killers of New Zealand tourist,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine police search was underway on Wednesday for two motorcycle-riding men who shot and killed a New Zealand man in a brazen street robbery that officials fear could scare foreign tourists away.

            The 34-year-old tourist, Nicholas Peter Stacey, was fatally shot once in the chest while trying to wrest a pistol from one of the two robbers who held him up and his Filipina girlfriend on Sunday in a suburban street in Manila’s Makati financial district, police Maj. Gen. Jonnel Estomo said.

            “We regret to report this incident and extend our sympathy to the bereaved family,” Estomo said in a statement, adding he has ordered the police to “leave no stones unturned until the culprits are brought to jail and are prosecuted.”











            While he described the deadly street robbery as an “isolated incident,” Estomo acknowledged it has the potential to frighten foreign tourists. Police patrols would be beefed up to prevent a recurrence, said Estomo, who heads the Metropolitan Manila police.

            “We know that this incident could spark fear among tourists, who plan to visit our country so we will make sure the slain victim will get justice and demonstrate that the police are always ready to provide service,” Estomo said in a statement.

            The slain victim’s girlfriend, Pamela Gaye Villanoza, told investigators that she and Stacey had just arrived in the capital region from a holiday trip in the western island province of Palawan and were walking to a laundry shop in the early hours after midnight when the suspects approached on a motorcycle.

            One of them alighted and pointed a pistol at the couple while his companion parked the motorcycle a few meters away. Stacey grappled with the armed man and was shot and killed, she said.

            Before fleeing, the gunman, who was wearing a black shirt and red athletic shorts, took the cellphone and wallet of Stacey’s girlfriend, police said.

            Investigators would try to match a slug found in the area and compare it with slugs recovered from other recent crime scenes in the heavily populated metropolis to try to identify the suspects and assess how they operate, police said.

            Stacey’s killing occurred amid high-profile gun attacks on two local politicians that underscore how criminal violence even against officials has persisted despite the government's pledge to combat such violence.

            Gunmen wounded Governor Mamintal Alonto Adiong Jr. of southern Lanao del Sur province and killed four of his bodyguards in an attack on their convoy Friday. Police said Wednesday they had killed one of the suspects in a clash.

            Separately, unidentified men reportedly wearing police uniforms fired guns at the van of northern Aparri town Vice Mayor Rommel Alameda on Sunday, killing him and five companions in northern Nueva Vizcaya province. The suspects remain at large.

            Crimes, decades-long Muslim and communist rebellions, and other security concerns have long hampered tourism in the Philippines, a Southeast Asian archipelago that offers white sand tropical beaches, diving and surfing resorts, heritage towns, rainforests and warm hospitality.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine police search was underway on Wednesday for two motorcycle-riding men who shot and killed a New Zealand man in a brazen street robbery that officials fear could scare foreign tourists away.The 34-year-old tourist, Nicholas Peter Stacey, was fatally shot once in the chest while trying to wrest a pistol from one of the two robbers who held him up and his Filipina girlfriend on Sunday in a suburban street in Manila’s Makati financial district, police Maj.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817945,"Johnson scores in SO, Blackhawks edge Golden Knights 3-2","CHICAGO (AP) — Tyler Johnson scored the lone goal in a shootout to give the Chicago Blackhawks their third straight victory, 3-2 over the Vegas Golden Knights on Tuesday night.

            Johnson beat Laurent Brossoit with a low shot in the third round of the tiebreaker after scoring a power-play goal with 55 seconds left in regulation to for force overtime. 

            “Tyler plays so hard and he does all the right things for us,” Chicago coach Luke Richardson said. ""It was great to see him have that opportunity to tie it up and then have that chance in (the shootout.)











            “It looked like he was going to deke and he just slid it in there.”

            Johnson tied it on a screened shot from the high slot after Vegas defenseman Alex Pietrangelo was penalized for delay of game for lofting the puck over the glass and goalie Petr Mrazek was pulled for an extra attacker.

            Johnson was set up on a cross-ice pass from Patrick Kane.

            “You just kind of dream about those shots,"" Johnson said. ""Those are the ones you want to hit.”

            Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy wasn't happy about the play by Pietrangelo, a steady 15-year veteran.

            “That's on us a little bit, right?"" Cassidy said. “Maybe it's just a little bit of a lower rim (along the glass). Veteran guys, you've just to to manage it better in those situations.”

            Jack Eichel scored his 18th goal and Keegan Kolesar also connected for the Golden Knights, whose five-game winning streak ended. Vegas has points in seven straight game, however (5-0-2) and remained in first place in the competitive Pacific Division.

            Rookie Cole Guttman scored in his second straight game for Chicago, who have 43 points and climbed out of last place in the NHL. Guttman netted his first NHL goal Sunday.

            Kane appeared to score on breakaway as overtime ended, but a video review showed his high shot sailed past Brossoit just after time expired.

            “I think it would have been cooler if Kaner scored that goal,” Johnson said. “I think that would have made it a lot more fun. I thought it was in.""

            Brossoit made 37 saves through overtime in his first start for Vegas this season. The 29-year-old goalie appeared in 24 games for Vegas in 2021-22. 

            “A few jitters in the first period, but I think overall it was a net-positive for how I felt,” Brossoit said. 

            Mrazek blocked 34 shots through overtime and all three in the shootout. 

            The Golden Knights failed to score on their lone power play, extending their dry spell to 24 straight chances dating to Jan. 22, a span of nine games.

            Kolesar opened the scoring 3:26 in, whipping in a shot from the slot after Kane turned the puck over to Nicolas Roy deep in the Chicago zone.

            Guttman broke in behind the Vegas defense and tied it 1 at 12:39 of the first, beating Brossoit between the pads.

            Eichel put Vegas back in front 2-1 at 11:32 of the second period with his third goal in five games. He fired a shot under Mrazek’s blocker from the right circle.

            VEGAS GOALIE MOVES

            Knights goalie Adin Hill is out day-to-day with a lower-body injury after winning four straight starts. He was hurt in a 5-4 victory over Tampa Bay on Saturday.

            Vegas recalled 32-year-old Michael Hutchinson from Henderson of the AHL to back up Brossoit on Tuesday. Knights All-Star goalie Logan Thompson is out week-to-week with a lower body injury, suffered on Feb. 9 at Minnesota.

            KANE COUNTDOWN?

            Kane started and seemed to be soaking in the United Center ambiance as he stood at the blue line and looked up to the crowd during the national anthem.

            Kane, second in points in Blackhawks franchise history, has been the subject of trade rumors. Rebuilding Chicago has only one more home game, on March 2 versus Dallas, before the NHL’s March 3 trade deadline.

            Kane’s eight-year contract is set to run out at the end of the season, but it has no-movement clause and he’d have to consent to a deal before then.

            WORTH NOTING

            The Blackhawks placed F MacKenzie Entwistle (right wrist) on IR retroactive to Feb. 14. Chicago also placed F Reese Johnson in concussion protocol.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817946,Michigan State tops Indiana in 1st home game since shootings,"EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Michigan State coach Tom Izzo gazed into the crowd, tears welling in his eyes, moments before his team played its first home game since a mass shooting on campus killed three students and hospitalized five students.

            “It was one of those moments where I just said, `I’m a lucky guy,'"" Izzo recalled as his voice cracked with emotion. “I said to myself, `I hope we can come through for you.'"" 

            The Spartans did.











            Tyson Walker shook off a slow start to score 23 points and lifted Michigan State to an 80-65 win over No. 17 Indiana on Tuesday night, eight days after a mass shooting ended lives, endangered others and frightened an entire community.

            “It was definitely a emotional,"" Walker said. “Everybody was involved in some way because everybody’s on campus. So, it was definitely good to go out there and play well for everybody.""

            The Spartans (17-10, 9-7 Big Ten) surged into the lead late in the first half after Walker started making 3-pointers following an 0-for-4 start from the field and were ahead by double digits for much of the second half.

            “Izzo's teams play great. They play hard,"" Indiana coach Mike Woodson said. “They force you to play hard. If you don't meet that, you're going to lose.""

            The Hoosiers (19-9, 10-7) relied heavily on Trayce Jackson-Davis, as usual, and he had 19 points, seven rebounds and five assists.

            Michigan State had its previous home game against Minnesota postponed after the shootings and resumed playing Saturday night in a loss to rival Michigan on the road.

            The victims, survivors and first responders from last week’s shootings were recognized with pregame remarks. There was also a moment of silence that was broken by the Michigan State band playing “MSU Shadows,” when Izzo looked left, right, high and low at fans in the stands.

            “I wish I could have ran up to that top row and thank the people that were there,"" Izzo said.

            In the front row of the student section, white shirts were placed on eight seats to save them for the eight students shot on campus. The funeral for the last of the three students killed was earlier Tuesday.

            The Spartans, after the emotional pregame, got off to a sluggish start before turning the game around with 3-pointers, defense and rebounding.

            Michigan State's A.J. Hoggard had three turnovers early in the game, then didn't have another turnover and finished with 22 points and five assists. Joey Hauser and Malik Hall each scored 10 points for the Spartans, who have won three of their last four games.

            Jalen Hood-Schifino scored 16 and Trey Galloway had 11 points for the Hoosiers.

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers, who have lost two of their last three games, may have some work to do to earn an NCAA Tournament bid.

            Michigan State: After collapsing late against Michigan and returning to play at home on an emotional campus, Izzo’s team earned a much-needed win.

            HE SAID IT

            “As the game wore on, they smashed us and I don't like that,"" Woodson said.

            IN THE FACE

            Midway through the second half, Michigan State's Mady Sissoko blocked Malik Reneau's shot and the ball hit Kaleb Banks in the head so hard that he staggered and fell to the court.

            BRIDGES SAYS

            Former Michigan State star Miles Bridges sat behind the team's bench and said he may be back in the NBA soon, returning to play for the Charlotte Hornets.

            “It’s been a long process,” Bridges told The Associated Press at halftime. “I might be back in March.”

            Bridges has not played this season while under an NBA investigation. He pleaded no contest three months ago to a felony count of injuring a child’s parent, agreeing to do so in exchange for three years probation and no jail time.

            INJURY REPORT

            Michigan State's Carson Cooper missed the game after Izzo said the freshman center sprained his ankle during practice on Monday. Indiana senior guard Xavier Johnson is still out with a foot injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817948,Uyghur activist's warning for Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Two prominent Washington-based Uyghur activists held a press conference at Taiwan’s parliament on Tuesday (Feb. 21) in which they warned Taiwan not to compromise with China.Leader of the American NGO “Campaign for Uyghurs” Rushan Abbas and the executive director of the Center for Uyghur studies Abdulhakim Idris addressed a group that included the Deputy Secretary of the Taiwan Parliamentary Human Rights Commission Wu'er Kaixi (吾爾開希) (also of Uyghur descent), legislators, Turkish students, and other activists, reported CM Media.During a Q&A session following the pair's address, Abbas agreed with the audience members' suggestions that Taiwan was a valuable place for Uyghurs to communicate in Mandarin and get help with communications with various organizations. However, Abbas said that there was still limited knowledge of Uyghurs outside of Taipei, something she noticed when attending the 2017 Urban Nomad Film Festival in Tainan and Kaohsiung.Speaking to RTI, Abbas said she wants to warn people that if Taiwan does not mobilize the international community to do something to counter China, Taiwan will end up the same as Xinjiang. “(If it is) the Uyghur people today, (it) will be tomorrow for the Taiwanese, and the Japanese and all these Southeast Asian countries, because they are all in danger,” she said.Abbas said she believes that the experience of Hong Kong in recent years is the same as that of the Uyghur people. “Certainly, what happened in Hong Kong is almost an immediate copy of what the police did to Uyghur women, Uyghur protestors, and Uyghur people,” she said.“They even brought the policeman from (Xinjiang),” said Abbas, presumably referring to the Beijing decision to appoint former head of internal security in Xinjiang to lead the People’s Liberation Army’s garrison in Hong Kong.Idris told the audience gathered at parliament that there were several ways Taiwan could help the Uyghur people protect their cultural heritage. He suggested that Taiwan provide vias or scholarships to Uyghurs to allow them to conduct research related to Uighur ethnicity, history, and culture.Speaking at the event, Kaixi responded to suggestions that the people of Xinjiang should compromise with the Chinese government, asking the crowd; if Xinjiang were to compromise, would the Chinese government compromise also?""Looking at the history of the Chinese Communist Party, they will never give in at all,"" Kaixi said. ""As long as you still have an inch left to yield, they will continue to suppress you.""",2023/02/22,3351,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817970,"Namibian dancers, president welcome Jill Biden to Africa","WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Dancers, drummers and Namibia's president and first lady welcomed U.S. first lady Jill Biden on Wednesday as she opened a five-day, two-country visit to Africa aimed at highlighting the challenges facing women and young people and the food insecurity plaguing the Horn of Africa. 

            After flying all night, the first lady was feted at the airport by members of some of Namibia’s ethnic groups — clad in red, white and blue, or bright pink — who greeted her with singing, dancing, drumming and ululating. The last high-level U.S. official to visit was Vice President Al Gore in 1996, the White House said. 

            The first lady's trip is part of a commitment by President Joe Biden to deepen U.S. engagement with the fast-growing region. The United States has fallen well behind China in investment in sub-Saharan Africa, which has become a key battleground in an increasingly fraught competition between the major powers.











            Jill Biden and Monica Geingos, Namibia's first lady, embraced on the tarmac before Biden greeted U.S and Namibian diplomatic and government officials. The two first met in December, when dozens of African leaders flew to Washington for a summit hosted by President Biden. 

            After leaving the airport, Jill Biden was driven 45 minutes south of Windhoek, the capital, to lay a wreath at Heroes’ Acre, Namibia’s official war memorial. She later met with President Hage Geingob and his wife at the State House, where her arrival was heralded with more singing and dancing.

            It's Jill Biden's sixth time in Africa, but her first trip as first lady. She is following in the footsteps of her recent predecessors, who all made the trip across the Atlantic Ocean in the name of trying to help foster goodwill toward the United States. 

            “We have a lot to accomplish,” she said Tuesday before departing Washington.

            Africa is the fastest-growing and youngest region in the world, according to the White House, which says 1 of every 4 people in the world will be African by 2050. 

            Jill Biden previously visited Africa in 2010, 2011, twice in 2014 and once in 2016, all during her husband's service as U.S. vice president. Two of those trips were with him. 

            This time, she is traveling to Africa without the president, who was wrapping up a trip to Poland to mark Friday's anniversary of Russia's aggression toward Ukraine. She brought along her granddaughter Naomi Biden.

            Patricia Nixon was the first first lady to travel to Africa on her own. She went as President Richard Nixon’s “personal representative” to Liberia, Ghana and the Ivory Coast in 1972. She addressed legislative bodies and met with African leaders about U.S. policy toward the country now known as Zimbabwe, and human rights in South Africa, according to the National First Ladies’ Library.

            What recent first ladies did on their visits to Africa:

            MELANIA TRUMP

            Mrs. Trump visited for the first time in 2018, when she spent five days as first lady stopping in Ghana, Malawi, Kenya and Egypt to promote U.S. developmental aid and education, cradle babies and highlight animal and historic preservation.

            She traveled without President Donald Trump, who had denied making disparaging comments about African countries. 

            She opened the trip at an infant clinic in Ghana. She also learned about Africa's slave past during a tour of Cape Coast Castle, a former slave holding facility on the Ghanaian coast. She spent time inside the cramped dungeon once used to house male slaves and walked through the “Door of No Return,” from which the slaves were shipped to the New World.

            In Malawi, the former model toured indoor and outdoor classrooms, observed lessons and watched students play soccer with U.S.-donated balls. She highlighted elephant preservation at Nairobi National Park in Kenya. She closed the tour in Egypt by touring the pyramids and the Great Sphinx to highlight U.S.-supported preservation efforts there. 

            MICHELLE OBAMA

            
                Mrs. Obama went to South Africa and Botswana on a goodwill mission in the summer of 2011 to promote youth leadership, education and HIV and AIDS awareness.

            The centerpiece of the weeklong trip by America’s first Black first lady was a 30-minute speech at a U.S.-sponsored leadership conference at a church in Soweto township. THe church became a popular refuge during the South African people's fight against apartheid, the now-abolished system of government-imposed segregation.

            She was accompanied by her daughters, Malia and Sasha; her mother, Marian Robinson; and a niece and nephew. Mrs. Obama also took her daughters to visit with former South African President Nelson Mandela at his home.

            Mrs. Obama made a second solo visit to Africa in June 2016, the final year of the Obama administration. In Liberia and Morocco, she promoted her “Let Girls Learn” initiative to encourage developing countries to educate girls.

            She also visited Ghana with President Barack Obama in 2009, his first year in office. 

            LAURA BUSH

            
                Mrs. Bush traveled to Africa five times on her own between 2005 and 2007 during President George W. Bush’s second term, in addition to two trips she took with him.

            Her trips mostly focused on promoting the administration's efforts to combat the spread of HIV, as well as malaria. She also emphasized literacy, drug prevention and national parks. During one stop in South Africa, she praised HIV-positive mothers for working to erase the stigma associated with the disease. She spoke openly with African women about taking control of their sex lives.

            Mrs. Bush also announced millions of dollars in U.S. funding for programs to stem the spread of AIDS and mosquito-borne malaria. In Mozambique, she covered her face with a white mask to help illustrate the benefits of spraying homes with insecticides to combat malaria. She also passed out mosquito nets.

            She was accompanied on these trips by one or both of her twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna.

            HILLARY CLINTON

            
                Hillary Clinton took along her 17-year-old daughter, Chelsea, on her two-week visit in March 1997 to Senegal, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Uganda and Eritrea.

            The first lady opened her journey at Goree Island in Senegal, a hub for the Atlantic slave trade for 300 years. Mrs. Clinton had said she wanted to see the island because of its significance to Black Americans. She discussed violent crime in South Africa, along with the need to improve education for Black people in a country that recently had abolished its apartheid policy of racial segregation.

            Mrs. Clinton returned in 1998 when President Bill Clinton made his first visit to Africa; it was also the first visit to the continent by a U.S. president in 20 years. 

            The White House billed the 12-day tour of Ghana, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal as a way to encourage trade and investment in Africa.WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) — Dancers, drummers and Namibia's president and first lady welcomed U.S. first lady Jill Biden on Wednesday as she opened a five-day, two-country visit to Africa aimed at highlighting the challenges facing women and young people and the food insecurity plaguing the Horn of Africa.After flying all night, the first lady was feted at the airport by members of some of Namibia’s ethnic groups — clad in red, white and blue, or bright pink — who greeted her with singing, dancing, drumming and ululating.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817971,"Oilers star Connor McDavid scores twice, reaches 800 points","EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Connor McDavid reached 800 career points and scored his 43rd and 44th goals in the third period to give the Edmonton Oilers a 4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night.

            McDavid also assisted on Leon Draisaitl’s tying goal early in the third, with McDavid picking up his 800th point and Draisaitl his 700th on the play.

            Playing in his 545th game, McDavid became the fifth-fastest player in NHL history to hit the mark, behind Wayne Gretzky (352 games), Mario Lemieux (410), Mike Bossy (525), and Peter Stastny (531).











            McDavid gave the Oilers the lead with 7:21 left when his pass deflected in off Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim. McDavid then scored a short-handed goal into an empty net with 2:25 remaining.

            “You have to win games without your ‘A’ stuff,” McDavid said. “It’s cliche that good teams find a way to win when they don’t have their stuff and that was tonight. We did just enough to get a win. It’s going to take a lot more than that to win coming down the stretch, but give the boys credit.”

            McDavid leads the NHL in goals and points with 105.

            Draisaitl also had two assists, Tyson Barrie scored and Stuart Skinner made 23 saves. The Oilers snapped a four-game losing streak to improve to 31-19-8.

            Noah Cates and Owen Tippett scored for Philadelphia.

            “I thought the team laid it out there. They did all the things we asked of them, and we played a hard game. We just couldn’t find a way to win,” Flyers coach John Tortorella said. “We were playing the right way. We did all the things to win a hockey game, and we don’t find a way to do it. But I think the group, through this trip, it’s been a long trip, have handled themselves very well.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817972,Nipsey Hussle's killer gets 60 years to life in prison,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A Los Angeles judge on Wednesday sentenced the man convicted of gunning down Nipsey Hussle to 60 years to life in prison after hearing testaments to the immense cost of the killing of the hip-hop star and neighborhood leader, and of the lifetime of mental illness, abuse and struggle of the man who shot him. 

            Superior Court Judge H. Clay Jacke II handed down the sentence to Eric R. Holder Jr., 33, who was found guilty of the 2019 first-degree murder of the 33-year-old Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist outside the clothing store Hussle founded, the Marathon, in the South Los Angeles neighborhood where both men grew up in very similar circumstances. 

            “I am very mindful of what was presented as to Mr. Holder’ mental health,"" Jacke said. ""I am also mindful of the devastation caused to the victims and their families. I believe this sentence balances the two.” 











            After the monthlong trial, jurors in July also convicted Holder of two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter and two counts of assault with a firearm for gunfire that hit two other men at the scene who survived.

            Jacke sentenced Holder to 25 years to life for the murder, 25 more for a firearm sentencing enhancement and 10 for assault with a firearm. He set several other sentencing additions and ordered that others run concurrent. He also gave Holder credit for the nearly four years he has served since the shooting. 

            Holder, dressed in orange jail attire, stared straight ahead throughout the proceedings and did not react when the sentence was read, and spoke only to tell the judge he understood the circumstances when he was asked.

            In an impact statement before the sentence was handed down, Herman “Cowboy” Douglas, a close friend of Hussle who was standing with him when he was killed and testified during the trial, told the judge that the killing was a tremendous loss both for him personally and for the South Los Angeles community where Hussle was a business leader, and an inspiration.

            “Nipsey was my friend, he was like a son, he was like a dad,” said Douglas, who took off his black cowboy hat as he entered the courtroom and wore a sweatshirt with a picture of Hussle on the front. “Our community right now, we lost everything, everything we worked for. One man’s mistake, one man’s action, messed up a whole community.”

            Douglas said Hussle's store and surrounding businesses that he owned and supported have been closed down, and it has meant that “the Homies don’t have nothing to do.” 

            Douglas told the judge, “I don’t care what you give this guy. It ain’t about the time. I just want to know why. The world wants to know why. Why someone would do that?”

            Actor Lauren London, who was Hussle’s partner and the mother of his two young children, did not attend any part of the trial, nor did any of his relatives, and none gave similar impact statements.

            Asking for a lesser sentence of 25 years to life that would allow some chance at release and rehabilitation, Jansen detailed a childhood of physical abuse and poverty for Holder. 

            As he reached adulthood, Jansen said Holder suffered “a terrible descent into mental illness” that led to ""years of torment and struggle” with issues including agonizing auditory hallucinations that resisted all attempts at treatment. 

            He showed photos of a head injury Holder suffered at the hands of other inmates during the trial, saying he has been targeted as Hussle's killer and that his life behind bars is ""going to be brutal. It’s going to be short. He’s already received numerous death threats.” 

            Jansen also read a letter from Holder's father, Eric Holder Sr. apologizing to Hussle's family and to the other victims. 

            “I know there are not enough words that would fill the void, the pain, the deep sorrow that they feel,” the letter read. ""I question myself every day asking if I as a father did everything to help Eric Jr. stabilize his mental health."" 

            
                Hussle, whose legal name is Ermias Asghedom, and Holder had known each other for years growing up as members of the Rollin' 60s in South LA. Both were aspiring rappers. But Holder never found the same success as Hussle, who would become a local hero and a national celebrity.

            A year after his death, he was mourned at a memorial at the arena then known as Staples Center, and celebrated in a performance at the Grammy Awards that included DJ Khaled and John Legend.

            The evidence against Holder was so overwhelming — from eyewitnesses to surveillance cameras from local businesses that captured his arrival, the shooting and his departure — that Jansen conceded during trial that he had shot Hussle, asking jurors to find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. But jurors took just six hours deliberating before returning with the first-degree murder verdict.

            As Holder was taken from the courtroom Wednesday, Douglas sang “Hit the Road Jack” toward him. Jacke shouted “Out!” and deputies led Douglas out.

Jacke shouted “Out!” and deputies led Douglas out.___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817973,"Albanese says Australian nuclear subs benefit US, UK","CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says a deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines will be the nation’s biggest leap in defense capability in its history, adding the United States and Britain also plan to benefit from the partnership.

            A decision will be announced in March on how a fleet of Australian submarines powered with U.S. nuclear technology will be delivered under the AUKUS tripartite pact.

            Options include a next-generation U.S. Virginia-class sub, a British Astute-class or a new hybrid design.











            Critics argue that neither the United States nor Britain has the capacity to start delivering the subs by 2040, while Australia lacks the shipbuilding capability to take a lead role.

            Albanese said Tuesday the technology sharing among the AUKUS partners would bring benefits beyond submarines.

            “Now, this will be the single biggest leap in our defense capability in our history,” Albanese told the National Press Club, referring to Australia’s advance from Australian-built Collins-class diesel-electric submarines that went into service more than 20 years ago.

            “AUKUS is about much more than nuclear submarines or even technological interoperability. AUKUS is about the future. It further formalizes the common values and the shared interests that our three nations have,” Albanese added.

            Albanese said the three governments were focused on how their countries would benefit from spinoffs from the submarine-building cooperation.

            “It’s a focus that recognizes that it’s not a zero-sum game. This is one of those times when one plus one plus one equals more than three because there’s a multiplier effect and a benefit from sharing some of the science and innovation,” Albanese said.

            “All three countries want the sum to be a benefit for all of the three nations,” he added.

            Critics argue Australia’s lack of nuclear expertise will leave it heavily reliant on its nuclear-armed partners. Australia’s only atomic reactor is in the Sydney suburb of Lucas Heights where it produces nuclear isotopes for medical use.

            Unlike Australia’s current homemade fleet, critics argue that Australia might not be able to use its nuclear submarines in circumstances that the United States or Britain disagree with.

            But Albanese said Australia would maintain authority, or sovereignty, to decide how the subs are deployed.

            “Australia will maintain our sovereignty. That’s a decision for Australia as a sovereign nation, just as the United States will maintain its sovereignty and the United Kingdom will maintain its” sovereignty, Albanese said.

            Australia has reassured regional neighbors who fear an arms race that while the Australian subs will be nuclear powered, they will never be nuclear armed.

            Australia currently spends 2.1% of its GDP on defense, above the 2% minimum that former President Donald Trump demanded of U.S. allies.

            Albanese said defense spending would increase in the years ahead.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says a deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines will be the nation’s biggest leap in defense capability in its history, adding the United States and Britain also plan to benefit from the partnership.A decision will be announced in March on how a fleet of Australian submarines powered with U.S. nuclear technology will be delivered under the AUKUS tripartite pact.Options include a next-generation U.S. Virginia-class sub, a British Astute-class or a new hybrid design.Critics argue that neither the United States nor Britain has the capacity to start delivering the subs by 2040, while Australia lacks the shipbuilding capability to take a lead role.Albanese said Tuesday the technology sharing among the AUKUS partners would bring benefits beyond submarines.“Now, this will be the single biggest leap in our defense capability in our history,” Albanese told the National Press Club, referring to Australia’s advance from Australian-built Collins-class diesel-electric submarines that went into service more than 20 years ago.“AUKUS is about much more than nuclear submarines or even technological interoperability.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817975,Supreme Court seems to favor tech giants in terror case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court seemed skeptical Wednesday of a lawsuit trying to hold social media companies responsible for a terrorist attack at a Turkish nightclub that killed 39 people.

            During arguments at the high court several justices underscored that there was no evidence linking Twitter, Facebook and Google directly to the 2017 attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul. The family of a man killed in the attack says the companies aided and abetted the attack because they assisted in the growth of the Islamic State group, which claimed responsibility for the attack . A lower court let the lawsuit go forward.

            What the court does with Wednesday’s case and a related one it heard a day earlier is important, particularly because the companies have been shielded from liability on the internet, allowing them to grow into global giants.











            If the court bars the lawsuit involving the attack in Turkey from going forward it could avoid a major ruling on the companies' legal immunity. That outcome would leave the current system in place, but also leave open the possibility that the justices could take up the issue again in a later case.

            Justice Amy Coney Barrett was among the members of the court who suggested that the suit against the companies lacks the kind of facts required under a federal anti-terrorism law to hold platforms responsible. 

            Barrett suggested that a lawsuit against a company such as Twitter would need to have more, such as direct messages, comment threads or other evidence that the platform was being used to coordinate activities for a terrorist attack, “not just general recruitment or radicalizing people.”

            Justice Neil Gorsuch, participating remotely for a second straight day because of illness, said he was having difficulty with the argument of a lawyer for the family of Nawras Alassaf, who was killed in the nightclub attack. Gorsuch told lawyer Eric Schnapper that he was ""struggling with how your complaint lines up with the three requirements of the statute” that the companies knowingly helped a person commit a terrorist act.

            The justices seemed more willing to accept the arguments of a lawyer for Twitter, Facebook and Google, Seth Waxman. At one point during two and a half hours of arguments, Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Waxman to help her sketch out what an opinion would look like if the court ruled for his clients. “Write it for me,” she said.

            Justice Brett Kavanaugh summarized Waxman's argument this way: “When there’s a legitimate business that provides services on a widely available basis ... it’s not going to be liable under this statute even if it knows bad people use its services for bad things.”

            Seeming to agree with that idea, Justice Samuel Alito suggested that it would be outlandish if telephone companies were held responsible for criminal activity of people using their phones. What if, he said, the phone company “knows that a particular person is -- has a criminal background and is probably engaging in criminal activity and is using the phone to communicate with other members of that person’s gang. Is that aiding and abetting the crimes that they commit?”

            The law the case involves is the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which allows Americans injured by a terrorist attack abroad to sue for money damages in federal court. 

            A decision in the case — Twitter v. Taamneh, 21-1496 — is expected by the end of June before the court recesses for its summer break.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817978,"McCarthy gives Carlson access to 1/6 footage, raising alarms","WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of hours of surveillance footage from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol are being made available to Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson, a stunning level of access granted by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that Democrats swiftly condemned as a “grave” breach of security with potentially far-reaching consequences.

            
                The hard-right political commentator said his team is spending the week at the Capitol poring through the video and preparing to reveal their findings to his viewers. But granting exclusive access to sensitive Jan. 6 security footage to such a deeply partisan figure is a highly unusual move, seen by some critics as essentially outsourcing House oversight to a TV personality who has promoted conspiracy theories about the attack.

            “It’s a shocking development that brings in both political concerns but even more importantly, security concerns,” said Rep. Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., who was a chief counsel during President Donald Trump's first impeachment trial.











            Many critics warn that Capitol security could be endangered if Carlson airs security footage that details how the rioters accessed the building and the routes lawmakers used to flee to safety. And a sharply partisan retelling of the Capitol attack could accelerate a dangerous rewriting of the history of what happened Jan. 6, when Trump encouraged a mob of supporters to head to the Capitol to overturn Joe Biden’s election.

            “It is not lost on anyone that the one person that the speaker decides to give hours and hours of sensitive secret surveillance footage is the person who peddled a bogus documentary trying to debunk responsibility for the Jan. 6 riot from Donald Trump onto others,” Goldman said.

            “Kevin McCarthy has turned over the security of the Capitol to Tucker Carlson and that’s a scary thought,” he added.

            McCarthy’s office declined to confirm the arrangement, first reported by Axios, despite repeated requests for comment.

            Gripping images and videos from the Capitol attack by Trump supporters have been widely circulated by documentarians, news organizations and even the rioters themselves. But officials have held back much of the surveillance video from hundreds of security cameras stationed in and around the Capitol that offer a detailed view of the grisly scene and the brutal beatings of police as they tried to stop the rioters.

            The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack went through a painstaking process to work closely with the U.S. Capitol Police to review and ultimately release approved segments of the surveillance footage as part of its public hearings last year.

            The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, Tom Manger, issued a terse statement when asked about the new release of footage: ""When Congressional Leadership or Congressional Oversight Committees ask for things like this, we must give it to them.”

            House Democrats planned to convene Wednesday for a private caucus call to hear from Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who served as the chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, and others. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries called McCarthy's decision an “egregious security breach” that threatens the safety of those who work at the Capitol.

            ""Unfortunately, the apparent disclosure of sensitive video material is yet another example of the grave threat to the security of the American people represented by the extreme MAGA Republican majority,"" Jeffries, D-N.Y. said in a letter to House colleagues.

            Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the former chairwoman of the House Administration Committee and a member of the committee that investigated Jan. 6, said: “It’s really a road map to people who might want to attack the Capitol again. It would be of huge assistance to them.”

            Carlson, who previously produced a documentary suggesting the federal government used the Capitol attack by Trump’s supporters as a pretext to persecute conservatives, confirmed that his team was reviewing the footage ahead of a possible airing. 

            “We believe we have secured the right to see whatever we want to see,” Carlson, who is the network’s most-watched prime-time host, said on his show Monday night. 

            It's not clear what protocols Carlson and his team are using to view the material, but he said that “access is unfettered.”

            The House committee investigating Jan. 6 underwent an often intense process to review the tens of thousands of hours of footage as it documented its findings.

            Over the nearly two-year probe, the panel, which was disbanded once Republicans took control of the House, created a secure room in their Capitol Hill offices for staff to comb through the more than 14,000 hours of footage. The process took months, according to a person familiar with the investigation who requested anonymity to discuss the private machinations.

            Any clip of footage the committee wanted to use for their series of public hearings or for the final report had to be approved by Capitol Police to avoid any security breaches, the person said. If police had an objection, the committee would engage in negotiations to redact any content that could potentially endanger the force or the mechanisms they use to protect the Capitol and lawmakers. 

            “Throughout our entire review on the committee, we worked with U.S. Capitol Police, one, to get the footage and review it through secure channels, and then we also worked with them again before we released anything,"" said Marcus Childress, who was the panel's investigative counsel and now is in private practice. “The purpose of that was to make sure that we weren’t releasing any sensitive surveillance footage.""

            Anxiety over security is running high after Capitol Police reported an uptick in threats to member safety over the last several years, its highest on Jan. 6, 2021. The number of possible threats against members of Congress rose from about 4,000 in 2017 to more than 9,600 in 2021, then declined last year to 7,501. 

            Key Republicans welcomed McCarthy's decision as part of his commitment to create a more transparent House and engage in oversight, as Republicans launch a far-reaching series of investigations and probes touching many aspects of government.

            “I support Speaker McCarthy's decision,” said Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Administration Committee.

            Hard-right figures cheered the move. “For all of you that doubted we would release the tapes. Here you go!” tweeted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a right-flank firebrand who has become close to McCarthy. 

            Former Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., said if House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughter, the documentary filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, was able to film that day and release her footage, McCarthy should be able to grant Carlson access.

            But others said the two situations are not comparable — countless hours of footage have been released from many sources that captured what happened that deadly day. A mob of Trump supporters battled Capitol Police, in often violent scenes, breaking into the building. Five people died in the riot and its aftermath.

            ""I think we should remember that the Jan. 6 attack happened in broad daylight,"" said Sandeep Prasanna, a former investigative counsel on the Jan. 6 committee now in private practice.

            “My concern is that I don’t see how releasing thousands of hours of footage to one handpicked controversial media figure could ever produce the same factual and careful analysis that the committee produced over that year and a half,” he said.

            Anderson Lee Aldrich also posted an image of a rifle scope trained on a gay pride parade and used a bigoted slur when referring to someone who was gay, Detective Rebecca Joines said. 

            Her testimony came at the start of a hearing that will determine if there’s enough evidence to warrant that Aldrich face hate crime charges, in addition to other charges including murder and attempted murder.











            Aldrich, who identifies as nonbinary and uses the pronouns they and them, administered the obscure website that included what Joines described as a “neo-Nazi white supremacist” shooting training video glorifying mass shootings. 

            The video, which she said was not created by Aldrich and has been posted online by many others, featured attacks on synagogues and mosques in Europe and the 2019 shooting at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Joines said she believes Aldrich was trying to emulate those attacks in the Colorado Springs shooting.

            Investigators also heard from an acquaintance that Aldrich said their mother, Laura Voepel, is nonbinary and forced them to go to LGBTQ clubs, Joines testified during the hearing, which is expected to conclude Thursday.

            Hate crime charges require prosecutors to present evidence of a motive — that Aldrich was driven by bias, either wholly or in part. 

            The defense countered that Aldrich was not anti-LGBTQ, but was high on multiple drugs, was sleep deprived and came from an abusive family. 

            Joines discussed police calls to the apartment that Aldrich and Voepel shared for Voepel’s suicide attempt and overdose. During one call, Aldrich indicated feeling unsafe in the apartment, Joines acknowledged. 

            Joines said that while identification scanning technology showed Aldrich had been to the club at least six times before the shooting, there were no fights or disturbances during those visits, which each lasted just a few minutes. The defense showed a photo that appeared to be a selfie of Aldrich and Voepel smiling at Club Q in August 2021. 

            On the night of the shooting, according to authorities, Aldrich went to the club, left and then returned. Surveillance video showed Aldrich entering the club wearing a red T-shirt and tan ballistic vest while holding an AR-style rifle, with six magazines for the weapon and a pistol visible, police Detective Jason Gasper said. Soon after entering, Aldrich allegedly opened fire indiscriminately.

            The shooting was stopped when Navy information systems technician Thomas James grabbed the barrel of Aldrich’s rifle, burning his hand it was so hot, Detective Ashton Gardner said in the most detailed account provided yet. 

            As panicked patrons fled from the dance floor, James and Aldrich tumbled off a landing and struggled over a handgun. Aldrich fired at least once, shooting James in the ribs, Gardner said.

            After being shot, it is clear from the video that James was tiring, “but he continues to do what he can to subdue the suspect until police arrive,” Gardner testified, noting that James later gave up his spot in an ambulance to someone else who was injured. 

            Army veteran Richard Fierro rushed over to help, grabbing the rifle and throwing it, Gardner said. Fierro then used the handgun to beat Aldrich, telling officers later that he “kept hitting” the suspect until they arrived.

            Aldrich, who wore an orange jumpsuit, shook during the testimony about the people shot and cried while being led out of court for the lunch break. 

            James, who issued a statement days after the attack saying he “simply wanted to save the family that I found,"" did not appear to be in the main courtroom where testimony was presented. Fierro, who sustained scrapes and bruises, sat in the back row. His daughter’s boyfriend was killed in the attack.

            Joines, the detective, said evidence also indicates that Aldrich was considering livestreaming the attack. A hat found in Aldrich’s vehicle had a phone taped to it, and Aldrich recorded four videos using a livestreaming app starting over an approximately two-hour period before the shooting, she said. 

            After the gunfire ended and police arrived, Aldrich tried to blame the shooting on one of the patrons who subdued them while also claiming that the shooter was hiding, Officer Connor Wallick testified. Officers didn’t believe it and shortly afterward confirmed that Aldrich was the shooter, he said.

            Police found several high-capacity magazines at the scene, including a drum-style one that holds 60 rounds and was empty, and others that hold 40 rounds, Gasper said. A state law passed after the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting bans magazines of more than 15 rounds.

            Although Aldrich identifies as nonbinary, someone who is a member of a protected group such as the LGBTQ community can still be charged with a hate crime for targeting peers. Hate crime laws are focused on the victims, not the perpetrator. 

            At Aldrich’s apartment, investigators found gun-making materials, receipts for weapons and a drawing of the club. In Aldrich’s mother’s room, they found round gun range targets with holes in them, Gasper said. Voepel had taken Aldrich to the range. 

            It was also revealed that the rifle and the handgun used in the attack appeared to be ghost guns, or firearms without serial numbers that are homemade and do not require an owner to pass a background check. One part of the handgun did have a serial number, but the overall weapon was likely not purchased whole and appeared to be privately made, Joines said. 

            Defense attorney Joseph Archambault pointed out that it is not illegal to make a gun.

            Questions remain about how the suspect got the guns, but experts say that doesn’t have to be discussed in order to persuade the judge to rule that there’s enough evidence for a trial. 

            Questions were raised early on about whether authorities should have sought a red flag order to stop Aldrich from buying guns after Aldrich was arrested in 2021, when they threatened their grandparents and vowed to become the “next mass killer,” according to law enforcement documents.

            Authorities said two guns seized from Aldrich in that case — a ghost gun pistol and an MM 15 rifle — weren’t returned. That case was dropped, in part because prosecutors couldn’t track down Aldrich’s grandparents and mother to testify, so Aldrich had no legal restrictions on buying guns. 

            Defense attorneys also brought up Aldrich’s mental health for the first time at the hearing, showing photographs of pill bottles for drugs that Aldrich had been prescribed to treat mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and PTSD. But the defense didn’t say if Aldrich had been formally diagnosed with any of those mental illnesses.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817999,US deputy assistant secretary touts education cooperation with Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Deputy Assistant Secretary Camille Dawson, from the U.S. State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, lauded education cooperation between Taiwan and the U.S. as “a great success” during a Taiwan-US Education Initiative briefing on Wednesday (Feb. 22).

            Taiwan has a “free and vibrant education environment, free of coercion or censorship, similar to what we enjoy in the United States,” Dawson said. The deputy assistant secretary attended the third high-level U.S.-Taiwan Education Dialogue earlier Wednesday morning and said the U.S.’ top priority was to deepen cooperation in Mandarin and English language instruction while “safeguarding academic freedom.”

            Dawson said the two sides discussed ways to increase opportunities for U.S. students to study in Taiwan and for Taiwanese teachers and students to go to the U.S. She also said the meeting “explored new areas for growth and the road ahead.""

            Dawson said Taiwan has partnered with multiple U.S. states and is developing K-12 classroom relationships. She announced that the department of state has drafted a letter to the Council of Chief State School Officers that supports cooperation with Taiwan for K-12 Mandarin teaching in the U.S.











            Taiwan and the U.S. both agree that increasing Mandarin and English exchanges and training “will strengthen U.S.-Taiwan people-to-people ties and bring us all closer together.”

            Deputy Minister of Education Liu Meng-qi (劉孟奇) said that Taiwan’s Ministry of Education (MOE) is promoting Mandarin education in the U.S. via the Taiwan Huayu Best study abroad program.

            The program facilitates U.S.-Taiwan university-to-university cooperation in Mandarin education by providing teaching resources and scholarships, he said. There are currently 35 American universities and 17 Taiwanese universities participating in this program.

            The MOE is also supporting Taiwan’s bilingual education policy, Liu said. Taiwan has collaborated with the U.S. Department of State on the Fulbright Taiwan ETA Program, which from 2022-2023 has seen 148 English teaching assistants from the U.S. help English education in Taiwan’s K-12 schools, he added.

            The deputy minister pointed out that the MOE is strengthening governmental education partnerships between Taiwan and the U.S. The ministry has been establishing ties with American states and has already inked 22 MOUs with 20 state governments, he said.

            The MOE is seeking cooperation in joint talent cultivation, STEM, language and teacher exchanges, humanities, finance, and sister school partnerships with U.S. elementary and middle schools, Liu said. He revealed that the ministry is planning to send a delegation comprised of Taiwan university representatives to attend an education cooperation symposium in the U.S. this May.

            The deputy minister pledged that his ministry would do its best to strengthen educational cooperation based on shared values and interests. This will “greatly benefit our younger generation and lay a solid foundation for a strong partnership between Taiwan and the U.S.,” he said.

            Additionally, Dawson and Liu unveiled the new logo for the Taiwan-U.S. Education Initiative. The initiative was launched in 2020 and is intended to expand access to Mandarin and English language instruction while safeguarding academic freedom, according to the American Institute in Taiwan.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Deputy Assistant Secretary Camille Dawson, from the U.S. State Department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, lauded education cooperation between Taiwan and the U.S. as “a great success” during a Taiwan-US Education Initiative briefing on Wednesday (Feb. 22).Taiwan has a “free and vibrant education environment, free of coercion or censorship, similar to what we enjoy in the United States,” Dawson said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818006,Exploring the Metaverse: The Role of Marketing in Shaping the Future of Virtual Worlds,"As technology continues to advance, so does our ability to create and explore virtual worlds. The Metaverse, a term coined by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson in his novel “Snow Crash,” describes a collective virtual shared space that is created by the convergence of physical and virtual reality. It is a concept that has been gaining popularity in recent years, and many experts believe that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we live, work, and play.One key aspect of the Metaverse is the role of marketing in shaping its future. Just like in the real world, marketing plays a crucial role in promoting and creating awareness of virtual products, services, and experiences. Metaverse marketing involves using innovative and immersive techniques to promote virtual brands and experiences within these shared spaces.One example of Metaverse marketing is the use of virtual events and experiences to promote real-world products and services. This can include virtual concerts, product launches, and even fashion shows. By leveraging the unique features of the Metaverse, such as its ability to create immersive experiences, marketers can engage with their target audience in new and exciting ways.Another aspect of Metaverse marketing is the use of virtual influencers. These are digital avatars that are created to represent a brand or product within the Metaverse. They are designed to appeal to the virtual community and can help to create buzz and excitement around virtual products and experiences. The use of virtual influencers is a relatively new concept, but it has already been embraced by many brands and businesses looking to reach a younger and more tech-savvy audience.In addition to promoting products and services, Metaverse marketing also has the potential to create new revenue streams for businesses. For example, virtual real estate is becoming increasingly valuable within the Metaverse. Brands and businesses can create their own virtual spaces, such as storefronts or event spaces, and charge others to use them. This presents an exciting opportunity for businesses to generate revenue in a new and innovative way.As the Metaverse continues to evolve and expand, the role of marketing will become even more important. By leveraging the unique features of this shared virtual space, marketers can create exciting and immersive experiences that capture the attention of their target audience. The potential for growth and innovation within the Metaverse is immense, and those who are able to harness its power will undoubtedly be at the forefront of this new frontier in marketing.",2023/02/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818007,Going Green with Scent: The Science and Art of Plastic-Free Deodorant and Perfume,"The fragrance has been a part of human culture for thousands of years. From ancient Egypt to modern-day perfumery, fragrance has played a significant role in our lives. But what makes a scent so captivating? Is it the chemistry behind the ingredients, the artistry of blending them, or the psychology of how they affect our senses? In this article, we will explore the science and art of fragrance, delving into the chemistry and psychology of perfume to better understand why it has such a powerful impact on us.In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the environmental impact of our daily habits, including the use of plastic products. From straws to shopping bags, many people are making an effort to reduce their plastic consumption and find more eco-friendly alternatives. In the realm of personal care, this has led to a surge in interest in plastic-free deodorant and perfume. But what exactly are these products, and how do they work?Traditional deodorants and antiperspirants often contain aluminum compounds that block sweat glands and prevent perspiration. However, these compounds can also have negative health effects, such as skin irritation and a potential link to breast cancer. Plastic-free deodorants offer a natural alternative, often made with ingredients like baking soda, arrowroot powder, and essential oils. These products work by neutralizing odor-causing bacteria, rather than stopping sweat production altogether.Perfume, on the other hand, is all about the scent. Plastic-free options are typically made with natural essential oils and botanical extracts, rather than synthetic fragrances that can be harmful to both the environment and our health. However, creating a natural perfume can be a delicate art. Essential oils and botanicals can be finicky, and it takes a skilled perfumer to create a balanced and long-lasting fragrance.The zero-waste deodorant market is on the rise as more and more consumers are aware of the effects of plastic pollution and many conventional deodorants are packaged in plastics. Many multinational companies are feeling this consumer pressure and are adapting to customer needs by designing products that meet their needs. A plastic-free deodorant is usually packaged in a fully recyclable cardboard tube or box, in an aluminum tin or tube, or even with a natural cork.Beyond the health benefits, plastic-free deodorant and perfume also offer a more sustainable option. Traditional plastic containers can take hundreds of years to decompose, and many end up in landfills or the ocean. In contrast, plastic-free options often come in biodegradable or reusable packaging, reducing waste and the overall carbon footprint.If you’re interested in trying out plastic-free deodorant or perfume, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, be patient. It may take some time for your body to adjust to the natural ingredients, and you may experience some initial odor or sweat issues. However, these should resolve over time. Second, be mindful of the ingredients. Just because a product is labeled “natural” doesn’t necessarily mean it’s right for you. Finally, do your research. Look for reputable brands that prioritize sustainability and ethical sourcing.In conclusion, plastic-free deodorant and perfume offer a natural, eco-friendly option for personal care. By understanding the science and art behind these products, we can make informed choices and reduce our impact on the planet.",2023/02/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818030,"China blasts Pentagon official's Taiwan visit, military ties","BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday sharply criticized a visit to Taiwan by a senior Pentagon official and reaffirmed it has sanctioned Lockheed Martin and a unit of Raytheon for supplying military equipment to the self-governing island democracy. 

            The comments from the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office underscore the dramatic deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan, technology, spying allegations, and, increasingly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

            Asked about the reported visit by Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said China “resolutely opposes any official interaction and military collaboration” between the U.S. and Taiwan. 











            Efforts by Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party to cement the island's independence with foreign assistance are “doomed to failure,"" Zhu told reporters. 

            China considers Taiwan part of its territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and has been stepping up its military and diplomatic harassment. The sides split amid civil war in 1949, and China's authoritarian Communist Party has never held sway over the island. 

            A Pentagon spokesperson did not comment directly on Chase's visit, repeating that “our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.” Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it had no information about any such visit.

            Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said a “new round of tensions” in the Taiwan Strait was a result of the Taiwanese authorities’ attempts to “seek independence with U.S. support, as well as the U.S. intention to contain China with Taiwan.”

            “We urge the U.S. to ... stop any form of official U.S.-Taiwan contacts, stop meddling in the Taiwan issue and stop creating new factors of tension in the Taiwan Strait,” Wang said at a daily briefing. 

            Tensions between the U.S. and China again ratcheted up last month after Washington accused Beijing of sending a spy balloon that was shot down over the American East Coast. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to Beijing in the wake of the incident and said over the weekend that the United States was concerned China would provide weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine. 

            China, which has declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow’s actions, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia. Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China over Taiwan.

            On a visit to Moscow Tuesday, the Communist Party's top diplomat Wang Yi said relations between Moscow and Beijing are “solid as a rock” and will “stand the test of the volatile international situation.”

            Russia and China have an “excellent opportunity to continue close strategic cooperation and contacts to protect our shared strategic interests,” Wang said. 

            Wang Wenbin, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said he had no information about a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Moscow this spring. 

            A delegation of U.S. lawmakers visiting Taiwan met on Tuesday with President Tsai Ing-wen, who said she looked for increased cooperation on issues from security to climate change. 

            On Monday, the delegation met with the head of the legislature as part of their five-day visit. They include Reps. Ro Khanna of California, Tony Gonzales of Texas, Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Jonathan Jackson of Illinois. 

            The congressional team held talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s founder Morris Chang, considered the father of the island’s world-leading microchip industry that is now investing heavily in U.S. production. 

            Khanna and Auchincloss are both members of the new House select committee focused on competition with China. 

            Amid the flurry of exchanges, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and head of the National Security Council Wellington Koo were in Washington on Tuesday for what are believed to be security meetings.

            They were filmed by Taiwan's private TVBS television station entering the offices of the body the U.S. uses to oversee relations with Taiwan in lieu of formal diplomatic ties. Washington cut formal relations in 1979 in order to establish ties with Beijing, but remains the island's chief political and military ally. 

            China has increasingly lashed back at the increase in exchanges with Taiwan by officials and elected representatives from the U.S. and other democratic nations. China's campaign of diplomatic isolation has left Taiwan with just 14 formal allies, although it retains robust unofficial relations with dozens of other countries. 

            Last Thursday, China imposed trade and investment sanctions against Lockheed Martin Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp.’s Raytheon Missiles and Defense, barring them from importing goods into China or making new investments in the country.

            The Ministry of Commerce declared they had been added to the “unreliable entity” list of companies whose activities are restricted because they might endanger national sovereignty, security or development interests. It wasn’t clear what impact the penalties would have.BEIJING (AP) — China on Wednesday sharply criticized a visit to Taiwan by a senior Pentagon official and reaffirmed it has sanctioned Lockheed Martin and a unit of Raytheon for supplying military equipment to the self-governing island democracy.The comments from the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office underscore the dramatic deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington over Taiwan, technology, spying allegations, and, increasingly, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Asked about the reported visit by Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, office spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said China “resolutely opposes any official interaction and military collaboration” between the U.S. and Taiwan.Efforts by Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party to cement the island's independence with foreign assistance are “doomed to failure,"" Zhu told reporters.China considers Taiwan part of its territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and has been stepping up its military and diplomatic harassment. The sides split amid civil war in 1949, and China's authoritarian Communist Party has never held sway over the island.A Pentagon spokesperson did not comment directly on Chase's visit, repeating that “our commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid and contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region.” Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said it had no information about any such visit.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said a “new round of tensions” in the Taiwan Strait was a result of the Taiwanese authorities’ attempts to “seek independence with U.S. support, as well as the U.S. intention to contain China with Taiwan.”“We urge the U.S. to ... stop any form of official U.S.-Taiwan contacts, stop meddling in the Taiwan issue and stop creating new factors of tension in the Taiwan Strait,” Wang said at a daily briefing.Tensions between the U.S. and China again ratcheted up last month after Washington accused Beijing of sending a spy balloon that was shot down over the American East Coast. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a trip to Beijing in the wake of the incident and said over the weekend that the United States was concerned China would provide weapons to Russia for its war in Ukraine.China, which has declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow’s actions, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia. Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China over Taiwan.On a visit to Moscow Tuesday, the Communist Party's top diplomat Wang Yi said relations between Moscow and Beijing are “solid as a rock” and will “stand the test of the volatile international situation.”Russia and China have an “excellent opportunity to continue close strategic cooperation and contacts to protect our shared strategic interests,” Wang said.Wang Wenbin, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said he had no information about a possible visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Moscow this spring.A delegation of U.S. lawmakers visiting Taiwan met on Tuesday with President Tsai Ing-wen, who said she looked for increased cooperation on issues from security to climate change.On Monday, the delegation met with the head of the legislature as part of their five-day visit. They include Reps. Ro Khanna of California, Tony Gonzales of Texas, Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts and Jonathan Jackson of Illinois.The congressional team held talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s founder Morris Chang, considered the father of the island’s world-leading microchip industry that is now investing heavily in U.S. production.Khanna and Auchincloss are both members of the new House select committee focused on competition with China.Amid the flurry of exchanges, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and head of the National Security Council Wellington Koo were in Washington on Tuesday for what are believed to be security meetings.They were filmed by Taiwan's private TVBS television station entering the offices of the body the U.S. uses to oversee relations with Taiwan in lieu of formal diplomatic ties.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818036,"Top brands pull out of Russia, but their goods remain easy to find","MOSCOW, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Trucks carrying Coca Cola roll across the border into Russia, tourists return from abroad laden with Zara's latest designs, and local online marketplaces snap up IKEA's furniture stocks. Western brands may have left the country, but their goods haven't.Despite European, North American and Japanese companies exiting Russia over its actions in Ukraine, the impact on Russian consumers is minimal, although delivery times can be longer and some goods more expensive.The main change has been to supply routes, but the products remain available both online and in stores. Buyers just need to know where to look.Crucially, the vast majority of goods concerned are not subject to sanctions and these cross-border flows are legal. And Moscow is happy to let them in, whatever route they take.Brands' continued availability shows the challenge companies face in controlling supply chains when exiting a market.ZARA IN MINSKZara-owner Inditex <ITX.MC> shuttered its 502 Russian stores after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, and then sold them to UAE-based Daher Group.Now, small-scale imports and online sellers are keeping them alive, a Reuters review of six major online marketplaces and conversations with a dozen buyers and sellers showed.Albina, 32, took an empty suitcase to Minsk last summer and returned 24 hours later with 33,000 roubles ($442) worth of Inditex-brand Zara, Bershka and Massimo Dutti clothes for herself and friends.While most Western brands that have halted Russian operations have also pulled out of Belarus - a staunch Moscow ally - Inditex has not. The company did not respond when asked about this.Albina told Reuters she has also bought clothes in Paris and Dubai and used a network of online sellers.""There are pages on Instagram, on Telegram, there are girls I know who moved to live in Europe or Istanbul or Dubai,"" she said. ""They collect orders, let's say in Istanbul, they take 15%-30% (as commission), then get them delivered here and you pay for the delivery.""Last year's strong rouble and weak Turkish lira played into Russian consumers' hands.Currency dynamics were partly responsible for a seven-fold increase in deliveries from Turkey on CDEK Forward, a delivery service from foreign e-commerce sites, its marketing director Dinara Ismailova told Reuters.""As soon as brands said they were leaving, some kind of panic started, and the number of volumes and orders rose sharply,"" Ismailova said.Dealing with small, private deliveries, CDEK Forward's turnover doubled in money terms last year, with 80% of that coming from clothes, while its goods turnover tripled.""It's comparable to if you personally went to a Zara store in New York, bought something there and sent it on to your friends in Moscow,"" Ismailova said.ONLINE MARKETPLACESAs supply chains broke down, Russia legalised so-called parallel imports, allowing retailers to bring in products from abroad without the trademark owner's permission.E-commerce sites sell a wide range of imported goods, and sellers often advertise that they bring products from abroad.Market leader Wildberries sells old stock from Inditex brands and has almost 17,000 goods in its Zara catalogue. A source close to Inditex said these were clearance stocks that were in Russia when it suspended activities there.Wildberries did not respond to a request for comment.One ubiquitous Western product Wildberries and its peers Ozon <OZON.O> and Yandex Market sell is Coca-Cola, often advertised as imported so buyers know it is the real thing.While Coca-Cola Co <K.N> stopped producing and selling drinks in Russia last year, others have been importing them, with labels on cans and bottles showing they have arrived from Europe, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China.One quirk of this arrangement is that prices vary. In one Moscow supermarket, three cans of Coca-Cola were on sale for three different prices, imported from Denmark, Poland and Britain respectively.A senior employee at a major retailer explained how companies have adapted.""Contacts were quickly established and new contracts with new partners signed, new money flows and logistical supply chains with Turkish, Polish and Kazakh companies were launched,"" he said on condition of anonymity.Coca Cola is available from even more countries now.""However, as usual, it is the buyer who pays more for these new inconveniences,"" the employee added.'FRIENDLY' IMPORTSAs new routes are developed the extra logistics, travel and scaling costs will fall, and though trade remains relatively inefficient, these new relationships are here to stay, said Ram Ben Tzion, CEO of digital vetting platform Publican.""The parallel importing mechanisms have been consolidated and expanded, meaning that pretty much everything is accessible and still will be in the future,"" Ben Tzion said, pointing to border truck queues and new entities springing up in nearby states.""Coca Cola can easily notice the 'surge in demand' from countries neighbouring Russia, where most parallel imports come from,"" Ben Tzion said. ""It is not in their interest to do anything about it.""Coca-Cola declined to comment.""Friendly"" countries not imposing sanctions have ramped up exports to Russia, their trade data shows. Russia itself has stopped publishing such figures.China-Russia trade hit a record 1.28 trillion yuan ($186 billion) last year, while Turkey's exports to Russia jumped 61.8% to $9.34 billion and Kazakhstan's rose 25.1% to $8.78 billion.Informal supply routes could lead to more poor-quality goods entering Russia, however, as regulators lose oversight, Ben Tzion said.REPLICASSome brands face years battling copies and unauthorized imports. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's Russian rivals have increased bottling capacity and launched new Cola beverages.Swedish furniture giant IKEA sold its stock to Yandex Market, tech giant Yandex's <YNDX.O> e-commerce division, when it left Russia. IKEA brand owner Inter IKEA Group said it sold remaining stock for an undisclosed amount to Yandex as it down-scaled IKEA Retail Russia.Yandex Market says it puts suppliers who previously sold goods via IKEA stores in direct contact with customers.But former suppliers are also ready to sell lightly modified IKEA items under different names. One already advertises a bedding set it calls ""ARUA (analogue of IKEA BERGPALM)"".IKEA said it was looking into goods being advertised as similar to IKEA online.Although new opportunities are opening up for Russian firms, the fixation with Western brands may hinder efforts to boost local production.""Over time, market forces will continue to drive the products Russians are used to into the market and while there is an aspiration to move to 'Made in Russia' it will be very difficult to actually get people hooked up on Russian coke,"" said Ben Tzion.",2023/02/22,324,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818037,KMT gains upper hand in Taiwan poll,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — With the next presidential election less than one year away, the opposition Kuomintang’s (KMT) popularity surpassed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), an opinion poll showed Tuesday (Feb. 21).However, the biggest loser according to the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation (TPOF) survey was former Taipei City Mayor Ko Wen-je’s (柯文哲) Taiwan People’s Party (TPP).While support for the KMT surged from 21.5% in January to 27.1% in February, the DPP also saw its approval rise from 26.1% to 26.9%, ending up barely 0.2% below the main opposition party. In contrast, the TPP plunged from 20.3% to 12.3% in the survey, while no other political party reached 2%.TPOF Chairman Ying-lung You (游盈隆) saw a link between the rise of the KMT and the decline of the TPP, with voters switching between the two parties, especially in the wake of the KMT victory in the Nov. 2022 local elections.The poll also asked voters for their choices in the January 2024 presidential elections. Vice President and DPP Chairman Lai Ching-te (賴清德) received 27.7%, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih (侯友宜) of the KMT led the field with 32.4%, and Ko received 19.5%.According to You, the results showed that not only Lai could not be certain of victory, but if the KMT nominated Hou, the DPP might face an uphill battle trying to hold on to power after eight years in government.Focus Survey Research conducted the survey on behalf of the TPOF Feb. 13-14, producing 1,072 valid responses with a margin of error of 2.99%.",2023/02/22,2033,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818050,"After one year of war, Russia's economy is doing fine","In the dramatic days following Russia's invasion of Ukraine one year ago, the Russian economy was seriously rattled.Western allies, led by the US and EU, leveled severe sanctions against the country's financial system. The ruble fell to a record low against the US dollar, the Russian central bank doubled interest rates and the Moscow stock exchange was shut for several days.In a statement, EU leaders described ""massive and severe consequences"" for Russia. Economists predicted a huge plunge in GDP. Weeks after the sanctions were brought in, the White House said in a statement: ""Experts predict Russia's GDP will contract up to 15 percent this year, wiping out the last fifteen years of economic gains.""It hasn't happened. While the past 12 months have been very challenging for the Russian economy, it has performed far better than expected.Getting a clear picture is ultimately impossible. The Kremlin made a lot of key economic data classified after the invasion and it remains so today. The underlying shape of the economy is uncertain. However, it's already obvious that the collapse many predicted has not materialized.""I think we can say that the economy shrank a lot less than the 10 to 15% that people were talking about at the beginning of the war,"" Alexandra Vacroux, executive director of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University, told DW.She believes Russian GDP fell by between 3 and 4% over the past 12 months. That's broadly in line with estimates from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).Russia's official statistics agency this week said the economy contracted by 2.1% in 2022, having predicted a contraction of 12%.Chris Weafer has worked in Russia for around 25 years as an investment advisor and strategist. He says there was a lot of genuine panic within Russia about the economy in the early months after the invasion. That was not only due to the sanctions but also because many companies were voluntarily leaving Russia.""There was speculation that the loss of trade and logistic routes would hit manufacturing very hard and that one would have significant job losses. So around that time, I was definitely very pessimistic about the outlook for the economy in 2022,"" he told DW.However, he says, by May the picture was ""improving rapidly."" ""You could see that the worst-case predictions were not going to happen.""There are several reasons why the Russian economy has outperformed expectations. A major one is its hydrocarbons, namely oil and gas. The EU did not sanction Russian oil and gas imports in the early months of the invasion, as it was so dependent on them for its energy needs.Europe continued to buy Russian oil and gas for much of 2022, while Moscow also found willing new energy trade partners in China, India and elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Russian central bank reported a record-high trade surplus of $227 billion (€211 billion) for 2022, largely driven by its colossal energy exports.""Russia has been able to earn almost like windfall revenues from exporting those products at a very high level because traders in Europe not only continued to buy Russian products, but they started stockpiling them,"" says Weafer.That 'windfall' meant the Russian government was able to greatly limit the impact of western sanctions on its foreign reserves.""It was able to use the money to provide subsidies for key industries, employment support, make sure it continued to fund not only the military but also social programs and to generally maintain economic and social stability in the country,"" says Weafer.That in turn has helped keep unemployment low, reportedly at around 4%, although that figure is significantly distorted by the fact that many people have left the labor force, either because they were drafted into the armed forces or because they left the country in the aftermath of the invasion.Another factor that has helped keep the Russian economy going is that a majority of western companies continued to operate in the country once the initial clamor to exit the market faded.Weafer says that while companies such as McDonald's came under huge social media pressure to leave, most others rode out the storm. ""Especially those that are important for the economy, such as big taxpayers or revenue generators or particularly big employers, they've been much, much slower to leave.""Another reason for the Russian economy's robustness relates to the sanctions themselves. Vacroux says sanctions have consistently failed to live up to expectations in countries such as Venezuela, Iran and Russia itself.""The fact is that sanctions are most effective right before you levy them,"" she says. ""When you have the threat and you say, if you do X, we're going to sanction Y, and at that point, the actor stops to think, like, is it really worth doing X? And maybe the sanctions have an effect. But once Russia does Y invades Ukraine, then you really have no more leverage.""Then there is the fact that the Kremlin has been used to dealing with sanctions for almost a decade, since its annexation of Crimea in 2014.The Russian central bank, well-versed in crisis management, took decisive action to shore up its financial system in February and March 2022. The interest rate hike helped prevent a run on banks as the country's inflation rate eased gradually.Weafer says a decade of sanctions means the country's banks have been heavily stress-tested while the country has also become relatively self-sufficient in key industries, particularly in food production.Another major factor driving Russian economic resilience is the strengthening of its trade ties with China and India. Trade between the countries has soared while Russia has also been able to increasingly benefit from so-called ""parallel imports"", whereby western products are now finding their way into Russia again via third-party countries like China, India and others across central Asia.Vacroux says China is ""the big winner"", pointing out that while trade between the countries soared, so too has Moscow's dependence on Beijing.""China doesn't really care about Russia,"" she says. ""It's 3% of Chinese trade. But Russia now cares a lot about China. And the good thing about that for us is that when China says, 'You cannot use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Right, don't do that,' Russia really has to listen.""Expectations for the Russian economy in 2023 vary. The IMF recently said it expected the country's economy to grow by 0.3% in 2023, although others have forecast a GDP drop of around 2%.Europe has managed to largely divest itself of its dependence on Russian energy over the course of the last 12 months. However, so far there is little evidence to suggest that the bloc's price cap sanction on Russian oil — introduced in December — is working. According to research carried out by The Economist, Russian crude oil sales remain high, driven by demand from China and India.Weafer believes the new EU sanctions,which kicked in on February 5 and target diesel and other refined products, are a potentially key moment.""There's an enormous question mark over how much money Russia will earn from exporting hydrocarbons and extractive industries this year,"" he said. ""And it certainly will be significantly less than in 2022, that's for sure.""Edited by: Kristie Pladson",2023/02/22,219,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818051,"Flights canceled, highways closed as winter storm wallops US","PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — A brutal winter storm closed interstate highways from Arizona to Wyoming Wednesday, trapped drivers in cars, knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people and prompted the first blizzard warning in Southern California in decades — and the worst won't be over for several days.

            Few places were untouched by the wild weather, including some at the opposite extreme: long-standing record highs were broken in cities in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

            The wintry mix hit hard in the northern U.S., closing schools, offices, even shutting down the Minnesota Legislature. Travel was difficult. Weather contributed to more than 1,600 U.S. flight cancellations, according to the tracking service FlightAware. More than 400 of those were due to arrive or depart from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Another 5,000-plus flights were delayed across the country.











            At Denver International Airport, Taylor Dotson, her husband, Reggie, and their 4-year-old daughter, Raegan, faced a two-hour flight delay to Nashville on their way home to Belvidere, Tennessee.

            Reggie Dotson was in Denver to interview for a job as an airline pilot.

            “I think that’s kind of funny that we’ve experienced these types of delays when that’s what he’s looking into getting into now as a career,” Taylor Dotson said.

            The roads were just as bad. 

            In Wyoming, rescuers tried to reach people stranded in vehicles but high winds and drifting snow created a “near-impossible situation” for them, said Sgt. Jeremy Beck of the Wyoming Highway Patrol.

            “They know their locations, it’s just hard for them to get them,” he said.

            Wyoming's Transportation Department posted on social media that roads across much of the southern part of the state were impassable.

            In the Pacific Northwest, high winds and heavy snow in the Cascade Mountains prevented search teams from reaching the bodies of three climbers killed in an avalanche on Washington’s Colchuck Peak over the weekend. Two experts from the Northwest Avalanche Center were hiking to the scene Wednesday to determine if conditions might permit a recovery attempt later this week.

            Powerful winds were the biggest problem in California, toppling trees and power lines. By Wednesday evening, more than 65,000 customers in the state were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us.

            A 1-year-old child was critically injured Tuesday evening when a redwood crashed onto a home in Boulder Creek, a community in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco, KTVU reported. 

            For the first time since 1989, a blizzard warning was issued for the mountains of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, effective from 4 a.m. Thursday to 4 p.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said.

            “Nearly the entire population of CA will be able to see snow from some vantage point later this week if they look in the right direction (i.e., toward the highest hills in vicinity),” UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain tweeted.

            A more than 200-mile (320-kilometer) stretch of Interstate 40 from central Arizona to the New Mexico line closed due to snow, rain and wind gusts of up to 80 mph (129 kph). More than 8,000 customers were without power in Arizona.

            In the northern U.S. — a region accustomed to heavy snow — the snowfall could be significant. More than 18 inches (46 centimeters) may pile up in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said Wednesday evening. According to the weather service, the biggest snow event on record in the Twin Cities was 28.4 inches (72 centimeters) from Oct. 31 through Nov. 3, 1991.

            Temperatures could plunge as low as minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 29 degrees Celsius) Thursday and to minus 25 F (minus 32 C) Friday in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Wind chills may fall to minus 50 F (minus 46 C), said Nathan Rick, a meteorologist in Grand Forks.

            Wind gusts may reach 50 mph (80 kph) in western and central Minnesota, resulting in “significant blowing and drifting snow with whiteout conditions in open areas,” the weather service said.

            The weather even prompted about 90 churches in western Michigan to cancel Ash Wednesday services, WZZM-TV reported.

            The storm will make its way toward the East Coast later this week. Places that don’t get snow may get dangerous amounts of ice. Forecasters expect up to a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of ice in parts of southern Michigan, northern Illinois and some eastern states.

            The potential ice storm has power company officials on edge. Nearly 1,500 line workers are ready to be deployed if the ice causes outages, said Matt Paul, executive vice president of distribution operations for Detroit-based DTE Electric. He said a half-inch of ice could cause hundreds of thousands of outages.

            A half-inch of ice covering a wire “is the equivalent of having a baby grand piano on that single span of wire, so the weight is significant,” Paul said. 

            More than 192,000 customers in Michigan and nearly 89,000 in Illinois were without electricity Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.

            As the northern U.S. dealt with the winter blast, National Weather Service meteorologist Richard Bann said some mid-Atlantic and Southeastern cities set new high temperature marks by several degrees.

            The high in Lexington, Kentucky, reached 76 F (24 C), shattering the Feb. 22 mark of 70 F (21 C) set 101 years ago. Nashville, Tennessee, reached 78 F (26 C), topping the 1897 record by 4 degrees. Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Atlanta and Mobile, Alabama, were among many other places seeing record highs.

Forecasters expect up to a half-inch (1.3 centimeters) of ice in parts of southern Michigan, northern Illinois and some eastern states.The potential ice storm has power company officials on edge. Nearly 1,500 line workers are ready to be deployed if the ice causes outages, said Matt Paul, executive vice president of distribution operations for Detroit-based DTE Electric. He said a half-inch of ice could cause hundreds of thousands of outages.A half-inch of ice covering a wire “is the equivalent of having a baby grand piano on that single span of wire, so the weight is significant,” Paul said.More than 192,000 customers in Michigan and nearly 89,000 in Illinois were without electricity Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.As the northern U.S. dealt with the winter blast, National Weather Service meteorologist Richard Bann said some mid-Atlantic and Southeastern cities set new high temperature marks by several degrees.The high in Lexington, Kentucky, reached 76 F (24 C), shattering the Feb. 22 mark of 70 F (21 C) set 101 years ago. Nashville, Tennessee, reached 78 F (26 C), topping the 1897 record by 4 degrees. Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Atlanta and Mobile, Alabama, were among many other places seeing record highs.___Salter reported from O'Fallon, Missouri.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818053,"LeDee scores 14, No. 22 San Diego State beats Rams 77-58","SAN DIEGO (AP) — Jaedon LeDee scored 14 points and Matt Bradley scored 10 of his 13 in the first four minutes of the second half for No. 22 San Diego State, which overwhelmed Colorado State 77-58 Tuesday night for its fifth straight win.

            Bradley, SDSU's leading scorer, was whacked on top of the left hand taking a shot and was subbed out during a timeout with 7:47 left and the Aztecs leading 69-48. He returned with 4:55 to go but didn't play the final two minutes. 

            “I didn't want to risk playing him any more with the lead we had so I pulled him out,” said coach Brian Dutcher, who added that Bradley had a knot on his hand. 











            Micah Parrish added 12 and Lamont Butler and Darrion Trammell had 11 each for SDSU (22-5, 13-2 Mountain West), which solidified its lead in the conference race. The Aztecs have won nine of their last 10 games dating to an 82-76 overtime win at Colorado State on Jan. 18. 

            John Tonje scored 18 and Isaiah Rivera 15 for the Rams (12-16, 4-11), who have lost seven of nine. 

            “That was a good, hard-fought win and I was nervous about it,"" Dutcher said. “They're very dangerous offensively. I still have memories of Tonje hitting a corner 3 on Jordan Schakel to win the game against us not so many years ago here. If you don't learn from the past you can repeat it and we were ready to play.”

            The Aztecs forced 16 turnovers and held The Rams to just 3 3-pointers, on 14 attempts. They made 11 of 29 in the first game between the teams this year.

            “I think our defensive pressure caused some issues,” Dutcher said. “I just feel like we're a hard team to beat if you don't make a lot of 3s because we're hard to score on around the basket. Tough twos are a hard way to win a game in the half court. I'm proud of our effort and I think we're getting better. That's the key to Aztec basketball.""

            The Aztecs used their trademark tough defense to take a 41-26 lead at halftime, when Bradley had just three points. But the senior guard got hot right away in the second half, hitting a 3-pointer, a jumper, a layup and another 3-pointer that gave the Aztecs a 52-32 lead and forced the Rams to call time out. 

            Bradley's only points in the first half came in a 3-point play less than four minutes in. Lamont Butler also converted a 3-point play and Darrion Trammell hit a 3-pointer to help the Aztecs start to pull away. 

            But it was the Aztecs' defense that stood out. They forced a shot-clock violation and a 10-second violation early on, and the Rams had 10 turnovers in the first half.

            BIG PICTURE

            Colorado State: The Rams were coming off a thrilling finish at Fresno State, when they outscored the Bulldogs 12-2 in the final 1:30 to win 60-57. The Aztecs scored only 45 points in beating the Bulldogs by two points three nights earlier.

The Ministry provided subsidies to the non-profit research institute ITRI to develop the robot.7-Eleven’s parent company also announced today that from March 1, office workers within the Kaohsiung technology park would be able to have robot-delivered meals to their office door.Cubot ONE was previewed at the 2022 Meet Greater South Exhibition and is now ready for trial operations after more than half a year of refinement. The robot will apparently be able to navigate inside and outside of buildings, avoid obstacles in crowds and use narrow elevators, according to the release.MOEA Special Committee on Technology member Chang Neng-kai (張能凱), said that global demand for service robots had grown rapidly in recent years, with logistics robots accounting for approximately one third of all sales. MOEA estimates that the global market value of logistics robots will reach US$49.4 billion (over NT$1.5 trillion) by 2027.The robot delivery service will be accessed through the Foodomo app, a relatively small actor in Taiwan’s food delivery market that is dominated by Foodpanda and Uber Eats. According to a Market Intelligence & Consulting Institute (MCI) report, out of the 71% of Taiwanese consumers that use food delivery services, up to 78% use either Foodpanda or Uber Eats, while only 6.5% use Foodomo.In the same 2022 report, MCI analyst Hu Tzu-li (胡自立) said that the food delivery market in Taiwan had stabilized and that major players were no longer focused on growing market share. Foodomo’s unique autonomous delivery capability and the potential for cost savings that brings with it may mean there are changes in the market ahead yet.Cubot ONE, a food delivery robot that will begin a trial period delivering to customers in a set area in Kaohsiung on March 1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818078,QMC Receives Work Permit for Irgon Lithium Mine Project,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - February 22, 2023 -  QMC Quantum Minerals Corp., (TSXV: QMC) (FSE: 3LQ) (OTC Pink: QMCQF) (""QMC"" or ""the Company"") has received a work permit from the Government of Manitoba for the Company's Irgon Lithium Mine Property. The Irgon Lithium Mine has a historical resource estimate of 1.2 million tons grading 1.51% Li2O over a strike length of 365 metres, to a depth of 213 metres. Currently, on surface, the strike length has been extended to approximately 800 metres and remains open along strike and to depth. A complete mining plant and 40-man camp were installed on site during 1956/57. The adjacent Highway 314, which transects the property, was specifically built for access to the historic Irgon mining operation. The mining plant was designed to process 500 tons of ore per day. The project has excellent infrastructure, being close to grid power, highway access to a processing facility 20km to the south and a major central railway system located in Winnipeg, Manitoba.   The initial focus of the proposed work program will be to carry out a field mapping and sampling program in order to extend the Irgon Dike beyond the known 800m strike length. The Company will then execute a channel sampling program across newly exposed mineralized outcrop sections of the Irgon Dike.   PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS:     Historic Resource: Between 1953 and 1954, the Lithium Corporation of Canada Limited (""LCOC"") reported a historical resource estimate on the Irgon Dike of 1.2 million tons grading 1.51% Li20 over a strike length of 365 metres and to a depth of 213 metres. This historical resource is documented in a 1956 Assessment Report by B. B. Bannatyne for LCOC (Manitoba Assessment Report No. 94932). This historical resource estimate is believed to be based on reasonable assumptions and both the Company and QP has no reason to contest the document's relevance and reliability.     Existing Underground Development: During 1956/1957 a complete mining plant was installed, and since removed, on site designed to process 500 tons of ore per day and a three-compartment shaft was sunk to a depth of 74 metres. On the 61-metre level, lateral development was extended off the shaft for a total of 366 metres of drifting from which six crosscuts transected the dike.     Excellent Historic Recoveries: Historic metallurgical tests reported an 87% recovery from which a concentrate averaging 5.9% Li2O was obtained.     Excellent Local Infrastructure:  The Irgon Property is transected by Manitoba Highway 314 with access to hydro, water, nearby rail head and is located only 20 kilometres north of the Sinomine Rare Metal Resources Group's TANCO Mine which is currently mining spodumene and producing a lithium concentrate on site.     Pending NI 43-101 Report: A NI 43-101 technical report is nearing completion which will update the historical lithium resource to current NI 43-101 standards.    The mineral reserve cited above is presented as a historical estimate and uses historical terminology which does not conform to current NI43-101 standards. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Although the historical estimates are believed to be based on reasonable assumptions, they were calculated prior to the implementation of National Instrument 43-101. These historical estimates do not meet current standards as defined under sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43-101; consequently, the issuer is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.    Qualified Person and NI 43-101 Disclosure      The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Daniel Leroux, P. Geo. who is a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.   On behalf of the Board of Directors of  QMC QUANTUM MINERALS CORP.

Left untreated, serious bites by such snakes can lead to severe complications and even death, prompting the Changhua County Department of Agriculture to issue a warning to the public to take extra precautions in the area.Taiwan krait slithers on road. (Chen photo)When taking photos of a herd of water buffaloes by the Maoluo River in Fengyuan Township, a photographer surnamed Chen (陳) was warned by fishermen that there had recently been many sightings of Taiwan kraits and cobras on a bike path that runs between Jiushe and Zhulin Village, reported SET News. Chen went to investigate the area and found that Taiwan kraits and cobras were slithering directly on the bicycle path.He estimated that some of the kraits were thick and were over a meter in length, approximately 150 centimeters. He said that seeing the serpents made him weak in the knees, and he saw a few dead kraits that had been recently run over by vehicles.Closeup of Taiwan krait slithers. (Chen photo)The path is a popular area for people to go cycling, hiking, and walking their dogs, including the elderly on weekdays and children on holidays. Chen expressed fears that anyone bitten by the kraits or cobras could die if not quickly treated.He suspected that a religious organization had intentionally released the snakes nearby as a ""meritorious deed' to accumulate good karma. Other possible explanations Chen posited were that the snakes were emerging amid warmer spring weather or that people carrying out tomb sweeping burned the weeds to drive the snakes out of their burrows.Taiwan krait crushed by a vehicle. (Chen photo)In response to the spate of serpent sightings, the Changhua County Department of Agriculture reminded the public that if they encounter a venomous snake, they should not approach it or make dangerous movements such as flailing or poking. Instead, they should immediately call 119 or report the sighting to the Department of Agriculture, which will assign snake wranglers to deal with the situation.It also urged the public to be particularly vigilant while traveling down the roadway.",2023/02/22,4196,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818104,Germany's military 'turning point' still a work in progress,"BERLIN (AP) — Nearly a year after Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared Russia's invasion of Ukraine a “turning point” that would trigger weapons shipments to a nation at war and a massive increase in Germany's military spending, the turnaround for his country's armed forces still has a long way to go.

            Germany has become one of the leading arms suppliers to Ukraine since the speech Scholz gave three days after Moscow sent troops into Ukraine. Lawmakers, including the main opposition bloc, gave strong backing in June to the 100 billion-euro ($107 billion) military procurement fund that the chancellor announced.

            Over the weekend, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said there had been “a 180-degree turn in the opinions of Germans regarding military questions, military issues, NATO and of course, what’s going on in Ukraine.”











            A remarkable change in policy has indeed taken place in a country that, weeks before the invasion, drew derision for announcing that it would deliver 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine as a signal of solidarity. But some things have been slow to shift in Germany, whose history of World War II aggression led to an aversion to projecting military power. 

            Germany's generosity in delivering weapons — it is Ukraine's biggest supplier in continental Europe — has repeatedly been overshadowed by criticism of its perceived hesitancy in ramping up support, notably in clearing the way last month to supply battle tanks.

            And much of the 100 billion euros in funding has yet to find its way into bolstering the German military, the Bundeswehr, which the army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Alfons Mais, described on Feb. 24, 2022, as “more or less naked.” There is widespread acknowledgement that the military has suffered from years of neglect and in particular from aging, poorly functioning equipment.

            Scholz pledged last February that “from now on, we will invest more than 2% of gross domestic product in our defense year for year,” a NATO target on which Germany has for years fallen significantly short, to the displeasure of allies such as the United States. 

            NATO figures from mid-2022 estimated the country would miss the benchmark again last year, with 1.44% of GDP going to defense.

            Opposition leader Friedrich Merz complained to Scholz during a parliamentary debate this month that “large parts of the so-called ‘turning point’ that you described here on Feb. 27 last year so far are happening largely on paper in Germany.” Merz said it was unacceptable that “practically no orders” had yet been placed, particularly for ammunition.

            It was mid-December by the time lawmakers gave the go-ahead for specific major procurement projects, including the purchase of 35 Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets, new assault rifles and radio systems. German defense companies have complained of seeing hardly any orders yet. 

            While there's a wide understanding that Russia's aggression marked a turning point, “it took a very long time to implement the changes in the German ministerial system, into the bureaucracy,” said Thomas Wiegold, a defense policy expert who runs the Augen geradeaus! military blog. “You have to say that, until now, it has not been really implemented."" 

            About 30 billion euros of the special fund has been committed to contracts for specific projects so far, Defense Ministry spokesman Arne Collatz said Wednesday.

            There have been calls from some in and outside the military for a big increase in the special military procurement fund. But Wiegold noted that the fund doesn't cover the military's regular operations, including increasingly expensive basic costs such as fuel, and that billions need to be spent on ammunition.

            “The main question is not to raise the special fund; the main question is what will be the defense budget, the regular budget, over the coming years,"" he said. 

            Scholz, in a speech Saturday to the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of international security policy officials, stressed his pledge to get Germany's defense spending up to 2% of GDP “permanently.” 

            Pistorius, who has brought new vigor to the Defense Ministry after his much-criticized predecessor quit last month, is reportedly pushing for a 10 billion-euro increase in the regular defense budget from the current annual level of around 50 billion euros.

            “We will reach the 2% target, but we will also make every effort to go beyond that,” the minister said. “That will, of course, still have to be agreed in the (governing) coalition, but it must be clear to everyone that we won't be able to fulfill the tasks that lie ahead of us with nearly 2% alone.” 

            That's not an easy ask as Germany contends with the fallout from high inflation and the transition to renewable energy sources while also trying to keep a lid on government debt. “All of us would prefer to spend more money on other things, but reality is what it is,” Pistorius said.

            There might be an easier fix for Germany's image as a country that has to be prodded at every turn to step up its military aid.

            “If you see the long list of what Germany has delivered, that's pretty impressive,” Wiegold said. “At the same time, the German government is pretty, pretty bad in communications. ... If Germany would communicate better what it's doing, this would help a lot.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818105,Tuesday's Sports In Brief,"NBA

            ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday fired coach Nate McMillan, who was unable to follow up on the success of leading the team to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals.

            Atlanta general manager Landry Fields announcing the firing. The Hawks are 29-30 and in eighth place in the East this season.











            Assistant coach Joe Prunty will serve as interim coach. Prunty joined the Hawks in July 2021 as lead assistant. 

            The 58-year-old McMillan went 99-80 as Atlanta’s coach, including a 27-11 record as interim in the second half of the 2020-21 season. His success that season earned him the full-time position.

            McMillan was frustrated in his attempts to improve Atlanta’s defense, a consistent weakness that weighed down a team led by high-scoring guard Trae Young.

            McMillan denied reports early this season that he considered resigning. 

            Overall in 19 seasons, McMillan has a 760-668 record with the Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Hawks.

            NEW YORK (AP) —Jacque Vaughn, who has coached the Brooklyn Nets into playoff position despite the trades of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving during another turbulent season for the franchise, has agreed to a multiyear contract extension.

            Vaughn replaced Steve Nash early in the season and the Nets announced Tuesday they were extending his deal. Terms were not disclosed, though general manager Sean Marks said the Nets looked forward to Vaughn leading the team “for years to come.”

            The Nets (34-24) are fifth in the Eastern Conference and have gone 32-19 under Vaughn, the fifth-best record in the league.

            He replaced Nash on an interim basis on Nov. 1 and took the full-time position on Nov. 9 — after the Nets had discussed the position with former Boston Celtics coach Ime Udoka.

            SOCCER

            NEW YORK (AP) — A former ESPN executive underscored how big money corrupted soccer, testifying in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that his company’s bid to televise the World Cup might have been sabotaged by two former Fox executives accused of bribing officials to undermine competing offers.

            ESPN’s former president, John Skipper, told a federal court in New York that ESPN and Univision had jointly bid $900 million — evenly split between the two TV behemoths — for broadcasting rights to the two most recent World Cups, including the recently completed one in Qatar.

            Despite ESPN’s hefty bid for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, FIFA awarded U.S. English-language rights to Fox, which bid less.

            Government lawyers say millions of dollars in bribes fed a system of clandestine, no-bid contracts that allowed corrupt soccer executives to profit from the scheme and ultimately allowed Fox to air the matches.

            Prosecutors allege the payoffs enabled the former Fox executives — Heran Lopez and Carlos Martinez — to get confidential information from high-ranking soccer officials, including those at FIFA. The information helped Fox secure the U.S. English-language rights with a $425 million bid. Telemundo, a division of Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, won U.S. Spanish-language rights for about $600 million.

            EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) — Connor McDavid reached 800 career points and scored his 43rd and 44th goals in the third period to give the Edmonton Oilers a 4-2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night.

            McDavid also assisted on Leon Draisaitl’s tying goal early in the third, with McDavid picking up his 800th point and Draisaitl his 700th on the play.

            Playing in his 545th game, McDavid became the fifth-fastest player in NHL history to hit the mark, behind Wayne Gretzky (352 games), Mario Lemieux (410), Mike Bossy (525), and Peter Stastny (531).

            McDavid gave the Oilers the lead with 7:21 left when his pass deflected in off Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim. McDavid then scored a short-handed goal into an empty net with 2:25 remaining.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818106,Global impact: 5 ways war in Ukraine has changed the world,"LONDON (AP) — War has been a catastrophe for Ukraine and a crisis for the globe. The world is a more unstable and fearful place since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022.

            
                One year on, thousands of Ukrainian civilians are dead, and countless buildings have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of troops have been killed or seriously wounded on each side. Beyond Ukraine’s borders, the invasion shattered European security, redrew nations’ relations with one another and frayed a tightly woven global economy.

            Here are five ways the war has changed the world:











            THE RETURN OF EUROPEAN WAR

            Three months before the invasion, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson scoffed at suggestions that the British army needed more heavy weapons. “The old concepts of fighting big tank battles on European landmass,” he said, “are over.”

            Johnson is now urging the U.K. to send more battle tanks to help Ukraine repel Russian forces.

            Despite the role played by new technology such as satellites and drones, this 21st-century conflict in many ways resembles one from the 20th. Fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region is a brutal slog, with mud, trenches and bloody infantry assaults reminiscent of World War I.

            The conflict has sparked a new arms race that reminds some analysts of the 1930s buildup to World War II. Russia has mobilized hundreds of thousands of conscripts and aims to expand its military from 1 million to 1.5 million troops. The U.S. has ramped up weapons production to replace the stockpiles shipped to Ukraine. France plans to boost military spending by a third by 2030, while Germany has abandoned its longstanding ban on sending weapons to conflict zones and shipped missiles and tanks to Ukraine.

            Before the war, many observers assumed that military forces would move toward more advanced technology and cyber warfare and become less reliant on tanks or artillery, said Patrick Bury, senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath.

            But in Ukraine, guns and ammunition are the most important weapons.

            ""It is, for the moment at least, being shown that in Ukraine, conventional warfare — state-on-state — is back,” Bury said.

            ALLIANCES TESTED AND TOUGHENED

            Russian President Vladimir Putin hoped the invasion would split the West and weaken NATO. Instead, the military alliance has been reinvigorated. A group set up to counter the Soviet Union has a renewed sense of purpose and two new aspiring members in Finland and Sweden, which ditched decades of nonalignment and asked to join NATO as protection against Russia.

            The 27-nation European Union has hit Russia with tough sanctions and sent Ukraine billions in support. The war put Brexit squabbles into perspective, thawing diplomatic relations between the bloc and awkward former member Britain.

            “The EU is taking sanctions, quite serious sanctions, in the way that it should. The U.S. is back in Europe with a vengeance in a way we never thought it would be again,” said defense analyst Michael Clarke, former head of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.

            NATO member states have poured weapons and equipment worth billions of dollars into Ukraine. The alliance has buttressed its eastern flank, and the countries nearest to Ukraine and Russia, including Poland and the Baltic states, have persuaded more hesitant NATO and European Union allies, potentially shifting Europe’s center of power eastwards.

            There are some cracks in the unity. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin’s closest ally in the EU, has lobbied against sanctions on Moscow, refused to send weapons to Ukraine and held up an aid package from the bloc for Kyiv.

            Western unity will come under more and more pressure the longer the conflict grinds on.

            “Russia is planning for a long war,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the end of 2022, but the alliance was also ready for the “long haul.”

            A NEW IRON CURTAIN

            The war has made Russia a pariah in the West. Its oligarchs have been sanctioned and its businesses blacklisted, and international brands including McDonald's and Ikea have disappeared from the country’s streets. 

            Yet Moscow is not entirely friendless. Russia has strengthened economic ties with China, though Beijing is keeping its distance from the fighting and so far has not sent weapons. The U.S. has recently expressed concern that may change.

            China is closely watching a conflict that may serve as either encouragement or warning to Beijing about any attempt to reclaim self-governing Taiwan by force.

            Putin has reinforced military links with international outcasts North Korea and Iran, which supplies armed drones that Russia unleashes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Moscow continues to build influence in Africa and the Middle East with its economic and military clout. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has grown more powerful in conflicts from the Donbas to the Sahel.

            In an echo of the Cold War, the world is divided into two camps, with many countries, including densely populated India, hedging their bets to see who emerges on top.

            Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King’s College London, said the conflict has widened a rift between the “U.S.-led liberal international order” on one side, and angry Russia and emboldened rising superpower China on the other.

            A BATTERED AND RESHAPED ECONOMY

            
                The war’s economic impact has been felt from chilly homes in Europe to food markets in Africa.

            Before the war, European Union nations imported almost half their natural gas and third of their oil from Russia. The invasion, and sanctions slapped on Russia in response, delivered an energy price shock on a scale not seen since the 1970s.

            The war disrupted global trade that was still recovering from the pandemic. Food prices have soared, since Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of wheat and sunflower oil, and Russia is the world’s top fertilizer producer.

            Grain-carrying ships have continued to sail from Ukraine under a fragile U.N.-brokered deal, and prices have come down from record levels. But food remains a geopolitical football. Russia has sought to blame the West for high prices, while Ukraine and its allies accuse Russia of cynically using hunger as a weapon.

            The war ""has really highlighted the fragility” of an interconnected world, just as the pandemic did, German said, and the full economic impact has yet to be felt.

            The war also roiled attempts to fight climate change, driving an upsurge in Europe’s use of heavily polluting coal. Yet Europe’s rush away from Russian oil and gas may speed the transition to renewable energy sources faster than countless warnings about the dangers of global warming. The International Energy Agency says the world will add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the last 20.

            A NEW AGE OF UNCERTAINTY

            The conflict is a stark reminder that individuals have little control over the course of history. No one knows that better than the 8 million Ukrainians who have been forced to flee homes and country for new lives in communities across Europe and beyond.

            For millions of people less directly affected, the sudden shattering of Europe’s peace has brought uncertainty and anxiety.

            Putin’s veiled threats to use atomic weapons if the conflict escalates revived fears of nuclear war that had lain dormant since the Cold War. Fighting has raged around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, raising the specter of a new Chernobyl.

            Patricia Lewis, director of the international security program at think-tank Chatham House, said Putin's nuclear saber-rattling had provoked “more anger than fear” in the West. But concerns about nuclear escalation were heightened by Putin's Feb. 21 announcement that he was suspending Russia's participation in its sole remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the U.S.

            Putin stopped short of withdrawing completely from the New START treaty and said Moscow would respect the treaty’s caps on nuclear weapons, keeping a faint glimmer of arms control alive.

            Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineLONDON (AP) — War has been a catastrophe for Ukraine and a crisis for the globe. The world is a more unstable and fearful place since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022.One year on, thousands of Ukrainian civilians are dead, and countless buildings have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of troops have been killed or seriously wounded on each side. Beyond Ukraine’s borders, the invasion shattered European security, redrew nations’ relations with one another and frayed a tightly woven global economy.Here are five ways the war has changed the world:THE RETURN OF EUROPEAN WARThree months before the invasion, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson scoffed at suggestions that the British army needed more heavy weapons. “The old concepts of fighting big tank battles on European landmass,” he said, “are over.”Johnson is now urging the U.K. to send more battle tanks to help Ukraine repel Russian forces.Despite the role played by new technology such as satellites and drones, this 21st-century conflict in many ways resembles one from the 20th. Fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region is a brutal slog, with mud, trenches and bloody infantry assaults reminiscent of World War I.The conflict has sparked a new arms race that reminds some analysts of the 1930s buildup to World War II. Russia has mobilized hundreds of thousands of conscripts and aims to expand its military from 1 million to 1.5 million troops. The U.S. has ramped up weapons production to replace the stockpiles shipped to Ukraine. France plans to boost military spending by a third by 2030, while Germany has abandoned its longstanding ban on sending weapons to conflict zones and shipped missiles and tanks to Ukraine.Before the war, many observers assumed that military forces would move toward more advanced technology and cyber warfare and become less reliant on tanks or artillery, said Patrick Bury, senior lecturer in security at the University of Bath.But in Ukraine, guns and ammunition are the most important weapons.""It is, for the moment at least, being shown that in Ukraine, conventional warfare — state-on-state — is back,” Bury said.ALLIANCES TESTED AND TOUGHENEDRussian President Vladimir Putin hoped the invasion would split the West and weaken NATO. Instead, the military alliance has been reinvigorated. A group set up to counter the Soviet Union has a renewed sense of purpose and two new aspiring members in Finland and Sweden, which ditched decades of nonalignment and asked to join NATO as protection against Russia.The 27-nation European Union has hit Russia with tough sanctions and sent Ukraine billions in support. The war put Brexit squabbles into perspective, thawing diplomatic relations between the bloc and awkward former member Britain.“The EU is taking sanctions, quite serious sanctions, in the way that it should. The U.S. is back in Europe with a vengeance in a way we never thought it would be again,” said defense analyst Michael Clarke, former head of the Royal United Services Institute think tank.NATO member states have poured weapons and equipment worth billions of dollars into Ukraine. The alliance has buttressed its eastern flank, and the countries nearest to Ukraine and Russia, including Poland and the Baltic states, have persuaded more hesitant NATO and European Union allies, potentially shifting Europe’s center of power eastwards.There are some cracks in the unity. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Putin’s closest ally in the EU, has lobbied against sanctions on Moscow, refused to send weapons to Ukraine and held up an aid package from the bloc for Kyiv.Western unity will come under more and more pressure the longer the conflict grinds on.“Russia is planning for a long war,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said at the end of 2022, but the alliance was also ready for the “long haul.”A NEW IRON CURTAINThe war has made Russia a pariah in the West. Its oligarchs have been sanctioned and its businesses blacklisted, and international brands including McDonald's and Ikea have disappeared from the country’s streets.Yet Moscow is not entirely friendless. Russia has strengthened economic ties with China, though Beijing is keeping its distance from the fighting and so far has not sent weapons. The U.S. has recently expressed concern that may change.China is closely watching a conflict that may serve as either encouragement or warning to Beijing about any attempt to reclaim self-governing Taiwan by force.Putin has reinforced military links with international outcasts North Korea and Iran, which supplies armed drones that Russia unleashes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Moscow continues to build influence in Africa and the Middle East with its economic and military clout. Russia’s Wagner mercenary group has grown more powerful in conflicts from the Donbas to the Sahel.In an echo of the Cold War, the world is divided into two camps, with many countries, including densely populated India, hedging their bets to see who emerges on top.Tracey German, professor of conflict and security at King’s College London, said the conflict has widened a rift between the “U.S.-led liberal international order” on one side, and angry Russia and emboldened rising superpower China on the other.A BATTERED AND RESHAPED ECONOMYThe war’s economic impact has been felt from chilly homes in Europe to food markets in Africa.Before the war, European Union nations imported almost half their natural gas and third of their oil from Russia. The invasion, and sanctions slapped on Russia in response, delivered an energy price shock on a scale not seen since the 1970s.The war disrupted global trade that was still recovering from the pandemic. Food prices have soared, since Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of wheat and sunflower oil, and Russia is the world’s top fertilizer producer.Grain-carrying ships have continued to sail from Ukraine under a fragile U.N.-brokered deal, and prices have come down from record levels. But food remains a geopolitical football. Russia has sought to blame the West for high prices, while Ukraine and its allies accuse Russia of cynically using hunger as a weapon.The war ""has really highlighted the fragility” of an interconnected world, just as the pandemic did, German said, and the full economic impact has yet to be felt.The war also roiled attempts to fight climate change, driving an upsurge in Europe’s use of heavily polluting coal. Yet Europe’s rush away from Russian oil and gas may speed the transition to renewable energy sources faster than countless warnings about the dangers of global warming. The International Energy Agency says the world will add as much renewable power in the next five years as it did in the last 20.A NEW AGE OF UNCERTAINTYThe conflict is a stark reminder that individuals have little control over the course of history. No one knows that better than the 8 million Ukrainians who have been forced to flee homes and country for new lives in communities across Europe and beyond.For millions of people less directly affected, the sudden shattering of Europe’s peace has brought uncertainty and anxiety.Putin’s veiled threats to use atomic weapons if the conflict escalates revived fears of nuclear war that had lain dormant since the Cold War. Fighting has raged around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, raising the specter of a new Chernobyl.Patricia Lewis, director of the international security program at think-tank Chatham House, said Putin's nuclear saber-rattling had provoked “more anger than fear” in the West. But concerns about nuclear escalation were heightened by Putin's Feb. 21 announcement that he was suspending Russia's participation in its sole remaining nuclear arms control treaty with the U.S.Putin stopped short of withdrawing completely from the New START treaty and said Moscow would respect the treaty’s caps on nuclear weapons, keeping a faint glimmer of arms control alive.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/02/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818107,Taiwan Air Force Mirage jet loses external fuel tanks,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A Mirage 2000 jet lost two external fuel tanks during regular drills, reports said Wednesday (Feb. 22).The French-made fighter jet was taxiing on the runway at Hsinchu Air Base preparing for takeoff Tuesday (Feb. 21) when the fuel tanks fell from under the wings, the Liberty Times reported.The Air Force launched an investigation to find out the cause of the mishap, during which nobody was injured. Speculation centered on either the pilot touching a button by accident or a mistake during maintenance work on the plane.According to the Air Force, France had improved its support work for the planes by upgrading the supply of parts and technical repair services since 2021. During annual training last year, the Mirage 2000 team outperformed its rival F-16 and IDF teams, per the Liberty Times. Taiwan bought 60 Mirages in 1992, but lost six of the jets to accidents.",2023/02/22,2163,Politics

Global study on “Natural Gas Liquids” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.The market for natural gas liquids worldwide was worth USD 18.3 billion in 2022. It is expected to grow at a CAGR 5.27% between 2023 and 2030.Natural gas liquids (NGL), which are natural gas components, are liquids that have been separated from the gas state. This happens in a field facility, or at a gas processing station through absorption, condensation, and other methods. Hydrocarbons, also known as natural gas liquids, are a family of molecules, including crude oil and natural gas. They are made exclusively from carbon and hydrogen. There are many types of natural gas liquids, and many applications for NGL products. Natural gas liquids produce Ethane and propane as well as butane and isobutane. NGLs can be used in many sectors of the economy.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-natural-gas-liquids-market-qy/438561/#requestforsampleNGLs can be used to fuel vehicles, as well as being inputs to petrochemical plants. The rise in crude oil prices has led to an increase in NGL prices. This in turn has encouraged drilling in NGL-rich liquids. Although the chemical compositions of these hydrocarbons are similar, their uses vary greatly. The largest percentage of NGL field production is occupied by ethylene. It is almost exclusively used to make ethylene, which can then be turned into plastics. While most of the propane is used for heating, a large amount is also used as petrochemical feedstock. Autogas, a mixture of propane and butane is used in certain parts of Europe, Turkey and Australia. Natural gasoline (pentanes+) can be mixed into different types of fuel for combustion engines and is useful in energy recover from oil sands wells.Ethane

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818147,How Fintech is Revolutionizing Banking for Millennials?,"Millennials, also referred to as the “digital generation,” have distinct financial needs and preferences from previous generations. They value convenience, accessibility, and technology above all else – which is why they have turned towards fintech banking solutions for their financial requirements.Traditional banks must embrace fintech solutions in order to remain relevant and meet the evolving demands of millennials. They are using advanced technology to offer a range of digital financial products and services and to gain a competitive advantage. In this blog, we will discuss how the adoption of fintech is revolutionalizing the banking system for millennials.Mobile banking has become an integral part of modern banking, and fintech companies are leading the charge. Millennials value convenience and flexibility, which mobile banking provides in spades. Fintech firms are using advanced technology to offer convenient access to various banking services that can be accessed anywhere at any time – such as deposits, bill payments, money transfers, and more – making these services invaluable for consumers everywhere.Fintech companies are utilizing data analytics and artificial intelligence to offer tailored banking services to millennials. By analyzing a user’s spending habits, financial goals, and other factors, fintech companies can provide tailored recommendations for financial products and services. This personalized approach helps millennials better manage their finances and reach their financial objectives.Digital wallets are now becoming increasingly popular with millennials as a convenient and secure way to make payments. Fintech companies are offering digital wallets that store all payment information – credit and debit cards included – in one secure location. These digital wallets can be used for making payments online, in-store, or even through peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers.Robo-advisors are automated investment platforms that use algorithms to provide investment advice and manage portfolios. As millennials increasingly look towards robo-advisors for their investment needs, these low-cost platforms provide an accessible way of investing that meets everyone’s financial capabilities. Fintech companies are using robo-advisors to offer investment services that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial background. This creates a win-win situation for everyone.Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that utilizes encryption techniques to control unit production and transfer of funds. Millennials are more likely to adopt cryptocurrency than other generations, so fintech companies are providing services tailored towards this demand. These businesses provide trading, investment, and storage options for cryptocurrency holders so it becomes easier for them to engage in investing in it.Banks are offering mobile banking apps to cater to the mobile-first preferences of millennials. The apps are intuitive and offer a seamless user experience with features like mobile deposit, bill payment, and budgeting tools. Real-time alerts and notifications are also provided to keep millennials updated on their account activity.Contactless payments are being embraced by banks to meet the needs of millennials who are leading this trend. Easy and secure contactless payment options are provided through the integration of mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Contactless debit and credit cards are also being issued by banks to make transactions faster and more convenient.Banks are leveraging fintech to provide personalized financial advice to millennials who value it when it comes to managing their finances. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms are used to analyze customer data and provide tailored recommendations. These can include personalized investment options, debt management plans, and savings goals.To cater to the preferences of millennials who prefer a quick and easy account opening process that can be completed online, banks are using fintech to automate the process. The account opening time has been reduced from days to minutes through the use of eKYC (electronic know your customer) and digital signatures. This also reduces the paperwork and administrative burden for banks.Banks are using fintech to analyze customer data and offer personalized rewards and incentives that cater to the individual needs of millennials. Cashback rewards for specific spending categories, exclusive discounts on partner brands, and travel rewards are some of the personalized rewards and incentives being offered.To address the high concern of millennials about cybersecurity and data privacy, banks are implementing robust cybersecurity measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and fraud detection algorithms. They are also educating their customers on cybersecurity best practices to reduce the risk of cyberattacks.In conclusion, fintech is now an unstoppable force that is reshaping the financial industry and has the potential to create a more inclusive and accessible financial system for everyone.As fintech continues to expand, we can expect even greater disruption in the financial industry from tech-savvy fintech firms. On the positive side, this disruption also presents new opportunities for collaboration between traditional financial institutions and fintech businesses, leading to greater innovation and efficient financial services.",2023/02/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818165,N Korea calls UN chief's remarks on missile test 'unfair',"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Wednesday accused U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of “an extremely unfair and imbalanced attitude,” as it lambasted him for condemning its recent missile test but ignoring alleged U.S. hostility against the North.

            The accusation came as U.S., South Korean and Japanese destroyers were holding trilateral anti-missile training near the Korean Peninsula, a move the North could regard as a provocation.

            After the North’s intercontinental ballistic missile test on Saturday, Guterres strongly condemned the launch and reiterated his call for the North to immediately desist from making any further provocations. In a statement, Guterres also urged North Korea to resume talks on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.











            “To be most deplorable, the U.N. secretary-general is going on the rampage of illogical and miserable remarks, which are little different from those of U.S. State Department officials over the years,” Kim Son Gyong, the North’s vice foreign minister for international bodies, said in a statement carried by state media.

            Kim said North Korea’s ICBM test was a response to the security threat the U.S. posed to the North by temporarily deploying long-range bombers for joint training with South Korea earlier this year. Kim said the test was also a warning to the earlier convocation of the U.N. Security Council on the North.

            North Korea views U.S.-South Korea military drills as an invasion rehearsal and is particularly sensitive to the U.S. mobilization of B-1B bombers that can carry a massive conventional payload of both guided and unguided weapons. After the North’s ICBM test, the United States flew B-1B bombers again for separate drills with South Korean and Japanese warplanes.

            “The U.N. secretary-general should clearly understand that his unreasonable and prejudiced stand on the Korean Peninsula issue is acting as a factor inciting the hostile acts of the U.S. and its followers against (North Korea),” Kim said.

            Last November, North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called Guterres “a puppet of the United States” for condemning an earlier ICBM test by the North.

            Saturday’s ICBM test, the North’s first missile test since Jan. 1, was made on a steep angle to avoid neighboring countries. The reported launch details again suggested the North has missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland. But many foreign experts say the North still must master some last remaining technologies to acquire functioning nuclear-tipped missiles, such as one shielding missiles from the harsh conditions during atmospheric reentry.

            In response to the latest U.S. deployment of B1-B bombers on Sunday, North Korea said its 600-millimeter multiple rocket launcher fired two rounds off its east coast the next day. North Korea has said its rockets can carry nuclear warheads. South Korea views the weapons as a short-range ballistic missile.

            In a closed-door briefing at parliament Wednesday, South Korea’s military intelligence authorities said that North Korea could conduct further provocations such as a nuclear test, a spy satellite launch or an ICBM test on a standard trajectory, according to Yoo Sang-bum, a lawmaker who attended the meeting.

            South Korea and the United States are to hold a set of joint military drills in coming weeks, including a table-top exercise set to take place at the Pentagon on Wednesday.

            The U.S.-South Korea-Japan exercise Wednesday took place in international waters off the Korean Peninsula’s east coast. The three countries were meant to practice procedures to detect, track and intercept missiles while sharing related information among themselves, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. It was their first trilateral training in four months.

            Last year, North Korea test-launched more than 70 missiles, the most ever in a single year, as part of its efforts to enlarge its weapons arsenal. Observers say the North would eventually want to win international recognition as a legitimate nuclear state and use that status as a way to get U.N. and other international sanctions on it lifted.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea on Wednesday accused U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818194,Taiwan troops to train in US at battalion-level for 1st time in history,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Troops from the Army will reportedly go to the U.S. for exchanges at the battalion level for the first time in history in the second half of this year.Sources familiar with the matter were cited by CNA saying the Army's 542nd Armor Brigade and the 333rd Combined Arms Battalion (CAB) will go to the U.S. for exchanges in the second half of this year. This will mark the first time Taiwanese troops have been dispatched to the U.S. at the battalion level.In the past, Taiwanese troops were only sent to the U.S. at the platoon level or at most the company level. However, the Army Command Headquarters said all military exchanges with foreign forces are handled in accordance with planning, and it declined to comment further on the details provided in the media report.After a meeting with a Congressional delegation at the presidential office on Tuesday (Feb. 21) led by U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, President Tsai said ""Taiwan and the United States continue to bolster military exchanges."" She also emphasized that ""Taiwan will step up cooperation with the United States and other democratic partners to confront such global challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change.""Tsai did not specify what these future military exchanges would entail, but stressed that now is the time to ""explore even more opportunities for cooperation"" between Taiwan and the U.S.The reported plan to send battalion level Taiwanese soldiers could be an example of the military exchanges Tsai had referred to the day before.",2023/02/22,4745,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818204,Nearly 1 million asylum requests in the EU in 2022,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Nearly 1 million people applied for international protection in the European Union in 2022, according to data published Wednesday, bringing the number of asylum requests to a level not seen since the refugee crisis of 2015-2016.

            The EU agency for asylum said 966,000 asylum applications were made in the 27 EU countries as well as in Norway and Switzerland last year, up 50% from 2021. That doesn't include more than 4 million Ukrainian refugees who were granted temporary protection in the EU, a special mechanism activated to avoid collapsing already backlogged asylum systems.

            The European agency linked the increase to continuing easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions, increasing food insecurity and conflicts in many parts of the world. Though most asylum-seekers enter the EU legally, mainly by plane with travel visas, some also crossed the EU's land and sea borders without permission, mainly through the Western Balkans and the Mediterranean.











            After more than a decade of war and economic collapse in their country, Syrians continued to be the top nationality of asylum-seekers in Europe with more than 130,000 applications. They were followed closely by Afghans fleeing the spiraling security, humanitarian and financial troubles that followed the Taliban takeover in August 2021, with 129,000 requests.

            Coming in third were applicants from Turkey who doubled in numbers with 55,000 requests. Soaring inflation and “democratic backsliding” were among the factors believed to have caused the increase, the agency said. 

            In many places, reception centers are overwhelmed, leaving asylum-seekers in the streets.

            The recent earthquake that killed nearly 46,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless in Turkey and Syria has raised fears of a potential surge in irregular border crossings into Greece. Germany offered earlier this month to temporarily ease visa restrictions to some quake survivors while Spain promised to resettle a small group of 100 vulnerable Syrian refugees from Turkey, which is home to 4 million refugees. 

            Venezuelans, Colombians, Bangladeshis and Georgians applied for asylum in record numbers last year, as did Moroccans, Tunisians and Egyptians. Some 4% of asylum-seekers in 2022 claimed to be unaccompanied minors.

            The European agency didn't say which EU countries received the most applications last year. But an internal EU migration report seen by the Associated Press lists Germany, France, Spain, Austria and Italy as the top five.

            Asylum authorities issued decisions on more than 600,000 applications last year but they received even more new cases, adding to the existing backlog. Of the applications analyzed, 40% were granted refugee status or subsidiary protection, mostly for Syrian, Belarusian, Eritrean, Yemeni, and Malian applicants, as well as for most of the Ukrainians who chose to apply for asylum instead of temporary protection.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818206,OPPO Launches Find N2 Flip Globally Marking A New Benchmark for Flip Phones,"OPPO Find N2 Flip announced for global markets     Find N2 Flip combines a revolutionary vertical cover screen – the largest of its kind, with a long-lasting, fast-charging battery and a host of flagship experiences    LONDON, UK -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 - OPPO, the world's leading smart device brand, today announced the global availability of its Find N2 Flip. Combining the largest cover screen of its kind with day-long battery life and SUPERVOOC flash charging, Find N2 Flip takes foldables from the fringes to the forefront in a compact, sleek, awesome way.                         The new OPPO Find N2 Flip puts an industry-leading cover screen into palms and pockets, challenging what we've come to expect from small form-factor foldables. Despite its light weight and pocketable size, Find N2 Flip's vertical cover screen turns OPPO's debut flip phone into an incredible photography tool. The tall cover screen also features powerful widgets that help users stay on top of their notifications, and it's big enough to showcase meaningful information, so there's no need to open your flip phone constantly.   Empowered by world-class hardware, a flagship camera system with a Sony IMX890 sensor, MediaTek Dimensity 9000+ power, ultra-fast dual-SIM 5G connectivity, and best-in-class charging speeds, Find N2 Flip marks the start of a new chapter for OPPO and flip phones on the whole.   ""Every aspect of Find N2 Flip reflects OPPO's mission to enrich real-world experiences. We combined industry-leading engineering and innovation with intuitive design principles. So Find N2 Flip's design is burdenless – each component moving in harmony, as it marries a powerful cover screen with a compromise-free package, elevated by subtle, rich flourishes.""   Pete Lau, SVP and Chief Product Officer, OPPO   Redefining the Cover Screen   Measuring 3.26 inches, Find N2 Flip's cover screen is the largest of any flip phone currently available. Its extra size makes everything easier to do, so the big screen is a bona fide fumble-free zone, whether taking selfies or checking notifications.   Its vertical orientation is also game-changing, allowing the cover screen to display as many as six notifications in one view – that's industry-leading for a flip phone.   Quickly reply to messages in mainstream messenger apps, toggle settings, record a voice note, answer a call and more – all without picking up or opening your phone. And with less need to engage fully, you can regain control over your digital balance while staying connected.            Balancing its useful features with fun, playful moments, Find N2 Flip's cover screen is also home to one of five interactive pets. Choose between a bird, cat, dog, hamster or rabbit, and you'll have company whenever you fire it up. From playful to laugh-out-loud, set a GIF as your cover screen wallpaper for memes on loop, and if you're a Bitmoji fan, your sticker pack can be your AOD (always-on display). In addition to Bitmoji and OMOJI stickers, the AOD also displays helpful insights: the time, date, power status, and notifications.   Rather than create a loud, attention-grabbing aesthetic for Find N2 Flip's design, OPPO dialled down the visual volume, so the phone's style acts as a backdrop upon which the cover screen shines.            With polished aluminium sides, a fingerprint-resistant glass cover and a unique micro-etched wave pattern across the hinge, while Find N2 Flip has a simplified design, it feels rich in the hand and is available in two colours: Astral Black and Moonlit Purple.   Weighing just 191g and measuring 7.45mm when open, Find N2 Flip is thin and light, and with its micro-arc, precision curved glass back cover, it feels like it truly belongs in your hand, whether open or closed.   And as you use the phone, its immense 6.8-inch E6 AMOLED display is picture perfect, with its cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio and smooth 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Viewability is also excellent across environments thanks to an advanced Anti-Reflection film and up to 1600 nits of brightness.   The Best Flip Phone Camera   Find N2 Flip's flagship 50MP main camera features a large Sony IMX890 sensor with an f/1.8 lens – a strong foundation for incredible imaging.   See more and capture with confidence, as the largest cover screen of any flip phone gives you the clearest selfie preview available. And if you're taking a photo or video of someone else, fire up Dual Preview so they can see how they look.   Find N2 Flip's 17:9 aspect ratio cover screen is the same vertical orientation as your phone's camera sensor, keeping cropping to a minimum for maximum detail.   Unlock even more creativity with FlexForm Mode, made possible by the New Generation Flexion Hinge, as Find N2 Flip holds its position mid-fold between 45º and 110º for waist-level dynamic angles, and evocative 4K time-lapse video.            FlexForm Mode also turns your flip phone into a tripod-steady, hands-free camera. Just part-fold it, place it on a surface and then trigger the shutter release with an open palm gesture – perfect for group shots. It also harnesses the power of the 32MP selfie camera. With its Sony IMX709 sensor, autofocus, and wide-angle lens, rest the phone down for a high-quality hands-free video call, with FlexForm mode optimized for apps like WhatsApp and Zoom.   Co-developed with the legendary camera manufacturer Hasselblad, Find N2 Flip captures pro-grade colours, a fully featured Professional Mode, and its unique XPAN mode freezes time in a wide, cinematic frame.   Much more than just a photography champion, Find N2 Flip's in-house imaging NPU, MariSilicon X, boosts night video to capture ultra-clear 4K footage in low light, and you can also hold the phone part-folded and sideways, just like a camcorder for a steadier grip.   Tested to over 400,000 folds   Much of what makes Find N2 Flip incredible is made possible by its New Generation Flexion Hinge, which works in harmony with the main display to create a robust, folding screen with an incredibly subtle crease.   The hinge's miniaturized design is made up of fewer components than the original Flexion Hinge, and in its intricate simplicity, OPPO has achieved a new standard of mechanical stability. The New Generation Flexion Hinge is also more compact than ever, creating more space for a larger cover screen and a higher-capacity, faster-charging battery.   Just as with Find N and Find N2, there is no hinge gap when you close the Find N2 Flip, so it keeps dust out, and OPPO appointed TÜV Rhineland to test its durability independently. The phone is certified to withstand over 400,000 folds and unfolds at standard room temperature. That's equivalent to opening and closing the phone around 100 times a day for more than ten years, and it's also tested up to 100,000 times at 50ºC and 95 per cent humidity, and at -20ºC.            OPPO also iterated its New Generation Flexion Hinge to guide the screen into the gentlest folding angle possible, creating a waterdrop shaped fold that results in a significantly shallower, narrower crease than other flip phones when unfolded. In addition to being incredibly subtle to the eye, it also feels virtually imperceptible to the touch for an uncompromised, flat-screen experience.   The Longest Lasting and Fastest Charging Flip Phone   Find N2 Flip crams a massive 4,300mAh battery into its compact body. This is the biggest battery in any flip phone by a huge margin.   A long-lasting battery is the result of continuous efforts to redesign everything from the hinge to the SIM tray, eking out as much space as possible to add just a few more milliamp hours of power with every iota of space saved.            OPPO also worked closely with MediaTek to create an optimized version of its flagship Dimensity 9000+ chipset for Find N2 Flip. These efforts result in one more hour of video calling, two more hours of social media and five hours of music streaming.   In fact, according to our tests, Find N2 Flip is the first flip phone to confidently offer a full day of use on a single charge – critical in popularizing the category on the whole.   OPPO also includes the fastest charging of any flip phone on Find N2 Flip – 44W SUPERVOOC, taking the battery from nearly empty to 50 per cent in just 23 minutes, and up to 100 per cent in less than one hour.   In summary, Find N2 Flip breaks through barriers with the largest cover screen on any flip phone. With it, world-class selfies and flagship photography experiences are made possible.   Robust enough for over a decade of folding, and with all-day power and fast charging, durability and battery anxiety will be little more than a memory as Find N2 Flip marks the start of a new chapter for foldables and smartphones at large.   Price and availability   OPPO Find N2 Flip will be available to pre-order from 15 February and will cost £849 in UK.   Hashtag: #OPPO

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818232,Cushman & Wakefield's Response to Budget 2023/24,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 -   Response to Budget 2023/24 by Mr KK Chiu, International Director, Chief Executive, Greater China of Cushman & Wakefield:    Land policy    Housing has always been a major concern for Hong Kong citizens, Cushman & Wakefield is pleased to see the Government is actively creating land to increase the land supply in the market. As mentioned in the Budget, 12 residential sites are covered in the 2023-24 Land Sale Programme, and it is estimated that the potential land supply for the whole year will provide 20550 units. However, in view of recent failure of Government land sales bids, Cushman & Wakefield suggests that the Government review standard land price and bidding price to make sure they are on par with market situation.   Cushman & Wakefield agrees that the Northern Metro Area is a new engine for the future development of Hong Kong. To accelerate the development of the area, we suggest that the Government set up phased indicators for new development areas in Yuen Long South and Hung Shui Kiu in order to speed up their planning and development. We also suggest that the Government prioritise on land consolidation and planning of industrial park construction.   Light Public Housing    The Government has identified 8 sites for the construction of Light Public Housing, Cushman and Wakefield agrees this measure could fill the short-term gap of public housing supply. At the same time, in order to address the public's concerns over recovery of land designated for light public housing, we suggest that the Government publish a clear timeline for land recovery, and may consider putting some of the light public housing sites on the land requisition list. This will convey a clear message to the market that ""the sites currently planned for the light public housing are only temporary"", thereby giving the public confidence that the sites will be put back on the market again in the near future.   Response to Budget 2023/24 by Mr John Siu, Managing Director, Cushman & Wakefield Hong Kong    Logistics land use    With the Financial Secretary proposing in his Budget Speech to further promote Hong Kong as an international maritime center and a ""smart port"", Cushman & Wakefield believes that more logistics sites will need to be reserved to support import/export and storage of goods in the future. We suggest that the Government could consider relocating the existing brownfield operators to suitable logistics sites in the Northern Metropolis, to better consolidate and enhance the land usage within the area.   Nevertheless, land sales driven by public tenders might push up development costs and rents, making them less affordable for the existing brownfield operators. Currently, warehouse rents in Hong Kong increase annually by around 5%. Whilst the monthly rents of modern multi-story warehouses/industrial buildings range between $12 and $17 psf (in terms of GFA; efficiency ratio around 50% to 70%), those in brownfield sites in the New Territories range from $13 to $15 psf (in terms of saleable area), creating a rental gap of around 50%.   Data Center    We are pleased to see the Government committing resources and introducing various measures to promote the development of smart cities and a digital economy. The data center industry is one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong's digital economy, and we suggest that the Government should adopt a progressive approach and release data center sites, of about 200,000 to 300,000 sq feet, in popular data centers areas, such as Kwai Chung, Tsuen Wan, Tsing Yi, Sha Tin, Fanling and Tseung Kwan O, every one to two years according to the market demand-supply dynamics, to attract more data center operators to set up in Hong Kong and develop Hong Kong into an international data center hub.   We also advise that the Lands Department should consider waiving the requirement to build a public car park in the Conditions of Sale for data center sites. The government departments should also liaise in advance with the power supply providers to ensure sufficient electricity supply for the site, so as to enable the data center to have a reliable and stable supply of electricity upon completion.   Response to Budget 2023/24 by Ms Rosanna Tang, Executive Director, Head of Research, Hong Kong of Cushman & Wakefield:    Housing market prediction and stamp duties   Cushman & Wakefield supports the Government's adjustments to the value bands of the ad valorem stamp duty(AVD), easing the burden on ordinary families and first-time buyers on purchasing their first residential properties through the broadening of the AVD (Second Standard Rate) bands, particularly small and medium residential units under HK$ 10 million. Although house prices have experienced a downturn over the past three years due to the on-going pandemic, with resumption of cross-border travel between Hong Kong and the Mainland this year, it is expected that both the macro-economy and buyer's sentiment will improve. We had noticed a gradual pick-up in house viewings and transactions in the market. With the Government's adjustments of the AVD, Cushman & Wakefield is expecting the overall property prices will rebound by 5-10% in 1H23.   Response to Budget 2023/24 by Mr Kevin Lam, Head of Retail Services, Hong Kong of Cushman & Wakefield:    Digital Consumption Voucher    We are pleased with a re-run of the consumption voucher scheme which will give a boost to local F&B and consumption and speed up the recovery of the retail market.   International events to attract visitors could help reviving the shop market    As Hong Kong and the rest of the world lift all travel restrictions and gradually ease pandemic measures, Cushman & Wakefield supports the government in setting aside $100 million for holding more megaevents to attract visits and promote tourism in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Tourism Board to spend more than $250 million to continue to organise and promote the megaevents. We remain conservative yet optimistic about retail rent this year but will need to evaluate changes in the spending pattern of mainland and overseas visitors. We expect more apparent changes in retail rent in 2H23.   Promote Urban Sports    We are pleased to welcome the government's support for the further promotion of urban sports.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818284,"Philippines eyes South China Sea patrols with US, Australia","MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines is in talks with the United States as well as Australia on future joint patrols in the South China Sea, where China's increasingly aggressive actions in the disputed waters are causing concern, top defense officials in the three nations said Wednesday.

            U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called his Philippine counterpart, Carlito Galvez Jr., to reiterate Washington’s support and commitment to help defend its oldest treaty ally in Asia after a Chinese coast guard aimed a military-grade laser at a Philippine patrol vessel near a disputed shoal.

            The Feb. 6 incident off Second Thomas Shoal briefly blinded some of the Filipino crew and prompted Manila to file a strongly worded diplomatic protest. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. also summoned China’s ambassador to express his concern.











            “The two leaders discussed proposals to deepen operational cooperation and enhance the United States and the Philippines’ shared security, including the recent decision to resume combined maritime activities in the South China Sea,” according to details of the phone conversation provided by Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder.

            During Austin's visit to Manila this month, Galvez and U.S. officials had said the allies agreed to carry out joint patrols. 

            Separately, Galvez and visiting Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a news conference on Wednesday that they were looking at Australian and Philippine forces possibly carrying out their joint patrols in the busy waterway.

            As countries asserting the rule of law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, in the South China Sea, where a bulk of Australia’s trade traverses, “we did talk today about the possibility of exploring joint patrols,” Marles said, without elaborating.

            Australian and Philippine forces have undertaken joint patrols off the southern Philippines in the past to counter terrorist threats, Galvez said, and added, “We can do it again.""

            Aside from the United States, Australia is the only other country that struck a defense agreement with the Philippines for joint combat exercises in the country. The Philippine Constitution prohibits the permanent basing of foreign troops and their involvement in local combat.

            Austin announced after meeting Marcos on Feb. 2 that the Philippines had approved an expanded U.S. military presence by allowing rotating batches of U.S. forces to stay in four more Philippine military camps, in addition to five others. 

            It was the latest move by the Biden administration to strengthen an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter China, including in any future confrontation over Taiwan.

            Austin reaffirmed in his talk with Galvez on Wednesday the U.S. Defense Department’s “commitment to bolstering the Philippines’ defense capabilities and capacity to resist coercion as the allies develop a security-sector assistance roadmap.” No details of the mutual security plan were immediately provided.

            China opposes military activities involving the U.S. and its allies, especially in the South China Sea, and has warned Washington not to meddle in what it says is a purely Asian dispute. 

            Chinese forces have protested the presence of U.S. Navy ships and fighter jets that have been enforcing freedom of movement in the contested waters. The U.S. military insists it would exercise its rights under international law to sail and fly in international waters.

            In Jakarta, visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang said on Wednesday that China would work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is currently led by Indonesia, to hasten negotiations on a proposed nonaggression pact, which is designed to avoid armed confrontations in the South China Sea.

            “China and Indonesia will work with other ASEAN countries to … accelerate consultations on a code of conduct in the South China Sea, and jointly maintain the peace and stability in the South China Sea fully and effectively.” Gang said in an online press conference.

            The highly secretive talks between China and the 10-nation ASEAN, whose four members are locked in territorial conflicts with Beijing over the strategic waterway, have faced years of delay, including during the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

            China and the regional bloc have agreed to speed up the negotiations this year but it's unclear how they can overcome key differences, including which areas should be covered by the pact and whether the agreement should be legally binding.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818303,Letter to Editor: Round-the-clock Taipei MRT service worth considering,"Public transportation is at the forefront of many minds when considering Taipei's standing as a convenient place to live and work, or is it?Taipei boasts a state-of-the-art MRT system that spans 152.9 kilometers of track, incorporates over six dedicated MRT lines, services 131 stations — and continues to expand since its inception over 25 years ago. However, it is rather inconvenient and even counterproductive for many who wish to use it, as the hours of operation and service are rather limited.From an economic, logistical and competitive standpoint, this hinders regional connectivity, mobility, and growth. It could even be said to contribute to adverse effects, such as disincentivizing people from using sustainable public transit.While many urban centers across the world are aggressively incentivizing and implementing car-free, pedestrian friendly walkable cities, we have a long way to go here. Especially in a region where accessibility to many of our businesses and points of commerce are limited to only foot traffic.Every day, in Taiwan's economical, political and cultural hub, those who do the real work to keep this place running while we sleep are left behind and forgotten. Service workers, store clerks, nurses, security personnel, and countless others who commute to and from work are left with limited or no options, which their nine-to-five counterparts get to take advantage of. Furthermore, many others who live, work and play at night are also substantially hindered.There is no logic in taking a single trip on a roundtrip journey. More specifically, by the time many wish to return home, they are left stranded, in some cases with limited transit options that are unsustainable and overpriced.Taxis, in particular, are not only uneconomical, especially for low-wage workers. Also, the reckless driving of many who drive them make this city a more dangerous place to live and commute in for all of us and should only be used as a last resort.If a year-round, 24-hour MRT schedule was implemented, even with frequency limited from 30 minutes up to an hour between trains, to ensure quality and safety, it would remove tens of thousands of unnecessary cars and scooters off the road per day. Furthermore, it would further complement the already existing alternative modes of public transit, most notably the city's YouBike system. Not to mention save millions of tons of pollution annually and improve the poor air quality of the region.Another inconvenient truth is the Greater Taipei region is also in the midst of a housing crisis that grows worse by the day, to the point of it being a national crisis and furthering the economic divide. The majority of residents throughout the region are being battered by the crippling high cost of living in the region brought on by an overinflated housing market.Greater access to affordable and sustainable transport options around the clock will ensure greater economic equality, so that all residents will benefit.Greater access to citywide transit will also spur greater access to employment across the board. This would not only generate millions in regional economic development, it would also save individuals thousands of hours and millions of dollars per year in unsustainable and wasteful commutes.Furthermore, and most importantly, it would also help curb the countless traffic accidents and prevent injury and death. Both the monetary and human benefits would far outweigh any investment in implementing and maintaining alternatives.This is one major step Taipei can take toward setting a better example and one day join the ranks of New York, Chicago, Tokyo, Melbourne, and Copenhagen, which have all had 24-hour transit models since their inception. With ridership already hitting peaks throughout the city on New Year's Eve, there's no doubt the demand already exists.Also, with newly elected Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-An (蔣萬安) already taking more action to improve transit infrastructure and traffic safety than his predecessors by addressing the ""living hell"" traffic conditions, why stop there?While 24-hour service may not be attainable at this point, extended hours of service may be a good start. If, as a region and a society, we are supposed to give up our cars and scooters in favor of becoming more dependent upon public transit — the right move — it must also be that much more reliable as a transit mode.The infrastructure is already in place, the existing system needs to live up to and utilize its full potential.Chapin Routh is the founder and owner of Sapphire City Selex.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818321,Global Refractory Market Latest Technological Innovations in Upcoming years 2023-2030,"Global Refractory Market Report focuses on Industry Size, Share and Development, Growth, Key Players, Demand Forecast to 2030.Global Refractory Market research report provides information about the current and future market prospects and helps in understanding the business opportunities. Global study on “Refractory” provides a comprehensive assessment of the market’s current and future state.The global refractories market was valued in USD 24.52 billion 2022. It is projected to grow to USD 34.83 trillion by 2030. This will be a 4.83 percent CAGR over the forecast period 2023-2030.Refractory materials are those that resist heat, pressure, or chemical attack and can form at high temperatures. Inorganic, heterogeneous and porous refractories can be composed of oxides, nitrides, carbides, etc. Ceramic materials that can withstand temperatures exceeding 1,000°F (538°C) are called refractories. They are used to cover hot surfaces in a variety of industrial processes.Request for a sample report here: https://market.biz/report/global-refractory-market-qy/490336/#requestforsampleRefractory materials are the primary material used in the iron and steel industries. These industries use refractory monolithics to heat control the manufacturing process of iron and steel. Refractory solutions are also needed for other purposes in the iron and steel industry. To heat steel, furnace lining is required to transport and hold the slag, metal and hot gases. These factors are driving the market’s growth and increasing the demand for refractories.As the power generation industry expands, so does the need for refractory installations companies. Because any type of power supply power to the globe involves multiple processes, An expert refractory contractor is required to control the heat processes. To extract energy from coal, for example, you need strong boiler refractory to prevent thermal shocks. Specific refractory castings are required for Petrochemical, Refineries, and Chemical Plants. It can preserve the refinery and hydrocarbon processes that are involved in these operations. The right solutions can reduce the refractory liner consumption. You can find these solutions in catalytic reactions, fired heaters and sulfur burners as well as gasifiers. These plants also need to plan for reducing running costs and reducing their carbon footprint. They require long-term stability in refractory lines.If it is exposed in excess, however, refractory materials like silica, ceramic fibres, and alumina pose a danger to human beings. The prolonged exposure to ceramic fiber-based, refractory material can cause irritation of the respiratory system and skin problems. Inhaling very small particles of silica can cause serious health problems, including silicosis and even death. These factors are major market inhibitors that hinder market growth.Shaped Refractories

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818330,Germany expels 2 Iranian diplomats over death sentence,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany said Wednesday that it is expelling two Iranian diplomats over the death sentence imposed in Iran against one of its citizens.

            
                Authorities in Iran announced Tuesday that Jamshid Sharmahd, a 67-year-old Iranian-German national and U.S. resident, was sentenced to death after being convicted of terrorist activities. 

            Iran claims Sharmahd is the leader of the armed wing of a group advocating the restoration of the monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but his family say he was merely the spokesman for the opposition group and deny he was involved in any attacks.











            German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires in Berlin and informed him that “we will not accept this massive breach of a German citizen’s rights.”

            “As a consequence the German government has declared two members of the Iranian embassy unwanted persons and asked them to leave Germany at short notice,” she said. “We demand that Iran revokes the death sentence against Jamshid Sharmahd and allows him to have an appeal that is fair and in line with the rule of law.”

            Baerbock has said that Sharmahd, who lives in Glendora, California, did not have “even the beginning of a fair trial” and that consular access and access to the trial had been repeatedly denied. She has also alleged that he had been arrested “under highly questionable circumstances,” without elaborating.

            
                Sharmahd's family accuse Iranian intelligence of abducting him from Dubai in 2020. 

            The official website of Iran’s judiciary said Sharmahd was convicted of plotting terrorist activities. He was tried in a Revolutionary Court, where proceedings are held behind closed doors and where rights groups say defendants are unable to choose their lawyers or see the evidence against them.

            The death sentence — which can be appealed — comes against the backdrop of months of anti-government protests in Iran sparked by the death of a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating the country's strict Islamic dress code.

            The protesters have called for the overthrow of the country’s ruling clerics. Monarchists based outside Iran support the protests, as do other groups and individuals with different ideologies.

            Security forces have attacked the demonstrators with live ammunition, bird shot and batons, rights groups say. At least 530 protesters have been killed and nearly 20,000 people have been arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group monitoring the unrest.

            Iranian authorities have blamed the protests on hostile foreign powers, without providing evidence, and have not released official figures for those killed or arrested.

            
                Iran has executed four men accused of violence linked to the protests, and activists say at least 16 others have been sentenced to death.BERLIN (AP) — Germany said Wednesday that it is expelling two Iranian diplomats over the death sentence imposed in Iran against one of its citizens.Authorities in Iran announced Tuesday that Jamshid Sharmahd, a 67-year-old Iranian-German national and U.S. resident, was sentenced to death after being convicted of terrorist activities.Iran claims Sharmahd is the leader of the armed wing of a group advocating the restoration of the monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but his family say he was merely the spokesman for the opposition group and deny he was involved in any attacks.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said she summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires in Berlin and informed him that “we will not accept this massive breach of a German citizen’s rights.”“As a consequence the German government has declared two members of the Iranian embassy unwanted persons and asked them to leave Germany at short notice,” she said. “We demand that Iran revokes the death sentence against Jamshid Sharmahd and allows him to have an appeal that is fair and in line with the rule of law.”Baerbock has said that Sharmahd, who lives in Glendora, California, did not have “even the beginning of a fair trial” and that consular access and access to the trial had been repeatedly denied.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818331,Korea's Hybe completes purchase of 14.8% stake in rival SM,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS, said Wednesday that it has completed its acquisition of a 14.8% stake in rival SM Entertainment, making it SM’s largest single shareholder.

            The acquisition was finalized even as SM Entertainment accused Hybe staging a hostile takeover to control the firm by purchasing shares from Lee Soo-man, SM’s founder. Lee's influence in the firm has waned after an activist fund successfully campaigned for stricter oversight of its corporate governance.

            Hybe earlier said it plans to purchase a further 25% of SM shares from investors at 120,000 won per share, which would take its total stake to almost 40%.











            In an open letter to “fans, artists, employees and shareholders” of SM Entertainment on Wednesday, Hybe CEO Park Jiwon said that SM will move to become a company with a “transparent governance structure that prioritizes shareholder value.”

            SM will be given “complete autonomy” when it comes to creative work akin to the other labels operated by Hybe, he said.

            He said Hybe would also actively support SM artists’ endeavors. SM is behind popular K-pop acts such as boy-group NCT and girl-group aespa.

            On Monday, SM’s CFO Jang Cheol-hyuk published a YouTube video criticizing Hybe’s takeover bid, arguing that such a move would lead to a monopolization of the industry, rising costs for fans. SM’s artists might be at a disadvantage to Hybe’s artists, he said.

            Combined, both SM and Hybe account for 70% of revenues from albums and digital music in the K-pop industry.

            “A lot of indicators of market share imply that HYBE’s acquisition of SM will undermine fair competition, which clearly shows that this acquisition is unfair,” Jang said. “Ultimately, K-pop fans will be the ones that will be most affected by the monopoly.”

            Hybe’s bid for a bigger stake in SM came days after technology firm Kakao Corp said it would buy a 9.05% stake in SM through a rights offering and convertible shares and become a strategic partner of SM. SM had planned to expand its IP monetization and leverage Kakao’s messaging, social and entertainment platforms.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS, said Wednesday that it has completed its acquisition of a 14.8% stake in rival SM Entertainment, making it SM’s largest single shareholder.The acquisition was finalized even as SM Entertainment accused Hybe staging a hostile takeover to control the firm by purchasing shares from Lee Soo-man, SM’s founder.

PUTRAJAYA, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 22 February 2023 - Following the launch of Hilton’s Sustainability MICE Series in 2022 which focused on food sustainability, Hilton hosted the second installation of the series titled: “The Heart of Hospitality: Wellness”.       Image: Participants of Hilton MICE Sustainability Series: The Heart of Hospitality, Wellness together with Eugene Oelofse, Marketing and Communications Director of Hilton, Malaysia, Philippines and Sri Lanka and Ian Barrow, General Manager of DoubleTree by Hilton Putrajaya Lakeside.     Over two days, delegates from the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Events) industry experienced an immersive wellness journey at the DoubleTree by Hilton Putrajaya Lakeside. The showcase featured a thoughtfully curated selection of workshops focused on the ""body, mind, and spirit"". Attendees were able to indulge in everything from healthy food choices to breathwork and in-room experiences.   The event also reinforced Hilton’s ‘Travel with Purpose’ Program, which offers meeting planners tools to make a big impression with attendees while making a better impact on the world. It demonstrated that infusing wellness into MICE events creates deeper connections and impactful takeaways.   ""As with every Hilton brand, we design each hotel with several options for our MICE customers, paired with Hilton’s responsible hospitality at the highest standards. As hoteliers, we have always recognised the value wellness brings to individuals. With recent world events, now more than ever, elements of body, mind and spirit are necessities, not luxury. Through this showcase, we are delighted to be leading the way in delivering exceptional guest experiences,” expressed Leo Lee, National Director of Sales, Hilton Malaysia.   Traditional meetings and conferences can leave delegates feeling drained, which is why this experience was designed to be customized to enhance any existing agenda. Doing so helps to stimulate the mind while also promoting relaxation for a more holistic approach. Key elements of the experience included:    Intimate Arrival Space and Hassle-free Check-In      A dedicated space sets the tone and provides a serene environment for delegates to connect. At the event, the executive lounge was transformed with healthy snacks, welcome drinks, and the signature DoubleTree cookie. This also served as the check-in area, giving participants extra time to network and get comfortable.    In-Room Experiences      Upon first entering their rooms, receiving the welcome note and package, to the turn-down service, ‘body, mind and spirit’ wellness elements are thoughtfully dispersed. ‘Body’ elements included a yoga mat, highlighting the Hilton pillow menu, nut snack, and fruits instead of chocolate at turn down. ‘Mind’ elements included two different room mist scents and two curated spotify lists to set the desired mood. Meanwhile ‘Spirit’ was encapsulated with a journaling experience with gratitude prompts.    Wellness Workshops      Invited coaches led sessions to connect delegates with their inner selves. Hansen Lee conducted a stress-reducing breathwork and movement exercise to invigorate the body post lunchtime, as well as a sunrise yoga session at the property’s Borneo Courtyard. Alex Tan taught a tool called 'Disruptive Thinking' to motivate participants to be their best selves.

""Because if he doesn't win the war, if he doesn't deliver this victory, he will face serious problems. People understand that,"" he said.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Wednesday, February 22:China's most senior diplomat Wang Yi has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow.""The cooperation between China and Russia on the world stage is very important to stabilise the international situation,"" Putin said at the meeting with Wang.The Russian president said he was looking forward to a visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping and to deepening the partnership between the two countries.China's top diplomat said that relations between Beijing and Moscow could not be influenced by other countries, in comments broadcast on Russian state TV.US President Joe Biden will conclude a two-day visit to Poland by holding talks with countries on NATO's eastern flank.The Bucharest Nine is made up of the countries situated on the most eastern parts of the alliance — Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.Biden is expected to reassure allies in the region of Washington's support as Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine.""When Russia invaded, it wasn't just Ukraine being tested. The whole world faced a test for the ages,'' Biden said in an address in Warsaw.Ukraine's military said that Russian forces have continued attacking the eastern town of Bachmut,The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said that there had been 59 missile attacks over a 24-hour period. This figure could not be independently verified.There has been fierce fighting in the region for months, with Russian forces concentrating on the strategically important town.The UN General Assembly is expected to vote on a draft resolution calling for a ""just and lasting peace"" in Ukraine, one year since Moscow launched its invasion.The text ""underscores the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.""The draft resolution, which is sponsored by some 60 countries, is to be voted on after the close of debate, which is not expected until at least Thursday.The first criminal case involving a member of Ukraine's military has gone to court, according to Russian state media agency TASS.The agency cited unnamed sources at the Southern District Military Court in Rostov-on-Don as saying that a senior sergeant of Ukraine's marines was charged with murder and training for the purpose of terrorism.In June, Russia's Investigative Committee said on Telegram that the soldier had been charged with cruel treatment of the civilian population.TASS reported that the court will consider the case ""in the near future.""The European Union fast-tracked COVID shots when it was scrambling to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818356,Biden to meet leaders of NATO's eastern flank in Poland,"US President Joe Biden on Wednesday is holding talks with leaders from the Bucharest Nine, NATO's most eastern members, before he departs Poland.Biden arrived in Warsaw late on Monday following a surprise visit to Kyiv, just days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Biden is due to reaffirm Washington's commitments over the security of the eastern allies and discuss support for Kyiv.The nine countries have been staunch supporters of military aid to Ukraine and have called for additional assistance to the war-torn country such as air defense systems.On Tuesday, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda's foreign policy adviser told Lithuanian radio that the leader would seek in the meeting with Biden ""greater involvement of the US in Europe, NATO's eastern flank and, of course, more aid to Ukraine.""""Lithuania and other like-minded countries have several requests, which concern air defense, forward defense presence, air defense systems, and greater investments in the defense industry,"" Asta Skaisgiryte said.The Bucharest Nine grouping came together in response to the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818361,Ukraine: Can the EU fast-track ammunition for the war?,"Estonia says its plan to eliminate Ukraine's ammunition shortfall is simple: Show weapons manufacturers the money and do it fast.To be exact, Tallinn is asking Brussels to set aside €4 billion ($4.25 billion) of joint EU funding to secure 1 million rounds of ammunition which would be delivered within the next six months.In a document circulated among EU governments, and seen by DW, Estonia argues a financial injection of this size could increase the capacity of the European manufacturing industry sevenfold. Not only that, it says it would enable the delivery of significant amounts of ammunition within half a year rather than the four years estimated under current conditions.The maximum combined production capabilities of European ammunition manufacturers currently sits at 230,000 rounds per year, according to the Estonian document. Ukraine, currently at war with Russia, uses almost that many every month.Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur tells DW his government has received positive feedback on the proposal, which he believes is a win-win-win for Ukrainian and European militaries and industry, and, he hopes, a loss for Russia.""One thing is [it's] 1 million rounds for Ukraine,"" Pevkur explained. ""But the other thing is that there will be a sustainable project for the European countries, for the European militaries, to also acquire a lot more ammunition in the future. When industry [steps] up production capabilities, they can also [retain] these capabilities for a longer time.”Tapping into the bloc's general budget to fund the effort is not allowed, as EU funds are unable to be put toward military endeavors. However, this limitation has been circumvented already with the EU military aid fund, the ""European Peace Facility"" (EPF), an ""off-budget"" mechanism currently worth €5.5 billion and which all member states contribue to based on their gross national income. It has being used recently, for example, to reimburse governments for their military contributions to Ukraine. Estonia is suggesting the aid fund could be further used to bankroll their proposal.Defense minister Pevkur says Estonia does not care how the spending spree is funded, or whether purchases made are for new or existing ammunition. ""The important thing is that there will be a political decision that we will do it,"" he emphasized. ""We don't have time.""Both NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and, as of this week, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, have encouraged governments within their organizations to send Ukraine everything they can, even allowing national supplies to temporarily dip below previously agreed NATO stockpile guidelines, with the understanding they will be shored up later when shortages ease. Allies' procurement chiefs have met multiple times at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss how to ramp up production processes which have been deliberately scaled back for decades.But even the effort to speed up the process seems inadequate to the task. Three days before the one-year mark of the start of the war, Stoltenberg, Borrell and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met together for the first time. Following talks, the group announced there would be a joint meeting of NATO, EU and Ukrainian procurement experts organized, as Stoltenberg said, ""to see what more we can do together to ensure Ukraine has the weapons it needs."" The alliance will also help Ukraine set up its own procurement system that is ""effective, transparent and accountable.""But industry sources say despite all the talk, the number of contracts their companies are receiving has increased only slightly over the last year. Speaking at NATO headquarters Tuesday, Kuleba confirmed he had heard similar remarks.""After speaking with representatives [from the] defense industries, this gap [between buyer and producer] became even more evident,"" he said. ""But it doesn't mean that there is no political will on the side of the buyer, there is a lack of procedures and understanding of how it should all work, and this is why we're meeting with defense industries. This is why we're setting up the coordination mechanism to bring everyone together.""But until that happens, manufacturers say, there should be no expectation for them to self-fund speculative investments in capacity-building. ""If governments want to see more production capacity, we need to see orders coming in,"" said one ammunition manufacturer representative who asked to remain anonymous due to political sensitivities. ""I think there's a very real risk here for some of these companies to actually go bankrupt. If you massively scale up production, make massive investments, employ more people, buy raw materials, all that stuff, and then you start producing and in a year or two the whole demand just drops off a cliff again, what are you going to do then as a business?""If you think you have heard this somewhere before, you are not mistaken. The same arguments were raised by the pharmaceutical industry at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic when they were asked to dramatically boost their output of vaccinations. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen believes she can apply some of the lessons learned to joint procurement of ammunition.""At the European level, we have financed advance-purchase agreements [for vaccines],"" she told DW on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference last week. ""We could do the same with the European defense industry so that they can build their production lines faster and wider and speed up production. We have the institutions in place. We should not create something new, but we should use the European Peace Facility, which has a coordination mechanism with Ukraine already in place.""There is also another plan making the rounds, this one modeled on an assistance program for Ukraine already being used in France. Nathalie Loiseau, chair of the European Parliament's Security and Defense subcommittee, and French lawmaker Benjamin Haddad, chair of the parliament's France-Ukraine friendship committee, recommend establishing a €1 billion pot with member states contributing based on their GDPs. Ukraine could use this money to buy whatever it needs from European manufacturers, putting the money back into EU industry.Haddad thinks the comparison with the vaccine campaign is apt. ""We realized in the last few years that when we put the resources, the capital and the political will into doing something, we can actually manufacture, produce and distribute much more quickly than we expected,"" he said, noting that initially it was anticipated it would take years to develop and distribute a vaccine, but it was done in less than one.Haddad told DW he does not see the various plans as competing. ""All these things are complementary,"" he says, ""but I think it's time to step up. We can't delay and dither. Every day that we delay in supporting Ukraine's militarily to defend themselves is a day for Russia.""Estonia is hoping to see its proposal approved by the next EU summit scheduled for late March, if not earlier, says Defense Minister Pevkur. ""My timeline is tomorrow,"" he says. ""But for Ukraine, it was yesterday.""Edited by: J. Wingard",2023/02/21,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818362,Ukraine military aid: How much has the West provided?,"US President Joe Biden announced plans Monday which will see arms worth $500 million (€468 million) delivered to Ukraine. Speaking during his recent visit to Kyiv, Biden added that Washington will supply artillery ammunition, extra howitzers, along with more shoulder-mounted armor-piercing Javelin missile systems.The announcement during Biden's highly symbolic visit just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine fits a recent analysis looking at the financial aspects of Kyiv-bound aid published by German-based economic think tank, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW).""The Americans are leading the way when it comes to supporting Ukraine,"" IfW economist Christoph Trebesch, who oversees the institute's Ukraine Support Tracker, said. ""European reluctance to provide support during the first year of the war in Ukraine is a remarkable phenomenon, especially since financial resources can be mobilized so quickly,"" Trebesch added, referring to financial payments made by EU states to bolster Ukraine's state budget. The country's economic output plunged by around 40% following Moscow's move to invade Ukraine in February 2022.IfW economists use publicly available sources to calculate the overall worth of direct financial aid and humanitarian support, in addition to the value of Ukraine-bound weapon deliveries. Ordnance shipments from national stockpiles, such as those from Germany's armed forces, are determined based on their open market valuation.Comparing data from the last published Ukraine Support Tracker update from December 2022, IfW researchers found the US had pledged an additional €37 billion ($39 billion), thereby, once again surpassing contributions made by the EU and its member states. Both pledged and delivered aid from Washington now totals €73.1 billion, compared with the EU's figure of €54.9 billion. In total, €128 billion has been provided, or promised, as aid for Ukraine. Notably, the US has gifted twice the amount of the entire EU, followed by the UK and Germany.Trebesch and his colleagues included for the first time in their report alternative forms of aid pledged by the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, an alliance of over 50 states led by the US. ""In total, aid offered to Ukraine is typically only a fraction of what governments spend on cushioning the fallout of the crisis within their own countries,"" the analysis reads. ""Germany alone has announced over €250 billion in subsidies since January 2022 in a bid to help cushion the rise in energy prices for both private consumers and businesses.""Bilateral aid provided by Germany to Ukraine now totals €6.15 billion, the researchers say. In comparison, they add, the German government spent €5.56 billion alone on subsidizing fuel and offering residents heavily discounted public transportation tickets — measures which were introduced in the summer of 2022 to counteract spiking petrol prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24.IfW researchers did not take into account the planned delivery of Western tanks to Ukraine in their calculations — such as the Leopard 2 consignment scheduled for March this year. In part due to unclear commitments made by European nations currently in possession of the German-built tanks. The IfW researchers did, however, factor in the $100 billion the US House of Representatives flagged last summer for training Ukrainian pilots to use Western fighter jets.IfW economists also compared Western aid to Ukraine in the first 12 months of the conflict with Western spending in previous wars. In terms of gross domestic product (GDP), for example, Germany spent three times more to defend Kuwait during the 1990-91 Gulf War. After Iraq invaded its neighbor, Kuwait, Germany — which did not directly participate militarily in the Operation Desert Storm offensive — supplied funding to the US which ultimately helped liberate the attacked Gulf nation.  Comparatively, Washington spent nearly 1% of GDP on the Gulf War, compared to less than 0.4% so far for Ukraine. Annual military spending by the US in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2010 was three times higher than what Washington has spent to date defending Ukraine. However, unlike Ukraine, the US also sent ground troops to Afghanistan and the Middle East, something which continued for years and at great cost.IfW scholars also found that supplied aid and promised support earmarked for Ukraine plummeted from more than €20 billion in May last year to just over €5 billion in June.Large-scale support only resumed in November, after Ukraine liberated key regions in the east and south of the country. Following these battlefield successes, the EU pledged to further contribute aid to Kyiv going forward into 2023, with the US House of Representatives also voting in December to commit €37 billion in military aid.Arguably, it is that aid package from which US President Biden approved €500 million euros in arms shipments for Ukraine during his visit to Kyiv earlier this week, all whilst insisting US ""support for Ukraine will not waver.""This article was translated from German.",2023/02/21,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818363,Ex-IS bride loses appeal to have her UK citizenship restored,"LONDON (AP) — A British woman whose U.K. citizenship was revoked after she traveled to Syria as a teenager to join the Islamic State group has lost an appeal in her fight to have her citizenship restored.

            Shamima Begum, now 23, was 15 when she and two other girls from London joined the extremist group in February 2015. Authorities withdrew her British citizenship on national security grounds soon after she surfaced in a Syrian refugee camp in 2019.

            The Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a tribunal which hears challenges to decisions to remove someone’s British citizenship on national security grounds, ruled there was a “credible suspicion” that Begum was trafficked to Syria for “sexual exploitation.” It said there also were “arguable breaches of duty” by state bodies in allowing her to travel to the country.











            But Judge Robert Jay said that evidence was “insufficient” for Begum to win the argument that the deprivation of her British citizenship failed to respect her human rights. Given that she remains in Syria, UK authorities are not compelled to facilitate her return, the judge said.

            “Reasonable people will differ as to the threat she posed in February 2019 to the national security of the United Kingdom, and as to how that threat should be balanced against all countervailing considerations,’’ Jay said in delivering the decision of the tribunal. “However, under our constitutional settlement, these sensitive issues are for the secretary of state to evaluate and not for the commission.”

            Arguing the ruling gave far too much power to the Britain’s home secretary, Begum’s lawyers promised an appeal. Daniel Furner, part of Begum’s legal team, said the case was “nowhere near over.”

            “What else this judgment calls out for though is some courage and some leadership from the Home Secretary to look at this case afresh in light of the clear and compelling factual findings this court has made,″ Furner said. “We are going to challenge this decision.”

            Begum had challenged the action of Sajid Javid, the U.K.’s home secretary at the time, arguing that it left her stateless and that she should have been treated as a child trafficking victim, not a security risk.

            The British government claimed she could seek a Bangladeshi passport based on family ties. But Begum’s family argued that she was from the U.K. and never held a Bangladeshi passport.

            Javid expressed satisfaction with the decision.

            “This is a complex case, but home secretaries should have the power to prevent anyone entering our country who is assessed to pose a threat to it,” he said.

            The immigration tribunal held a hearing in November on Begum's appeal. The case threw into sharp relief the larger question of how Western societies deal with people who joined IS but want to go back to their home countries. Thousands remain in camps in northeast Syria.

            Begum fled east London with two friends to marry IS fighters in Syria at a time when the group’s online recruitment program lured many impressionable young people to its self-proclaimed caliphate.

            Begum married a Dutch man fighting for IS and had three children, who all died.

            But her apparent lack of remorse in interviews soon after she surfaced in the refugee camp triggered criticism in Britain. Her tone has changed since then as she reflected on her actions and fought to return home.LONDON (AP) — A British woman whose U.K. citizenship was revoked after she traveled to Syria as a teenager to join the Islamic State group has lost an appeal in her fight to have her citizenship restored.Shamima Begum, now 23, was 15 when she and two other girls from London joined the extremist group in February 2015.

            “Following unsuccessful attempts to extinguish the fire, the master of Escape has taken the prudent measure to evacuate the ship,” the shipping company said. “All 15 seafarers of Escape ... have safely been taken onboard the nearby vessel Kairit which is now proceeding to Riga Bay.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818365,Spain: police detain father of 2 sisters slain in Pakistan,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Police in Spain have detained the father of two sisters who were victims of so-called “honor killings” while visiting family in Pakistan, authorities said Wednesday.

            Spain’s National Police confirmed local media reports that the father was taken into custody in the eastern town of Terrassa, near Barcelona.

            He is under investigation for his possible involvement in the murders of his daughters, Urooj Abbas, 21, and Anisa Abbas, 23. They were killed last year in Pakistan for allegedly refusing to help their husbands come to Spain after the women had been forced to marry two of their cousins. 











            The women were severely tortured and shot dead in the Gujrat district of Punjab province, which neighbors India.

            According to Spanish media reports, the women, who had spent several years in Spain, had been forced into the marriages in 2021. When they traveled to Pakistan the following year, their relatives wanted them to help their husbands emigrate to Spain with them. They reportedly refused and asked for divorces instead.

            In May, Pakistani police arrested six men for their suspected involvement in the murders. Pakistani officials said that murder charges were leveled against the victims’ brother, a paternal uncle, both husbands, a cousin, and both fathers-in-law.

            Forced marriages are common in rural areas of conservative Pakistan, where relatives don’t hesitate to kill women who refuse them or ignore the opinions of family elders. Rights groups say around 1,000 women are killed every year in so-called ""honor killings"" in Pakistan.BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Police in Spain have detained the father of two sisters who were victims of so-called “honor killings” while visiting family in Pakistan, authorities said Wednesday.Spain’s National Police confirmed local media reports that the father was taken into custody in the eastern town of Terrassa, near Barcelona.He is under investigation for his possible involvement in the murders of his daughters, Urooj Abbas, 21, and Anisa Abbas, 23.

            Coach Xavi also won't be able to count on suspended midfielder Gavi.

            
                The teams drew 2-2 in Barcelona last week in the first leg of the knockout playoffs. The former European champions traded leads in a thrilling back-and-forth second half at Camp Nou.











            Barcelona, which traveled Wednesday to Manchester, heads to the match still reeling from the public disclosure that it made payments of millions of dollars over several years to a company that belonged to the vice president of Spain's refereeing committee, igniting widespread criticism of the club across Spain. Barcelona has denied any wrongdoing, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.

            Muscle injuries have sidelined Pedri (right leg) and Dembélé (left leg). Xavi could use forwards Ferran Torres or Ansu Fati to play in attack against United with Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, or add Sergi Roberto to an attacking midfield position in what would be a more cautious formation. 

            Raphinha started on the bench in the team’s 2-0 win against Cadiz in the Spanish league on Sunday, a result that left the Catalan club eight points ahead of second-place Real Madrid. Lewandowski and Roberto scored a goal each.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818380,‘Now or never’: Young Nigerians pin hopes on key election,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Frustrated by high unemployment and worsening violence, many younger Nigerians are flocking to a candidate outside the political mainstream in this month’s presidential election.

            Despite being Africa’s largest economy and and one of its top oil producers, Nigeria is in economic crisis. A currency reform effort has left many unable to access their own money, even to buy food. Meanwhile, extremist violence has continued, leaving thousands dead in the past year. Many young people have left the country, seeing no future at home. But many of those who have stayed hope the Feb. 25 election will bring real change.

            So many people registered to vote that many spent days waiting in line to collect permanent voter cards, which are required to cast a ballot. Nigeria’s election commission extended the deadline to collect the cards by two weeks in response. 











            On Feb. 25, voters will choose among 18 candidates in a first-round vote to succeed incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari, who is winding down his second and final term. A runoff will be held unless one candidate gets at least one-quarter of the votes in each of at least two-thirds of all the states.

            “Either we get things right now in Nigeria, or never,” said Kingsley Chima, 26, as the first-time voter waited to collect his voting card from Nigeria’s election commission.

            Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country, with more than 210 million people, and it has at least 93 million registered voters, almost 40 percent of whom are under 35. The country has one of the world’s largest youth populations, with about 64 million people aged 18-35 and a median age of 18. 

            Young people have made a third-party candidate with social media appeal into a serious contender in the polls.

            That’s surprising in a country where elections have long been usually dominated by Nigeria’s two largest parties.

            Bola Tinubu, 70, of the All Progressives Congress has served as governor of Nigeria’s economic hub of Lagos, while Atiku Abubakar, 76, of the Peoples Democratic Party has served as Nigeria’s vice-president. Tinubu was an important backer of the current president, and is known as a key funder for the ruling APC. Abubakar, one of Nigeria’s richest businessmen, ran for president in 2019 and lost to Buhari.

            Both men have been fixtures in Nigerian politics since 1999. 

            In 2015, Buhari rode a wave of goodwill to power by promising to curb Nigeria’s rampant corruption and extremist insurgency, but he failed to make headway on either challenge. Frustration with mainstream parties made room for former governor Peter Obi, 61, to position himself as a change candidate.

            “The hopes we placed in the current president have been crushed,” said Rinu Oduala, a youth activist. Oduala was among the leaders of unprecedented nationwide demonstrations held in 2020 by young Nigerians to protest police brutality and bad governance. Now, she’s mobilizing voters, supporting Obi. 

            Initially seen as an underdog with little political experience, Obi has emerged as a leading candidate, coming ahead of or close behind Tinubu and Abubakar in most polls. He’s the candidate of the Labour Party, which won 5,074 votes in the 2019 presidential election, under a tenth of one percent of the vote.

            He’s spoken to young people, promising jobs, and to Nigeria’s vast diaspora, promising changes that will give them a reason to return.

            Tinubu has focused on another bloc: Nigeria’s Muslim majority. Presidential candidates usually balance their tickets, choosing a running mate from the other side of Nigeria’s religious divide, but the APC candidate has chosen a fellow Muslim. Some members of the ruling party see the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket as Tinubu’s biggest chance of securing votes in the Muslim-dominated north, which has more registered voters than the Christian-dominated south.

            That strategy could deepen the country’s religious divisions, said Hassan Idayat, who leads the Center for Democracy and Development, Nigeria’s largest democracy-focused group. 

            “Nigeria is a giant that has never been quite stable,” said Ayisha Osori, an analyst with the Open Society Foundations.

            “We are having one of our most polarized elections ever (and) our campaign messaging is a lot more focused on competition between religions, competition between ethnic groups and trying to address political equity issues,” she said.

            A key question is how many people turn out to vote. Turnout in Nigeria’s recent elections has been low. In 2019, only 34% of registered voters cast their ballot in the presidential vote. It reflects both cynicism about politics, and high barriers to participation. Voters can cast ballots only in person, and only at their place of registration.

            Long lines to collect voter cards, and enthusiasm online and at rallies, lead many to think this time will be different. 

            “This time around, it is the young people who are very involved in the process; they are not just involved as voters but they are actually the mobilizers,” said Idayat. “They are going to vote.”

            Youth turnout could be further boosted by a decision to close the country’s universities for two weeks before the election. Officials cited security concerns as the main reason for the move, but it will also mean many young people are at home to cast ballots.

            “The typical response from our politicians when young Nigerians complain is that we don’t vote,” Oduala said. “Well, another generation has lately become aware of their responsibilities to join hands to make this nation work. And we have decided to vote.”

            Among those driving the surge in voter registration is Chukwuenye Igwe in the southeastern Enugu state where she has embarked on a personal campaign urging people to sign up to vote. 

            “People have really woken up, especially the youths,” said Igwe. Last year, the 26-year-old was keen to join other young Nigerians leave the country at a level unseen in recent years. She eventually could not move but many have, often citing economic hardship caused by spiraling unemployment rate of 33% and insecurity.

            Among those who have recently relocated from Nigeria is Jude Edozie, who left last year as a pharmacist to further his studies in Ireland. He can’t vote abroad, but is watching closely.

            “I don’t plan on returning any time soon, but how it ends will either increase or reduce the chances of that happening,” Edozie said “I hope the election this time is different.”ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Frustrated by high unemployment and worsening violence, many younger Nigerians are flocking to a candidate outside the political mainstream in this month’s presidential election.Despite being Africa’s largest economy and and one of its top oil producers, Nigeria is in economic crisis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818382,Stellantis earnings rise as EV push drives higher sales,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Automaker Stellantis on Wednesday reported its earnings grew in 2022 from a year earlier and said its push into electric vehicles led to a jump in sales even as it faces growing competition from an industrywide shift to more climate-friendly offerings.

            Stellantis, formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot, said net revenue of 179.6 billion euros ($191 billion) was up 18% from 2021, citing strong pricing and its mix of vehicles. It reported net profit of 16.8 billion euros, up 26% from 2021.

            Stellantis plans to convert all of its European sales and half of its U.S. sales to battery-electric vehicles by 2030. It said the strategy led to a 41% increase in battery EV sales in 2022, to 288,000 vehicles, compared with the year earlier.











            The company has “demonstrated the effectiveness of our electrification strategy in Europe,” CEO Carlos Tavares said in a statement. “We now have the technology, the products, the raw materials and the full battery ecosystem to lead that same transformative journey in North America, starting with our first fully electric Ram vehicles from 2023 and Jeep from 2024.”

            The automaker is competing in an increasingly crowded field for a share of the electric vehicle market. Companies are scrambling to roll out environmentally friendly models as they look to hit goals of cutting climate-changing emissions, driven by government pressure.

            The transformation has gotten a boost from a U.S. law that is rolling out big subsidies for clean technology like EVs but has European governments calling out the harm that they say the funding poses to homegrown industry across the Atlantic.

            Stellantis' Jeep brand will start selling two fully electric SUVs in North America and another one in Europe over the next two years. It says its Ram brand will roll out an electric pickup truck this year, joining a rush of EV competitors looking to claim a piece of the full-size truck market.

            The company plans to bring 25 battery-electric models to the U.S. by 2030. As part of that push, it has said it would build two EV battery factories in North America. 

            Stellantis said that 40,500 unionized U.S. factory workers will get profit-sharing checks of about $14,760 on March 10. United Auto Workers members will get the checks based on North American pretax earnings last year.

            A $2.5 billion joint venture with Samsung will bring one of those facilities to Indiana, which is expected to employ up to 1,400 workers. The other factory will be in Windsor, Ontario, a collaboration with South Korea’s LG Energy Solution that aims to create about 2,500 jobs.

            The EV push comes amid a slowdown in U.S. car sales tied to a global computer chip shortage and other problems finding parts. Sales at Stellantis dropped 13% last year.

            The company also announced a share buyback valued at up to 1.5 billion euros to be carried out this year as well as a 4.2 billion-euro dividend, amounting to 1.34 euros per share.AMSTERDAM (AP) — Automaker Stellantis on Wednesday reported its earnings grew in 2022 from a year earlier and said its push into electric vehicles led to a jump in sales even as it faces growing competition from an industrywide shift to more climate-friendly offerings.Stellantis, formed in 2021 from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Peugeot, said net revenue of 179.6 billion euros ($191 billion) was up 18% from 2021, citing strong pricing and its mix of vehicles.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818386,Israel says Palestinian militants fired rockets after raid,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israeli military said Palestinian militants fired six rockets from the Gaza Strip toward the country's south early Thursday, hours after an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank triggered a fierce gunbattle in which 11 Palestinians were killed.

            The rocket attacks, which were not immediately claimed by Palestinian militant groups, appear to be triggered by the Wednesday morning raid in Nablus.

            The Israeli military said air defenses intercepted five of the rockets which were fired toward the cities of Ashkelon and Sderot. One missile landed in an open field. Israeli aircraft then struck several targets in northern and central Gaza. There were no reports of injuries in Israel or Gaza.











            Among the dead in Nablus were three Palestinian men, ages 72, 66 and 61, and a 16-year-old boy, according to health officials. Scores of others were wounded.

            It was one of the bloodiest battles in nearly a year of fighting in the West Bank and east Jerusalem and raised the likelihood of further bloodshed. Israeli police said they were on heightened alert, while the Hamas militant group in Gaza said its patience was “running out.” Islamic Jihad, another militant group, vowed to retaliate.

            The four-hour operation left a broad swath of damage in a centuries-old marketplace in Nablus, a city known as a militant stronghold.

            In one emotional scene, an overwhelmed medic pronounced a man dead, only to notice the lifeless patient was his father. Elsewhere, an amateur video showed two men, apparently unarmed, being shot as they ran in the street.

            Israel has been carrying out stepped-up arrest raids of wanted militants in the West Bank since a series of deadly Palestinian attacks in Israel last spring.

            Israeli officials liken these operations to “mowing the lawn,” saying they are necessary to prevent a difficult situation from turning worse. But the raids have shown few signs of slowing the violence, and in cases like Wednesday's operation, can raise the likelihood of reprisals.

            The Israeli military said it entered Nablus, the West Bank’s commercial center, to arrest three militants suspected in previous shooting attacks. The main suspect was wanted in the killing of an Israeli soldier last fall.

            The military usually conducts raids at night in what it says is a tactic meant to reduce the risk of civilian casualties. But military spokesman Lt. Col. Richard Hecht said forces moved quickly after intelligence services tracked down the men in a hideout.

            Hecht said Israeli forces surrounded the building and asked the men to surrender, but instead they opened fire. One militant who tried to flee the building was shot and killed. He said the military then fired missiles at the house, flattening the building and killing the other two men.

            At the same time, he said, troops that had set up an outside perimeter came under heavy fire, setting off an intense gunfight. The military said others hurled rocks and explosives at the troops, and officials released a video taken from inside an armored vehicle as crowds of Palestinian youths pelted it with stones. There were no Israeli casualties.

            The influx of wounded overwhelmed the city’s Najah Hospital, said Ahmad Aswad, the head nurse of the cardiology department.

            The 36-year-old medic told The Associated Press that he saw many patients shot in the chest, head and thighs. “They shot to kill,” he said.

            In a moment he said will haunt him, he and a colleague carefully extracted a bullet from a 61-year-old man’s heart. After the chaos subsided and they pronounced their patient dead, they looked at the man’s face. It was his colleague’s father, Abdelaziz Ashqar.

            His colleague, Elias Ashqar, was overcome and went silent. “It didn’t feel like we were in reality,” Aswad said.

            In the Old City of Nablus, people stared at the rubble that had been a large home in the centuries-old marketplace. From one end to the other, shops were riddled with bullets. Parked cars were crushed. Blood stained the cement ruins. Furniture from the destroyed home was scattered among mounds of debris.

            Time-stamped security footage widely shared online appeared to show two young men running down a street. Gunshots are heard, and both fall to the ground, with one’s hat flying off his head.

            The two men did not appear to be armed, but the video did not show the events that led to the shooting.

            Hecht called the video “problematic,” and said the military was looking into it.

            Various Palestinian militant groups claimed six of the dead — including the three targeted in the raid — as members. There was no immediate word on whether the others belonged to armed groups. Later, officials said a 66-year-old man had died from tear gas inhalation.

            As the bodies were paraded through the crowd on stretchers, thousands of people packed the streets, chanting in support of the militants. Masked men fired into the air.

            Israel’s police force said it was beefing up security in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in anticipation of violence.

            Last month, Israeli troops killed 10 people in a similar raid in the northern West Bank. In response, Palestinian militants fired rockets from Gaza. The following day, a lone Palestinian gunman opened fire near a synagogue in an east Jerusalem settlement, killing seven people.

            Days later, five Palestinian militants were killed in an Israeli arrest raid elsewhere in the West Bank. That was followed by a Palestinian car ramming that killed three Israelis, including two young brothers, in Jerusalem.

            The fighting comes at a sensitive time, less than two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new hard-line government took office.

            The government is dominated by ultranationalists who have pushed for tougher action against Palestinian militants and vowed to entrench Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank. Israeli media have quoted top security officials as expressing concern that this could lead to even more violence as the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches.

            The Cabinet includes a number of West Bank settler leaders. In a move that could further raise tensions, Yesha, the settlement council, announced that Israeli planning officials had granted approval to nearly 2,000 new homes in settlements across the West Bank. There was no immediate confirmation from the government, but an announcement was expected Thursday.

            The Palestinians and most of the international community say settlements built on occupied lands are illegal and obstacles to peace. Over 700,000 settlers now live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by the Palestinians for a future state.

            In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the U.S. recognizes Israel’s “very real” security concerns, but was also “deeply concerned” about the deaths and injuries from the raid.

            He urged both sides to avoid steps that could “inflame tensions,” including the possible approval of new settlements.

            The Israeli decision comes in the wake of a U.N. presidential statement that strongly criticized settlements. The U.S. blocked what would have been a stronger, legally binding council resolution.

            American diplomats claimed to have extracted an Israeli pledge to halt unilateral action to block the resolution. The approval of new settlements by Israel would appear to undermine that claim.

            The Palestinian ambassador to the U.N., Riyad Mansour, urged the international community ""to put an end to these massacres against our people.”

            In the Gaza Strip, Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the ruling Hamas militant group, warned that Hamas' ""patience is running out,” he said.

            Late Wednesday, Palestinian activists burned tires along Gaza’s frontier with Israel in protest.

            Hamas has battled Israel in four wars since seizing control of Gaza in 2007.

            Islamic Jihad leader Ziyad Al-Nakhala called the Israeli raid a “huge crime.”

            “It is our duty as resistance forces to respond to this crime without hesitation,” he said.

            Nearly 60 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem this year, according to an AP tally.

            Last year, nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in those areas, making it the deadliest year there since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Some 30 people on the Israeli side were killed in Palestinian attacks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818388,"Foreign ministry, AIT refute former legislator's US' 'Taiwan destruction plan' claim","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After former Kuomintang Legislator Alex Tsai (蔡正元) cited an American journalist as saying the White House has a plan for Taiwan’s destruction, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) refuted the claim and revealed the source’s Russian affiliation.Journalist Garland Nixon on Thursday (Feb. 16) claimed that U.S. President Joe Biden said the White House had a “plan for the destruction of Taiwan.” A few days later, Taiwan caught on to the news, which was spread further when Tsai shared it on social media on Tuesday (Feb. 21) and called Nixon “a famous radio show host in Washington, D.C.”In response, MOFA wrote in a press release that Nixon in fact works for Russian state-run media, Radio Sputnik, which was founded according to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s executive order. “Radio Sputnik has long been a tool for the Russian government to promote propaganda, and the U.S. court in 2019 ruled its radio station ‘WZHF-AM’ as a ‘Russian government agent’ that must be registered with the U.S. Department of Justice according to the ‘Foreign Agents Registration Act.’”MOFA added that Nixon’s Twitter account is filled with “sensationalizing tweets that abuse the U.S. government” and obviously not a reliable source. The ministry urged Tsai to stop spreading unconfirmed misinformation and misleading the public.Meanwhile, CNA cited the American Institute in Taiwan as saying its policy towards Taiwan has adhered to the Taiwan Relations Act, Three Communiques, and Six Assurances for the past 40 years. It added that not only does the U.S. have “grave concern” about any attempt to decide Taiwan’s future non-peacefully, the U.S. will also maintain the ability to stop any force or threat that may harm Taiwan’s security and socioeconomic systems.Despite Sputnik News’ listing Nixon as “a broadcast journalist at Radio Sputnik in Washington DC,” Tsai insisted that he has no affiliation with Russia in another post published on Wednesday (Feb. 22). “If Garland Nixon was a Russian journalist, he would’ve been sanctioned long ago … Let me also tell the retarded Democratic Progressive Party, Garland Nixon is not only a famous host in D.C., he often appears on Fox News as a political commenter. He is very famous.”However, as a commenter pointed out, the Fox News screenshot Tsai included in the post was from 2018.

Standard operating procedures dictated that the planned flight was canceled, the Liberty Times reported.When the brakes functioned and the UAV reduced speed, it left the runway before coming to a standstill. The NCSIST towed the drone back to Jiashan Air Base during the afternoon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818406,Russian lawmakers endorse suspension of nuclear pact with US,"MOSCOW (AP) — Both houses of Russia's parliament on Wednesday quickly endorsed President Vladimir Putin's move to suspend the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the United States, with officials and lawmakers casting it as an eleventh-hour warning to Washington amid the tensions over Ukraine.

            Putin declared that Moscow was suspending its participation in the 2010 New START treaty in his state-of-the-nation address Tuesday, saying that Russia can't accept U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Russia’s defeat in Ukraine as a goal.

            
                The Russian president emphasized that Moscow was not withdrawing from the pact altogether, and the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the caps on nuclear weapons set under the treaty and keep notifying the U.S. about test launches of ballistic missiles.











            Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council that is chaired by Putin, emphasized Wednesday that the suspension of Russia’s participation in the pact was a signal to the U.S. that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons to protect itself.

            “If the U.S. wants Russia’s defeat, we have the right to defend ourselves with any weapons, including nuclear,” Medvedev said on his messaging app channel. “Let the U.S. elites who have lost touch with reality think about what they got. If the U.S. wants Russia to be defeated, we are standing on the verge of a global conflict.”

            Leonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house, the State Duma, emphasized that the suspension is ""reversible and can be reviewed if our Western opponents come back to reason and realize their responsibility for destroying the global security system.”

            Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov also noted that it would be up to Putin to decide whether Moscow could return to the pact. “The president will determine if and when the conditions for reviewing or clarifying yesterday's decision emerge,” he told reporters.

            The diplomat noted that Russia's surveillance capability will allow it to keep track of U.S. nuclear forces even without exchanges of data and inspections that were envisaged by the New START.

            “We will undoubtedly follow the actions by the U.S. and its allies very closely and take further countermeasures if necessary,” Ryabkov said. 

            He argued that “the U.S. and its satellites ... could push the world close to a nuclear war by inciting tensions, escalating the situation and raising the stakes in a thoughtless, utterly destructive and irresponsible way.”MOSCOW (AP) — Both houses of Russia's parliament on Wednesday quickly endorsed President Vladimir Putin's move to suspend the last remaining nuclear arms treaty with the United States, with officials and lawmakers casting it as an eleventh-hour warning to Washington amid the tensions over Ukraine.Putin declared that Moscow was suspending its participation in the 2010 New START treaty in his state-of-the-nation address Tuesday, saying that Russia can't accept U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites under the pact while Washington and its NATO allies have openly declared Russia’s defeat in Ukraine as a goal.The Russian president emphasized that Moscow was not withdrawing from the pact altogether, and the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the caps on nuclear weapons set under the treaty and keep notifying the U.S. about test launches of ballistic missiles.Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council that is chaired by Putin, emphasized Wednesday that the suspension of Russia’s participation in the pact was a signal to the U.S. that Moscow is ready to use nuclear weapons to protect itself.“If the U.S. wants Russia’s defeat, we have the right to defend ourselves with any weapons, including nuclear,” Medvedev said on his messaging app channel. “Let the U.S. elites who have lost touch with reality think about what they got.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818408,"At least 2 dead, more than 50 missing in China mine collapse","BEIJING (AP) — An open pit mine collapsed in China's northern Inner Mongolia region on Wednesday, killing at least two people and leaving more than 50 missing, state media reported. 

            The official Xinhua News Agency said people were buried under debris at the mine in Alxa League. It said six were rescued with injuries and 53 were still listed as missing. 

            A brief video of the collapse posted on the website of the Beijing Times newspaper showed a massive wall of reddish dirt or sand rushing down a slope onto mining vehicles moving below. 











            Chinese President Xi Jinping demanded “all-out efforts in search and rescue of the missing and treatment of the injured,"" Xinhua reported. Xi called for “ensuring the safety of people’s lives and property and maintaining overall social stability,"" it said. 

            More than 300 rescue workers operating 129 rescue vehicles were participating in the search, Xinhua said.

            The company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was cited and fined last year for multiple safety violations ranging from insecure access routes to the mining surface to unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of training for its safety overseers, according to the news website The Paper. 

            Inner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal and various minerals and rare earths, which critics say has ravaged the original landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts.

            China overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment. 

            Most mining deaths are attributed to explosions caused by the buildup of methane and coal dust, or to drownings caused when miners break into shafts that had been abandoned due to flooding.

            China has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to make profits. The economy has slowed, partly as a result of draconian lockdowns and quarantines imposed under the now-abandoned “zero COVID"" policy. 

            In one of the worst recent incidents, 38 people were killed in a fire at a company dealing with chemicals and other industrial goods in the central province of Henan that was blamed on unsafe welding work.

            Last month, an avalanche buried vehicles outside a highway tunnel in Tibet, killing at least 28.

When the three people behind Lin found no trace of someone walking in front of them on the trail and heard the sound of earth and rocks sliding, they suspected that something might have happened to their leader.The three were searching for Lin back and forth along the trail when they found broken branches and displaced stones near the Wujia wall. Looking down the slope, they found Lin's hiking poles, per CNA.The fellow hikers went down the slope to find Lin laying face down on the ground with no vital signs. They immediately reported to the Hualien County Fire Department for help.A 9-member search and rescue team started out from Xiulin Township at around 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and they reached the patient on Wednesday morning.The county fire department said that according to reports from the search and rescue personnel, Lin fell down a slope to a spot about 130 to 150 meters deep from the trail and was obviously dead. The team was carrying Lin’s remains to an open area in order to be airlifted out of the mountain by the National Airborne Service Corps at a later time.The victim was the son of Lin Feng-hsi (林豐喜), a former legislator of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and his family arrived in Hualien to take care of the aftermath of the accident.(Hualien County Fire Department photo)",2023/02/22,1620,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818444,Can college abroad actually save you money?,"When Emma Freer was a high school senior in 2011, her impression of American campus culture — sororities, football games, broad course requirements — didn’t appeal. Her parents had saved enough money to cover her in-state tuition, but, she says, “I knew I didn’t want to go to Ohio State.”

            College abroad offered a solution. Freer graduated from Scotland’s University of St. Andrews in 2016, debt-free and with a master’s degree in English and social anthropology.

            “I got a really excellent academic education as well as a second education in travel, living abroad and being an outsider in a new culture,” Freer says. “I never wished I had gone to school in the U.S.”











            Lured largely by promises of cheaper tuition, college-bound Americans are increasingly eyeing programs abroad. 

            Over the past five years, U.K. universities have seen the number of U.S. undergraduate applicants spike by 49%, according to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which manages the U.K. public university admissions system . The number of Americans studying in France has risen 5% over the past five years and jumped 50% from 2020 to 2021, according to Campus France, a French government agency that promotes higher education to foreign students . Meanwhile, Google searches in the U.S. for “college abroad” have more than doubled since February 2021.

            But college affordability depends on more than just tuition. Understand the key costs of an international education before you book a one-way plane ticket.

            TUITION

            “The tuition is what draws people in, what catches their attention,” says Jennifer Viemont, founder of Beyond the States, a company that helps American students find degree programs in Europe.

            Tuition abroad can vary depending on which city, country and type of school you choose. Germany, for example, abandoned public university tuition fees for all students — international included — in 2014. On the other hand, at England’s prestigious Oxford University, international students pay up to about $53,900 each year.

            American students can sometimes use federal aid for international schools, including loans. Additionally, undergraduate degrees from schools abroad typically take three years, rather than four, saving students a full year’s worth of tuition and expenses.

            COST OF LIVING

            Cost of living varies in different cities and countries, affecting how much you pay for housing, food and other basic expenses beyond tuition.

            For example, Norway has long offered free tuition to all students regardless of origin — but the average student there should budget about $1,260 per month for living expenses, according to the University of Bergen.

            But in Portugal, basic expenses run half that. A student will need about $640 per month to get by, according to ISPA, Lisbon’s Institute of Applied Psychology.

            EXCHANGE RATES

            Fluctuating exchange rates can make it difficult to predict the full cost of your education, says Jessica Sandberg , dean of international enrollment at Duke Kunshan University, a joint venture between Duke University in North Carolina and China’s Wuhan University.

            When Freer studied at St. Andrews, the exchange rate was not in her favor. “I would work all summer to save up, and when I would deposit the money into my Scottish bank account, it would sometimes be nearly half of what I put in in dollars ,” she says. Tuition fees could swing by a few hundred U.S. dollars, she says, depending on the day she paid her tuition.

            Build some flexibility into your budget to account for exchange rate shifts, and consider studying in a country with a favorable exchange rate.

            OTHER COSTS

            — HEALTH CARE. Many countries require that students pay an annual fee to access their national health care system. While this may cost a few hundred dollars each year, coverage is generous. When Viemont’s son broke his wrist in the Netherlands, there was zero out-of-pocket expense. 

            — TRAVEL. Students who want to use free time to travel should budget for these expenses. Emergencies, like a family member getting sick, could lead to bigger travel bills. “It’s more expensive when things go wrong,” advises David Hawkins, founder of U.K.-based college admissions consultancy The University Guys, so put money aside for a last-minute flight home. Credit cards suited for study abroad could help reduce some travel expenses.

            — VISAS. Most countries or regions require student visas or residency permits. Though these typically aren’t huge expenses, some mandate “proof of financial means ,” explains Sandra Furth, a certified educational planner and founder of World Student Support. In the U.K., for example, you must show enough savings to cover the first year of tuition, plus at least about $11,200 for living expenses. 

            “Overseas, the living costs are a little bit more a la carte, and that’s maybe a blessing and a curse for young folks who are going to have to budget and make choices,” Sandberg says. “It can come out to be less expensive, but that’s going to come down to the individual’s spending habits.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818445,Edmunds: Honda CR-V Hybrid vs Kia Sportage Hybrid,"The 2023 Honda CR-V and 2023 Kia Sportage are two highly rated small SUVs by Edmunds. Notably, they also come in hybrid versions that offer some compelling advantages. The big one is significantly better fuel efficiency than the regular gas-only versions. They’re also more powerful and have the same interior space. Altogether, it’s pretty easy to justify the slight price premiums that the hybrid CR-V and Sportage command. But which SUV should you get?

            The Honda CR-V has long been considered a benchmark of the class and it receives a full redesign for 2023 that ushers in a roomier interior, enhanced technology features and an improved hybrid powertrain. The Kia Sportage also received a 2023 redesign. It’s got a bold new look, up-to-date tech and an all-new hybrid powertrain to rival the CR-V’s. Edmunds experts compare them to find out which one is the fuel-sipping SUV champ. 

            FUEL ECONOMY AND POWER











            Both hybrid SUVs are efficient, but there’s a clear winner. The front-wheel drive version of the Sportage Hybrid gets an impressive EPA estimate of 43 mpg combined (44 mpg city/42 mpg highway). The front-wheel-drive hybrid version of the CR-V gets 40 mpg combined (43 mpg city/36 mpg highway). When all-wheel drive is equipped, the estimates become closer: 38 mpg combined for the Sportage and 37 mpg combined for the CR-V.

            Edmunds has also driven the all-wheel-drive versions of both SUVs on its real-world test route. Here, the results were less than the EPA’s estimates but still respectable: 34.5 mpg for the Sportage and 33.3 mpg for the CR-V. 

            Hybrids were once known for their lack of power, but these two hybrid SUVs provide a suitable amount of grunt. The CR-V combines a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with a hybrid system for a total output of 204 horsepower. The Sportage one-ups it with its hybrid system and turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that combine for 227 horsepower. The Sportage puts it to use and sprints from 0 to 60 mph in 7.7 seconds. The hybrid CR-V is decently quick, too, but needs 8 seconds to get to 60 mph. 

            Winner: Kia Sportage Hybrid 

            TECHNOLOGY AND INTERIOR SPACE

            The base Sportage Hybrid trim has an average-size 8-inch center touchscreen. But all other trims get a large and sharp-looking 12.3-inch unit. The Sportage also sports a sizable standard fully digital instrument panel. The CR-V’s 7- and 9-inch touchscreens are less impressive, and so is its instrument panel, which consists of a small digital screen and an analog speedometer. 

            Both hybrids offer many advanced driver aids that can help make driving easier and safer. Honda provides more of them as standard equipment, however. For example, every hybrid CR-V has standard adaptive cruise control. On the Kia Sportage Hybrid, it’s standard on the top trim level only. 

            Cargo room is even in each SUV: Both provide more than 39 cubic feet of space behind the second row, which is among the biggest capacities in the small SUV class. Passenger space is also abundant, and getting in and out is easy. 

            Winner: tie 

            COMFORT AND DRIVING 

            The CR-V Hybrid’s ride quality is impressive. But it’s not as smooth and accommodating as the Sportage Hybrid’s. The Kia also benefits from a quieter interior. Edmunds’ editors have noted that the CR-V’s hybrid powertrain can sometimes get loud when accelerating. Up front, you’ll find the seats comfortable and supportive in each SUV. 

            The CR-V does have a few advantages. It’s more composed around turns, for example, and its continuously variable transmission leads to smoother acceleration than the Sportage’s six-speed automatic. But overall the Sportage’s superior ride helps it eke out a win here.

            Winner: Kia Sportage Hybrid 

            PRICING AND VALUE 

            The Sportage Hybrid’s base LX trim starts at $28,815 including destination. That’s significantly less than the hybrid version of the CR-V that starts at $34,245. The CR-V’s higher price gets you heated seats and some helpful advanced driver aids, but isn’t worth the price increase for those alone. Furthermore, the Sportage’s midlevel EX trim is still more affordable than the cheapest CR-V Hybrid and packs more features. As for top-spec trims, once again, the Sportage delivers a better deal than the CR-V and provides features the Honda lacks, including ventilated front seats and a surround-view camera system. 

            If you plan on keeping your hybrid SUV for many years, you should definitely consider warranties. Kia offers a four-year/60,000-mile limited warranty, which tops Honda’s three-year/36,000-mile limited warranty. 

            Winner: Kia Sportage Hybrid 

            EDMUNDS SAYS:

            The Honda CR-V has been one of Edmunds’ favorite small SUVs for a long time, but its latest hybrid model has been upstaged by the Kia Sportage Hybrid’s efficiency, price, comfort and feature-packed trim levels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818448,"Russia, China show off ties amid maneuvering over Ukraine","Russia and China showcased their deepening ties Wednesday in meetings others are watching for signs that Beijing might offer the Kremlin stronger support for its war in Ukraine.

            The visit by Wang Yi, the Chinese Communist Party's most senior foreign policy official, to Moscow comes as the conflict in Ukraine continues to upend the global diplomatic order.

            Relations between Russia and the West are at their lowest point since the Cold War, and ties between China and the U.S. are also under serious strain. Moscow suspended its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty with Washington this week. And the U.S. expressed concern that China could provide arms and ammunition to Russia.











            Speaking at the start of talks with Wang, Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed ties between the two countries and added that the Kremlin expects Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit Russia.

            The Russian leader, whose own rule over Russia is imperiled by the war, noted escalating international tensions, adding that “in this context, cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the global arena is particularly important for stabilizing the international situation.”

            While Wang said “Chinese-Russian relations aren’t directed against any third countries and certainly can’t be subject to pressure from any third countries,” the specter of the war and how it has galvanized the West and deepened its divide with Russia hung over his meeting with Putin.

            For instance, Wang emphasized that Moscow and Beijing both support “multipolarity and democratization of international relations” — a reference to their shared goal of countering the perceived U.S. dominance in global affairs.

            Earlier Wednesday, Wang held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “Our ties have continued to develop dynamically, and despite high turbulence in the global arena, we have shown the readiness to speak in defense of each other’s interests,” Lavrov said.

            Wang responded in kind, underlining Beijing's focus on deepening ties with Russia — a relationship it has said has “no limits.”

            China has pointedly refused to criticize the invasion of Ukraine while echoing Moscow's claim that the U.S. and NATO were to blame for provoking the Kremlin . The government in Beijing also has blasted the sanctions imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine. 

            Russia, in turn, has staunchly supported China amid tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan.

            The two nations have held military drills showcasing their defense ties. China, Russia and South Africa are holding naval drills in the Indian Ocean this week.

            A Russian frigate, the Admiral Gorshkov, arrived in Cape Town in recent days sporting the letters Z and V on its sides, letters that mark Russian weapons on the front lines in Ukraine and are used as a patriotic symbol in Russia.

            The rapprochement has worried the West. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said any Chinese involvement in the Kremlin’s war effort would be a “serious problem.”

            Asked Wednesday whether NATO has any indication that China might provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also told The Associated Press in Warsaw, Poland:

            “We have seen some signs that they may be planning for that and of course NATO allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen. China should not support Russia’s illegal war.”

            Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the U.N. security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.”

            Government-backed scholars in China shrugged off Washington's warnings over Beijing's relationship with Moscow as a reflection of what they described as a polarizing and distorted U.S. view.

            The Global Times quoted Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, as saying the U.S. and its allies have looked at the Russia-Ukraine conflict through “colored glasses.”

            “It seems like anyone who talks with Russia will be seen as siding with Moscow in Russia-Ukraine conflict,” the English-language Chinese newspaper quoted Zhang as saying. 

            Wang's talks with Lavrov followed his meeting Tuesday with Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful secretary of Russia’s National Security Council, who called for closer cooperation with Beijing to counter what he described as Western efforts to maintain dominance by thwarting an alliance between China and Russia.

            While China recently has emphasized its close ties with Moscow, it also has to tread carefully to avoid an escalation of tensions with the West as it looks to stimulate its economy following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

            “Isolation from the West is not something (Beijing) wants to risk,” Yu Jie, senior research fellow for China in the Asia-Pacific program at Chatham House, a British think tank, said in comments published Wednesday. “President Xi and his colleagues have begun to realize that cooperation with Russia comes with substantial limits to avoid undermining China’s own political priorities and longer-term economic interests.”

            Wang's trip to Moscow took place against a backdrop of grinding battles in Ukraine, with neither side appearing to gain momentum. Ukraine’s presidential office said at least seven civilians were killed between Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. 

            During a speech at a patriotic concert, Putin on Wednesday hailed Russia's “heroic” troops and claimed Moscow's forces were fighting for the country's “historic frontiers” to protect its “interests, people, culture, language and territory.”

            “When we stand together, we have no equals,” he shouted to enthusiastic crowds at a Moscow sports arena.

            The growing relationship between China and Russia is another example of how the war could spread into perilous new terrain.

            Another was Putin’s announcement Tuesday that Russia would suspend its participation in the New START Treaty, raising new concerns about the fate of the arms pact, which was already on life support.

            Last fall, Moscow decided to allow the resumption of U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites but refused to hold a scheduled round of consultations under the pact.

            The lower house of Russia’s parliament on Wednesday quickly endorsed Putin’s move to suspend the treaty, with officials and lawmakers casting it as an 11th-hour warning to Washington.

            Reflecting Beijing's cautious stance, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said the treaty was key to peace and stability and that China hopes “the two sides will properly resolve their differences.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818449,German business confidence improves for 4th straight month,"BERLIN (AP) — German business confidence has strengthened for a fourth consecutive month as managers look past current problems to take a more optimistic view of the months ahead, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday. 

            The Ifo institute said its monthly confidence index rose to 91.1 points in February from 90.1 last month. That was due entirely to a clear improvement in companies' outlook for the next six months, because their assessment of the situation now worsened slightly. 

            The survey has shown confidence rising since November, but it is well below its level of 98.6 last February, before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.











            Ifo said “the German economy is gradually working its way out of a period of weakness.” Europe's biggest economy shrank by 0.2% in last year's fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period, largely because of a decline in consumer spending.

            The Ifo survey is based on responses from about 9,000 companies in a broad range of sectors. 

            The fact that the improved outlook is still based solely on forward-looking expectations reinforces the view that “Germany’s economy will only start to recover during the second quarter,” Timo Klein, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence in Frankfurt, said in a research note.

            ""However, the broad-based nature of improving expectations across all relevant sectors reassures that economic activity will indeed pick up soon, enabled by reduced worries about energy security and prices,” he added.

            Inflation has dogged Germany in recent months as it has other countries. The Federal Statistical Office said Wednesday that the annual inflation rate rebounded to 8.7% in January after dropping to 8.1% in December, stemming from the state taking on the cost of natural gas customers’ monthly bills in December as part of a massive government energy relief package.

            That was meant to ease the pain of natural gas prices that surged following the invasion of Ukraine and the end of Russia's gas supplies to Germany. 

            A feared shortage of gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and power industry hasn't materialized, however. Germany's gas storage facilities are well-stocked, and the country has opened its first liquefied natural gas terminals.BERLIN (AP) — German business confidence has strengthened for a fourth consecutive month as managers look past current problems to take a more optimistic view of the months ahead, a closely watched survey showed Wednesday.The Ifo institute said its monthly confidence index rose to 91.1 points in February from 90.1 last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818450,Pakistan defense minister in Kabul over shut border crossing,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan's defense minister was in Afghanistan on Wednesday, meeting with officials there in an effort to resolve this week's closure by the Taliban administration of a key border crossing between the two neighboring countries, officials said.

            Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif's trip to Kabul and his meeting with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban-appointed deputy prime minister for economic affairs, comes as tensions have increased between Afghanistan and Pakistan in recent months. 

            Taliban security forces on Sunday closed the Torkham border crossing with Pakistan and on Monday traded fire with Pakistani border guards. The exchange wounded a Pakistani soldier. The border crossing has since remained shut, hampering trade on both sides of the troubled boundary. 











            The Taliban government in Kabul said Torkham was closed because of Pakistan’s alleged refusal to allow Afghan patients and their caretakers to enter Pakistan for medical care without travel documents. 

            For Pakistan, the crossing is a vital commercial artery and a trade route to Central Asian countries. But Islamabad has also accused the Afghan Taliban of providing sanctuary for Pakistani militants whose cross-border attacks into Pakistan have led to a spike in violence in the region. 

            Since Sunday's closure of Torkham, more than 6,000 trucks with goods, including vegetables, fruit and other perishable food items, have been stuck on the Pakistani side of the border.

            Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry confirmed Asif was in Kabul, saying only that he was there to discuss security-related matters, including counter-terrorism measures. Two Pakistani security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss border issues, told The Associated Press that Torkham's closure was top of the agenda. 

            In Kabul, a statement issued by Baradar's office about Asif's visit said the two sides discussed the current situation at the crossing. 

            According to the statement, Baradar told the Pakistani delegation that “necessary facilities should be provided for all passengers"" at Torkham and also at Spin Boldak, another trade route located to the south, across from Chaman in Pakistan's restive southwestern Baluchistan province.

            Baradar was also quoted as saying “special facilities"" should be provided for the transportation of patients needing emergency medical care. 

            “The Pakistani side assured the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan that it would resolve solving the mentioned issues and ... work quickly on this matter,"" the statement said. Baradar also stressed it was important “to separate commercial and economic issues from political and security issues so that it does not become prey to politics.""

            Meanwhile, Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, a director at the Pakistan-Afghanistan joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, deplored the traffic halt at Torkham.

            “Miles after miles you can see trucks loaded with various items, and the drivers are waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border,"" he told the AP. He said Afghan traders were also worried as the closure has caused problems on both sides of the border.

            Closures, cross-border fire and shootouts are common along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Each side has in the past closed both Torkham and Chaman over various reasons. 

            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were withdrawing from the country after 20 years of war. Like the rest of the world, Pakistan has so far not recognized Afghanistan’s Taliban government. The international community has been wary of the Taliban’s harsh measures, imposed since their takeover, especially in restricting the rights of women and minorities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818452,"Latin Grammys to be held in Spain, leaving US for 1st time","MADRID (AP) — The next Latin Grammy Awards gala will be held in southern Spain, leaving the United States for the first time, the head of its organization said Wednesday.

            Latin Recording Academy CEO Manuel Abud and the regional president for Spain’s Andalusia region made the announcement in Seville.

            “That the Latin Grammys will leave the United States for the first time is reason for special celebration, and what better place to hold them than Andalusia,” Abud said.











            Regional president Juan Manuel Moreno said the awards show would be held in November. Neither the specific dates nor the host city were given.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818461,Democratic Sen. Jon Tester to run for 4th term in Montana,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said Wednesday he will seek reelection to a fourth term in 2024, a boost to Democrats' hopes of maintaining a seat in the Republican-leaning state as they try to hang on to their narrow Senate majority.

            Tester, 66, said he was seeking reelection to continue standing up for veterans and to “lower costs,” which his campaign said referred to rising expenses for housing, health care, child care and other needs. 

            “I know that people in Washington don’t understand what a hard day’s work looks like or the challenges working families are facing in Montana,” the Democrat said Wednesday in a statement obtained by The Associated Press. “Montanans need a fighter holding Washington accountable.”











            As a third-generation farmer and former music teacher, Tester has leaned on a folksy speaking style and populist-themed messages to overcome his Republican opponents in each of the last three elections. He narrowly prevailed each time by drawing independents and centrist Republicans while distancing himself from party leaders in Washington.

            The state’s political landscape has shifted sharply since Tester was first elected in 2006, and he has been the sole Democrat holding statewide office for the past two years.

            The race could draw a fierce GOP primary contest between U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Matt Rosendale. Zinke, who served as interior secretary in the Trump administration, said he will consider a Senate campaign, while Rosendale has declined to say if he will run.

            Rosendale, a hard-right conservative, tried and failed to unseat Tester in 2018, with then-President Donald Trump making repeated appearances in Montana on the Republican’s behalf. Trump won Montana by 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election and 16 percentage points in the 2020 election, but Tester defeated Rosendale by 3.5 percentage points.

            In his past elections, Tester stressed a handful of issues — agriculture, health care, reproductive choice and support for veterans. He avoided direct confrontations with national Republican figures such as Trump, who bore a grudge against Tester for derailing his Veterans Affairs nominee, then-White House doctor Ronny Jackson, with revelations of misconduct.

            In 2018, Tester was the only Democratic senator from a Republican-leaning state to win his reelection bid after voting against Trump's Supreme Court picks.

            Tester, who chairs the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, sponsored legislation that expanded health care services for millions of service members exposed to toxic smoke from burn pits at military bases. 

            He’s advocated for campaign finance reform but has sometimes ranked as the top congressional recipient of campaign donations from lobbyists, including in 2012 and 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. His campaign has raised more than $4 million in cash since his 2018 reelection and had almost $3 million remaining as of Jan. 1, according to Federal Election Commission filings.

            Before running for the Senate, Tester, who still works on his family farm, taught music at an elementary school in the small town of Big Sandy in central Montana and was later elected to the town’s school board. He served in the state Senate from 1999 to 2007, spending the last two years as the chamber’s president.BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818462,"CNN's Don Lemon tweets another apology, returns to work","NEW YORK (AP) — CNN anchor Don Lemon tweeted an apology to viewers for his remarks about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley shortly before returning to work on Wednesday, then stuck to the news.

            He made no mention of his comments last week that Haley was not in “her prime,” during “CNN This Morning,” instead reporting on stories like President Joe Biden's trip to Ukraine, the Ohio train derailment and winter weather.

            Lemon, within the hour before he went on the air, tweeted that he appreciated the opportunity to return to work. He was absent for three days.











            “To my network, my colleagues and our incredible audience — I'm sorry,” he tweeted. “I've heard you, I'm learning from you, and I'm committed to doing better.”

            His tweet made no mention of Haley, who called Lemon's comments sexist and has been referring to them in fundraising appeals.

            On last Thursday's show, Lemon and fellow hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins had been discussing Haley's suggestion that politicians over 75 should be subject to mandatory mental competency tests.

            “Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime, sorry,” Lemon said. He said a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s. Haley is 51.

            He doubled down on his message even after being challenged by his female colleagues. “I think we need to qualify,” Harlow said at one point. “Are you talking about prime for childbearing or are you talking about prime for being president?”

            After video of his comments spread quickly online, Lemon tweeted regret for his “inartful and irrelevant” comments. He was scolded the next day by CNN chief executive Chris Licht during an internal staff meeting, and appeared on the call to apologize.

            Late Sunday, Licht told staff members in a memo that Lemon would return to work and undergo unspecified training. Licht said in the memo, obtained by The Associated Press, that it was important that the network balance accountability with fostering a culture in which people “can own, learn and grow from their mistakes.”

            Lemon was switched from his own prime-time show when a revamped “CNN This Morning” was launched in November, one of Licht's biggest swings since taking control of the network last year.

            Between poor ratings and awkwardness between the new anchor team, it hasn't gone well.NEW YORK (AP) — CNN anchor Don Lemon tweeted an apology to viewers for his remarks about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley shortly before returning to work on Wednesday, then stuck to the news.He made no mention of his comments last week that Haley was not in “her prime,” during “CNN This Morning,” instead reporting on stories like President Joe Biden's trip to Ukraine, the Ohio train derailment and winter weather.Lemon, within the hour before he went on the air, tweeted that he appreciated the opportunity to return to work.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818463,French high school student held for teacher's fatal stabbing,"PARIS (AP) — A high school student has been arrested for allegedly stabbing a female teacher to death in front of other students Wednesday in a classroom in southwestern France, officials and media reports said.

            An investigation has been opened for suspected premeditated murder into the incident at a private Catholic school in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Bayonne prosecutor Jerome Bourrier said. Investigators were able to interview the suspect on Wednesday afternoon, he added.

            The student was not previously known to police and justice services, Bourrier noted. He declined to provide more details amid the ongoing investigation.











            Education Minister Pap Ndiaye, who travelled to Saint-Jean-de-Luz, said a minute of silence will be held in all French schools on Thursday at 3pm.

            He said about 90 students, including those who witnessed the attack, as well as some teachers, are being taken care of by a psychology unit.

            A top government official, speaking anonymously because he was not allowed to discuss the issue publicly, said first elements communicated by police suggest the attacker has severe mental health issues.

            French media reported that the student, born in 2007, said he heard voices telling him to kill the 53-year-old Spanish language teacher.

            French government spokesman Olivier Veran, speaking after a weekly Cabinet meeting, expressed the government's support for the education community and said the event represents a trauma for the nation. 

            In 2020, teacher Samuel Paty was killed outside his school in suburban Paris by an 18-year-old refugee of Chechen origin. The attacker was angry at the teacher showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in class after the images were re-published by a satirical newspaper targeted in a 2015 attack.PARIS (AP) — A high school student has been arrested for allegedly stabbing a female teacher to death in front of other students Wednesday in a classroom in southwestern France, officials and media reports said.An investigation has been opened for suspected premeditated murder into the incident at a private Catholic school in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, Bayonne prosecutor Jerome Bourrier said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818465,Jake Paul takes next step in boxing journey with Fury fight,"Jake Paul’s unorthodox career in boxing might just be about to get serious.

            The YouTube influencer-turned-prize fighter will be coming up against a recognized professional boxer for the first time Sunday when he takes on Tommy Fury, the half-brother of world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury.

            Since venturing into boxing in 2018, Paul has fought a fellow influencer, a former NBA basketball player and three MMA fighters. He has won each time, building up his already-sturdy brand in the process.











            Fighting Fury is widely regarded as a step up and the WBC, which is sanctioning the fight, recognizes it. Indeed, if the 26-year-old Paul — a blond, bearded social-media phenomenon — wins, he will be granted a place in the WBC’s world rankings at cruiserweight.

            “Jake has dedication and respect to the sport,” the sanctioning body said, “and the WBC will not tolerate discrimination against anyone. He deserves the opportunities that any other boxer has.”

            It’s hardly a move that will be popular with boxing traditionalists.

            Then again, Paul is not exactly operating in those circles or attempting to please that demographic. He has forged a very different path into the boxing world and is making a success of it, given the fight against Fury has gotten pay-per-view status and is deemed big enough to be hosted for big money out in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia.

            Paul rose to fame a decade ago by posting Vine videos and then as an actor on Disney Channel show Bizaardvark. His rise as an influencer has not been without controversy, including accusations of sexual assault by two women in 2021 — he wasn't charged with either — and his apparent use of racial slurs while rapping in some videos in 2018. He was also charged with criminal trespass and unlawful assembly in 2020 following a riot at a mall outside Phoenix.

            Boxing is his most recent passion. He joined the pro ranks in 2019 and said he is “as serious as it gets” about the sport. He says he has a 30-person team supporting his training, which is largely done at the Cleveland native’s base in Puerto Rico.

            “Because my life’s on the line,” he told British newspaper The Independent ahead of the Fury fight, “so I’m not going to take that lightly.”

            Becoming a world champion boxer is his ultimate aim, even if that goal appeared even more remote with the news in January that Paul has signed a deal with the Professional Fighters League in mixed martial arts.

            Certainly Fury doesn’t take his opponent seriously as a boxer.

            “That’s like saying a pig is going to fly, isn’t it?” Fury said of Paul’s ambitions of becoming a world titleholder.

            “I’m going to teach Jake Paul a lesson … I’m going to show him he can’t just pick up a pair of gloves and say, ‘I’m going to be a world champion.’”

            Fury has an interesting back-story, too, and not just because he is the half-brother of one of the most famous boxers in the world and comes from a family of bare-knuckle fighters.

            The 23-year-old Briton really made his name by appearing on Love Island, a dating reality TV show, in 2019. That forced him to put his boxing career on hold for nine months — he had only fought twice by that point — and he is now married to a British social-media influencer, Molly-Mae Hague, with whom Fury finished runner-up on Love Island.

            Fury has an 8-0 boxing record but has never fought more than six rounds in a single bout. In that sense, he is also taking a step into the unknown this weekend, certainly when it comes to the global appeal of his opponent. Paul has 4.5 million followers on Twitter and 22 million followers on Instagram.

            The fight was initially scheduled for December 2021 but Fury had to pull out because of illness and injury, and then again for August 2022 only for Fury to again withdraw because of travel issues going into the United States.

            It will be held over eight rounds and Tyson Fury has given his half-brother something of an ultimatum ahead of the catchweight bout.

            “I expect Tommy to chin him,” he told British radio station talkSPORT. “If he doesn’t, he can stay in Saudi Arabia.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818479,Microsoft brings Bing chatbot to phones after curbing quirks,"Microsoft is ready to take its new Bing chatbot mainstream — less than a week after making major fixes to stop the artificially intelligent search engine from going off the rails.

            The company said Wednesday it is bringing the new AI technology to its Bing smartphone app, as well as the app for its Edge internet browser, though it is still requiring people to sign up for a waitlist before using it.

            Putting the new AI-enhanced search engine into the hands of smartphone users is meant to give Microsoft an advantage over Google, which dominates the internet search business but hasn't yet released such a chatbot to the public. 











            In the two weeks since Microsoft unveiled its revamped Bing, more than a million users around the world have experimented with a public preview of the new product after signing up for a waitlist to try it. Microsoft said most of those users responded positively, but others found Bing was insulting them, professing its love or voicing other disturbing or bizarre language. 

            Powered by some of the same technology behind the popular writing tool ChatGPT, built by Microsoft partner OpenAI, the new Bing is part of an emerging class of AI systems that have mastered human language and grammar after ingesting a huge trove of books and online writings. They can compose songs, recipes and emails on command, or concisely summarize concepts with information found across the internet. But they are also error-prone and unwieldy.

            Reports of Bing's odd behavior led Microsoft to look for a way to curtail Bing’s propensity to respond with strong emotional language to certain questions. It’s mostly done that by limiting the length and time of conversations with the chatbot, forcing users to start a fresh chat after several turns. But the upgraded Bing also now politely declines questions that it would have responded to just a week ago. 

            “I’m sorry but I prefer not to continue this conversation,” it says when asked technical questions about how it works or the rules that guide it. “I’m still learning so I appreciate your understanding and patience.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818481,German town sees blowback over relocations for refugees,"BERLIN (AP) — A German town's decision to relocate about 40 residents from their apartments to temporarily house refugees there has generated hundreds of hate mails and thousands of calls, an official said Wednesday.

            Authorities in Lörrach, a town of 49,000 people in Germany's southwestern corner and just over the border from the Swiss city of Basel, announced on Monday that that they would use the municipally owned residential buildings from the 1950s to house about 100 refugees.

            The town said in a statement that the buildings were already “at the end of their life cycle” and due to be demolished in the coming years to make way for new housing. 











            It added that “more modern and affordable housing offers will be made to the tenants promptly, according to their personal situation,” and that they will be given logistical and financial help moving.

            The move came as cities and towns across Germany struggle to house large numbers of refugees and migrants who have arrived over the past year, not only from Ukraine but also from countries further afield such as Syria and Afghanistan, and have been parceled out among regions. 

            Some have resorted to using convention centers, sports facilities or tents as regular migrant centers run out of room.

            Anti-migration politicians seized on the Lörrach case. Alice Weidel, the co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, sharply criticized the decision and complained of what she asserted was “an open preference for so-called refugees over those who have lived here for a long time.”

            The manager of the Wohnbau Lörrach housing company, Thomas Nostadt, said at a news conference Wednesday that the reaction had been “somewhat surprising and intimidates us.""

            “We have received hundreds of hate mails, thousands of calls, and now the first letters,” with contents that are “difficult to bear,” he said.

            Mayor Jörg Lutz said the town's decision was “not suited to a scandal.” He added that “we don't get up in the morning and wonder ... how we can unnecessarily annoy people or somehow cause trouble for them.""BERLIN (AP) — A German town's decision to relocate about 40 residents from their apartments to temporarily house refugees there has generated hundreds of hate mails and thousands of calls, an official said Wednesday.Authorities in Lörrach, a town of 49,000 people in Germany's southwestern corner and just over the border from the Swiss city of Basel, announced on Monday that that they would use the municipally owned residential buildings from the 1950s to house about 100 refugees.The town said in a statement that the buildings were already “at the end of their life cycle” and due to be demolished in the coming years to make way for new housing.It added that “more modern and affordable housing offers will be made to the tenants promptly, according to their personal situation,” and that they will be given logistical and financial help moving.The move came as cities and towns across Germany struggle to house large numbers of refugees and migrants who have arrived over the past year, not only from Ukraine but also from countries further afield such as Syria and Afghanistan, and have been parceled out among regions.Some have resorted to using convention centers, sports facilities or tents as regular migrant centers run out of room.Anti-migration politicians seized on the Lörrach case.

            The Public Prosecution Service said in a statement that a lengthy Dutch probe “has not produced sufficient legal and convincing evidence.” They asked for the suspect's acquittal and a court in the port city of Rotterdam granted the request.

            The suspect's identity was not released, in line with Dutch privacy guidelines.











            A court in Paris convicted 20 men in June for their roles in the attacks on the Bataclan theater, Paris cafes and the national stadium that killed 130 people. The only surviving gunman, Salah Abdeslam, was sentenced to life with no chance of parole.

            Among those convicted by the French court was a man who had been in contact with the Dutch suspect, the prosecution service in the Netherlands said, but it added that the French judgment showed “that it cannot be determined who supplied the weapons used and who might have been involved.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818483,"Weakened Cyclone Freddy batters Madagascar, killing 4","ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — A weakened Cyclone Freddy which pummeled Madagascar Tuesday night with heavy rains and strong destructive winds, killing four people, is continuing to wreak havoc in the southwest of the Indian Ocean nation. 

            Freddy battered the western city of Mananjary and left 16,660 people displaced and damaged nearly 5,000 homes in the country, according to the latest provisional assessment by Madagascar's risk and disaster management office. But somewhat weaker winds and better preparation staved off further damage.

            The cyclone had waned slightly over land, with the state's meteorological office measuring average winds of 50 kilometers (31 miles) per hour and reduced gusts of 70 kilometers (43 miles) per hour.











            The red alerts issued for Madagascar’s east coast were lifted Wednesday morning and the southwestern regions of the island have now been placed on “blue alert,” indicating a phase of post-cyclone damage assessment, rescue and recovery.

            “Recently built utilities, schools, stadium and health centers have been affected including houses by the seafront whose roofs were blown off,” said Martin Raveloarimanana, a church minister in Mananjary. “We try to repair what can be repaired and to clean up.""

            Raveloarimanana said that better preparation and early evacuations limited damage and risk to life. But he added that the region was still recovering from Cyclone Batsirai that pummeled the region in February last year and the new damage has only added to residents' despair. 

            Authorities say 64 tons of relief food rations have been made available to the region.

            “Bananas and breadfruit trees fell because of the winds,"" said Gabriel Ravelomanantsoa, a resident of Antsenavolo, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Mananjary. “This is what people eat daily and everything is now destroyed.”

            But he added: ""Homes were not affected that much as everyone had reinforced their house because we had information in advance.” 

            Vatovavy region authorities, where Mananjary is located, reported that 12,000 people were displaced. The region's governor told The Associated Press that officials are “still in the process of taking stock of the damage.”

            Freddy, now classified as a “moderate tropical storm,” is projected to leave the island Wednesday evening. It is set to travel across the Mozambican Channel where it will likely regain strength as it barrels towards mainland Africa, with Mozambique in its path, the United Nation's meteorological center in Reunion estimated. It is due to make landfall in the country on Friday morning. 

            The U.N. weather agency warned that the cyclone will lash Mozambique as a “strong tropical storm with potentially damaging winds.” 

            A regional climate center based in Botswana also warned of “heavy to extreme rainfall"" over some parts of Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and South Africa. 

            Meanwhile, fears of a new cyclone forming near the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean were raised after Reunion's cyclone center said it's monitoring a new tropical depression that “has significant potential to strengthen into a tropical storm by Thursday.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818484,Israeli parliament advances bill that may override top court,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's parliament advanced a bill Wednesday that would enable lawmakers to overturn a Supreme Court decision with a simple majority, a law that critics say would severely erode the country's democratic checks and balances.

            The “Supreme Court override” bill's approval in a preliminary vote in the Knesset was the latest step by Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition toward realizing the judicial overhaul that is steaming ahead despite calls for dialogue and consensus from American Jews and Israel's president, and weekly protest by tens of thousands of Israelis.

            Netanyahu and his ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox allies seek to enact a series of laws that would severely restrict the authority of the Supreme Court, which they believe has had unchecked power for years. Critics say they will erode democratic norms, concentrate power with the ruling coalition in parliament, and make Israel an illiberal democracy. 











            The Netanyahu administration’s proposed judicial overhaul have drawn fierce opposition and vocal protest in Israel and abroad. 

            Earlier this week parliament approved a first reading of bills to give the governing coalition control over judicial appointments and strip the court of judicial review over Basic Laws — Israel's quasi-constitutional legislation. 

            A draft bill brought before parliament Wednesday would require a unanimous Supreme Court decision to amend or strike down a law for violating a Basic Law, and that parliament would be able to pass laws impervious to Supreme Court review even if it violates a Basic Law. The preliminary vote passed 61-52. 

            Each of these bills now faces committee approval before final votes in parliament to pass them into law. 

            Netanyahu returned to power as prime minister in December at the head of the country's most hardline and religious government in its almost 75-year history following Israel's fifth election in less than four years. The longtime leader's trial for charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes has dragged on for nearly three years.JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's parliament advanced a bill Wednesday that would enable lawmakers to overturn a Supreme Court decision with a simple majority, a law that critics say would severely erode the country's democratic checks and balances.The “Supreme Court override” bill's approval in a preliminary vote in the Knesset was the latest step by Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling coalition toward realizing the judicial overhaul that is steaming ahead despite calls for dialogue and consensus from American Jews and Israel's president, and weekly protest by tens of thousands of Israelis.Netanyahu and his ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox allies seek to enact a series of laws that would severely restrict the authority of the Supreme Court, which they believe has had unchecked power for years. Critics say they will erode democratic norms, concentrate power with the ruling coalition in parliament, and make Israel an illiberal democracy.The Netanyahu administration’s proposed judicial overhaul have drawn fierce opposition and vocal protest in Israel and abroad.Earlier this week parliament approved a first reading of bills to give the governing coalition control over judicial appointments and strip the court of judicial review over Basic Laws — Israel's quasi-constitutional legislation.A draft bill brought before parliament Wednesday would require a unanimous Supreme Court decision to amend or strike down a law for violating a Basic Law, and that parliament would be able to pass laws impervious to Supreme Court review even if it violates a Basic Law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818485,Doubleview Provides Update on Milestone 56% Scandium Phosphate Recovery in First Phase Metallurgical Testing at the HAT Deposit,"Vancouver, British Columbia -  Newsfile Corp. - February 22, 2023 -  Doubleview Gold Corp. (TSXV: DBG) (OTCQB: DBLVF) (FSE: 1D4) (""Doubleview"") is pleased to provide additional information regarding the metallurgical process and significance of achieving 56% scandium (""Sc"") recovery to a scandium phosphate precipitate, in the first attempt of sequential purification of HAT deposit flotation tailings. The HAT Copper-Gold-Scandium-Cobalt deposit is located in the Golden Triangle region of the Atlin Mining District in British Columbia.   Initial independent laboratory tests completed by Coffey, Tetra Tech were designed to demonstrate the validity of the underlying process chemistry. Achieving 56% Sc recovery shows that primarily, the response to the treatment program was predictable and as anticipated.   Expectations are that scandium recoveries in the range of 80% to 90% will ultimately be achievable with further process development and optimisation. Production of a phosphate lends itself to the solution purification scheme currently under test. Once recovered, scandium can be converted to other forms. Alternative treatment strategies are also being considered.   EUR ING Andrew Carter B.Sc. CEng. MIMMM, MSAIMM SME of Coffey, Tetra Tech noted ""Even at moderate recoveries, the HAT deposit has the potential to meet international demand for scandium for the foreseeable future. As scandium is a by-product of a waste stream, recovery is not the fundamental driver, cost is. If it can be demonstrated that scandium can be recovered at an acceptable cost, then scandium has the potential to add significant value to the HAT deposit. A techno-economic evaluation for the production of scandium as a by-product of HAT copper-gold production will be evaluated on conclusion of the test work phase.""   Mr. Carter also noted that ""Reported recovery rates for other projects, either in planning or under development, are 76.2% at the Flemington Project on the low end, and 88.0% at the Syerston Project on the upper end. This positions the potential for Doubleview's HAT deposit favourably as it is targeting an 80-90% recovery rate, however it is noted that other scandium projects currently under consideration are treating laterites.   Farshad Shirvani, President and CEO stated ""Current research has shown, that scandium is a unique metal which, when combined with certain other metals, significantly enhances the strength of the alloy while also reducing its weight. This results in lighter and stronger materials that can potentially be essential for a wide range of products where efficiency is crucial. The HAT property is among the few mineral bodies in North America that contain significant amount of scandium.""   Scandium is associated with crustal rocks and mafic and utra-mafic lithologies such as amphiboles and pyroxenes (in particular clinopyroxene) and so is primarily associated with the tails stream of a conventional copper flotation process employed in the treatment of a porphyry ore. In a fully integrated process, the HAT deposit could produce a high-gold, low-cobalt copper concentrate and a low-gold, high-cobalt pyrite concentrate. The pyrite concentrate could be used to produce acid for the recovery of cobalt from roaster calcines and scandium from flotation tails.   Qualified Persons:   EUR ING Andrew Carter B.Sc. CEng.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818501,"Young Vinícius, veteran Benzema make perfect duo for Madrid","MADRID (AP) — Youth and experience. Speed and calmness. And lots of goals.

            The 22-year-old Vinícius Júnior and veteran Karim Benzema are proving to be ideal attacking partners for Real Madrid, teaming up to perfection to keep the European champion thriving.

            The duo came up big again in Madrid’s stunning recovery in the Champions League on Tuesday, scoring two goals each in the 5-2 come-from-behind win at Liverpool in the first leg of the round of 16.











            They both also had an assist — for each other — as Madrid rallied from two goals down to take a commanding lead into the second leg at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

            Vinícius and Benzema have combined for 17 goals and eight assists for Madrid this year alone. For the season, their total number of goals is 36 — 18 each — and they have 14 assists overall.

            They have complemented each other nicely up front, always knowing how to find each other with quick passes or long through balls to set up scoring opportunities.

            Vinícius contributes mostly with his great runs and nifty moves past defenders, while the 35-year-old Benzema adds his smart touches and accurate finishes. 

            They thrived together last season as well, when Benzema was crowned the best player in the world. This time, it’s Vinícius taking the leading role in Madrid’s attack.

            “Vinicius right now in my opinion is the most decisive player in world football, the man who can make the biggest difference,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said.

            Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp agreed that Vinícius is one of the best players in the world at the moment, and said that “Benzema is not bad” either. The coach also praised Rodrygo, the other Madrid forward who has often teamed up effectively with Vinícius and Benzema.

            Benzema blamed injuries for not being able to play even better and match his impressive numbers from last season.

            “I’ve not played much so far, but the important thing is that I’m contributing to the team with goals and assists,” he said. “I’m coming off the back of a season where I played a lot of games. I was injured after the World Cup and it’s difficult to reach the top level. But I’m feeling gradually better. Today I put in a good performance and I’m going to keep going.”

            Vinícius has been succeeding despite dealing with racist insults and hate attacks from opposing fans since the beginning of the season.

            He scored twice in the first half to bring Madrid back into Tuesday's game. 

            “Vini’s performance lifted us,” Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde said.

            Benzema's goals came in the second half, and defender Éder Militão also scored for Madrid.

            ANCELOTTI’S ADJUSTMENTS

            Ancelotti said he needed to make changes to the formation after the poor start, when Liverpool took advantage of Madrid’s vulnerability on the left flank.

            “I asked Luka (Modric) to press Fabinho, but that left us unguarded on the left side,” Ancelotti said. “In the second half I put Valverde there and we could fix it.”

            The second leg against Liverpool is on March 15. 

            Second-place Madrid, whch trails Barcelona by eight points, plays city rival Atletico Madrid in the Spanish league on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818503,Spanish league files new complaints for racist insults,"MADRID (AP) — The Spanish league filed three more complaints for racist insults during matches on Wednesday, including two aimed at Real Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior.

            The league said one Mallorca fan was identified for twice insulting players — once against Vinícius and another against Villarreal midfielder Samu Chukwueze. Both Vinícius and Chukwueze are Black.

            It said police have taken a statement from the individual, who was identified by Mallorca's security officials.











            The third complaint was against an Osasuna fan who insulted Vinícius, though the person has yet to be identified.

            The league has filed eight complaints to authorities for racist insults or chants against Vinícius, with three of them being shelved by prosecutors and another three being accepted for processing before courts.

            Authorities have yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy from a bridge in Madrid before the derby against Atletico Madrid last month. 

            Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp defended Vinícius ahead of his team's 5-2 loss to Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday, when the Brazil forward scored twice.

            “I hope he’s not fussed by any idiots who say something about him,” Klopp said. 

            There has been little punishment for hate attacks against soccer players in Spain, though recently Valladolid suspended 12 season ticket holders while investigating their alleged use of verbal abuse against Vinícius.

            The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818504,WWE leaning in to social media ahead of possible sale,"WWE, an organization that is already king of the ring on social media, will attempt to expand its online presence this year with the $6.5 billion sports entertainment company hinting that it may put itself up for sale.

            WWE surpassed 20 million followers on its flagship TikTok account during its most recent quarter, the first sports league to do so, and it's launching three international TikTok accounts after the WWE Español TikTok handle reached nearly 2 million followers in its first year, according to the company. 

            WWE's presence online is already broad and it does not appear to be slowing down. 











            The company's YouTube channel topped 92 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, making it one of only 10 channels on the platform to surpass the 90 million subscriber mark, according to Paul Levesque, the company's chief content officer and director who wrestled under the name Triple H. 

            To put those numbers in perspective, the National Basketball Association has 19.8 million subscribers, the National Football League has 10.6 million, and Major League Baseball has 4.05 million. 

            Part of the reason is that, unlike the NFL, NBA and MLB, the WWE has no off season. It churns out new content from television shows and premium live events all year long and its fans eat it up. 

            The online presence of the company is so pervasive that it seeps into the social media posts from some of the world's biggest athletes. 

            After defeating the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and MVP Patrick Mahomes posted a photo of himself on Twitter holding the Vince Lombardi trophy in one hand, and a WWE belt in the other. 

            That photo has been viewed more than 23 million times and that number keeps rising. 

            Constant innovations that are blended with entertainment sets WWE apart on social media platforms, said Christopher Zook, chairman and chief investment officer of CAZ Investments. 

            “It has consistently found ways to generate interest and stay ahead of the growing changes in consumer behavior,” Zook said. “The viral, fan-service nature of their content is how they have built so much staying power.”

            Increased sports viewership has put a premium on the value of organizations with a large following and that moves WWE to the front of the line for companies looking to expand into new areas, said Zook, particularly when seeking to reach key demographics willing to spend. 

            And the platforms on which the WWE is focused increasingly attract a crowd with discretionary income to spend.

            Among those between the ages of 18 and 29, 95% say they use YouTube, according to a Pew Research Center survey on social media use by U.S. adults in 2021. 

            TikTok is expected to overtake Facebook next year as the most-consumed social network among U.S. adults over the age of 18, according to Insider Intelligence. The research firm expects 18-to-24-year-old TikTok users in the U.S. to spend an average of 1 hour on the platform every day this year. 

            And WWE has been quick to partner with people that have a massive following on social media platforms, most recently the social media personality Logan Paul. 

            Three months after signing a contract with WWE last year, Paul took out a cell phone and filmed himself jumping from the ropes and onto Roman Reigns. That video garnered more than 40 million views across Paul’s and WWE’s social platforms in less than 24 hours, according to Levesque, topping all social media posts for the Stamford, Connecticut, company last year. 

            A midair collision in the ring last month between Paul and the wrestler Ricochet racked up another 26.5 million views across all platforms.

            The company is also pushing digital programming like a weekly show called “The Bump,” which can be viewed live every Wednesday on all of WWE’s digital and social media platforms.

            “Look for us to launch more digital original programming in 2023, as it has proven to be an effective platform to pilot new shows and test creative, all while creating new programming for our sales team to sell against,” Levesque said in a post-earnings conference call this month. 

            The test will be how potential buyers value WWE's social media presence and that potential going forward. 

            However, Wall Street already appears to be very optimistic about the entertainment company. 

            In the last 12 months shares of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. have jumped 50%, a period when all major U.S. stock markets have fallen into a serious funk. 

            Rumors of a sale ramped up late last year when WWE founder Vince McMahon returned to the company and took a seat on the board after a short retirement.

            In a letter dated Dec. 20, but published in January, McMahon wrote, ""Given the rapidly evolving media landscape in which more and more companies are seeking to own the intellectual property offered on their streaming platforms – I firmly believe that the best thing to do for all of WWE’s shareholders and other stakeholders is to undertake a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives.”

            Zook, of CAZ Investments, believes potential buyers are aware that social media has changed the equation. 

            “When you combine the staying power of live sporting events, with the rapid growth in subscription-based content, and an expansive social media presence, you can begin to see why sports franchises like the WWE are becoming a more attractive asset to own,” Zook said.WWE, an organization that is already king of the ring on social media, will attempt to expand its online presence this year with the $6.5 billion sports entertainment company hinting that it may put itself up for sale.WWE surpassed 20 million followers on its flagship TikTok account during its most recent quarter, the first sports league to do so, and it's launching three international TikTok accounts after the WWE Español TikTok handle reached nearly 2 million followers in its first year, according to the company.WWE's presence online is already broad and it does not appear to be slowing down.The company's YouTube channel topped 92 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, making it one of only 10 channels on the platform to surpass the 90 million subscriber mark, according to Paul Levesque, the company's chief content officer and director who wrestled under the name Triple H.To put those numbers in perspective, the National Basketball Association has 19.8 million subscribers, the National Football League has 10.6 million, and Major League Baseball has 4.05 million.Part of the reason is that, unlike the NFL, NBA and MLB, the WWE has no off season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818516,"Pakistani ex-PM Imran Khan's supporters rally, taunt police","LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of Pakistan’s former prime minister on Wednesday defied a ban on rallies in a commercial area of the city of Lahore, taunting police and asking to be arrested en masse. 

            The protest is part Imran Khan's latest campaign dubbed “fill the jail cells"" with detainees — or “jail bharo"" in Urdu — as a way to pressure the administration into holding early elections. 

            But as the rally by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf opposition party got under way in Lahore, police made no move to detain Khan’s supporters. 











            At that point, several protesters barged into a police van parked nearby, demanding they be taken into custody. Police officers at the scene insisted they were not going to arrest them. 

            Khan last week called on his party and supporters to invite the police to arrest them in Lahore, the capital of the eastern Punjab province, where the former prime minister has a strong following. 

            Lahore is also the home city of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, who replaced Khan after a no-confidence in the parliament last April. Since then, Khan — who has claimed his ouster was a conspiracy by Sharif and Washington — has been seeking early elections. 

            The United States and Sharif's government have denied any conspiracy and the prime minister has rejected calls for early elections. The vote, Sharif has said, would be held as planned later this year. 

            “This so-called jail bharo campaign by Imran Khan is just a political stunt and nothing else,"" Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb told reporters. 

            She said Khan himself was safe from arrest after getting a preemptive bail order from a court in Lahore days ago, which enables him to avoid arrest.

            “He should voluntarily offer his arrest instead of asking his supporters to fill the jails,"" Aurangzeb added.

            Khan, a former cricket star turned Islamist politician, was not at the rally even though it was taking place in his hometown. He was wounded in the leg in a gun attack while leading a rally toward the capital, Islamabad, last November. One of Khan’s supporters was killed and several others were wounded in the attack.

            Since then, Khan has led the anti-government campaign from his home.

            Earlier Wednesday, Asad Omar, a senior leader from Khan's party, addressed the rally in Lahore, saying Khan's supporters were going to jail “to get real freedom."" 

            A local TV later broadcast footage of Omar, and Shah Mahmood Qureshi, another senior leader from Khan's party, climbing into a police van and making victory signs and posing for photographers. Police asked them not to sit inside the van. 

            Police said the opposition politicians wanted to force the police van to take them to the city's jail, where no one can be held without being arrested.

            In October, Pakistan's elections commission disqualified Khan from holding public office for five years after finding he had unlawfully sold state gifts and concealed assets as premier. Khan denies the charge and has filed a motion with a court to challenge the commission.

            In January, provincial lawmakers from Khan's party dissolved two legislatures — in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces — where the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf had majority seats, in a failed attempt to force early federal elections.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818517,Horn of Africa drought trends said worse than in 2011 famine,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Trends in a historic Horn of Africa drought are now worse than they were during the 2011 drought in which at least a quarter-million people died, a climate center said Wednesday.

            The IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Center said below-normal rainfall is expected in the rainy season over the next three months.

            “This could be the sixth failed consecutive rainfall season” in the region that includes Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, the center said.











            The drought, the longest on record in Somalia, has lasted almost three years, and tens of thousands of people are said to have died. More than 1 million people have been displaced in Somalia alone, according to the United Nations.

            Last month, the U.N. resident coordinator in Somalia warned that excess deaths in Somalia will “almost certainly” surpass those of the famine declared in the country in 2011.

            Close to 23 million people are thought to be highly food insecure in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, according to a food security working group chaired by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.

            Already, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families’ health and wealth have died, Wednesday’s statement said. Many people affected across the region are pastoralists or farmers who have watched crops wither and water sources run dry.

            The war in Ukraine has affected the humanitarian response as traditional donors in Europe divert funding to the crisis closer to home. The head of IGAD, Workneh Gebeyehu, urged governments and partners to act “before it’s too late.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818519,Could R. Kelly essentially get a ‘life’ prison sentence?,"CHICAGO (AP) — Superstar-turned-felon R. Kelly wouldn’t be eligible for release until 2066, a year shy of his 100th birthday, if a federal judge accepts prosecutors’ recommendations at his sentencing hearing Thursday in his hometown of Chicago.

            Kelly, 56, will be sentenced on his convictions from last year in Chicago of child pornography and enticement. He is already serving 30 years for his 2021 racketeering and sex trafficking convictions in New York.

            The central question for Judge Harry Leinenweber is whether to order that Kelly serve a Chicago sentence simultaneously with the New York sentence or that he start serving his Chicago sentence only after he completes the New York term.











            If the singer is ordered to serve the sentences one after the other, that would practically erase any chance of Kelly ever getting out of prison alive.

            Here is a look at the potential sentences:

            WHAT ARE PROSECUTORS ASKING FOR?

            In a sentencing memo last week, they recommended Kelly serve 25 more years and that he serve it consecutively to the New York sentence.

            
                Prosecutors described Kelly as “a serial sexual predator” who used his fame and wealth to reel in star-struck fans to sexually abuse and then discard them. They say he's shown no remorse.

            Jurors in Chicago convicted Kelly on three counts each of producing child porn and the enticement of minors for sex. Kelly was acquitted of the marquee count alleging he successfully rigged his 2008 state child pornography trial.

            Prosecutors acknowledged a 25-year sentence would be higher than sentencing guidelines suggest and that a consecutive sentence would be tantamount to a life sentence.

            But they argued Kelly's “desire to sexually abuse children is insatiable” and such a sentence was required “to protect the community from” him.

            WHAT SENTENCE DOES THE DEFENSE WANT?

            Kelly’s lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, asked for a sentence of around 10 years — on the low end of the guideline range.

            She also requested in a series of pre-sentence filings that, whatever prison sentence Leinenweber imposes, he allow Kelly to serve it at the same time as the New York sentence.

            Bonjean said Kelly’s existing 30-year term alone means he won't be eligible for release until he is around 80 and that a new consecutive sentence would be a “second life sentence.”

            She said an extended sentence for Kelly, who is Black, would also be disproportionate given that, according to her, white rock stars have long gotten away with the behavior for which Kelly was convicted.

            WHAT ARE THE CRITERIA FOR A CONSECUTIVE SENTENCE?

            By statute, the default for judges is to allow defendants to serve their sentences simultaneously — which courts call “concurrently” — which effectively means they serve only the longest sentence imposed.

            But if they conclude a defendant’s crimes were particularly egregious, they can decide that the only way to deter such crimes is to order sentences be served one after the other.

            Judges are more likely to order a simultaneous sentence to a sentence imposed in a previous case if the crimes in the two cases are related. While prosecutors say Kelly’s victims in the Chicago case are different, the defense says the allegations were substantially the same.

            WHAT DO PROSECUTORS ARGUE?

            They say Kelly’s crimes were particularly egregious because they involved children, enticing girls as young as 14 and 15 for sex.

            Making those crimes worse, they say, is that “Kelly sought to memorialize his sexual exploitation” by filming them. Some videos became available online, which exacerbated the harm to society, prosecutors said.

            “Because Kelly is Kelly, more people have watched child pornography,” their filing said. “The effects of Kelly’s conduct are wide-ranging, incalculable and irreversible.”

            WHAT ABOUT THE DEFENSE?

            Bonjean accused prosecutors of offering an “embellished narrative” in their sentencing memo “to inflame the passions of the public and the Court” against Kelly.

            She also said they have sought to get the judge to join what she called the government’s “blood-thirsty campaign to make Kelly a symbol of the #MeToo movement.”

            “The government insists on exaggerating Kelly’s misdeeds, sounding more like a teaser for the next installation of ‘Surviving R. Kelly’ than lawyers,” she said.

            That is a reference to Lifetime’s 2019 docu-series, “Surviving R. Kelly” — which featured testimonials by his accusers, including several who testified at the 2022 Chicago trial.

            Bonjean also hit back at prosecutors for arguing her client has never expressed remorse. She said Kelly had a right to remain silent as he appeals and that prosecutors shouldn't be permitted to use her advice to Kelly not to speak as proof he lacks remorse.

            She added that Kelly’s own abuse as a child and illiteracy throughout adulthood also justified leniency. That the conduct that led to charges happened decades ago should also be factored in, she said.

            Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, rose from poverty in Chicago to superstardom, with hits like “I Believe I Can Fly” and the sex-infused “Bump n’ Grind.”

            Bonjean said Kelly has already suffered enormously for his legal troubles, including financially. She said his worth once approached $1 billion but that he “is now destitute.”

            WILL KELLY ADDRESS THE COURT AT SENTENCING?

            It’s not clear he will, though he risks Judge Leinenweber holding that against him. Judges often like to hear expressions of remorse at sentencing. Most defendants do speak.

            But defendants who are appealing convictions, as Kelly is, sometimes choose not to. Kelly did not speak at his 2022 sentencing in New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818520,Committee says 305 nominated for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Wednesday that 305 candidates were nominated for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize by the Feb. 1 deadline, the lowest number in four years. The names of the 212 individuals and 93 organizations were not released, in accordance with committee practice.

            The Oslo-based organization said there was a decrease from last year's 343 candidates, and that it was the lowest number of registered candidates since 2019. Over the last eight years, the number of annual candidates has exceeded 300, it said, adding that the provisional record was set in 2016 with 376.

            “Who nominates, and who is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize is a secret for 50 years,” the very secretive board in Oslo said in a statement.











            A vast group of people can submit a nomination for the prize: heads of state or politicians serving at a national level, university professors, directors of foreign policy institutes, past Nobel Prize recipients and members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

            However, those doing the nominating may choose to make it public, raising publicity both for the nominee and the proposer.

            Norwegian lawmaker Lan Marie Nguyen Berg of the Green Party nominated two climate activists, Greta Thunberg of Sweden and Ugandan Vanessa Nakate, “for enormous mobilization"" in their continents.

            Thunberg has been nominated four times, including last year when the prize went to human rights activists from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.

            The 2022 award was a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine ruptured decades of nearly uninterrupted peace in Europe, and to the Belarusian president, his authoritarian ally.

            On Feb. 1, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, Henrik Urdal, shortlisted human rights activists as his favorites to win the 2023 award. They included Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian human rights activist and Mahbouba Seraj, an Afghan women’s rights activist; Myanmar’s representative to the United Nations, Kyaw Moe Tun; and the Netherlands-based International Court of Justice, among others.

            Urdal noted that 2023 was the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that his list “reflects a timely and worthy focus on human rights defenders and activists.”

            The Nobel Peace Prize is handed out in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, while the other awards are presented in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in line with prize founder Alfred Nobel’s wishes.

            Five Nobel Prizes were established under the terms of Nobel’s will. A sixth, for economics, was created by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel. The winners will be announced in early October.

            The laureates receive their awards at prize ceremonies held on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896. The prize includes a diploma, a gold medal and a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million) — which often is shared.

            The Nobel Peace Prize has always attracted more controversial or surprising nominees than its scientific cousins. Both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump were nominated in 2021.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Wednesday that 305 candidates were nominated for the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize by the Feb. 1 deadline, the lowest number in four years.

Over the last eight years, the number of annual candidates has exceeded 300, it said, adding that the provisional record was set in 2016 with 376.“Who nominates, and who is nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize is a secret for 50 years,” the very secretive board in Oslo said in a statement.A vast group of people can submit a nomination for the prize: heads of state or politicians serving at a national level, university professors, directors of foreign policy institutes, past Nobel Prize recipients and members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.However, those doing the nominating may choose to make it public, raising publicity both for the nominee and the proposer.Norwegian lawmaker Lan Marie Nguyen Berg of the Green Party nominated two climate activists, Greta Thunberg of Sweden and Ugandan Vanessa Nakate, “for enormous mobilization"" in their continents.Thunberg has been nominated four times, including last year when the prize went to human rights activists from Ukraine, Belarus and Russia.The 2022 award was a strong rebuke to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine ruptured decades of nearly uninterrupted peace in Europe, and to the Belarusian president, his authoritarian ally.On Feb. 1, the director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, Henrik Urdal, shortlisted human rights activists as his favorites to win the 2023 award. They included Narges Mohammadi, an Iranian human rights activist and Mahbouba Seraj, an Afghan women’s rights activist; Myanmar’s representative to the United Nations, Kyaw Moe Tun; and the Netherlands-based International Court of Justice, among others.Urdal noted that 2023 was the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and that his list “reflects a timely and worthy focus on human rights defenders and activists.”The Nobel Peace Prize is handed out in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, while the other awards are presented in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, in line with prize founder Alfred Nobel’s wishes.Five Nobel Prizes were established under the terms of Nobel’s will. A sixth, for economics, was created by the Central Bank of Sweden in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel. The winners will be announced in early October.The laureates receive their awards at prize ceremonies held on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896. The prize includes a diploma, a gold medal and a cash award of 10 million Swedish kronor (about $1 million) — which often is shared.The Nobel Peace Prize has always attracted more controversial or surprising nominees than its scientific cousins. Both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump were nominated in 2021.",2023/02/22,,World

Years passed, but she could not find a good match.Mahawar, a resident of Sitapur, a small town in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, has been a wheelchair user ever since she was infected with polio as a child.""I was homeschooled and did not get any exposure to the outside world all the years I was growing up,"" the 43-year-old told DW.""Despite all the difficulties, I had always been optimistic about finding a potential match, but when I crossed into my 30s, I got really frustrated feeling that I may never get to marry, leave my house and experience life on my own terms,"" she said.According to a 2011 census, the latest data available, there were about 26.8 million people living with disabilities in India. At the time, 40% were not married. Though dating and navigating romantic relationships can be hard for anyone, people with disabilities can find the process to be particularly exclusionary and they can be met with discrimination and prejudice.""One of the biggest challenges which people with disabilities face when trying to date is that they are often seen as asexual human beings,"" said Nipun Malhotra, a Delhi-based disability rights activist.Mahawar recalled her unfortunate experiences on matrimony sites, where she was confronted with exorbitant dowry demands.""My parents did not have a lot of savings because they had to spend a good chunk of their income on my medical expenses, so meeting those dowry demands were out of question,"" she said.Abhishek Shukla, who was diagnosed with osteogenesis, also known as brittle bone disease, has also had his share of bad experiences on matrimony sites.""Matrimony sites are of no use to people with disabilities. They charge the full amount for their service, but have very few options for us,"" said Shukla, who quit his job at an Indian multinational company after his condition became more prominent.""When I graduated from college and got a job, I used to get a lot of proposals, but later as people learned about my condition they distanced themselves,"" the 35-year-old told DW, adding that he continues the search for a potential partner.In 2017, life started to look up for Mahawar when she came across Inclov, a dating app for people living with disabilities.Having lived her entire life under parental supervision, curiosity pushed Mahawar to purchase a smartphone, and at the age of 38, she installed Inclov. Soon after she started using the app, she met her spouse and married in 2018.""I met guys who just wanted to pass their time, I met people who were clear with their expectations and I am still friends with them, and I also met my husband through the app,"" she said.Mahawar now lives with her husband, Alok Kumar, in Sitapur where he runs a tuition center.Inclov, however, shut its operations in 2019. At its peak, the app had about 50,000 people with disabilities registered as users. ""Many users who matched on Inclov are now parents,"" Kalyani Khona, founder of Inclov, told DW.Though people with disabilities still have the option to use mainstream dating apps like Bumble and Tinder, their experiences differed vastly, according to Khona.""One of the most glaring difference users felt while using Inclov was in the treatment […] on Inclov, users empathized with people having disabilities,"" said Khona.Besides launching an app, Khona has also organized social meetups inclusive of people with disabilities.According to Khona, the stigma around dating people with a disability still persists in society, and ""the apps only solve the discovery problem, but the process of matchmaking still requires a lot of effort.""Though apps have made it easier for people with disabilities to date and find spouses online, rights activist Malhotra said mainstream apps should also become more inclusive.""Just like questions about sexual orientation, hobbies and interests, the dating apps should include questions on whether a person is open to dating people with disabilities or not,"" he said, adding that it would lead to more honest conversations.He also highlighted how dating apps exclude people with disabilities. ""Many apps require users to imitate hand gestures, which is not possible for a person with a locomotor disability like me,"" he said.In September 2022, Minal Sethi launched her app MatchAble in India. Still in its early stage and with limited users, the app aims to provide people with disabilities with an avenue to forge relationships and socialize online.""Through the app, we want to enable genuine connections and make it easier for people with disabilities to find people who understand them,"" said Sethi, adding that she intends to include an array of features to be inclusive of users living with disabilities in the next phase of the app launch.Edited by: Sou-Jie van BrunnersumEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818536,Nearly 1 million apply for asylum in EU in 2022,"Nearly a million people applied for asylum in European countries last year, the highest tally since 2016, according to a Wednesday report by the European Union Agency for Asylum (EUAA).The agency said it received some 966,000 applications in 2022, which is 50% more applications it received in 2021.The numbers include applications for countries in the European Union, as well as Norway and Switzerland that are not members of the EU.Ukrainian refugees in EU states are protected under a separate mechanism called the Temporary Protection Directive and are largely not part of the asylum applications. The directive aims to avoid slowing down the asylum processes for old and new applicants.Nearly 1,251,815 people applied for asylum in 2016, when the Syrian conflict created the largest wave of refugees to Europe after World War II.Now, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 accounts for the largest movement of refugees since World War II, with more than 7 million people having fled the country. Millions more remain internally displaced.With more than 130,000 applications, Syrians were the largest group to have applied for asylum.They were closely followed by Afghans fleeing insecurity in their own country following the Taliban's 2021 takeover, with 129,000 requests.Turks, with 55,000 requests, were the third-largest group to have applied for protection owing to soaring inflation and a crisis of democracy in the country, according to the EU agency for asylum.Venezuelans, Colombians, Bangladeshis and Georgians applied for asylum in record numbers last year, as did Moroccans, Tunisians and Egyptians. Some 4% of asylum-seekers claimed to be unaccompanied minors.The number of applications surged in 2022 partly owing to a relaxation of COVID-19 measures, as well as growing economic insecurity and conflict around the world, the EU agency said.rm/nm (AP, AFP)",2023/02/22,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818538,German politicians call for cancellation of Roger Waters concert,"City politicians in Cologne have called for a spring concert by the former member of the British avant-garde rock band Pink Floyd to be canceled, citing the musician's controversial political stance on Russia's war in Ukraine and accusations of antisemitism.The majority of the city council's members, who span the political spectrum, sent an open letter to the management of Lanxess-Arena, the large-scale venue hosting the performance on May 9. In it, they stated they cannot understand why the concert organizers would provide Waters with a stage and called on management ""to do everything they can to prevent the concert.""The city council has no direct influence on whether the concert goes forward, as the arena is a private venue.In recent months, Waters' unabashed statements backing Russia's propaganda line on the war in Ukraine have led to an outpouring of criticism against the musician.In a prominent recent incident, the 79-year-old addressed the UN Security Council in New York on February 8 via video link.Invited by Moscow to give the speech, Roger Waters repeated that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was ""provoked,"" claiming that he represented a ""voiceless majority"" with his opinion.He did condemn ""in the strongest possible terms"" Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but added, that it ""was not unprovoked, so I also condemn the provocateur in the strongest possible terms.""Waters urged US President Joe Biden, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the ""USA, NATO, Russia, the EU,""  to ""change course now and agree to a cease-fire in Ukraine today.""Russia presumably invited Waters to the meeting following his interview with the Berliner Zeitung, during which he made critical remarks about arms deliveries to Ukraine and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as someone who ""governs carefully, making decisions on the grounds of a consensus."" He also repeated Russia's official propaganda, stating that the attack on Ukraine was actually a ""special military operation.""""How sad for his former fans to see him accepting the role of just another brick in the wall — the wall of Russian disinformation and propaganda,"" said Ukrainian UN Ambassador Serhij Kyslyza, referring to the Pink Floyd 1979 world hit ""Another Brick In The Wall.""US Deputy Ambassador Richard Mills said Waters ""has impressive credentials as a recording artist"" but argued that the musician's qualifications to speak to the council as an expert on arms control or European security issues are not very plausible.It is not the first time Waters spoke about the Ukraine war in public. In September 2022, he accused Zelenskyy of ""extreme nationalism"" and urged the West to stop supplying weapons to Ukraine. As a result, his concerts in Krakow, Poland, were canceled and the city administration declared him an ""undesirable person.""In Germany, an alliance of Jewish groups has called for the cancellation of a Waters concert scheduled for late May in Frankfurt. In a statement released Wednesday, the alliance accused Waters of antisemitic propaganda and expressing hostility toward Jews at events. The signatories call Waters an ""antisemite, conspiracy theorist and Israel-hater"" and charge him with advocating discrimination against Jewish-Israeli artists based on their heritage and putting pressure on musicians who want to perform in Israel. There is a limit to freedom of expression when it comes to protecting human dignity in the public sphere, they argue.Uwe Becker, the antisemitism commissioner in the state of Hesse, argued in January that Waters was ""advocating the antisemitic BDS boycott movement with increasing aggression."" BDS stands for ""boycott, divestment and sanctions"" and calls on musicians, athletes, companies and politicians not to invest in or perform in Israel.Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media Claudia Roth told the Jüdische Allgemeine newspaper on Thursday that while she could not ban a concert, she would like to see organizers refrain from having concerts with Waters, ""and if they still take place, that he play to empty halls."" She said she deplores the development of the musician, who has ""obviously become an active BDS supporter and, moreover, a conspiracy theorist.""Waters has in the past let pig-shaped balloons featuring the Star of David rise at concerts.On his current tour he has reportedly told the audience that if they love Pink Floyd but can't stand his politics, they might as well ""f**k off to the bar, right now.""Waters' former bandmates, who have taken a stand against Russia's war of aggression, also distanced themselves from the controversial musician.Polly Samson, a lyricist who worked on some of Pink Floyd's songs and who is married to Waters' former bandmate David Gilmour, called out Waters following the Berliner Zeitung interview, tweeting, ""you are rotten to your antisemitic core"" and a ""Putin apologist."" Gilmour agreed, ""Every word demonstrably true.""The British band Pink Floyd, founded in 1965, is one of the most successful bands in rock history with albums including ""The Dark Side of The Moon"" and ""The Wall."" Roger Waters left the band in the mid-1980s and has since pursued a solo career.This article was originally written in German.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818539,"Poland-Ukraine: Solidarity with refugees, fear of Russia","February 1943: The region of Volhynia, then part of Nazi-occupied Poland and now part of Ukraine, saw a wave of violence unleashed on the Polish population by Ukrainian nationalists. It is estimated that by August of that year, up to 120,000 Poles were massacred in Volhynia by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Exactly 80 years on from this bloody chapter in Polish-Ukrainian history, Poland has helped millions of Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion.Among those helping are Beata and Karol Popko, who have made one of the three bedrooms in their Warsaw flat, which they share with their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, available for refugees. ""I wonder what my grandmother would say if she were still alive,"" says 32-year-old Karol. ""She survived the Volhynia massacre, and my entire childhood was marked by stories about the atrocities committed by the evil Ukrainians.""Nevertheless, he believes that Ukrainian refugees should be helped regardless of the old wounds in the relations between these two countries. Over the course of the past year, 12 refugees have lived with the Popko family — some for days, others for weeks — until they were able to find their own accommodation or left Poland altogether.Popko often gathered up the refugees at the railway station in Warsaw where he worked as a volunteer helping Ukrainian arrivals alongside his regular job. He has also driven trucks in aid convoys to Ukraine.The search machine expert also runs one of the most popular websites for Ukrainian refugees in Poland, ukrainianinpoland.pl. ""Our texts are written by Ukrainians living in Poland who know exactly what their compatriots need,"" he says. ""We want to help people who suddenly have to build a new life here,"" explains Popko. The website tells them how to get a Polish driving license, how to find a dentist or what help is available to Ukrainians from international organizations.Right from the word go, Ukrainian refugees in Poland have been able to rely more on private and social initiatives than on the authorities. The sudden arrival of millions of people in a short space of time was a massive challenge for Poland — one for which no one was prepared. Within weeks of Russia launching the invasion on February 24, 2022, Poland — which had previously refused to take in refugees at EU level — had become a country of immigration.Millions of Ukrainians have come to Poland. Although many have since returned to Ukraine or left Poland for other countries, over 1.4 million have registered in Poland.Once they have a Polish insurance number (PESEL), they get state health insurance and are allowed to work. The state gives them the equivalent of €70 ($75) in welcome money and €110 in monthly child benefits. Adults without children do not receive any support. Nevertheless, far more Ukrainian refugees fled to Poland than to any other country.According to surveys, three-quarters of them hope to go back home, which is why they prefer to stay in neighboring Poland rather than move to a more distant country.For many Ukrainian refugees, the Polish language is also a decisive factor. Polish and Ukrainian are similar enough to allow both sides to communicate easily with one another.Moreover, some refugees already had relatives in Poland and were able to find work through them.Even before the Russian invasion, about one million Ukrainians worked in Poland. Many of them moved there when Russia occupied Crimea in 2014. Of this group, many men returned to fight for Ukraine after Russia invaded their country on February 24, 2022. At present, there are about 2.2 million Ukrainians in Poland.The extent of solidarity shown at the start of the war was surprising, says Dominika Pszczolkowska, a political scientist at the Centre of Migration Research at the University of Warsaw. ""The Poles never rank very highly when it comes to European surveys about active citizenship. Business and family matters count more to them,"" she told DW. Nevertheless, she adds, when it came to helping Ukrainian refugees, the Poles demonstrated a phenomenal ability to organize quickly from the bottom up.But the willingness to help is receding. In late 2022, surveys indicated that 63% of Poles — or someone close to them — were supporting refugees out of their own pocket. In January 2023, on the other hand, the Warsaw-based Public Opinion Research Center CBOS discovered that this had dropped to just 41%.""It was to be expected that fatigue would set in,"" says Pszczolkowska, adding that prices have risen in Poland, too, and people are able to afford less and less. ""And if, for example, someone has to wait longer for a doctor's appointment because there are also Ukrainians in the queue ahead of them, then that person might easily vent their anger at those Ukrainians.""According to the Racist and Xenophobic Behaviour Monitoring Centre in Warsaw, the number of verbal and physical attacks on Ukrainians has risen sharply. During last year's annual demonstration by nationalists on Poland's national holiday, November 11, people carried banners and shouted anti-Ukrainian slogans like ""The Ukrainian is not my brother,"" ""Stop the ukrainization of Poland"" and ""This is not our war.""However, the influx of Ukrainian refugees has not been the only thing that has shaped Poland over the past year. So too has a growing fear of Russia. According to the CBOS, 43% of Poles consider the prospect of a Russian attack on their country to be realistic, and 78% see Russia as a threat.Karol Popko is afraid, too. ""I think that Putin could attack Poland. If he has already mobilized hundreds of thousands of soldiers, he can't just send them home again; he has to do something with them. So, he'll attack somewhere and then see what happens,"" he says.Popko says that he may in future seek refuge for himself, his family and his company abroad. But he intends to stay in Poland as long as possible. ""Thousands of Ukrainians who need help are still coming to Poland every day.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/02/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818540,Turkey-Syria earthquake: How can cities build up resilience?,"When Nepal was hit by consecutive earthquakes in April and May 2015, around 9,000 people were killed and many thousands more were injured. Multistory buildings, homes and temples, not built to withstand the tremors, collapsed. Damage and reconstruction costs were in the billions.Nearly eight years later, the Nepalese government and international aid organizations have helped rebuild hundreds of thousands of homes across the Himalayan country, preparing these buildings to withstand the shock of the next inevitable earthquake.But in Turkey and Syria — where the death toll and destruction are much higher — this is expected to be a far greater challenge.The aim for reconstruction groups is to ""build back better,"" often using ""locally available, widely known, and cost competitive"" building techniques, said Elizabeth Hausler, the founder and CEO of US-based NGO Build Change, which is active in Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.In Nepal, homeowners were required to be involved in the rebuilding effort. For the Japan International Cooperation Agency, that included a strong focus on community networks and ""mobile masons."" These local engineers were trained in seismic-resistant building by Japanese experts, who are well-versed in designing earthquake-proof buildings. Mobile masons traveled from village to village, helping with reconstruction and passing on their newly learned techniques.""The mobile masons helped us to build our house brick-by brick, which is stronger and will not collapse even if another earthquake hits,"" said Resham Binita Bhujel, a single mother of five young children in a village northeast of Kathmandu, in a 2020 JICA progress report.The majority of the more than 1 million buildings damaged or destroyed in rural Nepal featured traditional stone masonry and mud-mortar techniques, on average two stories in height. After surveying the damage, Build Change found that many damaged buildings didn't necessarily have to be torn down and replaced.""Much of the single family housing damaged in the earthquake could be repaired and strengthened for around $3,000,"" Hausler told DW. ""Given these buildings would cost $20,000 to replace, the cost-benefit of strengthening them was compelling."" Through retrofitting — repairing and strengthening unsafe buildings — builders reinforced weak walls, strengthened columns and other support structures and replaced inferior building materials.To be eligible for government assistance, homeowners were required to use earthquake-resilient measures in their reconstruction, said Kamran Akbar, a disaster risk management specialist with the World Bank based in Kathmandu. ""There was no restriction on any construction materials or methods as long as they met the minimum seismic resilience requirement,"" he said.Many of the solutions used in Nepal by Build Change and other organizations relied on confined masonry, which uses evenly spaced horizontal and vertical beams and columns of reinforced concrete to better support homes during earthquakes.In a YouTube video published by Build Change, an engineer in Haiti compares the reinforcements to interlaced fingers which resist external pressure much more efficiently than two closed fists side by side.There's a critical need for disaster-resilient housing, not just in Turkey and Syria but globally. Hausler said up to 40% of the world population will be living in vulnerable housing by 2030. ""It's one of the urgent challenges of our time, affecting almost the same number of people as those that lack access to basic health care,"" she said.Chile, where millions of people live on an extensive system of fault lines, has been able to successfully address that challenge. Near-daily seismic events are a ""constant reminder that we are on shaky ground,"" said Magdalena Gil, a post-disaster reconstruction researcher at the Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management, CIGIDEN. ""Every Chilean who is 30 years old has gone at least through one main [earthquake] event.""""Fortunately, Chile has strict seismic design codes,"" said Gabriel Gonzalez, CIGIDEN's deputy director, crediting these regulations for the fact that only one building collapsed during the last major quake, a magnitude 8.8 tremor, in February 2010. The building, a 15-story residential structure that had just been completed in the central city of Concepcion, was still largely empty. Some 500 people were killed throughout the country as a result of the quake and the ensuing tsunami.Over the years, the construction sector — in Chile and other seismically active regions — has developed techniques designed to reinforce modern high-rises. Gonzalez said there are no height limits for buildings in Chile's seismic design codes. Instead, these high-risk buildings use reinforced concrete columns and beams, supported by steel frames, to develop the flexibility to withstand strong quakes. The concrete beams may break, but the steel reinforcement columns are designed to stay standing and prevent complete collapse.Surprise inspections at construction sites also ensure that design codes are being followed to the letter. These codes, said Gil, have been steadily improved after every major earthquake dating back to the magnitude 9.5 disaster in May 1960, the most powerful seismic event ever recorded.Gonzalez told DW that since the 2010 earthquake, the government's focus has also shifted to improving cooperation between emergency response agencies. He added that risk anticipation and disaster preparedness — emergency drills, education and retrofitting older infrastructure — are playing a greater role to mitigate the impact of future quakes and other natural disasters.With some of the strictest design codes in the world, Chile is seen as a model of earthquake preparedness and response alongside Japan. ""But the building codes are not magic,"" said researcher Gil, pointing out that Turkey, for example, also has building codes that meet modern standards.""You also need to look at the different institutions and processes and actors that enforce the codes,"" she said. ""The code is meaningless without this network. If you don't enforce the codes, then it's just paper.""Experts believe weak enforcement of building codes — in part to help fuel a construction boom and economic growth over the last two decades — was at least partially responsible for the widespread devastation in Turkey after the recent earthquakes.Periodic amnesty policies since the 1960s have allowed Turkish construction companies and individuals to pay a fine to avoid having to bring their buildings up to code. At the time of the latest amnesty in 2018, the Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change Ministry, responsible for enforcing building codes, said more than half of all buildings in Turkey were not in compliance with current standards.For Gonzalez, seeing single buildings still standing amid a vast debris field in the news footage from Turkey was ""a clear picture that some buildings have not followed the regulations.""As Turkey and Syria rebuild, authorities will have to consider what needs to change to keep their homes and towers standing during the next major earthquake or climate-related disaster. One estimate by the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation has put the reconstruction costs at more than $70 billion (€65.2 billion).""It is of absolute necessity that not only new construction be made disaster resilient, but the existing ones are retrofitted to face disaster challenges,"" said Akbar. The latter option is often preferred: it can be less expensive, and quicker to realize.It's also better for the environment: in a global study due out later this year, Build Change found that, on average, retrofitting vulnerable housing could avoid about 60% of the embodied carbon associated with new construction. Making housing more resilient against the impact of earthquakes can also help protect against other hazards, such as hurricanes, windstorms and flooding.Edited by: Tamsin Walker, Sarah Steffen",2023/02/22,,

            EU PREPARES FOR DONORS’ CONFERENCE

            The powerful earthquake in Turkey and Syria will require a huge reconstruction operation at a scale “never seen before,” a top European Union official said.

            European Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement Oliver Varhelyi made the comment Wednesday during a visit to Ankara to prepare for an international donor’s conference, scheduled for March in Brussels. The conference aims to mobilize funds from the international community to support Turkey and Syria following the quake.

            “We are all shocked by the horror the people of Turkey have to go through,” Varhelyi said during a joint news conference with Sweden’s minister for foreign trade and Turkey’s foreign minister. “This is why we are here to help; because we care, because we are friends, because we are allies.”

            The commissioner continued: “My generation for sure has not seen such a devastating earthquake on the planet ... It will take a huge reconstruction operation. Maybe something, again, that we have not seen before.”

            Last week the United Nations launched an appeal for $1 billion to help humanitarian agencies in Turkey assist millions of people affected by the earthquake.

            TURKISH WATCHDOG FINES TV STATIONS

            Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog has fined four television stations that have aired programs critical of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government’s handling of the aftermath of the disaster.

            The move is widely seen as a government attempt to censor negative coverage of the government’s earthquake response ahead of elections scheduled to take place by June 18.

            The Radio and Television Supreme Council, or RTUK, fined Halk TV, Tele 1 and Fox TV and also ordered Halk TV and Tele 1 programs be taken off the air for five days, said Ilhan Tasci, a member of the council from Turkey’s main opposition party.

            Meanwhile, authorities have blocked access to a popular online forum, Eksi Sozluk, where government critics have posted opinions. The website said on Twitter that it was trying to get information on the reason behind the blockage.

            Erdogan’s government came under intense criticism after access to Twitter was restricted for several hours, days after the earthquake hit. Officials said the move was an effort to fight disinformation on Twitter. Many complained, however, that it hampered rescue efforts.

            UN TO HELP WITH DEBRIS MANAGEMENT

            The United Nations development program says it plans to support Turkey in the removal of rubble and the management of the debris from the earthquake’s devastation.

            A UNDP statement says the agency estimates that the disaster has generated between 116 million and 210 million tons of rubble. It estimates an area at least 30 kilometers by 30 kilometers (18.6 miles by 18.6 miles) with debris piled three meters (yards) high would be needed to contain it all.

            Turkish authorities say 118,000 buildings containing 412,000 units have either collapsed or are so damaged that they will need to be demolished.

            UNDP said it aims to draw on its experience in responding to earthquakes in other locations, including Haiti, Nepal and Pakistan, the massive explosion in Beirut as well as rubble caused by the war in Ukraine.

            The IFJ, which represents more than 600,000 media workers across the world, said the Russian union's membership was suspended following an investigation then a vote by its global executive committee on Wednesday. 

            The vote was held after the union refused to reconsider its decision to set up branches in four regions annexed by Russia, the federation said. 











            “The Russian Union of Journalists’ actions in establishing four branches in the annexed Ukrainian territories have clearly shattered ... solidarity and sown divisions among sister unions,"" said IFJ President Dominique Pradalié. 

            The Kremlin in September illegally annexed the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, where it claims its rule is welcomed. Pro-Moscow separatists have controlled part of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk province since 2014.

            The IFJ said it will continue to support independent journalists inside and outside Russia while providing aid to its Ukrainian affiliates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818544,Air Force expands cancer review of nuclear missile personnel,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force's review of cancers among its nuclear missile corps will include all personnel who worked on, guarded, supported or operated the nation’s ground-based warheads, Air Force Global Strike Command announced Wednesday. 

            Nine officers who had worked as missileers — the airmen who launch the warheads from underground silos and control centers — at Montana’s Malmstrom Air Force Base were diagnosed with with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, Lt. Col. Daniel Sebeck of U.S. Space Force reported last month in a briefing obtained by The Associated Press.

            Since that briefing, more missileers and missile support crew have come forward to the AP and other media outlets to report they, too, have been diagnosed with either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of cancers. 











            The Air Force review will extend beyond Malmstrom to include F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota. Together the three bases operate 450 silos that house the nation’s arsenal of ground-based nuclear warheads carried by Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. 

            Malmstrom was one of the sensitive military locations over which a suspected Chinese spy balloon loitered as it transited the United States earlier this month. 

            The “Missile Community Cancer Study,” to be conducted by the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, will look at all ICBM wings and all Air Force personnel who support the ICBM mission. It will review environmental factors at the missile bases and silos, and examine “the possibility of clusters of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma” among missileers and those who maintained, guarded and supported the bases, the head of Air Force Global Strike Command, Gen. Thomas Bussiere, said in a statement.

            The review will look at active-duty medical data and the Department of Veterans Affairs' cancer registry data, mortality data and public cancer registries. Col. Lee Williams, the command's surgeon general, said there was not yet a timeline for the study.

            The Air Force has also established a website to address the missileer community concerns.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Air Force's review of cancers among its nuclear missile corps will include all personnel who worked on, guarded, supported or operated the nation’s ground-based warheads, Air Force Global Strike Command announced Wednesday.Nine officers who had worked as missileers — the airmen who launch the warheads from underground silos and control centers — at Montana’s Malmstrom Air Force Base were diagnosed with with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, Lt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818549,Chair of South Carolina Democrats isn't seeking reelection,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Trav Robertson, the leader of South Carolina's Democrats, said Wednesday that he won't seek another term as party chair as the state prepares to host the party's first 2024 presidential primary in the nation.

            “With the hard work of our leadership — with the teamwork of many — we have made so much progress,"" Robertson told The Associated Press ahead of an official announcement. ""I look forward to building on these relationships and serving South Carolina into the future.”

            Robertson has led the state's Democrats since 2017, when he took over from Jaime Harrison, who's now chair of the Democratic National Committee.











            While the party's national prominence has risen, most recently when the DNC voted to make South Carolina the first voting state on its 2024 presidential primary calendar, South Carolina's Democrats have struggled to notch electoral wins at many levels of office.

            
                Winless in statewide elections since 2006, Democrats hold only one of the state's seven U.S. House seats. The party last won a Senate race in 1998, and Jimmy Carter was the last Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election.

            There have been some successes, however. In 2018, Joe Cunningham became the first Democrat to flip a House seat from red to blue in South Carolina in decades, though he lost his reelection bid two years later.

            On Wednesday, Harrison on Twitter lauded Robertson's stewardship of that 2018 victory and his work to secure South Carolina's No. 1 position on the primary calendar and “a permanent home"" for that party's Columbia headquarters.

            “No one works harder!” Harrison said, of Robertson.

            Some candidates have already jumped into the race to succeed Robertson, who didn't say what he planned to do next. Christale Spain, a longtime Democratic political operative, would be the first Black woman to chair the party if elected. Robertson said he would support Spain’s bid.

            Spain became the executive director of the state Democratic Party in 2016, worked as political director for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign and served as Sen. Cory Booker's state director for his 2020 White House bid. She founded 46 Hope Road, a political action committee aimed at energizing voters who had been inactive since President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, and worked on Black voter engagement for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2022 midterms.

            Also vying for the chairmanship is Brandon Upson, a progressive Democrat who has served as chair of the state party’s Black Caucus. He was an adviser to Tom Steyer’s presidential campaign in South Carolina in 2020. Since then, Upson founded Amplify Action, a national voter registration and mobilization effort. 

            South Carolina Democrats will select their next party chair at their spring convention.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818551,How credit scores are evolving to improve access to credit,"NEW YORK (AP) — A lowcredit score can hurt your ability to take out a loan, secure a good interest rate, or increase the spending limit on your credit card. 

            Some reasons for a low score are out of your control — such as unexpected medical debt or a lack of credit history. 

            Credit rating agencies are now working to improve access to credit by giving people more time to pay medical bills before the debt appears in reports, and by removing other debt completely. They’re also making it easier to count rent, utility payments, and other recurring bills — a boon for those who need credit the most. 











            Here's what to know:

            WHAT IS A CREDIT SCORE AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

            Put simply, a credit score is a formula that lenders use to decide how likely you are to pay back a loan. If you're considered a risky bet, you will pay more to borrow or may not be able to borrow at all.

            The factors that go into calculating your score are complicated, and advocates say it's a positive that ratings agencies have started making it easier for consumers to prove that they'll be able to pay back money they borrow. It's especially important for so-called “thin file” consumers — those with a lack of extensive credit history, who are often younger or lower income.

            “I do see that efforts are being made in order to equalize the credit score,"" said Rosalyn Glenn, a financial advisor at Prudential who focuses on expanding financial access. “For instance, adding rental payments to credit reports, because there is a segment of the population that rents and does not own. That's exciting — because the score can give them an opportunity for better rates on things like insurance and loans. I do believe progress is being made there.""

            WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MEDICAL DEBT?

            After conducting industry research during the pandemic, the three most-used credit rating agencies found that consumers with medical expenses were just as likely to be creditworthy as those without. 

            Effective July of last year, paid medical collection debt is no longer included on consumer credit reports, and the time period before unpaid medical collection debt appears is now a year, up from six months. That gives people more time to work with insurance and healthcare providers to pay off the debt. 

            In the first half of 2023, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion will also remove medical collection debt under $500 from credit reports.

            When Jonnathan Alvarado, 25, was in a car accident this past year, he knew health expenses wouldn't be the only hit to his finances. A landscaping contractor in Plainfield, New Jersey, who prides himself on careful financial behavior, Alvarado faced knee surgery at the beginning of his busiest work season, which hurt his productivity.

            Alvarado said he only realized in retrospect the consequences for his access to credit. Even after insurance, Alvarado still owed in the vicinity of $1,200, which he took several months to pay off. During that time, his credit score dropped to 680, still considered good, but lower than it had been. When he finished paying the debt, it jumped to 775, the highest it had ever been.

            It was only when Alvarado looked into what caused the decline and rebound that he learned the lingering medical debt had been responsible. 

            “A difference of almost a hundred points,” Alvarado said. “I would have paid it off sooner, if I had known.” 

            David Anthony, 43, who drives a service truck in Baltimore, only learned that medical debt was dragging his credit down when an employer pointed out the high interest rate he was paying on an auto loan. After looking into his score, Anthony disputed certain medical bills, some of which had been paid, eventually bringing his score up from the 500s to above 700. 

            “I got a great loan on the cars that I have now,” he said. “That first car — it was a 17 percent interest rate. That’s what raised the red flag to my employer."" 

            Anthony is now down to a single-digit interest loan. 

            HOW ELSE CAN I INCREASE MY CREDIT SCORE?

            Although consumers have long been able to add rent and utility bill payments to their credit files, the bureaus have made these additions easier and less costly in recent years. 

            Experian, for example, has an option for consumers to opt into a service, “Experian Boost,"" that counts these kinds of payments without charging a fee. (In some other cases, companies may charge the renter or landlord for the trouble of filing the additional information in credit reports, since it isn't automatically included as a matter of course.) Those who use the program often see an increase in their scores.

            “You’re making a payment once a month for a service you receive — very much like getting a loan,"" said Rod Griffin, financial health advocate at Experian. ""What we found in our research was that those kinds of pieces of information do indicate that a person may be a better credit risk than their report might show if they have very little credit.”

            For people with thin credit files or scores below 680, Experian sees an average increase in the neighborhood of 19 points, according to Griffin. Others might see their scores increase 12 or 13 points. About two-thirds of people see an improvement in their scores, but the tool helps even those who don't build a longer credit history, Griffin said.

            To use the tool, you give Experian permission to capture your monthly payment history and bank information — whether that's a cellphone plan, water bill, streaming service subscription, or rent. 

            For Brandon Reese, 41, a financial planner in Dallas, Texas, it made sense for him to help his 20-year-old daughter, a nursing student in San Antonia, opt in.

            “When she first opened a line of credit, her score dropped,” he said. “But with this, we were able to get it about 15 percent higher.”

            Reese said he also advises his retired clients to use the programs.

            “For older people, they have low credit scores, too, because they’ve paid everything off,” he said. “So their credit goes down. But now — Verizon, AT&T. Hulu, the Disney bundle, Netflix, your gas bill — fintech companies can justify those as payment histories.”

            Tech companies that provide similar services to Experian Boost, either at low or no cost, have proliferated. 

            “That is now one of the number one things we encourage people to do,” said Silvio Tavares, CEO of VantageScore, another provider of national consumer credit scores. Like FICO, VantageScore uses the credit reports compiled by Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion to calculate a rating of credit-worthiness using its own algorithm. “If you’re engaging in credit-worthy behavior — like paying rent and utilities on time, you want to include that.”

            HOW DO I OPT IN?

            To include alternative credit information on your report, you have several options. One is to opt-in to ExperianBoost or Ultra FICO by going to the companies' websites and granting permission for them to access your checking, savings, or money market accounts. This will allow the credit bureau or scoring company to analyze your spending, saving, and consistent payment histories. While other financial tech platforms provide similar services, these two options do not charge fees.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818555,NBA teams get ready to make 4th-quarter push for playoffs,"Kevin Durant went to Phoenix. Russell Westbrook moved from Los Angeles to Los Angeles. Kevin Love did what once worked out nicely for LeBron James, taking his talents from Cleveland to Miami. And speaking of James, he says he’s about to play some of the biggest games of his career.

            The All-Star break ends Thursday.

            Let the playoff-push fireworks begin.











            “It’s not the start of a new season,” Miami guard Tyler Herro said. “But I think this is when guys really raise their level of play.”

            Boston, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Denver, Cleveland and Memphis probably can go ahead and make playoff plans. Houston, Charlotte, San Antonio and Detroit probably can go ahead and start scheduling April vacations.

            That leaves 20 teams for 10 playoff spots. Sacramento is in position to end the longest drought in NBA history — 16 years and counting — and Cleveland is in line to make the playoffs without someone named LeBron on the roster for the first time since 1998.

            “We have a group that’s dedicated to winning, and there are certain things we have to learn about each other,” Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell said. “It’s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows with us. We’re still a team that’s young, but we also are figuring each other out.”

            The Cavaliers are five games behind Boston, 4 1/2 behind Milwaukee and two behind Philadelphia in the East. The rest of the race might get jumbled; 13th-place Orlando is only four games from a play-in berth.

            “We've given ourselves a chance,"" Magic rookie Paolo Banchero said.

            Out West, it’s a mess.

            “The West is loaded now,” Clippers forward Marcus Morris Sr. said. “I don’t know how that happened.""

            Here’s how: Durant went to Phoenix. Durant’s trade to the Suns could make a team that looked vulnerable anything but vulnerable.

            Denver is five games clear of Memphis for the West lead and eight games up on No. 3 Sacramento.

            But starting with the Kings, there are 11 teams in the standings — Sacramento, the Los Angeles Clippers (who just got Westbrook, after he was bought out by Utah following a trade with the Lakers), Phoenix, Dallas (now with Kyrie Irving alongside Luka Doncic), New Orleans, Minnesota, Golden State, Oklahoma City, Utah, Portland and the Lakers — separated by just six games.

            The seedings could flip every night out West.

            “Must-see TV,"" Morris said.

            And James — who just passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA scoring record — says the 23 games the Lakers have left carry incredible significance.

            He didn’t go to the playoffs last year. He can’t envision missing them again.

            “I don’t want to see myself not being part of the postseason for two years straight. It’s just not part of my DNA,” James said.

            Here's some of what to know for the stretch run:

            7 WITH 30

            There are seven players — Dallas’ Doncic, Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid, Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Portland’s Damian Lillard, Boston’s Jayson Tatum and James — averaging at least 30 points per game.

            If that holds, it’ll be an NBA record.

            There’s been only one season with more than three such players. That was 1961-62, with six — Wilt Chamberlain (50.4), Elgin Baylor (38.3 in 48 games, technically not enough to qualify as a scoring leader), Walt Bellamy (31.6), Bob Pettit (31.1), Oscar Robertson (30.8) and Jerry West (30.8).

            IT’S THE FOURTH QUARTER

            It’s not the second half of the season. It’s really the fourth quarter.

            An NBA regular season has 1,230 games; 884, or 72%, have been played. So if the season was an NBA game clock, 1:30 would remain in the third quarter.

            Teams have somewhere between 21 and 25 games left. Minnesota is down to a league-low eight home games remaining, while Indiana has nine. Washington has a league-high 15 home games left, while Atlanta and Charlotte each have 14.

            THE CHAMPS

            Golden State will emerge from the All-Star break ninth in the Western Conference.

            The defending NBA champion Warriors have some work to do.

            No reigning champion has missed the following season’s playoffs since the Chicago Bulls didn’t get to the postseason in 1999. Before that, it was the Boston Celtics not making the playoffs in 1970.

            Those Bulls lost Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Those Celtics lost Bill Russell and Sam Jones.

            .590 AND IN

            Over the last 20 seasons, there have been 173 teams that reached the All-Star break with a winning percentage of .590 or better.

            And 171 of them made the playoffs, or 98.8%.

            That’s good news for Boston (.712), Milwaukee (.707), Denver (.695), Philadelphia (.667), Cleveland (.623) and Memphis (.614).

            The only teams that hit the break with that good of a winning percentage and missed the playoffs were the 2007-08 Warriors and last season’s Cavaliers.

            The ’07-08 Warriors went 16-14 after the break and missed the playoffs by two games. Last season’s Cavs went 9-15 after the break, then lost two games in the play-in round.

            MILESTONES

            Upcoming milestones of note:

            — Miami coach Erik Spoelstra (692) is five wins from passing Red Holzman (696) for 20th place on the all-time list.

            — Durant (26,684) is 27 points from passing Robertson (26,710) for 13th on the all-time scoring list. Durant is 263 points from passing Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) for 12th.

            — Westbrook (9,002) is 60 assists from passing Isiah Thomas (9,061) for ninth on the all-time list.

            — Paul George of the Clippers is 18 3-pointers from 2,000. He’d be the 14th player to reach that number.

            — Golden State’s home game Sunday against Minnesota will be the 6,000th regular-season contest in Warriors’ history.

            BUSY LA

            Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles will be busy — the Lakers and Clippers both have 13 home games to play in the season’s final 46 days.

            Not one, not two, but three NBA teams play three consecutive games in Los Angeles during March — the Lakers, the Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. They visit the Clippers on March 21 and 23, then visit the Lakers on March 24.

Houston, Charlotte, San Antonio and Detroit probably can go ahead and start scheduling April vacations.That leaves 20 teams for 10 playoff spots. Sacramento is in position to end the longest drought in NBA history — 16 years and counting — and Cleveland is in line to make the playoffs without someone named LeBron on the roster for the first time since 1998.“We have a group that’s dedicated to winning, and there are certain things we have to learn about each other,” Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell said. “It’s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows with us. We’re still a team that’s young, but we also are figuring each other out.”The Cavaliers are five games behind Boston, 4 1/2 behind Milwaukee and two behind Philadelphia in the East. The rest of the race might get jumbled; 13th-place Orlando is only four games from a play-in berth.“We've given ourselves a chance,"" Magic rookie Paolo Banchero said.Out West, it’s a mess.“The West is loaded now,” Clippers forward Marcus Morris Sr. said. “I don’t know how that happened.""Here’s how: Durant went to Phoenix. Durant’s trade to the Suns could make a team that looked vulnerable anything but vulnerable.Denver is five games clear of Memphis for the West lead and eight games up on No. 3 Sacramento.But starting with the Kings, there are 11 teams in the standings — Sacramento, the Los Angeles Clippers (who just got Westbrook, after he was bought out by Utah following a trade with the Lakers), Phoenix, Dallas (now with Kyrie Irving alongside Luka Doncic), New Orleans, Minnesota, Golden State, Oklahoma City, Utah, Portland and the Lakers — separated by just six games.The seedings could flip every night out West.“Must-see TV,"" Morris said.And James — who just passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA scoring record — says the 23 games the Lakers have left carry incredible significance.He didn’t go to the playoffs last year. He can’t envision missing them again.“I don’t want to see myself not being part of the postseason for two years straight. It’s just not part of my DNA,” James said.Here's some of what to know for the stretch run:7 WITH 30There are seven players — Dallas’ Doncic, Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid, Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Portland’s Damian Lillard, Boston’s Jayson Tatum and James — averaging at least 30 points per game.If that holds, it’ll be an NBA record.There’s been only one season with more than three such players. That was 1961-62, with six — Wilt Chamberlain (50.4), Elgin Baylor (38.3 in 48 games, technically not enough to qualify as a scoring leader), Walt Bellamy (31.6), Bob Pettit (31.1), Oscar Robertson (30.8) and Jerry West (30.8).IT’S THE FOURTH QUARTERIt’s not the second half of the season. It’s really the fourth quarter.An NBA regular season has 1,230 games; 884, or 72%, have been played. So if the season was an NBA game clock, 1:30 would remain in the third quarter.Teams have somewhere between 21 and 25 games left. Minnesota is down to a league-low eight home games remaining, while Indiana has nine. Washington has a league-high 15 home games left, while Atlanta and Charlotte each have 14.THE CHAMPSGolden State will emerge from the All-Star break ninth in the Western Conference.The defending NBA champion Warriors have some work to do.No reigning champion has missed the following season’s playoffs since the Chicago Bulls didn’t get to the postseason in 1999. Before that, it was the Boston Celtics not making the playoffs in 1970.Those Bulls lost Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Those Celtics lost Bill Russell and Sam Jones..590 AND INOver the last 20 seasons, there have been 173 teams that reached the All-Star break with a winning percentage of .590 or better.And 171 of them made the playoffs, or 98.8%.That’s good news for Boston (.712), Milwaukee (.707), Denver (.695), Philadelphia (.667), Cleveland (.623) and Memphis (.614).The only teams that hit the break with that good of a winning percentage and missed the playoffs were the 2007-08 Warriors and last season’s Cavaliers.The ’07-08 Warriors went 16-14 after the break and missed the playoffs by two games. Last season’s Cavs went 9-15 after the break, then lost two games in the play-in round.MILESTONESUpcoming milestones of note:— Miami coach Erik Spoelstra (692) is five wins from passing Red Holzman (696) for 20th place on the all-time list.— Durant (26,684) is 27 points from passing Robertson (26,710) for 13th on the all-time scoring list. Durant is 263 points from passing Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) for 12th.— Westbrook (9,002) is 60 assists from passing Isiah Thomas (9,061) for ninth on the all-time list.— Paul George of the Clippers is 18 3-pointers from 2,000. He’d be the 14th player to reach that number.— Golden State’s home game Sunday against Minnesota will be the 6,000th regular-season contest in Warriors’ history.BUSY LACrypto.com Arena in Los Angeles will be busy — the Lakers and Clippers both have 13 home games to play in the season’s final 46 days.Not one, not two, but three NBA teams play three consecutive games in Los Angeles during March — the Lakers, the Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. They visit the Clippers on March 21 and 23, then visit the Lakers on March 24.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818557,EU carbon price passes symbolic 100 euros as reforms bite,"BERLIN (AP) — The price of releasing planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere rose above 100 euros (about $107) in the European Union for the first time this week, a signal that experts said Wednesday speaks for the bloc's efforts to make polluting costlier.

            The EU has laid down a path to become carbon neutral by 2050, meaning it would only emit as much carbon dioxide as can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means. In 2005 it established an emissions trading system, or ETS, where major emitters have to buy allowances for every ton of CO2 they release.

            The price, calculated per ton of carbon dioxide or equivalent greenhouse gas emissions, had long remained under 25 euros before rising sharply about two years ago. It had hovered around 90 euros for the past year until Tuesday, when it passed the 100-euro mark for the first time.











            “No one thought it would be likely or feasible that the price would go up to such a level in such a short time,” said Michael Pahle, who heads the energy policy group at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.

            “Politicians and policy makers put a lot of effort into bringing it up to that level,” he said Wednesday, referring to a deal agreed by EU governments and lawmakers in December that will reduce the number of carbon allowances on the market faster than previously planned, phasing them out completely by 2038.

            The bloc's executive Commission wants European industries to reduce their emissions 62% by 2030 from 2005 levels, compared to a target of 43% under the previous rules. Those efforts received a boost from Europe's push to massively expand renewable power production at home following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

            While the utility companies and heavy industries that currently have to buy carbon allowances will likely pass some of the cost on to consumers, this will mainly be felt in countries such as Poland, where electricity production relies heavily on coal, Pahle said.

            In the medium term the price is expected to rise even further, to between 125 and 160 euros per ton by 2030, he said, not accounting for inflation.

            Juliette de Grandpré, an expert at the Berlin-based think tank NewClimate, said the recent increase showed that — barring a sudden economic downturn — the price of emitting greenhouse gases in Europe will only go up.

            “It’s going to increase further, just because we know that in 2038 there won't be any more allowances in the system,” she said. ""That's only 15 years from now.”BERLIN (AP) — The price of releasing planet-heating carbon into the atmosphere rose above 100 euros (about $107) in the European Union for the first time this week, a signal that experts said Wednesday speaks for the bloc's efforts to make polluting costlier.The EU has laid down a path to become carbon neutral by 2050, meaning it would only emit as much carbon dioxide as can be absorbed again through natural or artificial means.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818558,Journalist deflates accusation at Vatican financial trial,"ROME (AP) — An Italian journalist on Wednesday deflated an accusation in the Vatican’s sprawling financial trial, as he disputed prosecutors’ claims about the source of a document concerning the Vatican’s 350 million euro investment in a London property.

            Investigative journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi was called to testify by defense lawyers representing Tommaso Di Ruzza, the former head of the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency. Vatican prosecutors accused Di Ruzza of having given Fittipaldi a copy of a contract related to the London deal, in violation of Vatican confidentiality laws.

            Fittipaldi, then a reporter at L’Espresso magazine and now with the Domani daily, had published a screenshot of the contract on Oct. 1, 2019, just as the Vatican investigation into the London deal was heating up.











            Prosecutors ultimately charged 10 people, alleging that Vatican officials, Italian brokers and others fleeced the Holy See of tens of millions of euros and then extorted the Vatican of 15 million euros to hand over control of the London property. All 10 have denied wrongdoing.

            Fittipaldi told the court on Wednesday that Di Ruzza didn’t give him the contract and had nothing to do with the article.

            “I exclude it,” Fittipaldi said. While recalling that journalists don’t reveal their sources, Fittipaldi told the court he had asked the person who did show him the contract if he could reveal his identity and said the source agreed.

            Fittipaldi identified him as Marcello Massinelli and provided text messages to the court indicating their correspondence. He said Massinelli was a colleague of another defendant, Raffaele Mincione, who had managed the London property for the Vatican until late 2018.

            The Vatican ultimately decided to buy Mincione out of the deal and hand management over to another London-based Italian broker, Gianluigi Torzi. That transfer is at the heart of the Vatican trial, with prosecutors alleging Torzi defrauded the Vatican and then extorted it to get control of the building.

            Fittipaldi said Massinelli had let him view the contract to show that, as far as Mincione was concerned, it outlined a legitimate, legal transaction.

            In their indictment, Vatican prosecutors substantiated the charge against Di Ruzza by noting that Fittipaldi’s screenshot of the contract bore an “X” mark on one side, as did a copy found in the offices of Di Ruzza’s Financial Information Authority.

            Fittipaldi is no stranger to the Vatican tribunal. He was put on trial by Vatican prosecutors in 2015, accused of publishing leaked Vatican documents. After an eight-month trial, the court ruled that it had no jurisdiction to prosecute him or another Italian journalist who was also put on trial in the so-called “Vatileaks 2” case.

            The current financial trial, which opened in July 2021, is expected to wrap up before the end of the year.ROME (AP) — An Italian journalist on Wednesday deflated an accusation in the Vatican’s sprawling financial trial, as he disputed prosecutors’ claims about the source of a document concerning the Vatican’s 350 million euro investment in a London property.Investigative journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi was called to testify by defense lawyers representing Tommaso Di Ruzza, the former head of the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818575,Mexican president hopes ex security chief will turn informer,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Wednesday he hopes that the former Mexican security chief convicted this week in the U.S. of bribe-taking will cooperate with prosecutors there and perhaps implicate former Mexican presidents.

            President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he hopes Genaro Garcia Luna will make a deal with prosecutors to reduce his sentence, in exchange for testifying about López Obrador’s predecessors.

            The former top Mexican security official was convicted Tuesday of taking massive bribes to protect the violent drug cartels he was tasked with combating. Garcia Luna served in different security posts under former presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon between 2000 and 2012. Both are political enemies of López Obrador.











            “I would say, as president of Mexico, for the good of the country, that hopefully he will do it,” López Obrador said, referring to a possible sentencing deal, “in exchange for informing about whether he received orders or gave information to the former presidents Fox and Calderon.”

             López Obrador said he hoped Garcia Luna would also provide information about his relationship with U.S. authorities, who he said must have known about his corruption.

            “He even got prizes from U.S. authorities, it is not possible they didn't know,” he said.

            López Obrador welcomed the U.S. verdict on Garcia Luna, and depicted it as opportunity to root out corruption. 

            But López Obrador fought tooth and nail to avoid a U.S. trial of former defense secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos on similar charges in 2020, at one point threatening to kick DEA agents out of Mexico unless the general was returned, which he was. Cienfuegos was quickly freed once he returned.

            And López Obrador railed against Mexican judges who ruled Tuesday against Mexican government efforts to freeze the accounts of Garcia Luna's wife, Linda Pereyra Gálvez. The government blocked her accounts in 2019, when her husband was arrested in Texas.

            However, judges later ruled the freezing of the accounts violated her rights.

            “As we have been saying, the judicial branch in our country needs a profound reform,” López Obrador said.

            The Mexican president has frequently sparred with the judiciary, because judges have often blocked his initiatives on constitutional grounds.

            García Luna, 54, was convicted on charges that include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. He faces at least 20 years and as much as life in prison at his sentencing, set for June 27.

            García Luna, who denied the allegations, headed Mexico’s federal police and was later the country’s top public safety official from 2006 to 2012 in Calderon's administration. His lawyers said the charges were based on lies from criminals who wanted to punish his drug-fighting efforts and to get sentencing breaks for themselves by helping prosecutors.

            On Tuesday, Calderon said Garcia Luna's conviction did not diminish his administration's policy of fighting drug cartels.

            “I never negotiated or agreed with criminals,” Calderon wrote in a statement.

            Rubén Salazar, director of the Mexican political analysis firm Etellekt Consultores, said García Luna’s conviction has rocked Mexico’s political world by underlining the possibility that the U.S. justice system could open cases against high-profile Mexican politicians. 

            “The entire political class is trembling right now,” Salazar said. “It is not a trial against García Luna, but against Mexican narco-politics.”MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Wednesday he hopes that the former Mexican security chief convicted this week in the U.S. of bribe-taking will cooperate with prosecutors there and perhaps implicate former Mexican presidents.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said he hopes Genaro Garcia Luna will make a deal with prosecutors to reduce his sentence, in exchange for testifying about López Obrador’s predecessors.The former top Mexican security official was convicted Tuesday of taking massive bribes to protect the violent drug cartels he was tasked with combating.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818576,Supreme Court rules for Arizona inmate in death penalty case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday for a man on Arizona's death row who wants a new sentencing hearing because jurors in his case were wrongly told that the only way to ensure he would never walk free was to sentence him to death.

            The 5-4 decision written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor likely means that John Montenegro Cruz will get a new penalty phase of his trial where it is made clear to jurors that he is ineligible for parole if he is sentenced to life in prison, instead of death. 

            “I am so gratified by the Court’s decision today. What Arizona has been doing in implementing the death penalty is patently unconstitutional and wrong, and I’m glad to see the Court call them out,” Cruz's lawyer Neal Katyal said in a statement.











            The case is important not only for Cruz, but also for other Arizona death row inmates. Arizona currently has approximately 100 people on its death row and the decision could affect about 30 of them with pending cases.

            Cruz had argued that the jury should have been informed he would be ineligible for parole if spared from death and given a life sentence. A judge rejected that request and the state said Cruz failed to make the precise requests he needed to under Supreme Court precedent.

            At least one juror has said that had she known that a “life sentence without parole” was an alternative to death, she “would have voted for that option.”

            Cruz was convicted of the 2003 murder of a Tucson police officer, Patrick Hardesty. Hardesty and another officer were investigating a hit-and-run accident that led them to Cruz, who attempted to flee and shot Hardesty five times.

            A 1994 Supreme Court case, Simmons v. South Carolina, says that in certain death penalty cases, jurors must be told that choosing a life sentence means life without the possibility of parole. That’s required when prosecutors argue that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future.

            Arizona courts refused to apply the decision. In a 2016 case, Lynch v. Arizona, the Supreme Court told Arizona directly that it needed to comply with Simmons. Cruz argued Arizona has continued to defy the high court.

            The case is Cruz v. Arizona, 21-846.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday for a man on Arizona's death row who wants a new sentencing hearing because jurors in his case were wrongly told that the only way to ensure he would never walk free was to sentence him to death.The 5-4 decision written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor likely means that John Montenegro Cruz will get a new penalty phase of his trial where it is made clear to jurors that he is ineligible for parole if he is sentenced to life in prison, instead of death.“I am so gratified by the Court’s decision today. What Arizona has been doing in implementing the death penalty is patently unconstitutional and wrong, and I’m glad to see the Court call them out,” Cruz's lawyer Neal Katyal said in a statement.The case is important not only for Cruz, but also for other Arizona death row inmates. Arizona currently has approximately 100 people on its death row and the decision could affect about 30 of them with pending cases.Cruz had argued that the jury should have been informed he would be ineligible for parole if spared from death and given a life sentence. A judge rejected that request and the state said Cruz failed to make the precise requests he needed to under Supreme Court precedent.At least one juror has said that had she known that a “life sentence without parole” was an alternative to death, she “would have voted for that option.”Cruz was convicted of the 2003 murder of a Tucson police officer, Patrick Hardesty. Hardesty and another officer were investigating a hit-and-run accident that led them to Cruz, who attempted to flee and shot Hardesty five times.A 1994 Supreme Court case, Simmons v. South Carolina, says that in certain death penalty cases, jurors must be told that choosing a life sentence means life without the possibility of parole. That’s required when prosecutors argue that the defendant will pose a threat to society in the future.Arizona courts refused to apply the decision. In a 2016 case, Lynch v. Arizona, the Supreme Court told Arizona directly that it needed to comply with Simmons. Cruz argued Arizona has continued to defy the high court.The case is Cruz v.

            The pan-continental pop competition will take place in May in the English city of Liverpool after Britain was asked to stage the event on behalf of designated host country Ukraine.

            Thirty-seven countries will compete for Europe’s pop crown, with semifinals held May 9 and 11 before a final on May 13. All three programs will be hosted by Waddingham, Sanin and Dixon, a TV presenter and former member of girl group Mis-Teeq.











            Sanina, who fronts Ukrainian alternative rock band The Hardkiss, said she was “excited to showcase Ukrainian culture and creativity, and to help put on a show to make my country proud.”

            Waddingham, an Emmy Award winner for her role as owner of a struggling soccer team owner in hit Apple TV+ comedy “Ted Lasso,” said it was “a great honor to be standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, a country which has carried itself with such strength and unity.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818578,Amazon closes $3.9B buyout of health company One Medical,"NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon said Wednesday it has closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary care organization One Medical. 

            The e-commerce giant has said the buyout, which was announced in July, is a key component of its growing health care business, which includes its online drugstore Amazon Pharmacy and a patient to doctor messaging service called Amazon Clinic. 

            One Medical, which was owned by San Francisco-based 1Life Healthcare Inc, has about 815,000 members and 214 medical offices in more than 20 markets. Its membership-based service offers virtual care as well as in-person visits. 











            The two companies said Wednesday that for the first year, membership will be available to new U.S. customers for $144, a 28% discount intended to lure new customers.

            Anti-monopoly groups have been calling on the Federal Trade Commission to block Amazon's purchase of the company, arguing it would endanger patient privacy and give the online retailer more dominance in the marketplace. 

            Last September, both One Medical and Amazon received a request for additional information from the FTC in connection with a review of the merger. FTC spokesperson Peter Kaplan said the agency won't bring forth a lawsuit to block the merger. But it's not ruling out any challenges in the future. 

            “The FTC’s investigation of Amazon’s acquisition of One Medical continues,"" Kaplan said in a statement. ""The commission will continue to look at possible harms to competition created by this merger as well as possible harms to consumers that may result from Amazon’s control and use of sensitive consumer health information held by One Medical.”

            The One Medical purchase is the first acquisition made under Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who took over from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021 and sees health care as a growth opportunity for the company. 

            “Customers want and deserve better, and that’s what One Medical has been working and innovating on for more than a decade. Together, we believe we can make the health care experience easier, faster, more personal, and more convenient for everyone,"" Jassy said in a statement. 

            The FTC is also reviewing Amazon’s $1.65 billion planned purchase of iRobot, which was announced last August.NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon said Wednesday it has closed its $3.9 billion acquisition of the primary care organization One Medical.The e-commerce giant has said the buyout, which was announced in July, is a key component of its growing health care business, which includes its online drugstore Amazon Pharmacy and a patient to doctor messaging service called Amazon Clinic.One Medical, which was owned by San Francisco-based 1Life Healthcare Inc, has about 815,000 members and 214 medical offices in more than 20 markets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818580,"Eugene Levy, very gingerly, explores world for travel show","NEW YORK (AP) — There are celebrities with TV travel shows who just can't wait to show you where they came from or push the limits of their bodies or go out of their way to locate a perfect recipe. Then there's Eugene Levy.

            The “Schitt’s Creek” star admits he's not really a fan of the cold or the heat. He doesn't really like eating strange things and, well, insects freak him out. He'd rather stay home, to be honest. 

            “Not only do I not love traveling, I’ve got a very low sense of curiosity,” he says during an interview. “I do not have an adventurous spirit. And I’m actually thinking, well, aren’t those things you need to host a travel show?”











            Not necessarily, and so welcome, to Apple TV+'s “The Reluctant Traveler With Eugene Levy,” the unlikely wedding of a droll and cautious host with some of the most beautiful places on Earth. 

            During the eight-episode series, Levy swims in a frozen lake in Finland, walks around slot canyons in Utah and explores a rainforest in Costa Rica. He also visits Italy, Japan, the Maldives, Portugal and South Africa, even going on safari and enjoying a gin and tonic as he does.

            The more uncomfortable he seems, the funnier the show becomes. “I’m the more Great Indoors type of guy,” he jokes to his guide in a forest in Costa Rica brimming with thousands of species of animals, what he calls “all those tiny threats to life.” While ice fishing in Finland, he notes drily: “Hearty and resilient are two words that have never been used to describe me.” 

            “I’m hoping this appeals to seasoned travelers that might watch this and chuckle,"" he says later in the interview. ""But also to people who, like me, don’t travel extensively, are not fond of traveling, don’t have that sense of adventure, so to speak — that they will see me as a kindred spirit.”

            “The Reluctant Traveler” was initially a show pitched as a way to feature hotels with remarkable views that morphed into one which really shines when Levy leaves them to go into the culture he’s visiting and is changed.

            In Utah, he stays in an elegant property overlooking the Colorado Plateau where rooms go for more than $3,000 a night but finds a real sense of spirituality visiting his Navajo guide’s modest homestead.

            “The memorable thing for me, by and large, are the people that I’m running into,” Levy says. “I’m hoping that this is one of those shows with a nice kind of different personality.”

            In Finland, Levy rides a snowmobile, goes ice fishing and ice swimming, eats reindeer and attempts husky sledding — “How do you say slow down in dog?” he asks — and ice swimming. He finds Finns deserve their reputation as some of the happiest people on Earth. “I’ve never met people that were any happier and don’t know whether being big vodka drinkers has anything to do with it,” he jokes.

            Levy landed the job by trying to talk himself out of it. Executive producer David Brindley recalls he and Apple executive Alison Kirkham were on a phone call trying to lure Levy into hosting a travel show and listening to him explain how he was the wrong man for the job. They were in stitches.

            “We all have fears about certain things and we all have things that scare us and we sort of wish that we could do something about them, but we never do. And Eugene has just given himself over to this process,"" said Brindley. ""And, as a result, maybe he doesn’t enjoy absolutely everything that he puts in his mouth or every activity that goes on, but it’s had a positive influence and he’s come away a bit of a different person.""

            The 76-year-old actor with bushy eyebrows and round glasses joins a crowded field of celeb travel hosts, which includes Zac Efron, José Andrés, Chris Hemsworth, Will Smith, Stanley Tucci, Macaulay Culkin and Ewan McGregor. 

            “There’s a lot of travel shows around the world and rightly so. They’re gorgeous and they’re escapist and they’re beautiful,” said Brindley, chief creative officer at production house Twofour. “But launching a new one, you want to find something that has a unique selling point, that has the chance to do something a tiny bit different that will just grab people’s attention and also that feels relatable.”

            So in South Africa, viewers will get a kick out of watching Levy nervously reacting to wild animal noises, seeing his first warthog — “That is not a pleasant-looking thing!” — and playing golf among hippos. He collects a fecal sample from a tranquilized elephant and charmingly bottle feeds a baby rhino. “That was a very, very cute experience,” he says.

            To keep Levy fresh, he and his team would visit two locations at a time — spending one week in each — and then break for a few months before reuniting for another set of visits. 

            Levy consulted over the list of possible locations for the first season and says he got more adventurous each time. “As the series went on, I was kind of rolling with the punches,” he says. “We’ll see how the viewers take to it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818581,Rales Foundation bets big on Carnegie Mellon STEM students,"Carnegie Mellon University and the Norman and Ruth Rales Foundation, named for a home-building supplies entrepreneur and his wife who built their fortune despite early struggles, hope a $150 million initiative will support a new generation of students trying to achieve that American dream.

            The foundation pledged $116 million Wednesday, in addition to $34 million from CMU, to endow scholarships for graduate students studying STEM from groups underrepresented in the fields, including racial minorities, women and first-generation college students. 

            Besides covering the cost of tuition, the scholarships include a stipend — even for Master’s students — dedicated faculty and other mentoring and career support for 86 students starting in 2024 at the Pittsburgh-based university. 











            “Both my parents believed deeply in creating more opportunity and social mobility for others, just as they had in their lives and paying it forward, paying for their success,” said Josh Rales, president and trustee of the foundation, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

            The gift represents more than half of the foundation's assets which were listed at $221 million in 2020 tax data. It has funded education and scholarships previously, with annual grant disbursements between $6-8 million in recent years, but had not made a gift to CMU before now. 

            Josh Rales and his brothers, Mitchell and Steven, who founded the life sciences conglomerate Danaher Corp., first started talking with CMU president Farnam Jahanian in the spring of 2021. In 2010, Danaher acquired a company Jahanian co-founded, but they were reintroduced by a CMU trustee, Jahanian said. 

            “We felt strongly, not only this is an important issue that the country needs to tackle because of its implication for our economic prosperity, for our global competitiveness, as well as our national security,” Jahanian said. “But it’s also very much aligned with the mission of the university to educate the next generation and provide access and opportunity for everyone.”

            The foundation's interest in funding the program came in part from Mitchell and Steven's experience hiring for their company and seeing a need for more diverse voices in STEM fields, Josh Rales said. U.S. citizens and permanent residents, but not international students, will be eligible for the program, and the university will work with the Ron Brown Scholar Program, which grants scholarships to African American students, to identify candidates, among other recruitment efforts. 

            Student debt from undergraduate degrees, as well as delayed entrance into the workforce, are major reasons racial minorities and first-generation college students do not pursue graduate studies in STEM, Jahanian said. That helped lead him to support providing stipends to all students in the program. 

            ""If we didn’t make them available to also Master’s students, we would miss the opportunity to really move the needle in this case,"" he said. 

            Beyond the financial barriers, Black and Native American students specifically, may also be stereotyped and underestimated by professors and institutions, said Ebony McGee, a professor of education at Vanderbilt University, who wrote “Black, Brown, Bruised: How Racialized STEM Education Stifles Innovation.” 

            Programs that broadly recruit from all underrepresented groups — not specifically Black students, who along with Latinos are underrepresented among higher degrees in STEM — won't reach the most marginalized populations, McGee said. She also urged universities recruiting Black students to STEM to provide professors with training on how to mentor them, because many advise students that if they work hard enough, people won't notice their race or gender. 

            “Just take as many STEM everything, do all the internships, make sure you have the right grades and your race or your gender doesn’t matter,” said McGee, adding that it's a disservice to those students. “You can’t just pretend that race or gender or the intersection of it is not there. That’s the first thing people see when they look at you and they stereotype you because of that.” 

            Josh Rales, who has worked full time with the foundation since 2014, said it was humbling to try to make an impact in this field because the scale of need was so large but that as a result, they had decided to make fewer, bigger bets.

            Every day when he walks into the foundation's offices, he said, he sees a photo of his parents hanging on the wall, which he sees as a reminder that, “We better do a very good job because their name is on the line.”

It has funded education and scholarships previously, with annual grant disbursements between $6-8 million in recent years, but had not made a gift to CMU before now.Josh Rales and his brothers, Mitchell and Steven, who founded the life sciences conglomerate Danaher Corp., first started talking with CMU president Farnam Jahanian in the spring of 2021. In 2010, Danaher acquired a company Jahanian co-founded, but they were reintroduced by a CMU trustee, Jahanian said.“We felt strongly, not only this is an important issue that the country needs to tackle because of its implication for our economic prosperity, for our global competitiveness, as well as our national security,” Jahanian said. “But it’s also very much aligned with the mission of the university to educate the next generation and provide access and opportunity for everyone.”The foundation's interest in funding the program came in part from Mitchell and Steven's experience hiring for their company and seeing a need for more diverse voices in STEM fields, Josh Rales said. U.S. citizens and permanent residents, but not international students, will be eligible for the program, and the university will work with the Ron Brown Scholar Program, which grants scholarships to African American students, to identify candidates, among other recruitment efforts.Student debt from undergraduate degrees, as well as delayed entrance into the workforce, are major reasons racial minorities and first-generation college students do not pursue graduate studies in STEM, Jahanian said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818584,New estimate U.S. could face default on debt by early June,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. could face an unprecedented default on its obligations as soon as early June if Congress does not act to lift the debt limit, a Washington think tank said Wednesday.

            The Bipartisan Policy Center, which forecasts the approximate “X-date” when the government will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations on time, said the U.S. will reach its statutory debt limit as soon as the summer or early fall of 2023. That inches up from the center's previous prediction in June 2022 that the “extraordinary measures” that U.S. Treasury uses to pay the government's bills would not be exhausted before the third quarter of 2023. 

            Previewing the data for reporters on a morning call, Shai Akabas, the center's director of economic policy, said the new projections reflect “considerable uncertainty in our nation’s current economic outlook.” 











            “Policymakers have an opportunity now to inject certainty into the U.S. and global economy by beginning, in earnest, bipartisan negotiations around our nation’s fiscal health and taking action to uphold the full faith and credit of the United States well before the X-Date,"" he said. 

            Akabas said the December 2022 big spending bill, an extended pause on student loan repayments and high interest rates resulting in higher costs to service U.S. debt have contributed to moving up the X-date. 

            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen notified Congress in January that her agency was resorting to “extraordinary measures” to avoid default, and that “it is unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June.""

            Yellen said her actions will buy time until Congress can pass legislation that will either raise the nation’s $31.4 trillion borrowing authority or suspend the limit for a period of time. But she said it’s “critical that Congress act in a timely manner.”

            President Joe Biden and new Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy met once earlier this month to talk about the debt limit, but expectations are low for quick progress as GOP lawmakers push for steep spending cuts in exchange for a debt ceiling deal.

            Biden has since used his bully pulpit to accuse Republicans of plans to cut Medicare and Social Security programs. McCarthy, however, has said those cuts are not in the picture, as has Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. 

            Treasury first used extraordinary measures in 1985 and has used them at least 16 times since, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog.

            Some economists have said in the midst of debt limit negotiations, Treasury could prioritize certain payments to bondholders in order to buy time for policymakers to resolve the issue. 

            Biden administration officials have said they will not prioritize payments to bondholders if the country passes the “X-date” without an agreement. Yellen has said debt payment prioritization is default by another name. 

            “Failure on the part of the United States to meet any obligation, whether its debt holders, to members of our military or to Social Security recipients, is effectively a default,"" she told reporters in Dakar, Senegal in January.WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. could face an unprecedented default on its obligations as soon as early June if Congress does not act to lift the debt limit, a Washington think tank said Wednesday.The Bipartisan Policy Center, which forecasts the approximate “X-date” when the government will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations on time, said the U.S. will reach its statutory debt limit as soon as the summer or early fall of 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818588,"MLS says San Diego, Las Vegas top candidates for 30th team","NEW YORK (AP) — With opening day approaching Saturday, Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber expressed hope to pick a 30th team by the end of the year and defended an expanded playoff format in which 18 of 29 clubs make the postseason.

            Speaking Wednesday during a kickoff event at the league’s new television studio built together with Apple TV, Garber said he felt relieved MLS avoided the difficulties faced by other sports preparing for the possible bankruptcy of Sinclair Sports Group's Bally Sports regional sports networks.

            MLS has nearly tripled in size from 2004, when it was a 10-team league. St. Louis, the 29th team, starts play Saturday at Austin.











            “We do need more teams. The 30th team will come at some point soon. Hopefully, we'd like to get that announced by the end of the year,"" Garber said. “We say we're going to stop at 30 but the other major leagues are larger than that. I never say never in Major League Soccer. There are many other markets that are opportunities for us. I think San Diego and Las Vegas are the most likely opportunities for 30.”

            He mentioned Detroit; Phoenix; Sacramento, California; and Tampa, Florida, as other expansion possibilities.

            Garber defended the playoff format, announced a day earlier, in which 62% of teams reach the postseason. In other U.S. sports, 14 of 32 teams make the playoffs in the NFL, 12 of 30 in Major League Baseball, 16 of 30 in the NBA and 16 of 32 in the NHL. 

            MLS used a mixture of two-leg and single-elimination rounds from 2003-18, then went to a knockout competition the last four years. The league is switching to single-game wild-card matchups and a best-of-three round — last used in 2002. The playoffs revert to a knockout competition for the final eight.

            There will be a maximum of 33 games, up from 13 last year.

            “We have been working on trying to find the right format for a really long time. We are playing here in North America and know the importance of playoffs to drive energy in the latter part of the season,” Garber said. “We wanted more games. ... If this works, we'll have it forever. If it doesn’t work, we’ll continue to evolve it.""

            Garber hopes MLS season ticket holders will have preferred access for tickets for the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host with Mexico and Canada. No decisions on ticketing have been made.

            “It would seem that if you’re a supporter of the game by buying season tickets, whether that’s for Major League Soccer or it's the NWSL or the various other minor leagues, you ought to be able to have a direct or more direct access to tickets for any tournament, whether that's U.S. Soccer matches or that's Copa América-type tournaments or if it's the World Cup,” he said.

            Garber spoke at a 6,000-square foot television studio in the Spanish Harlem area of Manhattan that will host coverage of telecasts by Apple TV, a 10-year deal announced last June. All MLS games will be streamed by Apple starting this weekend.

            “It would be unfair to say we were prescient and anticipated a dramatic change in what’s happening with at least one company, but we knew that the market was moving from local to more of a direct-to-consumer offering,” Garber said. “There was such a lack of consistency on the quality of our broadcasts because of the changing dynamic that was happening in the local level. And that was happening for five years. So I’m glad that we’re in the position we’re in.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818593,British-born former 'IS' bride loses citizenship appeal,"A British-born woman who traveled to Syria in 2015 to join the so-called ""Islamic State"" (IS) terror group, and then had her British nationality stripped, on Wednesday lost an appeal to have her citizenship reinstated, on the grounds of national security.The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that there was a ""credible suspicion"" that Begum was trafficked to Syria for the purposes of ""sexual exploitation"" but that the suspicion was insufficient for her appeal to succeed.The tribunal said there also were ""arguable breaches of duty'' on the part of state bodies in allowing her to travel to Syria.However, Judge Robert Jay said that since she remains in Syria, UK authorities were not obliged to facilitate her return.A UK Home Office spokesman welcomed the ruling and said, ""The government's priority remains maintaining the safety and security of the UK and we will robustly defend any decision made in doing so.""Begum's lawyers indicated that they would challenge the court's decision.In November, her legal team argued that Britain's Home Office failed to investigate whether she was a ""child victim of trafficking.""In 2015, Begum — who is now 23 years old — traveled to Syria when she was 15, along with two other girls from London, to marry IS fighters.Thousands of fighters from all over the world, swelled the terror group's ranks, with many renouncing their nationalities and opting to remain in the self-styled caliphate the terror group established in the territory it controlled at the time.However, when IS was defeated in 2019, and thousands of its fighters and families were captured, the challenge of what to do with them emerged. Many, like Begum, remain in camps in northern Syria.In the same year, then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid, decided to revoke her citizenship after she was found in the Al Hol detention camp in Syria. Begum had given birth to three children, all of whom died.Begum and others in her position, have been the source of debate as to what to do with people of various nationalities who joined the terror group when it was capturing vast swathes of territory in northern Syria and Iraq.kb/sms (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/02/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818594,What can fighter jets do and why does Ukraine want them?,"During sharp turns, you are flattened into the seat by many times the force of gravity. You only maintain consciousness if you are in peak physical condition and wear special pants that squeeze the blood out of your legs. You rarely fly below 900 kilometers per hour (roughly 560 miles per hour).""The acceleration is breathtaking."" That's how former German Air Force pilot Joachim Vergin describes the feeling of flying a fighter jet.One might compare it to riding a roller coaster, but not really: The power in a jet is often twice as strong. And during combat, you have to operate a large number of weapon systems simultaneously: Fighting, evading, defending. In an extreme situation, such as an air raid, everything is a matter of life and death, often at the speed of sound.There is currently a debate about whether to give in to Ukraine's demand for fighter jets, such as the F-16 or the MiG-29. The first time fighter jets were used was at the end of the last major war in Europe: World War II. With their turbojet engine, jets fly much faster than propeller-driven aircraft, which had been used up to that point.Jet engines suck air into the front of the motor, where it is compressed. Fuel is sprayed into the highly compressed air and ignited. This forces the air out of the engine ""very powerfully,"" as Dr. Robert Kluge, an aviation expert at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, explains.This air then pushes against any obstacle, be it the runway or the surrounding air, and thereby accelerates the aircraft.Fighter jets can attack targets in the air as well as on the ground. For aerial combat, a jet can be equipped with air-to-air missiles that can be fired in flight to destroy a target that is also flying.To strike targets on the ground, a jet can use air-to-ground missiles or drop simple free-fall bombs that fall to the ground ""according to the laws of physics,"" so to speak, said Leonhard Houben, a historian and freelancer at the Berlin-Gatow Military History Museum.When building fighter jets, compromises must be made. Questions to consider include whether a jet is likely to fight other aircraft in the air, and whether those aircraft are other fighter jets that can fight back. Or should the jet only be able to effectively engage ground targets?Such strategic considerations are then reflected in a fighter jet's technology: Should the aircraft be built to be rather light and maneuverable for air combat, or equipped with large fuel tanks for long range missions?The MiG-29 now being discussed for delivery to Ukraine in order to help fight off Russian attacks was designed to take to the air for a very specific purpose: To protect the borders of Warsaw Pact countries against NATO aircraft.Thus, this so-called interceptor, which entered service in 1983, can take off very quickly and reach its destination. Due to its design, the MiG-29 is extremely maneuverable in air combat. It can even stand vertically in the air on its own for short periods of time. However, the jet was initially equipped with only short-range fuel to save weight.The majority of modern fighter jets combine a variety of capabilities. According to Houben, it is more economical to build so-called multi-purpose warplanes because they can be mass-produced in just one batch that can then be used for a variety of missions.The F-16 is one such mass-produced multi-purpose aircraft. It was explicitly developed in the US in the 1970s for export to partner nations as a low-cost, general-purpose jet. The F-16 is the fighter jet with the largest worldwide production run that is still in service. To this day, the jet is still produced in the US and is being continually improved.Houben says that arguably ""F-16s built 20 years ago are on par with Russian jets built maybe three to five years ago"". That's partly because fighter jet technology development in Russia lagged in the 1990s, he says, and so much talent has left the country.In addition to a jet's technology, its weaponry is crucial. Without it, a jet is ""just a shell, like a fire truck without a rotatable ladder,"" says Kluge. Like other experts, he believes it is safe to assume that if jets are delivered to Ukraine, they will also be equipped with modern weapons.Ukraine could then use these jets to secure its own airspace. This is because, unlike air defense missiles of the kind fired by ground-based air defense systems, jets are highly mobile and can thus safeguard a large area and, using modern air-to-air missiles, also shoot down cruise missiles in the air.According to Leonhard Houben, it is unlikely that Russian and Ukrainian jets will engage in aerial combat like in Hollywood movies. Nowadays, fighter jets would mostly fight each other with missiles outside their line of sight.Similar to battle tanks, the rule is usually whoever fires first and hits, wins. Modern air-to-air missiles, once fired, virtually sneak up on their target and activate their conspicuous radar only shortly before impact. By then it's often too late to dodge. The reality usually has little to do with wild maneuvers, machine gun fire, and Hollywood.Nevertheless, a fighter pilot must also be able to engage in close combat in the event that all the missiles have been fired. They must be able to multitask under exceptional conditions. For this reason, pilots are not trained overnight: For the German Eurofighter aircraft, the training period takes five to six years and costs five million euros ― per pilot.On his very first flight in a jet, an engine failed, says former pilot Vergin. Although he was scared, he knew exactly what to do because of ""drills and training,"" and he remained calm and landed the plane safely.However, each pilot often learns to fly just one type of fighter jet, as retraining for another type of jet is costly. When Vergin switched from the Phantom fighter jet to the Tornado, the training took seven months.This is also where all the experts interviewed see a major challenge for Ukrainian pilots. All manuals, all buttons in NATO jets are labeled in English. Not easy when you can read only Cyrillic script. Also, all figures are in feet and miles. Pilots in former Soviet Union countries learn to fly on the basis of the metric system.In war, however, fighter jets are more than the sum of their technical capabilities.Robert Kluge, for example, describes the aircraft as a ""myth"" because, unlike humans, it can also move in the third dimension.A fighter jet can even be seen as a symbol that can boost the morale of one's own troops. And as an important chess piece in the strategy of a war, simply having it can be enough to make enemies have second thoughts.This text was originally published in German.",2023/02/22,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818595,Exiled Myanmar journalists in Thailand fight for truth,"More than two years after the military coup in Myanmar, the country's media landscape looks bleaker than ever. At least 130 journalists have been arrested, and around 50 remain in prison. Many media outlets in the country are now operating in exile, and for most of them, trying to continue covering the country from neighboring Thailand has proven to be a very challenging task.""Journalists have either been on the run or left the country, and we ca''t do our work properly and professionally,"" said Sonny Swe, founder of independent media outlet Frontier Myanmar. ""A lot of people are leaving journalism because they need to support themselves.""Swe and his team left the country in October 2021, following the arrest of Frontier Myanmar's managing editor Danny Fenster and a regular columnist. ""The police and soldiers were chasing our reporters,"" Swe told DW. ""We were all in hiding, and there were just many signs that we can no longer work freely in the country. Leaving was the right decision for us.""After contemplating how to flee the country, Swe and some Frontier Myanmar journalists flew to Chiang Mai in Thailand, joining scores of other Myanmar journalists.According to Daniel Bastard, the head of the Asia-Pacific desk for press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), 115 journalists were arrested in the first year of the coup in 2021. Since February 2022, 15 new arrests have been made.""This shows that it's becoming more difficult for the junta to arrest journalists, as they go into hiding or flee the country,"" he told DW.""But even when the number of arrests starts to slow down, the number of sentences given to journalists by military courts has increased. Most journalists were given three-year jail sentences, but there are signs that the length of sentence is getting longer,"" he added.Swe originally thought the Frontier Myanmar team could easily restart operations from Thailand, but a wave of COVID-19 infections, the arrests of more reporters, and the lack of access to sources and information in Myanmar complicated efforts.""There was no easy way to get back into full swing, but we managed to do it,"" he told DW. ""We rely on existing sources, and it's difficult to gain new sources when we are reporting from abroad. This is becoming the new normal, where we have to find other ways to do reporting,"" Swe explained.Naw Betty Han from Frontier Myanmar told DW that nowadays, she mostly relies on social media to connect with sources in Myanmar, but since some areas have no access to the internet, she must call sources via phone.Emilie Lehmann-Jacobsen, the program development advisor for Asia at International Media Support (IMS) in Denmark, says many Myanmar journalists now in relative safety in Chiang Mai still face many legal, personal, and security issues as they try to maintain operations in exile.""There are a lot of safety concerns, as there is a strong tie between the Thai military and Myanmar military, which also means many people don't know what consequences there will be in the long run,"" she said.Naw Betty Han recounted when she tried to renew her passport in Chiang Mai, the Myanmar consulate in the city accused Frontier Myanmar of producing fake information after they reported that Burmese migrant workers having difficulties renewing their passports.""I'm very worried about myself becoming undocumented, but I also have no plan to apply for asylum in another country,"" she told DW.Swe believes that as long as Frontier Myanmar directs all of its focus to Myanmar while staying away from political issues in Thailand, he thinks his journalists should be safe.""The reason why we choose to be in Thailand is that it's the closest country to Myanmar, and Myanmar migrants are everywhere in Thailand,"" he told DW. ""It's a safe haven, no matter what the track record is. Thailand is also a lot safer than Myanmar.""As the military junta remains in control over Myanmar, Swe thinks Myanmar journalists will have to adjust and accept that reporting on the country in exile will be the new normal.""When we first got to Thailand, I was planning to be around for two years, but now, I'm planning to be around for another seven to ten years,"" he said. ""I don't think Myanmar journalists can go home anytime soon, so we are now all focusing on long-term sustainability wherever we go.""Swe and Han both hope the international community will reserve more attention and support for Myanmar, as the coup enters its third year.""We are all yelling for help, especially since the media sector in Myanmar is completely gone,"" said Swe.""We have to find a way to sustain ourselves so we can stay in the business and keep an eye on the country. People need to know the truth… That's the most important thing.""Edited by: Sou-Jie van BrunnersumEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week's best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818597,Djokovic hopes to play in US despite being unvaccinated,"BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Novak Djokovic has asked American authorities for special permission to enter the United States to play tennis tournaments in California and Florida despite being unvaccinated against the coronavirus, the top-ranked Serb said Wednesday.

            The Transportation Security Administration has said the requirement for foreign air travelers to be fully vaccinated against the disease would be in place at least until mid-April. The tournament in Indian Wells will be played from March 6-19 and the Miami Open is scheduled from March 20-April 2.

            “Everything is currently in the process,” Djokovic said at his training ground in Belgrade. “I have a big desire to be there.











            “I am really thankful to the Indian Wells and Miami tournament (officials) and community for their support publicly and they would like me to be able to play in their tournaments.”

            Djokovic is one of the most high-profile athletes who is unvaccinated against COVID-19.

            Last year, the 35-year-old Djokovic was deported from Australia ahead of the Australian Open because of his vaccination status. Djokovic returned to the tournament in January after Australia lifted its strict vaccine mandate to win his 22nd Grand Slam title, tying the record with Rafael Nadal.

            Djokovic said Wednesday that Nadal remains his biggest on-court rival despite the rise of 19-year-old Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, who had been at the top of the rankings before a leg injury prevented him from playing at the Australian Open.

            ""(Alcaraz) is arguably the next biggest thing in our sport, or he’s already there.” Djokovic said. “I just feel that the rivalry with Nadal is something that is difficult to eliminate.

            “Nadal has been the biggest rival and he probably will remain the biggest rival I ever had in my in my career.”

            Djokovic reached another milestone in his tennis career this week by tying German great Steffi Gaff with 377 weeks at the top of the world rankings.

            “Obviously, Steffi Graf is one of the biggest legends of our sport, both men and women tennis, and someone that I truly admire and respect,” Djokovic said. “So, of course, it’s very flattering that I am able to equal her record and obviously have a possibility to break it as well the next week.”

            Djokovic said his next tournament will be next week's Dubai Open.

            The tours formally announced the change Wednesday, with Grant Thornton serving as the title sponsor.

            The Associated Press first reported the mixed team event in December.











            “By joining forces with the PGA Tour to host a mixed event where the top male and female golfers in the world compete alongside each other, we’re going to deliver a memorable and entertaining experience for all golf fans, showcasing our players’ incredible skills in a new context to a new audience,"" LPGA Tour Commissioner Mollie Marcoux Samaan said.

            “This is an important step forward for golf, women’s golf and the LPGA.”

            The Grant Thornton Invitational will be Dec. 8-10 at Tiburon Golf Club in Naples, Florida. Still to be determined is the format for the 16 teams.

            The event began in 1989 as the Shark Shootout, and in recent years it has added LPGA Tour players to the field. Other unofficial events, such as the CVS Charity Classic in Rhode Island, also included women.

            But this will be the first fully mixed event since the final edition of the JC Penney Classic in 1999 won by John Daly and Laura Davies. Tiger Woods played one year in the JC Penney Classic with Kelli Kuehne.

            Other tours in recent years have had official mixed competitions. At the ISPS Handa Australian Open, men and women competed on the same course at the same time for equal prize money in separate competition. Last year on the European tour, players competed in one competition from different sets of tees. Linn Grant of Sweden became the first woman to win a European tour title at the Scandinavian Mixed.

            A mixed event had been on the PGA Tour's radar for the last several years, and there was consideration to make the World Cup a mixed event until the COVID-19 pandemic halted momentum.

            “As we look to capitalize on the growing interest in the game of golf, the addition of a mixed event to the calendar has been a priority,” PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said.

            Grant Thornton, which has a marketing partnership with the PGA Tour, has a roster of corporate ambassadors in golf that includes Rickie Fowler and Tony Finau, and Nelly and Jessica Korda. They likely would be among those who play the event.

            “PGA Tour athletes playing alongside the best athletes from the LPGA Tour is going to be incredible for our fans,” Finau said. “They’ve been wanting something like this for a long time.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818599,"Nagelsmann fined for outburst against ref, avoids suspension","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann was fined 50,000 euros ($53,200) on Wednesday but avoided suspension for his outburst against match officials after the Bundesliga leader's 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach. 

            The German soccer federation issued the fine for what it called Nagelsmann’s “unsportsmanlike comments” to referee Tobias Welz and officials in their locker room after Saturday's game.

            The federation refrained from any ban for Nagelsmann after noting he apologized the same evening and had not previously appeared before its sports court.











            Nagelsmann was upset after Bayern defender Dayot Upamecano was sent off in the eighth minute for a foul on Gladbach’s Alassane Plea as the forward was heading toward the goal. There was only minimal contact, but Welz said it was enough for Plea to lose his balance.

            Nagelsmann saw it differently at the time and angrily confronted the match officials afterward.

            “Is he messing me around or what?” Nagelsmann reportedly roared, before he knocked on the door of the officials’ dressing room.

            Bayern leads the Bundesliga on goal difference from Borussia Dortmund and Union Berlin but Nagelsmann is under pressure after seeing the team's four-point lead disappear since the winter break.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818600,UN court calls for end to Nagorno-Karabakh roadblock,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The United Nations' highest court ordered Azerbaijan on Wednesday to “take all steps at its disposal” to allow free movement of traffic along the only road between Armenia and the ethnic Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan that has been blocked by protesters in a move that has further fueled tensions between the two countries.

            The legally binding 13-2 ruling by the International Court of Justice results from the latest legal skirmishes in a long-running feud between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Each country filed a case with the court accusing the other of breaching a convention aimed at stamping out racial discrimination.

            Wednesday's ruling on the blocked road known as the Lachin Corridor came just over two years after the neighboring nations ended a war in Nagorno-Karabakh that killed about 6,800 soldiers and displaced around 90,000 civilians.











            The remote and rugged region is within Azerbaijan but had been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994.

            A cease-fire brokered by Russia ended the 2020 war and granted Azerbaijan control over parts of Nagorno-Karabakh as well as adjacent land occupied by Armenians. Russia sent a peacekeeping force of 2,000 troops to maintain order, including controlling the Lachin Corridor.

            
                Armenia’s lawyers said during court hearings last month that the roadblock set up late last year by protesters claiming to be environmental activists was part of an Azerbaijani campaign the Armenians labeled “ethnic cleansing.”

            International Court of Justice President Joan E. Donoghue said the evidence presented by Armenia established that the blockade “has impeded the transfer of persons of Armenian national and ethnic origin hospitalized in Nagorno-Karabakh to medical facilities in Armenia for urgent medical care.""

            It also interrupted supplies to Nagorno-Karabakh of “essential goods causing shortages of food, medicine and other lifesaving medical supplies,” Donoghue said.

            In their majority decision, the court's judges ordered Azerbaijan to “take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin Corridor in both directions.”

            In a statement, Azerbaijan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the court's ruling “took note of Azerbaijan’s representation that Azerbaijan has and undertakes to continue to take all steps within its power and at its disposal to guarantee safe movement along the Lachin road.”

            The statement said Azerbaijan ""will continue to uphold the rights of all people under international law and to hold Armenia to account for its ongoing and historic grave violations of human rights.”

            The court, in its ruling, said that Armenia's request for judges to order Azerbaijan to “cease its orchestration and support"" of the protests on the Lachin Corridor was ""not warranted.”

            The judges rejected Armenia's request for an order for Azerbaijan not to block gas supplies to Nagorno-Karabakh, saying that Armenian lawyers did not provide enough evidence to back their claim that Azerbaijan was disrupting the supply.

            The judges also declined a request by Azerbaijan for an order to stop or prevent Armenia from laying landmines and booby traps in areas of the region to which Azerbaijani citizens are to return.

            The world court ordered both nations a little over a year ago to prevent discrimination against one another’s citizens in the aftermath of the war and to not further aggravate the conflict.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818602,Space telescope uncovers massive galaxies near cosmic dawn,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Astronomers have discovered what appear to be massive galaxies dating back to within 600 million years of the Big Bang, suggesting the early universe may have had a stellar fast-track that produced these “monsters.”

            While the new James Webb Space Telescope has spotted even older galaxies, dating to within a mere 300 million years of the beginning of the universe, it’s the size and maturity of these six apparent mega-galaxies that stun scientists. They reported their findings Wednesday.

            Lead researcher Ivo Labbe of Australia’s Swinburne University of Technology and his team expected to find little baby galaxies this close to the dawn of the universe — not these whoppers.











            “While most galaxies in this era are still small and only gradually growing larger over time,” he said in an email, “there are a few monsters that fast-track to maturity. Why this is the case or how this would work is unknown.”

            Each of the six objects looks to weigh billions of times more than our sun. In one of them, the total weight of all its stars may be as much as 100 billion times greater than our sun, according to the scientists, who published their findings in the journal Nature.

            Yet these galaxies are believed to be extremely compact, squeezing in as many stars as our own Milky Way, but in a relatively tiny slice of space, according to Labbe.

            Labbe said he and his team didn’t think the results were real at first — that there couldn’t be galaxies as mature as the Milky Way so early in time — and they still need to be confirmed. The objects appeared so big and bright that some members of the team thought they had made a mistake.

            “We were mind-blown, kind of incredulous,” Labbe said.

            The Pennsylvania State University’s Joel Leja, who took part in the study, calls them “universe breakers.”

            “The revelation that massive galaxy formation began extremely early in the history of the universe upends what many of us had thought was settled science,” Leja said in a statement. “It turns out we found something so unexpected it actually creates problems for science. It calls the whole picture of early galaxy formation into question.”

            These galaxy observations were among the first data set that came from the $10 billion Webb telescope, launched just over a year ago. NASA and the European Space Agency’s Webb is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, coming up on the 33rd anniversary of its launch.

            Unlike Hubble, the bigger and more powerful Webb can peer through clouds of dust with its infrared vision and discover galaxies previously unseen. Scientists hope to eventually observe the first stars and galaxies formed following the creation of the universe 13.8 billion years ago.

            The researchers still are awaiting official confirmation through sensitive spectroscopy, careful to call these candidate massive galaxies for now. Leja said it's possible that a few of the objects might not be galaxies, but obscured supermassive black holes.

            While some may prove to be smaller, “odds are good at least some of them will turn out to be” galactic giants, Labbe said. “The next year will tell us.”

            One early lesson from Webb is ""to let go of your expectations and be ready to be surprised,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818603,"Terry, Willard, other new coaches making big gains in debuts","Rodney Terry had minimal notice that his responsibilities were about to change. Just hours before Texas was to face Rice on Dec. 12, Terry was made the interim replacement for Chris Beard, who was suspended after a domestic violence arrest and later fired.

            With 10 years of experience guiding a program, and 27 years in the profession, Terry has steadied the eighth-ranked Longhorns amid all the chaos, making him one of the new coaches making a big splash this season.

            Texas is 16-6 under Terry after beating No. 23 Iowa State on Tuesday night, and 22-6 overall. Terry compiled a 163-156 record over three seasons at UTEP and seven at Fresno State and has spent much of his time in an assistant's role with the Longhorns. Their energetic style comes from Terry, guard Marcus Carr said.











            “Coach does a good job of, you know, before we even start talking about basketball, just making sure we understand where we’re at, and we’re all grateful to just be here and be breathing every single day and thankful to have the opportunity of life,” Carr said. “Coach definitely puts that energy into us and I definitely think it spreads throughout the whole team.""

            Here are some other coaches faring well in their first seasons in charge (records through Tuesday):

            KEVIN WILLARD, Maryland (18-9)

            The Terps parted ways with coach Mark Turgeon last December and hired Willard away from Seton Hall. The new coach set expectations high right away, calling the job one of the 10 best in the country.

            He’s delivering, with victories against then- No. 16 Illinois, then- No. 24 Ohio State, current No. 17 Indiana and current No. 5 Purdue.

            The 68-54 win over the Boilermakers was the Terps’ first against a top five team since 2016 and, in a sign of diminished expectations in the 20 years since their 2002 national championship, led students to storm the court.

            “That was special. ... The court-storming was for the students, for the fans. The locker room was what it’s all about. It was great. I told them I was very proud of them. I told him that they earned it,” Willard said. “It was a fun moment, just being able to get a big one like that.”

            JEROME TANG, Kansas State (21-7)

            Tang took over when Bruce Weber resigned after three consecutive losing seasons, during which the Wildcats were 34-58 overall and 13-41 in the Big 12. Tang has transformed the program even while competing in the rugged league that boasts six teams in the AP Top 25.

            Kansas State, ranked No. 14, had one of the more impressive runs of the season beginning on New Year’s Eve when it beat then-No. 24 West Virginia 82-76 in overtime, won at current No. 8 Texas 116-103 on Jan. 3 and won at current No. 9 Baylor 97-95 on Jan. 7. The Wildcats completed a sweep of Baylor with a 75-65 victory Tuesday.

            “I don’t know when’s the last time a team had to play three ranked teams in a row and two of them on the road,” Tang said after the first win at Baylor. “That’s a great accomplishment for these young men. But none of that matters if we lay an egg in the next game, right?”

            SEAN MILLER, Xavier (20-8)

            His success in his first stint as the Musketeers coach, from 2004-09, earned him the top job at Arizona. He now appears to have No. 16 Xavier poised to make a run at the Big East championship.

            Miller spent 12 scandal-tinged, successful seasons at Arizona before being fired after last season. He escaped sanctions after a lengthy federal corruption investigation into college basketball recruiting, costing him 50 victories and leaving the program with a self-imposed, one-year postseason ban.

            The addition of top scorer Souley Boum (16.3 ppg) from UTEP has been key in making the Musketeers significant contenders in a top league.

            CHRIS JANS, Mississippi State (18-10)

            The head man at New Mexico State from 2017-22, Jans left after last season with a 122-32 record with the Aggies and an NCAA Tournament upset of Connecticut last season as a No. 12 seed. He’s quickly improved things for the Bulldogs, who had not won more than 18 games in either of the previous two seasons but are 18-10 this year.

            After three NIT appearances in the last five years, the Bulldogs seem a sure bet to make it back into the NCAA's field of 68 this season.

            DENNIS GATES, Missouri (20-8)

            Gates, who coached at Cleveland State last season, has engineered a quick turnaround for a program that finished 12-21 last season. The Tigers' 86-85 victory at No. 11 Tennessee on Feb. 11 was just the 10th in program history against a top 10 team on the road and gave them five wins against ranked teams, their most since 2011-12.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818604,Winner comes forward to claim $1.35B Mega Millions jackpot,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — The winner of a $1.35 billion Mega Millions jackpot — the fourth largest in U.S. history — has come forward to collect the prize, state officials said Wednesday.

            The winner had been a mystery, and remains a mystery.

            The Maine State Lottery said the winner chose to remain anonymous and collect the cash option through a limited liability company, LaKoma Island Investments LLC, instead of receiving the full amount in payments over time.











            “The winner is thoughtfully considering the best uses of the life-changing prize,"" a representative said in a statement.

            By choosing the cash option, the winner will receive a one-time, lump-sum payment of $723,564,144 before taxes, officials said.

            The winner had the option of coming forward in person with the winning ticket or remaining anonymous through a trust, lottery officials said. 

            The winning ticket was validated when a representative came to the lottery headquarters in Augusta on Friday, and the wire transfer of the money will take place before the end of the week, said Michael Boardman, deputy director of Maine Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages & Lottery Operation.

            “I understand why someone would want to remain anonymous with this kind of money. We wish them well and hope they do good things with it,” he said.

            The winning ticket for the Jan. 13 drawing was purchased at Hometown Gas & Grill in Lebanon, which is located on a busy highway in a small town near the New Hampshire border.

            Owner Fred Cotreau said he had no idea who held the winning ticket.

            “We're going to wait and see if it's a local. Who knows? Sometimes they come to the store and say thank you, but I’m not going to lose any sleep over it,” said Cotreau, who shared half of the store's proceeds of $50,000 for selling the winning ticket with his employees.

            If the winner had chosen to accept the full amount, then there would've been 30 payments over 29 years, Boardman said.

            By accepting the cash payout, the winner will receive more than $498 million after taxes, Boardman said.

We wish them well and hope they do good things with it,” he said.The winning ticket for the Jan. 13 drawing was purchased at Hometown Gas & Grill in Lebanon, which is located on a busy highway in a small town near the New Hampshire border.Owner Fred Cotreau said he had no idea who held the winning ticket.“We're going to wait and see if it's a local. Who knows? Sometimes they come to the store and say thank you, but I’m not going to lose any sleep over it,” said Cotreau, who shared half of the store's proceeds of $50,000 for selling the winning ticket with his employees.If the winner had chosen to accept the full amount, then there would've been 30 payments over 29 years, Boardman said.By accepting the cash payout, the winner will receive more than $498 million after taxes, Boardman said. Taxes in the amount of $173.6 million will go to the federal government and $51 million to the state, he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818605,EU pandemic fund inspectors say no sign of fraud in Spain,"MADRID (AP) — The European Parliament´s budget control committee said Wednesday it has found no evidence of deceit or fraud in Spain’s handling of the 31 billion euros ($33 billion) it has received so far in special European Union post-pandemic recovery funds.

            But a visiting delegation urged the Madrid government to be more transparent and flexible in its use of the funds and in providing public information about them.

            Speaking Wednesday at the end of a three-day inspection visit, committee chair Monika Hohlmeier said she was impressed with Spanish authorities’ commitment to make the most of the funds but added that she recognized that administrative hurdles were a major complaint from several regional officials.











            “We have learned that the current implementation of the funds should be more flexible,” said Hohlmeier. “Administrative burden is a common complaint by the stakeholders. ”

            She added that several of Spain’s regions complain about their proposals not being considered and called “on both the central and regional governments to deepen their dialogs and cooperation.”

            Hohlmeier’s conciliatory tone in the end-of-visit press conference came as a surprise as it was expected that the delegation might be highly critical of Spain.

            She said the visit was not chiefly intended to look for violations but rather to ensure transparency and that the funds be well spent.

            Hohlmeier said there was a particular need to remove impediments to give fairer and faster access to the self-employed and small- and medium-sized companies that she said are so important to the Spanish economy.

            She said the committee will draw up a series of recommendations in its upcoming report once they have reviewed all they have heard in the meetings with financial and political authorities during the visit.

            Spain was one of the first EU countries to apply for and receive funds from the EU pandemic recovery fund and stands to be among its main beneficiaries. It is set to receive a total of 140 billion euros, half in direct transfers, half in loans.

            Prior to the visit, the European Commission last Friday said it would deliver a further 6 billion euros to Spain, indicating its satisfaction with how Spain was handling the money so far.

            Hohlmeier admitted that future funds would be contingent on Spain completing a reform of its pension system but said Madrid appeared committed to doing this and that there was no prospect of the money being blocked.MADRID (AP) — The European Parliament´s budget control committee said Wednesday it has found no evidence of deceit or fraud in Spain’s handling of the 31 billion euros ($33 billion) it has received so far in special European Union post-pandemic recovery funds.But a visiting delegation urged the Madrid government to be more transparent and flexible in its use of the funds and in providing public information about them.Speaking Wednesday at the end of a three-day inspection visit, committee chair Monika Hohlmeier said she was impressed with Spanish authorities’ commitment to make the most of the funds but added that she recognized that administrative hurdles were a major complaint from several regional officials.“We have learned that the current implementation of the funds should be more flexible,” said Hohlmeier. “Administrative burden is a common complaint by the stakeholders. ”She added that several of Spain’s regions complain about their proposals not being considered and called “on both the central and regional governments to deepen their dialogs and cooperation.”Hohlmeier’s conciliatory tone in the end-of-visit press conference came as a surprise as it was expected that the delegation might be highly critical of Spain.She said the visit was not chiefly intended to look for violations but rather to ensure transparency and that the funds be well spent.Hohlmeier said there was a particular need to remove impediments to give fairer and faster access to the self-employed and small- and medium-sized companies that she said are so important to the Spanish economy.She said the committee will draw up a series of recommendations in its upcoming report once they have reviewed all they have heard in the meetings with financial and political authorities during the visit.Spain was one of the first EU countries to apply for and receive funds from the EU pandemic recovery fund and stands to be among its main beneficiaries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818606,Steelers hire Seahawks' Curry as inside linebackers coach,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Aaron Curry is the new inside linebackers coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the team announced Wednesday.

            Curry spent the last four years working in various roles for the Seattle Seahawks, including assistant defensive line/defensive ends coach in 2022.

            Curry replaces Jerry Olsavsky, who had been Pittsburgh's inside linebackers coach since 2015. Olsavsky spent more than 20 years with the organization as a player and coach but was not retained for the 2023 season.











            Olsavsky's role was diminished last season after the Steelers hired Brian Flores as a senior defensive assistant with an emphasis on linebackers. Flores left the Steelers earlier this month to become the defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings.

            Curry inherits a unit that will enter 2023 in flux. Devin Bush, a first-round draft pick in 2019, and Rob Spillane will become free agents next month.

            Bush underperformed following his return from a torn ACL in his left knee suffered in 2020 and saw his playing time all but disappear at the end of the 2022 season. Spillane has been a solid contributor in his four seasons with Pittsburgh and finished third on the team in tackles in 2022 behind fellow inside linebacker Myles Jack and safety Minkah Fitzpatrick.

            Curry played four seasons in the NFL after Seattle selected him with the fourth overall pick in the 2009 draft. He spent two-plus seasons in Seattle before being traded to Oakland during the 2011 season. Curry played seven games for the Raiders through 2012. He attended training camp with the New York Giants in 2013 but did not make the final roster.

            Curry's arrival is the latest in a series of moves by Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin to overhaul his staff. With Olsavsky's departure, the longest-tenured assistant on staff is defensive line coach Karl Dunbar, who joined the Steelers in February 2018.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818608,Russia denies plans to test new missile off South Africa,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) — The Russian military denied Wednesday that it was planning to test its new Zircon hypersonic missiles during naval drills off the coast of South Africa this week that will coincide with the one-year anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine.

            China's navy also is participating in the Indian Ocean exercises, which come at a time when Russia's relationship with the West is at its lowest point since the Cold War, and ties between China and the United States are under serious strain.

            As Russian and Chinese warships prepared in South Africa for their joint drills, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted China's most senior foreign policy official at the Kremlin. Those meetings showed the strengthening of Russia's relationship with China and raised concern in the West that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support for its war in Ukraine.











            Russia's aims for the naval exercises came under scrutiny because of the involvement of the Admiral Gorshkov, a frigate which is armed with hypersonic missiles and has served as the main testbed for them. The ship arrived in Cape Town last week emblazoned with the letters Z and V, letters also seen on Russian weapons on the front lines in Ukraine and which are used as patriotic symbols in Russia.

            Russia has said the Zircon missiles can penetrate any missile defense systems by flying at an astounding 7,000 miles per hour (11,265 km/h) — around nine times the speed of sound — to strike targets at sea and on land. They have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (over 620 miles), Russia claims.

            Putin sent the Admiral Gorshkov on a trans-ocean cruise last month in a show of force as tensions with the West escalated over Ukraine. But a Russian navy officer in South Africa said Wednesday that the exercises would focus on maritime security, including the fight against piracy, and the Zircons would not be fired.

            The drills will involve ""mutual maneuvering of the three sides, assistance of the suffering vessel in a disaster, liberation of a captured vessel by the pirates, and artillery fire which, according to our schedule, does not include the firing with the hypersonic missiles,” Capt. Oleg Gladkiy said. He spoke through a translator.

            The Admiral Gorshkov and a Russian oil tanker for refueling, a Chinese destroyer, frigate and a support vessel, and a South African frigate will be involved in the exercises, according to a South African military statement released last week.

            Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa, Liubov Abravitova., criticized the timing of the drills, which will overlap with Friday's one-year anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine. 

            Abravitova noted that China, Russia and South Africa, which are partners in the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, have undertaken joint naval drills before but said “it is a concern for us that they are happening at the time of the anniversary of the brutal Russian invasion.”

            “The vessel that came to the shores of South Africa basically brought a piece of the war to this peaceful land through having the letters Z and V, which they are using as a marking on their military equipment while bombing Ukrainian cities,” Abravitova said in an interview with The Associated Press.

            Last week, a small yacht flying Ukraine’s flag sailed by the Admiral Gorshkov in Cape Town’s harbor in protest. On Wednesday, a group of protesters gathered outside the Russian Embassy in the South African capital, Pretoria. They criticized the presence of the Russian warship and South Africa's decision to host it.

            One protester held up a placard that read: “DON'T PLAY with bullies.”

            South Africa, a key partner of the West in Africa, has come under criticism for holding the naval exercises but has defended itself by saying they were planned two years ago, well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

            The exercises are to be held around the Indian Ocean port cities of Durban and Richards Bay. Media access was restricted.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818609,"MLB curtails infield shift, hopes for more singles, speed","PHOENIX (AP) — Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell needed to add some pop to his lineup a couple years ago, so he put a few more big bodies in his four-man infield, sacrificing defensive range for offensive thump.

            “They combined for a weight of over 1,000 pounds,” Counsell said, laughing. 

            “I don't think you'll ever see that again.”











            There's little doubt that hiding a couple bulky sluggers in the infield is going to be more challenging this season. One of Major League Baseball's most visible rule changes for 2023 is a limitation on infield shifts, which had grown exponentially and are partly to blame for a league-wide batting average drop.

            The hope is twofold: One, a few more hits for lefty mashers like Kyle Schwarber or Corey Seager, who were among those hindered by the shift. And two, stress on athleticism and range for those playing defense in the infield.

            “I’m sure some guys will like it and some won’t,” said former Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, a four-time Gold Glove winner. “You’ve got to have range now as an infielder. Got to be able to catch the ball. You’ve got to be quick. 

            ""It’ll be an adjustment for some guys. It’ll make other guys better.” 

            Hitters in the big leagues had a .243 batting average last season, the lowest since 1968.

            The new rule states that all four infielders must have both feet within the outer boundary of the infield and two infielders must be on each side of second base when a pitch is delivered. MLB also mandated infield dirt have uniform dimensions in all 30 ballparks — the outfield edge must be 95 feet from the front of the pitching rubber.

            A few hitters — notably New York Mets star Jeff McNeil — adapted to exploit the gaping holes in the infield shifts with hard-hit balls the other way. Most stuck to their modern, pull-heavy approaches, in part because pitchers strategized to make going to the opposite field difficult — even big league hitters struggle to slap an up-and-in 98 mph fastball the other way.

            Arizona's Josh Rojas, a left-hander hitter, said he wasn't particularly worried about the changes. He views them as just the latest salvo in ongoing pitcher-vs.-hitter battle that's ebbed and flowed for more than a century.

            “The holes will be in different spots,” Rojas said. “My goal as a hitter is to find the holes and use those to my advantage. There are always holes — you can't cover every single one on the field.”

            Enterprising teams spent the offseason peppering the commissioner's office with questions about ways to potentially circumvent the guidelines. 

            Morgan Sword, an MLB executive vice president, said teams primarily had three questions:

            — Can an infielder be put in motion during the pitch, running toward the other side of the diamond, so that there are three infielders on one side of second base once the ball is put in play? (The answer is no.)

            — Can an infielder be put in motion during the pitch, running toward the outfield grass, so that he's in the outfield by the time the ball is put in play? (No)

            — Can teams move outfielders around, such as the left fielder moving into short right field for a lefty pull hitter, leaving left field unmanned? (Yes)

            Umpires have broad discretion to enforce the guidelines.

            “They'll know if a team is trying to break the spirit of the rule,” Sword said. 

            MLB's hope is shift limits will add a hit or two each night. Not only will the shift affect batting, but it makes speed and agility more important for infielders, who must cover more ground on defense.

            “Those are the demands. You have to pick up the baseball and also hit it,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. “We're not just going to put someone in one spot, stand on the ‘X’, we don't believe in that. We do have very athletic position players.”

            The shift limit has been tested in the minor leagues, and Lovullo said that after speaking with the organization's Double-A manager, Shawn Roof, he expects offense to jump.

            “He said it makes a difference,” Lovullo said. “There are more balls getting through.”

            The change could affect some pitchers, too. D-backs right-hander Merrill Kelly said he's been told advanced metrics say he's been one of the beneficiaries of the shift.

            But the veteran, slated to pitch for the U.S. in the World Baseball Classic, is fine with the new rules.

            “I'm a fan of taking away from the shift, even though statistics say that I could benefit from it,"" Kelly said. “I think hits should be hits and outs should be outs.”

We do have very athletic position players.”The shift limit has been tested in the minor leagues, and Lovullo said that after speaking with the organization's Double-A manager, Shawn Roof, he expects offense to jump.“He said it makes a difference,” Lovullo said. “There are more balls getting through.”The change could affect some pitchers, too. D-backs right-hander Merrill Kelly said he's been told advanced metrics say he's been one of the beneficiaries of the shift.But the veteran, slated to pitch for the U.S. in the World Baseball Classic, is fine with the new rules.“I'm a fan of taking away from the shift, even though statistics say that I could benefit from it,"" Kelly said. “I think hits should be hits and outs should be outs.”___AP freelance writer Ken Powtak contributed to this report.___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818620,US sanctions Mexican drug precursor suppliers,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday on six members of a Mexican ring accused of supplying massive amounts of precursor chemical used to make deadly fentanyl and methamphetamines. 

            The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control blocked any U.S. properties of brothers Ludim and Luis Alfonso Zamudio Lerma, as well as several people they did business with. 

            The six allegedly supplied chemicals used in super labs, which the office described as “large-scale drug laboratories that produce 10 or more pounds of an illicit drug per production cycle” to make meth and the synthetic opioid fentanyl for the Sinaloa Cartel. 











             “The Zamudio Lerma brothers and their network enable the production of synthetic drugs that devastate American lives, while lining the pockets of Sinaloa Cartel leadership,” OFAC Director Andrea Gacki said in a statement.

            The ring allegedly supplied top-level Sinaloa cartel traffickers like the recently imprisoned Ovidio Guzman, the son of imprisoned cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

            Authorities in Mexico have found ever-larger processing facilities in Mexico where precursor chemicals, often imported from China, are used to make meth and fentanyl.

            Mexican cartels often press fentanyl into pills that mimic legitimate medications, heightening the danger of overdoses because many victims do not know they are taking fentanyl.

            Over 70,000 Americans died of overdoses involving opioids in 2020, mainly fentanyl.

            The office also named two Mexican companies owned by the Zamudio family in the sanctions, Aceros y Refacciones del Humaya, S.A. de C.V. and Farmacia Ludim.MEXICO CITY (AP) — The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday on six members of a Mexican ring accused of supplying massive amounts of precursor chemical used to make deadly fentanyl and methamphetamines.The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control blocked any U.S. properties of brothers Ludim and Luis Alfonso Zamudio Lerma, as well as several people they did business with.The six allegedly supplied chemicals used in super labs, which the office described as “large-scale drug laboratories that produce 10 or more pounds of an illicit drug per production cycle” to make meth and the synthetic opioid fentanyl for the Sinaloa Cartel.“The Zamudio Lerma brothers and their network enable the production of synthetic drugs that devastate American lives, while lining the pockets of Sinaloa Cartel leadership,” OFAC Director Andrea Gacki said in a statement.The ring allegedly supplied top-level Sinaloa cartel traffickers like the recently imprisoned Ovidio Guzman, the son of imprisoned cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.Authorities in Mexico have found ever-larger processing facilities in Mexico where precursor chemicals, often imported from China, are used to make meth and fentanyl.Mexican cartels often press fentanyl into pills that mimic legitimate medications, heightening the danger of overdoses because many victims do not know they are taking fentanyl.Over 70,000 Americans died of overdoses involving opioids in 2020, mainly fentanyl.The office also named two Mexican companies owned by the Zamudio family in the sanctions, Aceros y Refacciones del Humaya, S.A. de C.V. and Farmacia Ludim.",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818621,Marine commission: Whale deaths not linked to wind prep work,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — An independent scientific agency that advises the federal government on policies that could impact marine mammals said there is no evidence linking site preparation work for offshore wind farms with a number of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast.

            In a statement released Tuesday, the Marine Mammal Commission became the third federal agency to reject a link between the deaths and the offshore wind energy industry, despite a growing narrative among offshore wind opponents that probing the ocean floor to prepare for wind turbine projects is killing whales.

            Last month, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said there is no evidence linking offshore wind development with whale deaths.











            The commission said 16 humpback whales and at least one critically endangered North Atlantic right whale have washed ashore dead on the East Coast this winter.

            “Despite several reports in the media, there is no evidence to link these strandings to offshore wind energy development,” the commission said.

            The deaths are part of an “unusual mortality event” involving humpback whales declared by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2016. The agency said 40% of the whales that could be examined at necropsy, or post-mortem, showed evidence of a ship strike or entanglement with fishing gear. Others were floating at sea or otherwise inaccessible.

            The commission said the number of whale strandings is not unusual. Ten or more humpback whales have stranded each year since 2016, with a high of 34 in 2017, it added.

            It said the number of whales in the northeast is growing, something other agencies have noted as well. As the population grows, more whales are choosing to spend the winter in the northeast, where they are more vulnerable to being struck by ships or entangled in fishing gear, instead of migrating to warmer areas.

            On Feb. 12, a dead North Atlantic right whale washed ashore in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was a 20-year-old, 43-foot male.

            A necropsy was conducted by numerous state and city agencies and a private stranding response program, determining that the whale suffered a catastrophic blunt force traumatic injury, impacting its spine. The injuries, which are consistent with those often found in animals that have been struck by ships, included multiple vertebral fractures that would have resulted in death shortly after the injury.

            Today, there are fewer than 350 North Atlantic right whales in existence, with fewer than 95 mature females in the population. An unusual mortality event was declared for these animals in 2017.

            The commission's report comes as offshore wind opponents are pushing for investigations into whether offshore wind is killing whales, even though the federal government has been investigating whale deaths since 2016.

            Earlier this week, two Republican Congressmen from New Jersey announced legislation aimed at investigating, pausing or halting offshore wind projects.

            Rep. Chris Smith's bill would require an investigation into the environmental approval process for offshore wind projects. A bill by Rep. Jeff Van Drew would impose a moratorium on all existing offshore wind projects and prohibit all future projects. 

            About 30 New Jersey mayors have signed a letter calling for a moratorium on offshore wind projects and an investigation into whether the whale deaths are related to such work.

            The Marine Mammal Commission is an independent government agency charged by the Marine Mammal Protection Act to further the conservation of marine mammals and their environment. Its website says it provides “science-based oversight of domestic and international policies and actions of federal agencies with mandates to address human impacts on marine mammals and their ecosystems.”

            “Our role is unique,” the agency's mission statement said. “We are the only U.S. government agency that provides comprehensive oversight of all science, policy, and management actions affecting marine mammals.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818622,UNESCO chief urges tougher regulation of social media,"PARIS (AP) — The United Nations’ educational, scientific and cultural agency chief on Wednesday called for a global dialogue to find ways to regulate social media companies and limit their role in the spreading of misinformation around the world.

            Audrey Azoulay, the director general of UNESCO, addressed a gathering of lawmakers, journalists and civil societies from around the world to discuss ways to regulate social media platforms such as Twitter and others to help make the internet a safer, fact-based space.

            The two-day conference in Paris aims to formulate guidelines that would help regulators, governments and businesses manage content that undermines democracy and human rights, while supporting freedom of expression and promoting access to accurate and reliable information.











            The global dialogue should provide the legal tools and principles of accountability and responsibility for social media companies to contribute to the “public good,” Azoulay said in an interview with The Associated Press on the sidelines of the conference. She added: “It would limit the risks that we see today, that we live today, disinformation (and) conspiracy theories spreading faster than the truth.”

            The European Union last year passed landmark legislation that will compel big tech companies like Google and Facebook parent Meta to police their platforms more strictly to protect European users from hate speech, disinformation and harmful content.

            The Digital Services Act is one of the EU's three significant laws targeting the tech industry.

            In the United States, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed major antitrust actions against Google and Facebook, although Congress remains politically divided on efforts to address online disinformation, competition, privacy and more.

            Filipino journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa told participants in the Paris conference that putting laws into place that would prevent social media companies from “proliferating misinformation on their platforms” is long overdue.

            
                Ressa is a longtime critic of social media platforms that she said have put “democracy at risk” and distracted societies from solving problems such climate change and the rise of authoritarianism around the world.

            By “insidiously manipulating people at the scale that’s happening now, ... (they have) changed our values and it has rippled to cascading failure,” Ressa told the AP in an interview on Wednesday.

            “If you don’t have a set of shared facts, how do we deal with climate change?” Ressa said. “If everything is debatable, if trust is destroyed (there’s no) meaningful exchange.”

            She added: “Just a reminder, democracy is not just about talking. It’s about listening. It’s about finding compromises that are impossible in the world of technology today.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818623,UK grocers limit sales of some vegetables amid shortages,"LONDON (AP) — Several British supermarket chains have limited the amount of some fresh fruits and vegetables that customers can buy amid shortages blamed on bad weather in Spain and Morocco.

            Tesco, the U.K.’s largest grocery chain, said Wednesday that it would temporarily limit customers to buying three items each of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. It follows similar moves by rival chains Aldi and Morrisons.

            The empty shelves have become a political issue, with opponents of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union blaming Brexit for the fruit and vegetable shortages.











            But industry analysts said the main culprit was bad weather hurting crop yields in Spain and Morocco, two of the U.K.’s main suppliers of fresh produce in the winter. 

            Spain has had some unusually cold weather, while Morocco also was hit by frosty temperatures in January, followed by canceled ferries due to bad weather over the past month. That meant less produce being shipped to Britain.

            Ireland — an EU member but, like Britain, a chilly island that relies on seasonal imports — also has seen shortages of some fresh vegetables.

            “Difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe and northern Africa have disrupted the harvest for some fruit and vegetables including tomatoes and peppers,” said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents U.K. supermarkets.

            Opie said disruption was expected to last “a few weeks.”

            “Supermarkets are adept at managing supply chain issues and are working with farmers to ensure that customers are able to access a wide range of fresh produce,” he said.LONDON (AP) — Several British supermarket chains have limited the amount of some fresh fruits and vegetables that customers can buy amid shortages blamed on bad weather in Spain and Morocco.Tesco, the U.K.’s largest grocery chain, said Wednesday that it would temporarily limit customers to buying three items each of tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818624,Iconic Slovenian band Laibach to perform in Ukraine amid war,"LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) — Slovenia's iconic band Laibach will hold a concert in Ukraine's capital next month, saying Wednesday this will make them the first foreign group to perform a full show in Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion last February.

            The industrial rock band will hold a “very special concert” on March 31st at the Bel Etage Music Hall in Kyiv, a statement said. The concert will be dubbed ‘Eurovision’ in reference to the pop song contest which Ukraine won in 2022 but which will be hosted by the UK in Liverpool instead of Ukraine this year because of the war.

            “While the rest of Europe prepares to celebrate its idea of freedom and solidarity on 9 May in Liverpool, Laibach will be taking Eurovision back to Ukraine — where it belongs and where the only true and real vision of Europe is taking place right now,” the concert announcement said.











            Laibach is Slovenia's best known band which has won fame abroad for its totalitarian visual style, toying with populist imagery and almost martial-rhythm songs, sang in husky, deep vocals.

            Formed in 1980 when Slovenia was still part of Communist-run Yugoslavia, Laibach immediately stirred controversy with its name — German for Slovenia’s capital city Ljubljana — and because it used a black cross as one of its symbols.

            Considered too provocative for a regime that rose from the anti-Nazi struggle in World War II, the band was eventually formally banned and moved abroad in 1983 after they locked the audience inside a concert hall and played the sound of a dog barking extremely loudly for almost half an hour.

            In 2015, Laibach performed in North Korea.

            In Kyiv, the band will play its best known songs and the new track, “The Engine of Survival,” that is set for release in 2023. 

            “With anthems and marches at the core of many of their compositions, Laibach have long compared themselves to military marching bands created to maintain high morale on the battlefield, and with this concert in Kyiv, Laibach supports Ukraine and Ukrainians in their fight against Russian, and any other, aggression,” said the band's statement. 

            All proceeds raised from the Kyiv concert will be donated to charity and animal aid groups working in Ukraine, the statement added.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818625,Mets' Beltrán won't discuss role in Astros' cheating scandal,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. (AP) — Carlos Beltrán refused to discuss his role in the Houston Astros cheating scandal, preferring to concentrate on his new role with the New York Mets.

            “Today’s not about the Astros,” Beltrán said Wednesday. “Today is about the Mets.”

            Beltrán was hired by the Mets on Nov. 1, 2019, to replace Mickey Callaway as manager. But the team announced Beltrán’s departure the following Jan. 16 without him managing a game.











            Beltrán’s departure was announced three days after he was the only Astros player mentioned by name in Major League Baseball’s report that concluded that Houston broke rules by using electronics to steal signs en route to the 2017 World Series title.

            “I felt like that was a moment that needed to happen and I moved on,” Beltrán said.

            He joined the Mets last week as a special assistant to general manager Billy Eppler. Beltrán said he didn't expect to return.

            “No chance,” Beltrán said. “No clue. That’s how the world goes around. ... When this opportunity came, it was a no-brainer to say yes.""

            Beltrán received 46.5% of votes in his first Hall of Fame ballot appearance this year, well short of the needed 75%. His role in the scandal likely impacted voters.

            “I felt OK with it,” Beltrán said. “I know that I went through a moment in my career that was tough. I also know I had some fans and now I don’t have those fans anymore. But at the end of the day, I have to live my life. I have to move on.”

            Beltrán said several clubs offered him opportunities to be an on-field coach this season. He sees his new role as a bridge between players and the front office, helping players understand the pressure of playing in New York.

            “They test you, they push you, but most importantly they push you to be better,” Beltrán said.

            Beltrán wants to be the mentor he didn’t have when he coming through Kansas City’s system.

            “Because you didn’t have it, doesn’t mean you cannot give it,” Beltrán said. ""In my case I feel when you are in the minor league system you need love. You need people to care about you. That’s why I’m motivated. I’m motivated because I didn’t have that person, and I hope that I can be that person for those kids.”

            Now 45, the nine-time All-Star played with the Mets from 2005-11 and is sixth on the team’s career list for homers (149) and RBIs (559). Beltrán was the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year with Kansas City. He also played for San Francisco, St. Louis and the Yankees, finishing with a .279 average, 435 homers and 312 bases.

            Beltrán spent last season as a game analyst for the Yankees' YES Network.

            “That opportunity created this opportunity, because when you are in the game and you stay relevant, people get to see your face and get to see you around,"" he said. ""It’s hard for me to disappear for five years and say, ‘OK, I want to get back in the game.’ No chance. I would be a dinosaur. You have to speak the same language baseball is speaking today.”

            Beltrán wouldn’t rule out becoming a manager.

            “You can never say no when you love the game, and you love being around guys and being able to impact players and make careers better,” he said. “At this point I’m OK where I am, but later on I don’t know.”

""In my case I feel when you are in the minor league system you need love. You need people to care about you. That’s why I’m motivated. I’m motivated because I didn’t have that person, and I hope that I can be that person for those kids.”Now 45, the nine-time All-Star played with the Mets from 2005-11 and is sixth on the team’s career list for homers (149) and RBIs (559). Beltrán was the 1999 AL Rookie of the Year with Kansas City. He also played for San Francisco, St. Louis and the Yankees, finishing with a .279 average, 435 homers and 312 bases.Beltrán spent last season as a game analyst for the Yankees' YES Network.“That opportunity created this opportunity, because when you are in the game and you stay relevant, people get to see your face and get to see you around,"" he said. ""It’s hard for me to disappear for five years and say, ‘OK, I want to get back in the game.’ No chance. I would be a dinosaur. You have to speak the same language baseball is speaking today.”Beltrán wouldn’t rule out becoming a manager.“You can never say no when you love the game, and you love being around guys and being able to impact players and make careers better,” he said. “At this point I’m OK where I am, but later on I don’t know.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818626,Hawks GM Fields says Snyder a candidate to replace McMillan,"ATLANTA (AP) — Atlanta Hawks general manager Landry Fields said Wednesday former Utah coach Quin Snyder is among those being considered to replace Nate McMillan.

            The Hawks (29-30) fired McMillan on Tuesday. Fields stressed that Atlanta's eighth-place standing in the Eastern Conference is not acceptable for a team that advanced to the conference finals in 2021.

            Snyder, 56, was 372-264 as Utah's coach from 2014-22. He guided the Jazz to six consecutive playoff appearances before stepping down after last season.











            Fields said Snyder's availability “is a factor in the sense that I feel comfortable mentioning his name, but there are other candidates I don’t want to mention because they are a part of other teams.”

            Snyder was a Hawks assistant in 2013-14.

            Other possible candidates include Golden State assistant Kenny Atkinson and Milwaukee assistant Charles Lee, both former Atlanta assistants.

            Fields said he has started talking with potential candidates and could make a hire this season. Assistant coach Joe Prunty began serving as interim coach at practice Wednesday but may not be involved in the interview process for the full-time position.

            “To do this now, sort of last minute, there’s enough on Joe’s plate,” Fields said, adding that his message to Prunty is ""just focus on the task at hand and we’ll cover everything else later.”

            McMillan, 58, went 99-80 as Atlanta’s coach, including a 27-11 record as interim in the second half of the 2020-21 season. His success that season in leading Atlanta to the Eastern Conference finals earned him the full-time position.

            The Hawks are hoping for a similar late-season revival under Prunty, but players say consistency and accountability must improve.

            “It ain't on Nate McMillan,” guard Dejounte Murray said after practice. “We've all got to look in the mirror.”

            Added center Clint Capela: “It's on all of us. ... Consistency, we just have to be better.”

            McMillan couldn't follow up on the 2021 success. The Hawks lost to Miami in the first round of the playoffs last season after surviving the play-in tournament.

            Hawks forward John Collins said McMillan “was a great coach” but added “we need a different type of guidance” from the next coach.

            When asked if accountability from players was lacking under McMillan, Collins said, “Yeah, I definitely feel we can do a better job with that.”

            Prunty, who has been an NBA assistant coach since 1996, has previous experience as an interim coach. He posted a 21-16 record with Milwaukee after Jason Kidd was fired during the 2017-18 season.

            “It definitely helps, for sure, but every situation is different,” Prunty said. “... The reality is it's very difficult to make wholesale changes. There may be things that could be tweaked here and there.”

            Collins described Prunty as “a cool, calm coach, real relaxed.”

            “I feel we're all comfortable with Joe,” Collins said. “Hopefully, it can be a smooth transition.”

            Atlanta, which plays at home against Cleveland on Friday night, is struggling to remain in the top 10 in the conference for a return spot in the play-in field. The Hawks lost four of six games before the All-Star break and are only one game ahead of 10th-place Toronto in the East.

            Fields said he considered a coaching change for one month and was influenced by back-to-back losses to Charlotte and the New York Knicks before the break.

            “I do believe there was slippage and I felt that was a need we needed to address,” Fields said.

            Fields said he did not consult point guard Trae Young or other players before making the move. Fields said speculation that McMillan's efforts were affected by conflicts with Young were unfair to the player and were not a factor in his decision to make a coaching change.

            Young was not made available for interviews on Wednesday.

            Overall in 19 seasons, McMillan has a 760-668 record with the Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Hawks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818627,PGA Tour holding last Honda Classic as a new sponsor awaits,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Someone will be getting a big check this week at the Honda Classic.

            And then someone will be writing a big check to take over the Honda Classic.

            It’s expected that there will be a tournament at PGA National in 2024 and beyond, but this weekend will mark the last time someone wins the Honda. The automaker’s 42-year sponsorship — the longest-running continuous deal on the PGA Tour — ends with this event, and potential successors will be in Palm Beach Gardens to decide if they want to buy the naming rights.











            “It’s disappointing on many aspects of it,” Florida native Billy Horschel said. “I’m sort of disappointed in the PGA Tour in the sense that — I’m not going to say they didn’t prioritize the Honda Classic, they prioritize every sponsor that we have. ... But, you know, when I was out on tour early in my career, this was this was a hot event. I mean, you had all-top 20 players in the world playing here.”

            This week’s event has three top-20 players — No. 18 Sungjae Im, Horschel is ranked 19th and No. 20 Shane Lowry. Scheduling has been a challenge for Honda for years; it was preceded by the Phoenix Open and the Genesis Invitational, and gets followed by Bay Hill and The Players Championship.

            Those events all have $20 million purses, except for $25 million at The Players. Honda’s purse is $8.4 million.

            “This was an event to play at, and then unfortunately over the years, it’s sort of been relegated to not as strong a field anymore,” Horschel said.

            Changes are almost certainly coming, in more than just the name. The PGA Tour is trying to find a way for Honda to attract bigger names, and a schedule tweak is expected for next year.

            “You’ve got 30 to 40 PGA Tour pros that live within a couple miles of this place, and I think you’ve only got a handful of them playing this week, and that’s disappointing,” Horschel said. “It really is.”

            There is much to like. The Honda traditionally draws plenty of fans to PGA National, with a total attendance in recent years — except for the pandemic-limited tournament — going just over 200,000.

            Fans show up. The world’s highest-ranked golfers, not so much.

            “Do I worry for it? I don’t know,” Lowry said. “Next year, I think hopefully the schedule is going to be a little bit different. It is going to be a little bit different. I don’t know what it is going to be like yet. But hopefully it can be in a nice date because look, I think this is a proper test. It’s a proper championship golf course, and it deserves a good field.”

            First, though, comes the finding of a new sponsor. There’s no timetable to get that done, with the tour aiming for something to be finalized in the next few weeks.

            “It’s a combination of sponsors and potential sponsors that we’ve talked to over a period of time, trying to find a good fit for them,” said Andy Pazder, chief competitions and tournaments officer for the PGA Tour. “And then in other instances, it’s companies that know that this sponsorship opportunity exists and they come to us and they say, ‘We’d like to learn more.’ We have several active conversations going on. We’re hosting, I’ll just say, a few of those prospects this week.”

            When Honda took over as title sponsor in 1982, the purse was $400,000, with $72,000 going to the winner. That’s a $1.2 million purse in today’s dollars, with a winner’s take of about $225,000.

            Much has changed.

            Sunday’s winner gets $1.512 million. The Honda — since it’s been called the Honda — has been played on six different courses, with 39 different winners in the 41 years of that sponsorship. Padraig Harrington and Mark Calcavecchia each won the Honda twice; Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller have won the tournament twice but not in the Honda era.

            Sepp Straka is the last person to have a chance to win multiple Hondas. He’s the defending champion, tapping in for birdie on the 72nd hole after getting to tee off on the par-5 18th just before a downpour came. Lowry rushed his tee shot into the deluge and finished a shot back.

            “It was pretty fun to kind of relive some of those shots and just kind of be back here where it all happened,” Straka said. “It was a great time.”

            DIVOTS: Harrington will play the first two rounds at PGA National — site of the 1983 Ryder Cup — with Luke Donald and Zach Johnson. Harrington was Europe’s Ryder Cup captain in 2021; Donald and Johnson will be captains for Europe and the U.S. this year. ... Twin brothers Pierceson Coody and Parker Coody are in the field, Pierceson on a sponsor exemption, Parker after getting through a Monday qualifier (that ended on Tuesday). They’re the grandsons of 1971 Masters champion Charles Coody, and their dad will caddie for Parker this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818630,"Rio Carnival's overlooked, all-important rite: The count","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Rio de Janeiro couldn’t resume regular life after the Carnival festivities came to a close until “the count” of scores from the parade competition was complete and a victor proclaimed.

            The Carnival parade is billed as the world’s biggest party, yet scarcely anyone outside Brazil realizes that the flashy floats and extravagant dancers are more than spectacle. It has complex, constantly changing regulations and dozens of judges. In recent years, the samba school league has adopted changes to limit subjectivity, but skepticism about scoring remains — not least because of its checkered past.

            And the hopes of entire working-class communities ride on the outcome. On Wednesday, they flocked to their respective schools to watch the televised results. A win affirms their diligent work was executed to perfection, bestowing honor and prestige.











            “It’s the pleasure of doing the parade correctly and the satisfaction of taking the title home,” Maria da Conceição da Silva, 59, said Monday night before parading. She swears she’ll keep coming back “until God takes me, to parade up there.”

            The esoteric regulations dictate schools be scored on nine categories — among them costumes, drumming, song, harmony, plot and evolution — that together quantify the months of design, stitching, sculpting, welding and rehearsal that go into production. Judges with proven knowledge in each category undergo training, then are distributed along the 700-meter (2,300-foot) parade route to watch as each school’s several thousand paraders pass.

            Rio’s samba schools began competing in the 1930s, and were corralled into the Sambadrome parade grounds in the mid-1980s. Their 70-minute displays can cost 10 million reais (almost $2 million), and the school that scores lowest is relegated to the lower league. Returning to the elite echelon can take years.

            The top six finishers get percentages of box office revenue. But only the champion school goes down in history, and no one remembers the runner-up, said Jorge Perlingeiro, the president of the top league. 

            For over three decades, Perlingeiro has been the voice of Carnival, announcing judges’ scores one by one. Each bellow of “10!” — the top score — with his heavy Rio accent launched the schools’ fanatics into ecstasy Wednesday. Some lower scores elicited frustrated groans. More than half of Rio’s televisions were tuned in, according to Ibope, a company that monitors ratings.

            The ceremony lasted about 90 minutes, with no less than 432 scores read aloud for 12 schools. The winning school, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, achieved 269.8 — two-tenths of a point shy of perfect. The title ends the school’s 22-year drought and cements its Carnival director’s star reputation. At the Sambadrome, the school’s drum leader crumpled and cried when the win was announced while a packed crowd at the school jumped for joy.

            The large number of judges — 36 — is necessary to assess performance throughout the parade grounds and prevents a single bad score from torpedoing a school, according to Fábio Fabato, who writes and researches Carnival and Brazilian popular culture. It also helps curb corruption, he said, because it’s harder to buy off many judges. 

            In 1974, samba school Mocidade lost the title because one costume judge handed down an inexplicably low score of 4, Fabato said. In 1986, Brazilian soccer legend Socrátes was selected to judge drums, but had zero expertise, so he rated schools based solely on crowd reaction. Samba schools were furious. One school’s president said Socrátes was too drunk to judge and demanded that his scores be annulled. 

            “He (Socrátes) skipped down the stairs to the parade ground, stripped off his top and started dancing along in a pair of tight white shorts. Officials objected and he was reluctantly coaxed back to the judging station,” according to his biography, “Doctor Socrates.”

            The count two years later sparked a vicious fight between rival schools and a 16-year-old girl was shot in the stomach, according to an O Globo newspaper report at the time.

            David Butter, a Brazilian journalist who wrote a book on Carnival, remembers as a child watching the count with his father, who enjoyed it even more than the parade.

            “We would get the newspaper with the empty scorecard to fill as the count went forward. We were all excited about the scores, the disagreements,” Butter said. “The count became a spectacle in itself, just like an opera. It is an exclusively Brazilian entertainment product.”

            Other competitions have struggled with subjective scoring. Olympic figure skating had been rated from 1 to 6 until a judging scandal at the games in Salt Lake City — known as “Skate Gate” — prompted adoption of an elaborate system involving a technical panel. More recently, an investigation found multiple boxing matches were fixed at the 2016 Olympic games in Rio.

            That same year, Rio police probed alleged fraud in Carnival judging. Greater technical rigor and professionalism were meant to head off disputes and provide transparency. Judges must justify any less-than-perfect score with a handwritten explanation. 

            One judge evaluating costumes last year docked one-tenth of a point from a school because “a considerable quantity of paraders’ hats were slipping or fallen,” and she noted another school had promised to deliver “a diversity of green tones,” though only lime green prevailed. A harmony judge noted “occasional loss of internal homogeneity” and that “the neglect or weakening of some voices emptied the song of its sonic mass.”

            On a scorecard last year, one judge noted how hard it has become to find errors when so few are committed, so just one-tenth of a point can clinch a victory. This year’s runner-up finished one-tenth behind.

            If a gap appears between sections, the school can lose points. In this year’s parade, the lighthouse atop Unidos da Tijuca’s float was knocked severely askew, which cost them. 

            Starting last year, judges’ justifications are posted online within 48 hours. And cameras inside judges' booths record what they can see, so schools can review footage and compare to the judges’ notes for inconsistencies. If any are found, schools can petition for a judge’s removal. 

            In interviews with two dozen paraders on Monday night, about half said they think judges’ determinations still reflect some undue influence. But most acknowledged scoring has improved with each passing year. 

            “They are trying to organize, so the competition happens only on the avenue, but there’s a lot still happening behind the scenes. Every samba dancer knows that,” Carol Tavares, 40, said Monday before parading with Unidos da Tijuca. “It’s on the path toward changing.”

            Perlingeiro noted an ineffable quality also factors into the judging. 

            “The category that doesn’t exist, but exists in everyone’s mind, is emotion. It happens when you see the crowd cheering, waving. The judge sees that and, in a certain way, is captivated, too,” he said. “That has an influence.”

            Members of rival schools at the Sambadrome clapped appreciatively after Perlingeiro announced the winner. The president of Mangueira, Rio’s most popular school and a fan favorite, finished fifth on Wednesday, told the AP she was happy with the judges’ recognition of her school’s hard work. Asked if their scores were fair, the president, Guanayra Firmino, demurred.

            “With their justifications, I’ll do my analysis if it was fair or not. I can’t say that yet,” said Firmino.

            AP writer Mauricio Savarese contributed.RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Rio de Janeiro couldn’t resume regular life after the Carnival festivities came to a close until “the count” of scores from the parade competition was complete and a victor proclaimed.The Carnival parade is billed as the world’s biggest party, yet scarcely anyone outside Brazil realizes that the flashy floats and extravagant dancers are more than spectacle. It has complex, constantly changing regulations and dozens of judges. In recent years, the samba school league has adopted changes to limit subjectivity, but skepticism about scoring remains — not least because of its checkered past.And the hopes of entire working-class communities ride on the outcome. On Wednesday, they flocked to their respective schools to watch the televised results. A win affirms their diligent work was executed to perfection, bestowing honor and prestige.“It’s the pleasure of doing the parade correctly and the satisfaction of taking the title home,” Maria da Conceição da Silva, 59, said Monday night before parading. She swears she’ll keep coming back “until God takes me, to parade up there.”The esoteric regulations dictate schools be scored on nine categories — among them costumes, drumming, song, harmony, plot and evolution — that together quantify the months of design, stitching, sculpting, welding and rehearsal that go into production. Judges with proven knowledge in each category undergo training, then are distributed along the 700-meter (2,300-foot) parade route to watch as each school’s several thousand paraders pass.Rio’s samba schools began competing in the 1930s, and were corralled into the Sambadrome parade grounds in the mid-1980s. Their 70-minute displays can cost 10 million reais (almost $2 million), and the school that scores lowest is relegated to the lower league. Returning to the elite echelon can take years.The top six finishers get percentages of box office revenue. But only the champion school goes down in history, and no one remembers the runner-up, said Jorge Perlingeiro, the president of the top league.For over three decades, Perlingeiro has been the voice of Carnival, announcing judges’ scores one by one. Each bellow of “10!” — the top score — with his heavy Rio accent launched the schools’ fanatics into ecstasy Wednesday. Some lower scores elicited frustrated groans. More than half of Rio’s televisions were tuned in, according to Ibope, a company that monitors ratings.The ceremony lasted about 90 minutes, with no less than 432 scores read aloud for 12 schools. The winning school, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, achieved 269.8 — two-tenths of a point shy of perfect. The title ends the school’s 22-year drought and cements its Carnival director’s star reputation. At the Sambadrome, the school’s drum leader crumpled and cried when the win was announced while a packed crowd at the school jumped for joy.The large number of judges — 36 — is necessary to assess performance throughout the parade grounds and prevents a single bad score from torpedoing a school, according to Fábio Fabato, who writes and researches Carnival and Brazilian popular culture. It also helps curb corruption, he said, because it’s harder to buy off many judges.In 1974, samba school Mocidade lost the title because one costume judge handed down an inexplicably low score of 4, Fabato said. In 1986, Brazilian soccer legend Socrátes was selected to judge drums, but had zero expertise, so he rated schools based solely on crowd reaction. Samba schools were furious. One school’s president said Socrátes was too drunk to judge and demanded that his scores be annulled.“He (Socrátes) skipped down the stairs to the parade ground, stripped off his top and started dancing along in a pair of tight white shorts. Officials objected and he was reluctantly coaxed back to the judging station,” according to his biography, “Doctor Socrates.”The count two years later sparked a vicious fight between rival schools and a 16-year-old girl was shot in the stomach, according to an O Globo newspaper report at the time.David Butter, a Brazilian journalist who wrote a book on Carnival, remembers as a child watching the count with his father, who enjoyed it even more than the parade.“We would get the newspaper with the empty scorecard to fill as the count went forward. We were all excited about the scores, the disagreements,” Butter said. “The count became a spectacle in itself, just like an opera. It is an exclusively Brazilian entertainment product.”Other competitions have struggled with subjective scoring. Olympic figure skating had been rated from 1 to 6 until a judging scandal at the games in Salt Lake City — known as “Skate Gate” — prompted adoption of an elaborate system involving a technical panel. More recently, an investigation found multiple boxing matches were fixed at the 2016 Olympic games in Rio.That same year, Rio police probed alleged fraud in Carnival judging. Greater technical rigor and professionalism were meant to head off disputes and provide transparency. Judges must justify any less-than-perfect score with a handwritten explanation.One judge evaluating costumes last year docked one-tenth of a point from a school because “a considerable quantity of paraders’ hats were slipping or fallen,” and she noted another school had promised to deliver “a diversity of green tones,” though only lime green prevailed. A harmony judge noted “occasional loss of internal homogeneity” and that “the neglect or weakening of some voices emptied the song of its sonic mass.”On a scorecard last year, one judge noted how hard it has become to find errors when so few are committed, so just one-tenth of a point can clinch a victory. This year’s runner-up finished one-tenth behind.If a gap appears between sections, the school can lose points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818631,"Amid probe, Kansas lawmakers move to overhaul ethics agency","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Kansas' ethics commission has been investigating Republican campaign activities for at least a year, and the GOP-controlled Legislature is moving to reduce the agency's power and legalize practices apparently under scrutiny.

            Republicans backing a bill to overhaul the state Governmental Ethics Commission and rewrite campaign finance laws said Wednesday they're trying to ensure fair treatment of the people and groups scrutinized by the commission. But lawmakers drafted this year's measure amid a court battle over the commission's demand for documents from Kansas Republican Party officials, and critics see the bill as an effort to kneecap the agency. 

            Documents filed in court over subpoenas issued by the commission indicate that it has been investigating whether Republicans funneled national GOP funds through various committees to legislative candidates in 2020 to avoid contribution limits. One commission report made public in October includes transactions involving Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, both Wichita-area Republicans, before they took over those offices. The report does not specifically allege wrongdoing by them, however, and the commission has yet to file any complaints over such issues.











            It was not lost on the bill's older critics that this year marks the 50th anniversary of investigations into Watergate, the political dirty tricks and obstruction of justice scandal that later forced then-President Richard Nixon to resign. Those scandals prompted Kansas lawmakers to create the ethics commission and enact campaign, lobbying and ethics laws. 

            “Perhaps we’ve forgotten what happens when government runs amok in the darkness of the night,” said Democratic state Rep. John Carmichael, of Wichita, a lawyer in his mid-60s.

            Republicans argue that the ethics commission is engaged in an unwarranted fishing expedition and lawmakers need to see that people's right to due legal process is protected.

            Masterson told reporters earlier this month that the commission had asked about his communications but “they’ve since dropped that.” Hawkins said Wednesday that he has not been subpoenaed.

            “It’s like you’re guilty until proven innocent, like you’re guilty of something. I didn’t do anything,” Masterson said. “I’m not worried about any of it.”

            The GOP-dominated House Elections Committee approved the bill Tuesday on an 8-4 party-line vote, sending it to the full House for a debate as early as this week.

            Committee Chair Pat Proctor, a Kansas City-area Republican, said Wednesday that because the bill is not retroactive, it wouldn't interfere with the commission's current investigation. He argued that money represents speech when it’s used for political purposes, making the ethics commission an agency that regulates speech, so that warrants scrutiny.

            “It’s a spurious argument that we are not allowed to talk about ethics because there may or may not be some investigation going on,” Proctor said. 

            This year's bill would limit commission fines and require the commission to get a state district court judge's permission to issue a subpoena. A judge could sanction the commission for subpoenas deemed to create “an undue burden or expense” and the subjects of complaints could have their hearings handled by an outside administrative judge instead of the commission. 

            It would no longer be illegal in most instances for one donor to give money to a person or group specifically to pass along to the first donor's favored candidate — making it easier to evade contribution limits. Restrictions would be removed on candidates funneling contributions meant for their campaigns to other candidates, party groups or political action committees.

            Critics say such changes would render the state's campaign finance laws meaningless. After the bill cleared committee, Skoglund told reporters the measure “stands exactly for the premise that if you are powerful enough, you just change the law to make what you are doing legal.”

            State Rep. Cindy Neighbor, a Kansas City-area Democrat, said Wednesday, “This to me is more of a witch hunt and trying to tear down something because I didn't like the outcome.” 

            In February 2020, the commission issued subpoenas to at least seven Kansas Republican Party officials, seeking all communications — including emails, texts and social media messages — between them and at least 20 other people, including Masterson, for the last seven months of 2020. 

            In April, a Kansas Chamber of Commerce lobbyist told reporters the group also had received a subpoena. His disclosure came as GOP lawmakers sought for a few hours to rewrite laws organizing the commission so that Skoglund no longer would be qualified for his job. 

            In August, the commission went to state district court in Shawnee County, home to Kansas' capital of Topeka, to get subpoenas enforced. An attorney for several recipients made theirs public, along with the commission's related “Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.”

            In late December, a judge heard arguments on quashing the subpoenas and she indicated from the bench that she was considering whether they were too broad. She had not ruled as of Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818637,"Alex Murdaugh law partner talks crime scene problems, thefts","A former law partner of Alex Murdaugh testified at his double murder trial Wednesday that more than a dozen people walked around the scene of the killings of Murdaugh's wife and son before state-level law enforcement arrived.

            After South Carolina agents arrived, they sent Murdaugh, his law partners and friends into the sprawling property's home, which authorities hadn't entered since Murdaugh called 911 an hour earlier to say his wife and son were shot.

            “This is a pretty big farm and I don’t know who is over there. Two people have been gunned down,” attorney Mark Ball testified. “Safety is one concern. And is that house part of what has gone on here? Where does the crime scene start and stop?”











            While the defense had Ball highlight what he saw as problems at the crime scene and Murdaugh’s devotion to family, prosecutors on cross examination used Ball to walk through Murdaugh’s apparent lies to police. Those allegedly include where he was just before the killings, his lack of concern for his safety or his surviving son after the shootings, and the theft of millions of dollars from the family law firm.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the deaths of his wife Maggie, 52, who was felled by four or five rifle shots, and their 22-year-old son Paul, killed by two shotgun blasts. Both died near kennels on the Colleton County property on June 7, 2021. Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

            Alex Murdaugh may testify. Defense attorney Jim Griffin asked the judge Wednesday if he would allow Murdaugh to take his Fifth Amendment right against incriminating himself in the 100 or so other allegations he faces — including stealing from clients, money laundering, tax evasion and insurance fraud. The defense said he could testify as early as Thursday if he chooses to do so.

            Judge Clifton Newman said prosecutors generally get wide latitude in cross examination.

            The judge agreed with prosecutors to allow evidence of other alleged crimes to show Murdaugh killed his family to gain sympathy and buy time to hide his financial misdeeds. Prosecutors also want to show Murdaugh lied to police about his own subsequent shooting months afterward. He initially said a stranger shot him, but later said he asked a friend to shoot him so Murdaugh's surviving son could collect $12 million in life insurance.

            Ball, who arrived at the farm about 45 minutes after Murdaugh called 911, was a compelling witness for both sides Wednesday. 

            He described a chaotic crime scene. Police hadn't blocked the property's entrance and more than a dozen people not with law enforcement were walking around shell casings and pools of blood. A light rain fell intermittently and the runoff from a roof was hitting Paul Murdaugh's body.

            “It’s a crime scene. You don’t want water dripping all over the place but more importantly, I thought it was pretty disrespectful. Paul was a good young man and quite frankly it just pissed me off,"" Ball testified.

            Ball returned the next day once state agents said they were finished investigating the scene. He found uncollected shotgun pellets, small clumps of tissue and a large fragment of Paul Murdaugh's skull.

            “It infuriated me,” Ball said. “It was kind of like walking across a grave.”

            The defense called a crime scene reconstruction expert who said the police might have lost evidence.

            Kenneth Zercie testified that police should have used a tarp to cover the bodies instead of a sheet, which can absorb fluids. Zercie said agents made it worse by not holding onto the sheet, losing potential evidence such as hair or DNA from the killer.

            The agents didn't look for fingerprints and didn't test the blood around either body for anyone else's DNA, the expert said. “Much more could have been done."" 

            A cell phone data expert testified Wednesday that a possible time Maggie Murdaugh's phone could have been tossed — it was found beside a highway near the family's property — does not sync with when GPS data showed Alex Murdaugh's SUV passing by.

            Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone recorded that its backlight turned off at 9:07 p.m. the night of the killings and her husband's SUV is still in the driveway a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, Micah Sturgis said. The SUV didn't pass the spot where his wife's cellphone was found for nearly two minutes.

            Phone backlights typically turn on when the phone detects a small amount of motion. Maggie Murdaugh's phone light was off for the next 25 minutes, indicating it was still, Sturgis said.

            Prosecutors used Alex Murdaugh's former law partner to re-state their case. They had Ball read a list of several legal clients he had to call to tell them Alex Murdaugh lied and stole their money. Those clients were repaid with millions of dollars out of the pockets of the firm's other attorneys, Ball said.

            Ball testified he was certain he heard Murdaugh’s voice on a cellphone video along with his wife and son, played earlier in court. Phone records indicate the video was taken about five minutes before Maggie and Paul Murdaugh stopped using their phones forever.

            Ball said Murdaugh told him at least three times he was not at the kennels that night, instead taking a nap before leaving to visit his ailing mother. Murdaugh said he discovered the shooting when he returned.

            Murdaugh and Ball knew each other for 34 years and worked together for decades. Ball said Murdaugh appeared to be a loving father, a good lawyer who could talk to anyone and a man whose finances were solid.

            “He was pretty good at hiding who he really was, wasn't he?"" prosecutor Creighton Waters asked.

            “Obviously,” Ball replied.A former law partner of Alex Murdaugh testified at his double murder trial Wednesday that more than a dozen people walked around the scene of the killings of Murdaugh's wife and son before state-level law enforcement arrived.After South Carolina agents arrived, they sent Murdaugh, his law partners and friends into the sprawling property's home, which authorities hadn't entered since Murdaugh called 911 an hour earlier to say his wife and son were shot.“This is a pretty big farm and I don’t know who is over there.

A light rain fell intermittently and the runoff from a roof was hitting Paul Murdaugh's body.“It’s a crime scene. You don’t want water dripping all over the place but more importantly, I thought it was pretty disrespectful. Paul was a good young man and quite frankly it just pissed me off,"" Ball testified.Ball returned the next day once state agents said they were finished investigating the scene. He found uncollected shotgun pellets, small clumps of tissue and a large fragment of Paul Murdaugh's skull.“It infuriated me,” Ball said. “It was kind of like walking across a grave.”The defense called a crime scene reconstruction expert who said the police might have lost evidence.Kenneth Zercie testified that police should have used a tarp to cover the bodies instead of a sheet, which can absorb fluids. Zercie said agents made it worse by not holding onto the sheet, losing potential evidence such as hair or DNA from the killer.The agents didn't look for fingerprints and didn't test the blood around either body for anyone else's DNA, the expert said. “Much more could have been done.""A cell phone data expert testified Wednesday that a possible time Maggie Murdaugh's phone could have been tossed — it was found beside a highway near the family's property — does not sync with when GPS data showed Alex Murdaugh's SUV passing by.Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone recorded that its backlight turned off at 9:07 p.m. the night of the killings and her husband's SUV is still in the driveway a quarter-mile (400 meters) away, Micah Sturgis said. The SUV didn't pass the spot where his wife's cellphone was found for nearly two minutes.Phone backlights typically turn on when the phone detects a small amount of motion. Maggie Murdaugh's phone light was off for the next 25 minutes, indicating it was still, Sturgis said.Prosecutors used Alex Murdaugh's former law partner to re-state their case. They had Ball read a list of several legal clients he had to call to tell them Alex Murdaugh lied and stole their money. Those clients were repaid with millions of dollars out of the pockets of the firm's other attorneys, Ball said.Ball testified he was certain he heard Murdaugh’s voice on a cellphone video along with his wife and son, played earlier in court. Phone records indicate the video was taken about five minutes before Maggie and Paul Murdaugh stopped using their phones forever.Ball said Murdaugh told him at least three times he was not at the kennels that night, instead taking a nap before leaving to visit his ailing mother. Murdaugh said he discovered the shooting when he returned.Murdaugh and Ball knew each other for 34 years and worked together for decades. Ball said Murdaugh appeared to be a loving father, a good lawyer who could talk to anyone and a man whose finances were solid.“He was pretty good at hiding who he really was, wasn't he?"" prosecutor Creighton Waters asked.“Obviously,” Ball replied.",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818638,Abbey Hsu puts Columbia on road for first Ivy title,"NEW YORK (AP) — Abbey Hsu has Columbia well on its way to a first-ever Ivy League championship in women's basketball.

            A junior guard from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Hsu has helped the Lions go 63-21 since joining the team in 2019, equaling the win total of the previous eight years combined. Before that, Columbia had posted just one winning season in the previous 33 years. 

            Hsu had a career-best 35 points in Columbia's 75-70 win over Harvard last Friday night. A win over Dartmouth the next day gave the Lions a 21-4 record and left them tied with Princeton atop the league standings. Those wins also gave Columbia 12 road victories on the season, tied for first in the country with No. 1 South Carolina and No. 15 Villanova.











            Columbia, which earned votes in the AP poll for the first time ever this season, controls its own destiny and wins over Brown on Saturday and at home against Cornell a week later will assure the Lions at least a share of their first Ivy League regular-season crown.

            “That's been a goal since I've walked on campus,” Hsu said of winning the Ivy title. “I think all the years leading up to this one are necessary steps that we had to take. We had to take some losses and we had to learn from those losses.”

            Columbia lost in the finals of the Ivy Tournament last year to Princeton, which went on to reach the second round of the NCAAs before falling by a point at Indiana. The Lions advanced to the quarterfinals of the WNIT and Hsu was a big reason why. She set the Ivy League record with 108 3-pointers last season. She's currently in fourth place on the conference's career 3-point list and could finish the season in second.

            Through all the success, it hasn't been a easy few years for Hsu, who is third on Columbia's career scoring list. Before coming to Columbia, she was at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the school shooting occurred five years ago.

            She was in one of the buildings on the school's campus when the tragedy occurred and heard the gunshots. The anniversary of the shooting was last week. Whenever Hsu sees there's been a mass shooting at a school, such as the one at Michigan State last week, it brings up memories of what happened in Florida.

            “It just doesn't really make sense,” she said. “You go through something like that and it keeps happening almost like it's kind of scooted under the rug. I mean the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. There definitely has to be big steps in that direction regulation-wise. I don't know the exact answer, but obviously what we're doing is not working. There's too many lives lost.""

            Tragedy didn't end there for Hsu. When the pandemic cut Columbia's season short, she returned home. A short time later her father Alex, who was an internist, caught COVID-19 and became the first South Florida medical professional to die from the disease.

            Hsu stayed home for a year because there was no basketball season when the Ivy League canceled sports in the 2020-21 school year. Being home gave her time to grieve and heal. 

            “To go through that there is no right time,” Hsu said. “But because of COVID I was able to be home and be present with my family and had time to reflect.” 

            Through all the heartache, Hsu has persevered. crediting her father for her hardworking attitude.

            “This is part of who she is,” Columbia coach Megan Griffith said. “Pre tragedies, post tragedies. I think it has made her more who she is and for her to be able to embrace adversity and hardship and come out on the other end of it stronger, tougher. It's a true testament to her character and to the character she has and that her family has bestowed upon her. She's one of the toughest kids I ever coached.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818641,"Diesel, Fendi, No. 21 show some skin at Milan Fashion Week","MILAN (AP) — Sexiness is in the air at Milan Fashion Week, where brands are encouraging people to show some skin next fall and winter. 

            Whether they have global warming in mind, warm outerwear or are just thinking skimpy dressing for crowded, overheated parties — because, yes, we are doing that again — the invitation to intimacy is on the table. 

            Here are some highlights from the first day of Milan Fashion Week mostly womenswear previews on Wednesday:











            DIVERSITY CELEBRATED ON THE FASHION WEEK FRINGE

            A party highlighting the new faces of multicultural Milan spilled out into a piazza as one of Milan's hippest boutiques celebrated 12 designers of color living and working in Italy.

            ""This is better than a runway show, because they are getting straight to buyers,'' said Edward Buchanan, an African American designer working in Italy for 26 years who has helped bring up the We Are Made in Italy (WAMI) project. 

            WAMI dropped off the official calendar this season when another founder, Italian-Haitian designer Stella Jean, also quit fashion week to protest what she sees as a lack of commitment to diversity and inclusion. But as fashion week got under way, everyone wanted to put the friction behind them and look to the next step. 

            In a show of good will, the president of Italy's National Chamber of Fashion, Carlo Capasa, showed up for the event at the Modes boutique, which featured 12 WAMI designers in the store windows. 

            They included raffia bags by Eileen Akbaraly's Made For A Woman brand, that works with more than 300 artisans, many from underprivileged backgrounds, in Madagascar. 

            ""I'm just riding the new energy. In fashion, you always have to be flexible,'' said Akbaraly, whose brand is collaborating with French house Chloe on a raffia hat coming out next month. 

            BLANC SPACES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED DESIGNERS

            The founder of the U.S. publication Blanc Magazine launched a new project during Milan Fashion Week that she said aims to give ""underrepresented, incredibly talented designers a place to be seen and heard. To sell. To sell.”

            Called Blanc Spaces, the new project by Blanc Magazine founder Teneshia Carr, in partnership with Stefano Tonchi, intends to help creatives of color and across genders connect with major fashion brands and retailers, a sort of talent matchmaker. Carr showcased three at the CNMI's fashion Hub. 

            Milan-trained Rachel Scott works with artisans in her native Jamaica to create crocheted detailing on garments for her Diotima brand and she recalls the diaspora tradition of sending back European textiles by making them central to the looks.

            ""I want to show crocheting in a luxury context to show that luxury doesn't only come from Europe,'' she said. She also is helping to revive the tradition, with beautiful starched crocheted tops that spiral out of a central point, like a web, and panels sewn into jackets or dresses allowing skin to show. 

             Patience Torlowei moved her eponymous brand from Belgium, where she learned her trade, back to her native Nigeria because she wanted to bring both knowledge and technology back to Africa. Her luxury brand features custom lace detailing along with bursts of color, with a strong link to Torlowei's love of lingerie. 

            ""We are an African brand, for a global market,'' Torlowei said. 

            Aaron Potts, who showed NYC-inspired glam and Detroit-inspired utilitarian looks from his A.Potts brand, said after working for other fashion houses he appreciates that he can now hire people who don’t fit into the classic fashion world mold.

            “We are an incredibly diverse group. That’s how the magic happens,″ said Potts. “You cannot have a monolith of experiences and histories. It takes the magic of everyone’s experience to make something relevant in the modern world.″ 

            DIESEL PROMOTES SEX POSITIVITY

            Glenn Martens is promoting sex positivity with his new collection for denim-centric brand Diesel.

            Models walked around a mound of 200,000 Durex condom boxes, underlining a safe-sex message but also a capsule collection with the condom brand that is set to drop in April. As part of the campaign, Diesel plans to give away 300,000 boxes of condoms in stores around the world. 

            Martens has had fun and success while redefining Diesel. The Diesel handbag with an elongated D motif has become a Gen-Z must-have.

            Denim drove the collection previewed in Milan, which had a furtive, run-for-cover feel and included garments that were torn, distressed, shredded, and seemingly torched. The treatments speak to survival, making it through some scrapes and living to tell the tale. 

            Denim was interspersed with sheer panels, some in risque positions, worn with fading Diesel T-shirts. On the feminine side, there were slinky, silken looks fastened with sexy chains. On the masculine, there were oversized hoodies, or a well-worn gray pinstripe jacket and trousers, permanently showing their creases. This season's motto could be: Wear-and-tear included. 

            The mismatched boss and assistant from Season 2 or the TV series “White Lotus” made a front-row appearance, with Haley Lu Richardson, who played the assistant, Portia, sitting next to drag queen Alexis Stone, dressed to impersonate Jennifer Coolidge. 

            “Nothing beats the original,’’ Stone quipped. 

            Richardson’s Portia, assistant to Coolidge’s Tanya McQuoid, ignited the internet with her off-beat wardrobe choices.

            “I think they loved to hate it,’’ said Richardson, swathed in a stretch Diesel sheer dress she described as comfy, sexy pajamas. “You know what, if it gets people talking …” 

            BREAKING CLICHE'S AT No. 21

            Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s No. 21 collection looked pulled from an attic chest, treasures that recall a sultry past, re-imagined for a sexy present. 

            That gray cardigan is worn backwards, left open at the top to show some skin and fastened with a scorpion pin. The silhouette is tight, pencil skirts with sequins or in gold brocade, or silky slip dresses worn invitingly unadorned, with just a set of pearls. 

            The looks are simple, with a whiff of nostalgia that is quickly dispersed by the ultra-modern touches: the bodices of dresses hang down, revealing a slip top; zippers of dressers are left slightly undone, to reveal a tattoo. 

            ""I wanted to take cliches, and transform them,'' the designer said back stage. 

            Breaking with tradition, Dell’Acqua closed the show without playing his traditional Pat Benatar battle hymn “Love is a Battlefield,” instead allowing the models to walk only to the sound of applause. Benatar's “Love is a Battlefield,'' however, blasted for the designer’s final bow. 

            DEL CORE'S BLOOMING FASHION LANDSCAPE

            Deep in the northern Alaska wilderness blooms the sunburst lichen that stands at the heart of Daniel Del Core’s latest collection for his eponymous brand, a tightly edited streamlined mix of ready-to-wear and couture that play neatly off each other. 

            ""Its as if an explorer entered a forest and allowed himself to be contaminated by nature,'' Del Core said backstage. 

            The collection has an air of mystery. Jacket shoulders can be unfastened, to reveal shoulders; garters over shoes suggest the explorer; dresses drape and reveal; puffy coats are worn off the shoulder, like a wrap; sheer ribbed knits cross cross over the body, revealing the shape. 

            Finally, the disciplined black and white color palette bursts with the sunburst lichen, recreated with embroidered fabric in mossy green with pinks and rusts. 

            Seven of the looks were couture pieces, including a an off-shoulder floor length dress in the lichen burst fabric, contrasted with a latex shoulders, for a slightly fetish flourish, and a intricately woven body-wrapping plisse gown. 

            FENDI'S TWISTED CHIC

            Fendi models walked down a tunnel of blue light, which cast a spectrum on metallic heels and along garment hems, creating little rainbows to go. 

            The collection by Kim Jones took classic pieces and gave them literal or figurative twists. Cardigans twisted around the neck. A knit scarf functioned as a half sweater over a lacey top or dress. Garments appeared doubled, vests had another built over top, thrown off as if a cape; skirts were built in over trousers, and jackets into skirts. 

            Fendi called it “the lens of subtle subversions.”

            Baby blue knits contrast with dark leather skirts or jumpers, laced boots that hitch at the knee — combinations that Jones said were inspired by Delfina Delettrez Fendi, the brand's jewelry designer. Nowhere was the Fendi craftsmanship more on display than in leather dresses that were tailored with the softness of silk, hugging the body along a sweeping curves. 

            Donatella Versace was an unexpected guest in the first row, giving the collection a standing ovation.MILAN (AP) — Sexiness is in the air at Milan Fashion Week, where brands are encouraging people to show some skin next fall and winter.Whether they have global warming in mind, warm outerwear or are just thinking skimpy dressing for crowded, overheated parties — because, yes, we are doing that again — the invitation to intimacy is on the table.Here are some highlights from the first day of Milan Fashion Week mostly womenswear previews on Wednesday:DIVERSITY CELEBRATED ON THE FASHION WEEK FRINGEA party highlighting the new faces of multicultural Milan spilled out into a piazza as one of Milan's hippest boutiques celebrated 12 designers of color living and working in Italy.""This is better than a runway show, because they are getting straight to buyers,'' said Edward Buchanan, an African American designer working in Italy for 26 years who has helped bring up the We Are Made in Italy (WAMI) project.WAMI dropped off the official calendar this season when another founder, Italian-Haitian designer Stella Jean, also quit fashion week to protest what she sees as a lack of commitment to diversity and inclusion. But as fashion week got under way, everyone wanted to put the friction behind them and look to the next step.In a show of good will, the president of Italy's National Chamber of Fashion, Carlo Capasa, showed up for the event at the Modes boutique, which featured 12 WAMI designers in the store windows.They included raffia bags by Eileen Akbaraly's Made For A Woman brand, that works with more than 300 artisans, many from underprivileged backgrounds, in Madagascar.""I'm just riding the new energy. In fashion, you always have to be flexible,'' said Akbaraly, whose brand is collaborating with French house Chloe on a raffia hat coming out next month.BLANC SPACES FOR UNDERREPRESENTED DESIGNERSThe founder of the U.S. publication Blanc Magazine launched a new project during Milan Fashion Week that she said aims to give ""underrepresented, incredibly talented designers a place to be seen and heard. To sell. To sell.”Called Blanc Spaces, the new project by Blanc Magazine founder Teneshia Carr, in partnership with Stefano Tonchi, intends to help creatives of color and across genders connect with major fashion brands and retailers, a sort of talent matchmaker. Carr showcased three at the CNMI's fashion Hub.Milan-trained Rachel Scott works with artisans in her native Jamaica to create crocheted detailing on garments for her Diotima brand and she recalls the diaspora tradition of sending back European textiles by making them central to the looks.""I want to show crocheting in a luxury context to show that luxury doesn't only come from Europe,'' she said. She also is helping to revive the tradition, with beautiful starched crocheted tops that spiral out of a central point, like a web, and panels sewn into jackets or dresses allowing skin to show.Patience Torlowei moved her eponymous brand from Belgium, where she learned her trade, back to her native Nigeria because she wanted to bring both knowledge and technology back to Africa. Her luxury brand features custom lace detailing along with bursts of color, with a strong link to Torlowei's love of lingerie.""We are an African brand, for a global market,'' Torlowei said.Aaron Potts, who showed NYC-inspired glam and Detroit-inspired utilitarian looks from his A.Potts brand, said after working for other fashion houses he appreciates that he can now hire people who don’t fit into the classic fashion world mold.“We are an incredibly diverse group. That’s how the magic happens,″ said Potts. “You cannot have a monolith of experiences and histories. It takes the magic of everyone’s experience to make something relevant in the modern world.″DIESEL PROMOTES SEX POSITIVITYGlenn Martens is promoting sex positivity with his new collection for denim-centric brand Diesel.Models walked around a mound of 200,000 Durex condom boxes, underlining a safe-sex message but also a capsule collection with the condom brand that is set to drop in April. As part of the campaign, Diesel plans to give away 300,000 boxes of condoms in stores around the world.Martens has had fun and success while redefining Diesel. The Diesel handbag with an elongated D motif has become a Gen-Z must-have.Denim drove the collection previewed in Milan, which had a furtive, run-for-cover feel and included garments that were torn, distressed, shredded, and seemingly torched. The treatments speak to survival, making it through some scrapes and living to tell the tale.Denim was interspersed with sheer panels, some in risque positions, worn with fading Diesel T-shirts. On the feminine side, there were slinky, silken looks fastened with sexy chains. On the masculine, there were oversized hoodies, or a well-worn gray pinstripe jacket and trousers, permanently showing their creases. This season's motto could be: Wear-and-tear included.The mismatched boss and assistant from Season 2 or the TV series “White Lotus” made a front-row appearance, with Haley Lu Richardson, who played the assistant, Portia, sitting next to drag queen Alexis Stone, dressed to impersonate Jennifer Coolidge.“Nothing beats the original,’’ Stone quipped.Richardson’s Portia, assistant to Coolidge’s Tanya McQuoid, ignited the internet with her off-beat wardrobe choices.“I think they loved to hate it,’’ said Richardson, swathed in a stretch Diesel sheer dress she described as comfy, sexy pajamas. “You know what, if it gets people talking …”BREAKING CLICHE'S AT No. 21Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s No. 21 collection looked pulled from an attic chest, treasures that recall a sultry past, re-imagined for a sexy present.That gray cardigan is worn backwards, left open at the top to show some skin and fastened with a scorpion pin. The silhouette is tight, pencil skirts with sequins or in gold brocade, or silky slip dresses worn invitingly unadorned, with just a set of pearls.The looks are simple, with a whiff of nostalgia that is quickly dispersed by the ultra-modern touches: the bodices of dresses hang down, revealing a slip top; zippers of dressers are left slightly undone, to reveal a tattoo.""I wanted to take cliches, and transform them,'' the designer said back stage.Breaking with tradition, Dell’Acqua closed the show without playing his traditional Pat Benatar battle hymn “Love is a Battlefield,” instead allowing the models to walk only to the sound of applause. Benatar's “Love is a Battlefield,'' however, blasted for the designer’s final bow.DEL CORE'S BLOOMING FASHION LANDSCAPEDeep in the northern Alaska wilderness blooms the sunburst lichen that stands at the heart of Daniel Del Core’s latest collection for his eponymous brand, a tightly edited streamlined mix of ready-to-wear and couture that play neatly off each other.""Its as if an explorer entered a forest and allowed himself to be contaminated by nature,'' Del Core said backstage.The collection has an air of mystery. Jacket shoulders can be unfastened, to reveal shoulders; garters over shoes suggest the explorer; dresses drape and reveal; puffy coats are worn off the shoulder, like a wrap; sheer ribbed knits cross cross over the body, revealing the shape.Finally, the disciplined black and white color palette bursts with the sunburst lichen, recreated with embroidered fabric in mossy green with pinks and rusts.Seven of the looks were couture pieces, including a an off-shoulder floor length dress in the lichen burst fabric, contrasted with a latex shoulders, for a slightly fetish flourish, and a intricately woven body-wrapping plisse gown.FENDI'S TWISTED CHICFendi models walked down a tunnel of blue light, which cast a spectrum on metallic heels and along garment hems, creating little rainbows to go.The collection by Kim Jones took classic pieces and gave them literal or figurative twists. Cardigans twisted around the neck. A knit scarf functioned as a half sweater over a lacey top or dress. Garments appeared doubled, vests had another built over top, thrown off as if a cape; skirts were built in over trousers, and jackets into skirts.Fendi called it “the lens of subtle subversions.”Baby blue knits contrast with dark leather skirts or jumpers, laced boots that hitch at the knee — combinations that Jones said were inspired by Delfina Delettrez Fendi, the brand's jewelry designer. Nowhere was the Fendi craftsmanship more on display than in leather dresses that were tailored with the softness of silk, hugging the body along a sweeping curves.Donatella Versace was an unexpected guest in the first row, giving the collection a standing ovation.",2023/02/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818642,Pope at Lent's start: end 'dictatorship' of the superficial,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis ushered in the annual Christian Lenten period of sacrifice and reflection by encouraging people on Ash Wednesday to cast off what he called the “dictatorship” of heavy agendas and superficial needs. 

            Due to a knee problem, Francis didn't join in the traditional Ash Wednesday procession between two churches on Rome’s Aventine Hill. Instead, he presided over an early evening Mass after the procession in hilltop St. Sabina Basilica, where faithful gathered for the Catholic Church’s ritual distribution of ashes that are meant as reminders of people’s mortality. 

            Lent marks a period that can include fasting, prayer and works of charity in preparation for Easter, which this year is on April 9. 











            During the service, ashes were sprinkled on Francis' bowed head while a choir sang hymns. 

            Lent is the time to “drop the pretense of being self-sufficient and the need to put ourselves at the center of things, to be the top of the class, to think that by our own abilities we can succeed in life and transform the world around us,"" the pope said in his homily. 

            “The ashes we receive this evening tell us that every presumption of self-sufficiency is false and that self-idolatry is destructive, imprisoning us in isolation and loneliness,"" he said.

            Instead, Lent serves “to remind ourselves that the world is bigger than our narrow personal needs, and to rediscover the joy, not of accumulating material goods, but of caring for those who are poor and afflicted,” Francis said. 

            “Let us...take stock of ourselves, to free ourselves from the dictatorship of heavy schedules, crowded agendas and superficial needs, and choose the things that truly matter,"" the pontiff said. 

            In his homily, Francis circled back to an overarching theme of his nearly 10-year-old papacy — attention to the individuality of those in need, particularly the poor. 

            “Alms-giving is not a hasty gesture performed to ease our conscience,'' the pope said. ”Rather, it is a way of touching the sufferings of the poor with our own hands and heart.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818644,Russia rules out hypersonic missile launch off South Africa,"A Russian commander on Wednesday ruled out a possible hypersonic missile launch during navy drills off South Africa this week.The Admiral Gorshkov, a Russian frigate loaded with Zircon hypersonic missiles, will take part in the joint exercises with China's navy. The letters Z and V are on the side of the ship, two patriotic symbols Russia has used during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.""The hypersonic weapon will not be used in the context of these exercises,"" Russian naval officer Oleg Gladkiy told journalists during a press conference in South Africa. ""There is no hidden meaning in the exercises we are performing today.""Earlier this month, Russian news agency TASS reported that the hypersonic missile firing would occur during the drills, which kicked off on Wednesday and will last until February 27.Zircon missiles are believed to achieve speeds exceeding 9,000 kilometers per hour (almost 5,600 miles per hour), allowing them to bypass traditional naval defense systems.The missiles, which Russian President Vladimir Putin labeled ""unstoppable,"" are capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.The joint Russian-Chinese naval exercises, which are taking place off South Africa's eastern coast in the Indian Ocean, are occurring during the first anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine.South Africa has been called insensitive for hosting the drills, known as Mosi-II. The South African government has so far refused to issue a full-throated condemnation of Russia's war against Ukraine.In response to the criticism, South African Lieutenant-General Siphiwe Sangweni said, ""Cooperation and coordination with all other militaries is very important to us.""He said it is necessary for South Africa to learn techniques from other militaries to better defend itself and participate in global peacekeeping missions.Brazil is involved as an observer in the drills. Brazilian President Lula Inacio Lula da Silva has previously said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is equally responsible for Russia's invasion.The exercises also come as Russia and China deepen their ties.Western sanctions have led Russia to become more dependent on China's growing economy. Officials such as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken have also voiced fears that China could provide material support to Ukraine in its invasion, resulting in further escalation of the conflict.Putin said Wednesday that Sino-Russian relations have reached ""new frontiers,"" while adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping would soon visit Moscow.wd/sms (Reuters, AP, AFP, dpa)",2023/02/22,,

The group cited illegal mining causing environmental damage as the reason for its protest blocking access to the region.The two countries in the Caucasus fought over the disputed region in the 1990s and again in 2020. Following the latter of the two wars, a Russian-brokered truce saw Armenia cede territories to Azerbaijan.Earlier this month, Armenia offered a peace plan to Azerbaijan, aiming to definitively resolve the territorial dispute.""Azerbaijan shall, pending the final decision in this case... take all measures at its disposal to ensure unimpeded movement of persons, vehicles and cargo along the Lachin corridor in both directions,"" presiding judge Joan Donoghue said.""The disruption on the Lachin Corridor has impeded the transfer of persons of Armenian national and ethnic origin,"" she said.Donoghue said that there had been ""shortages of food, medicine and other life-saving medical supplies"" in Nagorno-Karabakh due to the roadblock. She added that there was a ""risk that irreparable prejudice will be caused.""The court also pointed to a 2021 ruling in which UN judges ordered both states to do everything possible not to escalate the conflict.Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said Yerevan welcomed the ruling that ""Azerbaijan must take all measures to end its blockade and ensure unimpeded movement of persons.""""We are also pleased to see truth prevail as the Court rejected in full Azerbaijan's counter request.""Armenia last month told the court that some 120,000 people had been running short of food, medicine and fuel due to the blockade, adding that people could not be transported to area hospitals.Yerevan also accused Azerbaijan of committing ""ethnic cleansing"" in Nagorno-Karabakh.Baku denied the allegations and filed a counter-claim against Yerevan, accusing Armenia of laying landmines and ""murdering and maiming Azerbaijanis.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818646,Prosecutor: Arizona border rancher shot at unarmed migrants,"PHOENIX (AP) — The prosecutor in the case against an Arizona rancher accused of killing a Mexican man on his land near the U.S.-Mexico border alleged during a court hearing Wednesday that the rancher fired that day on a group of about eight unarmed migrants who entered the U.S. illegally. 

            Kimberly Hunley, chief deputy attorney for Santa Cruz County in the border city of Nogales, Arizona, made the assertion the same day the court made public a filing she made Tuesday asserting that rancher George Alan Kelly began shooting at the group “out of nowhere” on Jan. 30 without issuing a warning or a request to leave.

            Kelly, 73, faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of one of the people, identifed by the sheriff's office as Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, who lived just south of the border in adjacent Nogales, Mexico. U.S. federal court records, which spell his last name slightly differently as Cuen-Buitimea, show he was convicted of illegal entry and deported back to Mexico several times, most recently in 2016. 











            Two more people from the group later came forward to law enforcement, prompting authorities this week to amend the complaint against Kelly to include two counts of aggravated assault “using a rifle, a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument” in a shooting at his ranch. 

            Those two were in the line of fire, but were not hit, according to court filings updated on Wednesday. One described watching the man they knew as Gabriel being hit and said they “felt like they were being hunted."" 

            Both fled back across the border into Mexico but are willing to testify in the case against Kelly, the documents say.

            The court, the county attorney's office and sheriff's office “have all received disturbing communications, some threatening in nature, that seem to indicate an ongoing threat to the safety of the victims,"" says Hunley's updated filing. 

            She says Kelly's comments conflicted with what witnesses from the group told law enforcement, and that his story significantly changed over time. 

            “Kelly shot an unarmed man in the back as he was fleeing, in addition to shooting at other individuals, without warning or provocation,” Hunley said in the filing, arguing against a reduction in Kelly's $1 million cash bond. 

            She wrote that the group “posed no threat to him or family,” but nevertheless “shot at them repeatedly with an AK-47, striking and killing one of them.”

            Kelly's attorney, Brenna Larkin, has said Kelly did not shoot and kill the man, but Kelly acknowledges that earlier that day he fired warning shots above the heads of smugglers carrying AK-47 rifles and backpacks he encountered on his property.

            Justice of the Peace Emilio G. Velasquez on Wednesday ordered that Kelly's bond be changed from a cash to a surety bond, which would allow Kelly to put up his ranch and home rather than come up with cash and allow him to leave custody while the case plays out. 

            Velasquez set another hearing for 9 a.m. MT (11 a.m. ET) Friday in Santa Cruz County Justice Court. 

            “We are following this case very closely,” said Consul General Marcos Moreno Baez of the Mexican consulate in Nogales, Arizona. “We have been present at the court appearances and are in touch with the victim's family, helping however we can."" 

            The shooting has sparked strong political feelings less than six months after a prison warden and his brother were arrested in a West Texas shooting that killed one migrant and wounded another. Michael and Mark Sheppard, both 60, were charged with manslaughter in the September shooting in El Paso County.

            Authorities allege the twin brothers pulled over their truck near a town about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the border and opened fire on a group of migrants getting water along the road. A male migrant died, and a female suffered a gunshot wound to the stomach.

            GoFundMe campaigns to pay for Kelly’s legal defense have been shut down and the money was returned to donors, the platform said last week in a statement.

            “GoFundMe’s Terms of Service explicitly prohibit campaigns that raise money to cover the legal defense of anyone formally charged with an alleged violent crime,” it said. “Consistent with this long-standing policy, any fundraising campaigns for the legal defense of someone charged with murder are removed from our platform.”

            GiveSendGo, which describes itself as a Christian fundraising platform, carries at least four campaigns collecting money for Kelly’s legal defense, including one that gathered more than $300,000 as of Wednesday.

            Kelly apparently drew on his borderlands ranching life in a self-published novel, “Far Beyond the Border Fence,” which is described on Amazon.com as a “contemporary novel which brings the Mexican Border/Drug conflict into the 21st century.” 

            Authored by a man with the same name, the 57-page novel focuses on a man named George and his wife, Wanda, also the name of Kelly’s real-life wife. 

            “Several times each week illegal immigrants would cross the VMR ranch,” reads one part. “They were led by armed human smugglers called Coyotes. George and his foreman had to patrol the ranch daily, armed with AK-47′s.”

            The fatal shooting of an Arizona rancher on his land in 2010 sparked a firestorm that helped spark passage of the state's Senate Bill 1070, the “show me your papers” law then described as the nation's toughest anti-immigrant legislation. It required law enforcement officers to inquire about suspects’ immigration status if they believed they were in the U.S. illegally.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818648,Rizwan century propels Multan to 3-run win vs Karachi in PSL,"MULTAN, Pakistan (AP) — Multan Sultans pulled off a sensational three-run victory over Karachi Kings for their fourth straight home win in the Pakistan Super League on Wednesday.

            Captain Mohammad Rizwan's blistering unbeaten 110 off 64 balls — his maiden PSL century — powered Multan to a strong 196-2.

            James Vince (75 off 34 balls) nearly upstaged Rizwan by plundering six sixes and seven fours as Karachi motored to 72-0 inside the first six overs of batting powerplay before ending up at a frustrating 193-5 for their fourth loss in five games.











            Multan fell to defending champions Lahore Qalandars in its season opener but has since beaten the remaining four franchises: Quetta Gladiators, Peshawar Zalmi, Islamabad United and Karachi.

            Multan pulled back nicely when leg-spinner Usama Mir had Matthew Wade (20) trapped leg before wicket off his first ball and Vince got run-out after Haider Ali refused to go for a quick single in the 10th over.

            Fast bowler Ihsanullah and left-arm spinner Khushdil Shah bowled impeccably in the middle-overs before captain Imad Wasim brought Karachi back in the hunt at the back end of the run-chase with an unbeaten 46 off 26 balls which featured five towering sixes.

            Needing 22 off fast bowler Abbas Afridi’s final over, Imad and Ben Cutting hit a six each and brought down the target to six runs off four deliveries. However, Cutting holed out at long off and Afridi kept his nerve on the final two deliveries to pull off a thrilling finish.

            Rizwan's tally followed his three half centuries in the last four games and left-hander Shan Masood (51) finally raised his first half century this season against a weakened Karachi bowling attack.

            Fast bowler Mohammad Amir was ruled out of the game due to a groin injury and his replacement — paceman Mohammad Umar (44-1) — proved too expensive.

            Rizwan struggled early in the innings but dominated both pace and spin in the second half of the innings after Masood holed out at deep square leg which ended up a solid 85-run opening stand off 62 balls.

            Rizwan played exquisite shots on both sides of the wickets that included 10 fours and four sixes as he also dominated the spin of Imran Tahir and Shoaib Malik with sweep shots.

            Rizwan raised his century in the penultimate over by smashing fast bowler Akif Javed for two sixes before scampering for two runs by cutting the pacer on the off-side as he anchored Multan to a challenging total.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818649,Leonard grateful to Bucks as he returns after 2 years away,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — During the two years that have passed since he made an antisemitic comment while playing a video game, Meyers Leonard often wondered if he’d ever suit up for an NBA team again.

            The 7-footer’s gratitude was evident Wednesday after signing a 10-day contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. Leonard said it felt “almost euphoric” to practice for the first time with his new team.

            “To take a chance on me like this, it takes a lot of courage,” Leonard said.











            
                Leonard hasn’t appeared in an NBA game since January 2021, when he injured his shoulder while playing for the Miami Heat. Two months later, he used a slur while playing a video game online that others watched on a livestream.

            The Heat told him to stay away indefinitely and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver fined him $50,000. Miami eventually traded him to the Oklahoma City Thunder, who released him shortly afterward.

            Leonard was trying to make amends for his mistake while also recovering from surgeries to his shoulder and ankle, the second of which resulted in what he called “a bit of a nerve issue.” Leonard pondered walking away from the game.

            “But that would have been the coward’s way out, to run away and say I’ve made enough money, I want to go start my life elsewhere,” Leonard said. “I felt like I owed it to anyone who’s ever believed in me, my family, my son, to make this right.”

            During his time away from the NBA, Leonard devoted himself to reaching out to the Jewish community.

            Shortly after the video came out showing him making a slur, Leonard issued a statement saying he didn’t know the meaning of the word he’d said but adding that “my ignorance about its history and how offensive it is to the Jewish community is absolutely not an excuse and I was just wrong.”

            Leonard has since spoken and worked with several Jewish groups, conducted a number of basketball camps for Jewish children and apologized numerous times for what he said and his ignorance about what the term meant.

            He briefly choked up while speaking to reporters Wednesday about everything that had transpired in his life over the last two years and how he had grown from it.

            “I always try to look at life glass half full, but obviously there were times when it was very, very, very dark,” Leonard said.

            The former Illinois star reached out to the Jewish communities in South Florida, at his alma mater and in Los Angeles, where he was recovering from his injuries. Leonard says he intends to do the same in Milwaukee.

            “It means something to me,” Leonard said. “It does. It’s part of me. I won’t stop. I can’t stop.”

            Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer vouched for Leonard's character by pointing out all the positive steps Leonard had taken since the March 2021 incident.

            “Meyers has been really, really diligent and conscientious about engaging with the Jewish community, acknowledging that there’s no place for antisemitism or antisemitic slurs or any type of hate speech,"" Budenholzer said. “The genuineness with how he’s talked to us about it, he’s talked publicly. We feel like he’s a person of high character that has owned and tried to make this an educational opportunity for himself and others.”

            Leonard, who turns 31 on Feb. 27, has career averages of 5.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 16 minutes in 447 games with the Portland Trail Blazers and Heat.

            His arrival in Milwaukee could help the Bucks deal with their lack of frontcourt depth as two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and Bobby Portis recover from injuries.

            
                Antetokounmpo sprained his right wrist last week at Chicago and went to New York on Monday to have it examined. Budenholzer said Wednesday 

            “He's always a fast healer,” Budenholzer said. “He's always a guy that's quick to come back. So we'll just see how he does as we take each day.”

            Portis appears on the verge of returning from a sprained medial collateral ligament that has kept him out for the last month.

            The Bucks will put a 12-game winning streak at stake Friday when they return from the All-Star break to host the Miami Heat.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818650,Human bones in car matched to Georgia man missing since 1976,"LAGRANGE, Ga. (AP) — Human bones found inside a submerged car near the Georgia-Alabama state line in 2021 have been matched to a college student who had been missing for 47 years, according to a Georgia sheriff.

            
                Kyle Clinkscales, 22, of LaGrange, vanished in January 1976 after leaving the Georgia club where he worked as a bartender to return to school at Auburn University in neighboring Alabama. 

            Investigators got a break in the cold case in December 2021, when someone spotted a car in a murky Alabama creek. The 1974 Ford Pinto pulled from the water belonged to Clinkscales, and some of his belongings were still inside. So were about 50 bones, including part of a skull.











            The office of Troup County Sheriff James Woodruff announced in a statement Sunday that forensic tests by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the FBI have concluded that the bones found inside the car more than a year ago are Clinkscales' remains.

            “At this time an official report has not been completed or released by the GBI as it relates to a manner of death,” according to the sheriff's statement.

            GBI spokesperson Nelly Miles confirmed Wednesday that investigators have not determined how Clinkscales died or whether foul play was involved. 

            In 2006, Jimmy Earl Jones pleaded guilty to making false statements to authorities about Clinkscales' death and was sentenced to four years in prison. Jones had told investigators that Clinkscales was fatally shot by someone else, but he gave conflicting accounts that prosecutors determined were useless to uncovering the truth. 

            Pete Skandalakis, the former district attorney who prosecuted Jones, said after Clinkscales' car was found that the “most plausible explanation” for his death was that he accidentally ran off the road.LAGRANGE, Ga.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818651,"Flu vaccine worked well in season that faded fast, CDC says","NEW YORK (AP) — Early estimates suggest the flu vaccine performed well in a U.S. winter flu season that has already dissipated.

            The vaccines were more than 40% effective in preventing adults from getting sick enough from the flu that they had to go to a doctor's office, clinic or hospital, health officials said during a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccines meeting Wednesday. Officials generally are pleased if a flu vaccine is 40% to 60% effective.

            One reason is the vaccine was a good match against the strains that spread over the fall and winter, officials say.











            But one expert at the meeting was underwhelmed and said it points out the need for better flu vaccines. “It is still disappointing” that the vaccine was a good match and yet effectiveness was still modest, said Dr. Sarah Long of Drexel University.

            Annual flu vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 months and older in the U.S. About half of eligible kids and just under half of adults got flu shots in the last several months, according to CDC data. Vaccination rates were up compared with 2021-2022, but below what they were before the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, said the CDC’s Brendan Flannery.

            Initially, it looked like it might be a bad flu season. The virus took off in early November as COVID-19 and another respiratory virus, RSV, roiled emergency departments. Among kids, flu-related hospitalization rates in November and December were as high as any seen in recent years, Flannery said. At least 111 flu deaths have been reported in children, the most since the 199 reported in the 2019-2020 season.

            The dominant flu strain was the kind typically associated with higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among older people. In some years, the vaccines were virtually ineffective against that strain in people 65 and older. But this season's vaccine has done unusually well, with the best results seen in at least 10 years, said Flannery, who is responsible for the CDC’s flu vaccine effectiveness data.

            Flu also apparently made a very early exit, with the virus declining since the end of November. Some pockets of high flu activity have persisted this month, including in New Mexico and New York City. But for the vast majority of the country, it's low. 

            It's not clear exactly why the wave crested so early, but flu seasons have been unusually mild or otherwise strange since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Flannery said. CDC officials also caution that flu season might not really be over — late winter or spring second surges have occurred in the past.

            The CDC uses several systems to track flu vaccines. One is a network of hospitals that offer information on how well the vaccine prevented flu-related illnesses bad enough to require admission to a hospital. Another is a collection of urgent care clinics and hospital emergency departments, which produce estimates of how well the vaccine worked against in preventing those kinds of medical visits.

            Among the findings:

            —The vaccine was 44% effective in preventing adult lab-confirmed flu visits to urgent care clinics and hospital emergency rooms, and 39% effective for seniors age 65 and older.

            —It was 43% effective against flu-related hospitalizations of all adults, and 35% against flu hospitalizations of seniors.

            —In kids, the vaccine was 68% effective in preventing illnesses severe enough to require hospitalization, and 42% effective for pediatric visits to the emergency department.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818652,What's behind the Israeli army's deadly Nablus arrest raid?,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The northern West Bank city of Nablus, the Palestinian commercial center, resembled a war zone on Wednesday, after a daytime Israeli military raid triggered a firefight that killed at least 10 Palestinians and wounded more than 100 others.

            It was the latest bloody escalation in a monthslong surge of Israeli raids into the the occupied territory that has led to the deaths of some 200 Palestinians and the arrest of at least 2,600 others. Last month, a similarly deadly raid in the northern West Bank city of Jenin triggered a Palestinian attack outside a synagogue in Jerusalem and a burst of rocket fire from Gaza.

            This period of heightened violence in the West Bank and east Jerusalem has prompted comparisons with aspects of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s and stoked fears of further bloodshed under the most right-wing government in Israel’s history. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new ultranationalist coalition has vowed to take a hard-line stance against the Palestinians and to entrench Israeli rule over lands they seek for a future state.











            WHY DID THE ISRAELI ARMY ENTER NABLUS?

            Much of the violence between Israelis and Palestinians for the past year has focused on Nablus, along with the nearby city of Jenin. The Israeli military said Wednesday's daytime raid targeted a Nablus-based armed group of young men known as the Lions’ Den, which emerged last year. The group has surged in popularity among Palestinians who see them as heroes for fighting Israel’s open-ended occupation of the West Bank, now in its 56th year. Although the Lion’s Den portrays itself as independent of established Palestinian factions, experts say the group is funded by Islamist militant groups Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Israel has blamed the Lion’s Den for a string of shootings aimed at troops and Israeli settlements in the past months, including one that killed a soldier last October.

            WHY DID THE RAID TAKE PLACE DURING THE DAY?

            The Israeli army usually raids cities in the West Bank late at night in what it says is a tactic meant to reduce the risk of civilian casualties. But on Wednesday, as Israeli military vehicles rumbled into Nablus' Old City, its warren of homes and shops teeming with vendors and residents going about their routines under the bright sky. Fighting between Israeli security forces and Palestinian gunmen erupted in the stone alleys and the Israeli army even fired missiles at a house after the militants holed up there refused to surrender. The Israeli military said intelligence services had tracked down three wanted members of the Lion’s Den, including one involved in the killing of the Israeli soldier last fall, and determined they were all in the same house — offering a rare window of opportunity to target them. The army claimed the militants posed an immediate threat to Israeli lives, without providing evidence.

            WHO WAS KILLED IN THE RAID?

            At least 10 Palestinians were killed, including a 16-year-old boy and older men 72 and 61. The Lion’s Den claimed six of the dead as its members. A 66-year-old later died from tear gas inhalation, officials said. Other men were killed in unclear circumstances that the Israeli army said it was investigating. CCTV footage widely shared online showed two young men, apparently unarmed, shot after sprinting down the street, away from echoing gunfire. Another video circulating on social media, confirmed by witnesses, shows the body of 72-year-old Adnan Baara inert on the ground of the Old City market, his clothes covered in dust, beside a cart of bread. “We’re looking into everything,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an army spokesman. So far this year, at least 59 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, according to a tally by The Associated Press. While many of those killed in recent army raids are militants, stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.

            WHY WAS THE DEATH TOLL SO HIGH?

            The Israeli military said that its troops came under heavy fire as they stormed into the city. Young Palestinian men are increasingly taking up guns and organizing into small militant groups. The Israeli army’s escalating efforts to pursue them last year led to bloodshed in the West Bank at levels not seen since 2004. Fed up with the Israeli occupation that constrains their lives and disillusioned by the long-stalemated peace process and the unpopular Palestinian Authority that exercises limited control in parts of the West Bank, many young Palestinians have gotten their hands on M-16s, often smuggled from Israeli army bases or neighboring Jordan. Instead of slinging stones at troops entering their towns, they open fire. Israeli forces fire back. During a raid into the Jenin refugee camp last month, 10 Palestinians were killed, including a 61-year-old woman peering out at the chaos from her apartment window.

            WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

            The Islamist militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, Hamas, issued a veiled threat after the deadly raid, saying its “patience is running out.” Senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh said that the Palestinian Authority is “considering taking steps at all levels in response,” without elaborating. Its options are limited. After last month’s raid in Jenin, the PA suspended security coordination with Israel, a move it has announced before with little impact. Although Israel says that its stepped-up arrest raids in the West Bank are intended to prevent future attacks, Palestinian residents and critics say the operations only inflame a ceaseless cycle of hatred and bloodshed. The Lion's Den on Wednesday promised revenge. “The size of the pain that befell Nablus today,"" it warned, “Israel will swallow twice as much.”JERUSALEM (AP) — The northern West Bank city of Nablus, the Palestinian commercial center, resembled a war zone on Wednesday, after a daytime Israeli military raid triggered a firefight that killed at least 10 Palestinians and wounded more than 100 others.It was the latest bloody escalation in a monthslong surge of Israeli raids into the the occupied territory that has led to the deaths of some 200 Palestinians and the arrest of at least 2,600 others.

The Israeli military said intelligence services had tracked down three wanted members of the Lion’s Den, including one involved in the killing of the Israeli soldier last fall, and determined they were all in the same house — offering a rare window of opportunity to target them. The army claimed the militants posed an immediate threat to Israeli lives, without providing evidence.WHO WAS KILLED IN THE RAID?At least 10 Palestinians were killed, including a 16-year-old boy and older men 72 and 61. The Lion’s Den claimed six of the dead as its members. A 66-year-old later died from tear gas inhalation, officials said. Other men were killed in unclear circumstances that the Israeli army said it was investigating. CCTV footage widely shared online showed two young men, apparently unarmed, shot after sprinting down the street, away from echoing gunfire. Another video circulating on social media, confirmed by witnesses, shows the body of 72-year-old Adnan Baara inert on the ground of the Old City market, his clothes covered in dust, beside a cart of bread. “We’re looking into everything,” said Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an army spokesman. So far this year, at least 59 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, according to a tally by The Associated Press. While many of those killed in recent army raids are militants, stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.WHY WAS THE DEATH TOLL SO HIGH?The Israeli military said that its troops came under heavy fire as they stormed into the city. Young Palestinian men are increasingly taking up guns and organizing into small militant groups. The Israeli army’s escalating efforts to pursue them last year led to bloodshed in the West Bank at levels not seen since 2004. Fed up with the Israeli occupation that constrains their lives and disillusioned by the long-stalemated peace process and the unpopular Palestinian Authority that exercises limited control in parts of the West Bank, many young Palestinians have gotten their hands on M-16s, often smuggled from Israeli army bases or neighboring Jordan. Instead of slinging stones at troops entering their towns, they open fire. Israeli forces fire back. During a raid into the Jenin refugee camp last month, 10 Palestinians were killed, including a 61-year-old woman peering out at the chaos from her apartment window.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?The Islamist militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, Hamas, issued a veiled threat after the deadly raid, saying its “patience is running out.” Senior Palestinian official Hussein al-Sheikh said that the Palestinian Authority is “considering taking steps at all levels in response,” without elaborating. Its options are limited. After last month’s raid in Jenin, the PA suspended security coordination with Israel, a move it has announced before with little impact. Although Israel says that its stepped-up arrest raids in the West Bank are intended to prevent future attacks, Palestinian residents and critics say the operations only inflame a ceaseless cycle of hatred and bloodshed. The Lion's Den on Wednesday promised revenge. “The size of the pain that befell Nablus today,"" it warned, “Israel will swallow twice as much.”",2023/02/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818654,Trump criticizes federal response to Ohio train derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized the federal response to the toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, as a “betrayal” during a visit to the village where residents and local leaders are increasingly frustrated more than two weeks after the disaster.

            The former president, who is mounting a third bid for the White House, wore his trademark red “Make America Great Again” cap as he said the community needs “answers and results,” not excuses.

            “In too many cases, your goodness and perseverance were met with indifference and betrayal,"" Trump said at a firehouse roughly half a mile from where more than three dozen freight cars — including 11 carrying hazardous materials — came off the tracks. The fiery, mangled mess near the Pennsylvania state line apparently followed a mechanical issue with a rail car axle.











            Trump appeared with U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Mayor Trent Conaway and state and local leaders — and traveled via motorcade — giving the visit the look of an official presidential visit.

            The Feb. 3 derailment led to evacuations and fears of air and water contamination after a controlled burning of toxic chemicals aimed at preventing an explosion. The disaster has become the latest front in America’s political divide, with Trump criticizing the federal response and the White House in turn saying Trump could have done more as president to toughen rail and environmental regulations.

            The trip offered Trump, who has held few events since he launched his campaign in November, an opportunity to reprise the role he often held as president: surveying disaster damage and meeting with residents following tragic events. He praised the staff of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, even as he offered criticism.

            He also donated cleaning supplies along with pallets of what he said was Trump-branded bottled water to residents concerned about the water coming out of their taps.

            Before leaving town, Trump stopped by a local McDonald’s, where he passed out hats, ordered meals for first responders and picked up food for the plane ride home. He also visited Little Beaver Creek to inspect the damage and greeted supporters assembled nearby to cheer him on.

            “Thank you for not forgetting about us,” one woman told him.

            “Have fun, everybody,” Trump told them after signing autographs.

            Trump, in his remarks at the firehouse, seized on Biden’s decision to make a surprise visit to Ukraine this week, saying he hoped Biden would have ""some money left over” for the residents of East Palestine when he returns. Biden, who has yet to come to the Ohio town, was traveling back from Poland on Wednesday after marking the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

            The Biden White House has defended its response to the derailment, saying officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies were at the rural site within hours of the derailment. The White House says it has also offered federal assistance and that FEMA has been coordinating with the state emergency operations center and other partners.

            EPA Administrator Michael Regan visited the site last week to try to reassure skeptical residents that the water was fit for drinking and the air safe to breathe. And shortly before Trump arrived in Ohio, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced he would visit Thursday after also facing criticism for not coming sooner.

            Trump took credit for Buttigieg's trip and also criticized FEMA's role in the response, accusing the agency of having “changed their tune” after he announced his own visit to East Palestine.

            The White House, however, has said FEMA was involved from the beginning, even as other agencies have taken the lead. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has said Ohio has received all the resources it needs from the federal government.

            DeWine and FEMA announced the same day that Trump’s trip was announced that FEMA would be deploying additional federal resources to the site, but the timing appears to be coincidental. Federal and state officials have also said Norfolk Southern, the train company, will pay the full cost of cleanup and other expenses such as hotel stays.

            Biden administration officials called out a decision by the Trump administration to repeal an Obama-era Transportation Department rule that would have requiring “high-hazard” cargo trains hauling large amounts of flammable liquids such as crude oil and ethanol to be equipped with more sophisticated, electronically controlled brakes by 2023. 

            Buttigieg said this week that the Federal Railroad Administration will look at reviving that brake rule now, though the NTSB noted it couldn’t have helped in this derailment because the train wasn’t considered a “high hazardous flammable train.” Only three of the 20 hazardous materials cars the train was carrying were filled with flammable liquids. Regulators may now look at expanding which trains are covered by the “high hazardous” rules.

            Almost three weeks after the derailment, the smell of chemicals that blanketed the village is mostly gone, but some residents close to the tracks say there’s still an odor inside their homes.

            The village of just under 5,000 residents is near the Pennsylvania state line in Columbiana County, which has grown increasingly Republican in recent years. Trump won nearly 72% of the vote in the 2020 election, and signs of his popularity remain clear.

            At a car dealership in town, where bottled water was being distributed, a photo of Trump leaned against a barricade, reading, “A Hero Will Rise.” Signs and flags around the village broadcast support both for Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate.

            Since the derailment, residents have complained about headaches, irritated eyes and other ailments. Thousands of fish have been found dead, and residents have talked about finding dying or sick pets and wildlife. Residents are also frustrated by what they say is incomplete and vague information about the lasting effects from the disaster and have demanded more transparency from Norfolk Southern.

            The gas that spilled and burned after the train derailment — vinyl chloride, a chemical used to make hard plastics — is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers.

            Environmental officials say that they monitored for toxins in the air during the controlled burn and that continuing air monitoring — including testing inside 550 homes — hasn’t detected dangerous levels in the area since residents were allowed to return.

            Residents like Cory Brittian, whose family owns an auto dealership in the center of the village, praised Trump for his visit.

            “Any light that can be shined on the situation here, especially with the federal government, can only help,” he said. ___

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818666,LIV Golf gets another setback in court fight with PGA Tour,"A federal judge has ruled the PGA Tour can add Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and its governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, as defendants in its countersuit in the ongoing legal fight with LIV Golf.

            The ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman was the second setback in the last week for Saudi-funded LIV Golf, which has accused the PGA Tour of monopolistic actions as the rival league gets started.

            
                LIV Golf's second season kicks off Friday at a Mexican beach resort south of Cancun.











            U.S. Magistrate Judge Susan van Keulen last week ruled the Public Investment Fund, which owns 93% of LIV Golf, and al-Rumayyan are required to give testimony and produce documents related to the antitrust lawsuit.

            Now their involvement deepens as defendants in the countersuit.

            Lawyers for PIF and al-Rumayyan had sought to quash subpoenas claiming sovereign immunity. They are expected to appeal van Keulen's decision that their involvement falls under the commercial activity exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act.

            The dispute centers around LIV's argument that PIF and al-Rumayyan were investors, while the PGA Tour says documents obtained during the discovery process indicate they were actively involved in attracting players to join the league and thus breach contracts with the PGA Tour.

            In her ruling, Freeman said adding PIF and al-Rumayyan as defendants in the counterclaim would not delay the trial, tentatively set for January 2024. She wrote in her ruling that any delay “is not likely to outlast the delay caused by the subpoena dispute.""

            Phil Mickelson was among 11 players who sued the PGA Tour on Aug. 3 in the Northern California court. LIV Golf joined the lawsuit, and now only three players — Matt Jones, Bryson DeChambeau and Peter Uihlein — remain as plaintiffs.

            In a separate ruling, Freeman ruled the PGA Tour's amended counterclaim must keep under seal details related to LIV's contracts and business strategy. However, she denied LIV's request to keep sealed matters that relate to the Saudi involvement in LIV operations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818667,"Love, Zeller discuss their decisions to sign with Miami Heat","MIAMI (AP) — Kevin Love got to know Bam Adebayo through time together with USA Basketball. He already is fond of Adebayo’s mother, Marilyn Blount. And Love and Adebayo already have exchanged some items, such as jerseys after a game and profane but hilarious comments on Instagram.

            Seems like a perfect match.

            That’s what the Miami Heat are hoping for, anyway. Love — one of two big men Miami signed during the All-Star break, along with free agent center Cody Zeller — detailed his rationale for picking the Heat over Philadelphia and his excitement to play along Adebayo on Wednesday, a day before his first official practice with his new team.











            “I love the way that they operate here,” said Love, who has been working out in Miami since he signed on Monday. “You can tell that it’s a top-tier, high-class, high-character organization and that all starts at the top. So for me, at the end of the day, it was a pretty easy decision.”

            And Adebayo, it seems, was part of that decision-making. The PG-rated version of their Instagram conversation that went viral Tuesday could be described as Adebayo posting a comment telling Love to make some shots, and Love telling Adebayo to create some space for him.

            The jousting will continue, only because they’re thrilled to have the other as a teammate. Adebayo spoke at length during All-Star weekend about how he wanted Love to land in Miami once his buyout with the Cleveland Cavaliers was complete.

            “He’s one of those guys, I just love his game,” Love said in a video conference with reporters. “I love what he is about. I love how he impacts winning and, you know, for him to jaw like that, it just means we’re off to a good start.”

            For Zeller, coming to Miami isn’t about how the season starts — but how it finishes.

            The 10-year veteran has been to the playoffs only twice in his career, both times against the Heat. He played in 11 games, with his Charlotte teams going 3-8 in those contests, Miami winning the first-round series against Zeller’s club each time.

            “I’ve hated playing the Heat throughout my whole career, because you always know it’s going to be a tough game, you always know it’s going to be hard-playing guys, it’s going to be a physical game, set the tone early,” Zeller said. “That’s how it’s been my whole career for 10 years in the NBA, so it’s kind of fun for me to be on the other side of it. Hopefully teams know it’s going to be a long night playing against us.”

            It’s a reunion for Zeller as well with his college teammate at Indiana, Heat guard Victor Oladipo.

            “It’s pretty special,” Zeller said. “Vic and I are really close. ... We didn’t imagine that the stars would align and we’d end up here in Miami.”

            The deals got done Monday, with Miami taking advantage of its two open roster spots to add not just some size — but big men who can pass, shoot and rebound as well. The Heat start their post-All-Star schedule Friday in Milwaukee, holding down seventh place in the Eastern Conference. Clearly, the hope is to move up.

            Love could have moved up in the standings already if so inclined.

            After falling out of Cleveland’s rotation 12 games ago, Love decided to seek a buyout from a team that’s No. 4 in the East right now, and he said he had serious talks with the No. 3 team in the East, Philadelphia. But he chose Miami, convinced it was the best fit and the best opportunity.

            Plus, it had been on his mind for about 15 years. Love was the No. 5 pick in the 2008 NBA draft and went three spots after Miami took Michael Beasley with that year’s No. 2 pick. Love thought at the time there was a chance he’d be in Miami — and now, it’s a reality.

            “I always looked at Miami as a place that’d be a great landing spot for me,” Love said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818668,Scott speaks of 'new American sunrise' as he mulls WH bid,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — As Sen. Tim Scott weighs mounting a 2024 presidential candidacy, the Republican was in Iowa on Wednesday delivering a message of “a new American sunrise,” articulating a positive vision that sets him apart from some possible rivals who have focused more on railing against cultural divides.

            “I see 330 million Americans getting back to celebrating our shared blessings again, tolerating our differences again, and having each other’s backs again,” Scott said in a speech to about 100 students and curious Republicans at Drake University in Des Moines. “We need new leaders who will lift us up, not tear us down.”

            If he follows through with a campaign, the South Carolinian's upbeat style could distinguish him during a GOP primary. Many of Scott's fellow Republicans who have courted Iowa's influential evangelical conservatives in recent weeks have focused on themes such as denying systemic racism in the U.S. or curbing transgender rights.











            Scott, the Senate's sole Black Republican, doesn't shy away from such terrain. He has in the past railed against “woke superiority.” 

            But in the speech, he described a “new American sunrise. Even brighter than before.”

            Such a goal requires collaboration he says is missing in government and around the country.

            “I see a future where common sense has rebuilt common ground, where we’ve created real unity, not by compromising away our conservatism, but by winning converts to our conservatism,” he said. 

            That nod toward inclusion has generally been absent from other Republicans who have recently swung through Iowa, which is poised to hold the first contest in next year's push for the GOP presidential nomination. Shortly after launching her presidential campaign last week, Nikki Haley was in suburban Des Moines stoking contempt for “woke ideology” and arguing “a national self-loathing has taken over our country.”

            Likewise, former Vice President Mike Pence, who is weighing a presidential candidacy, in Cedar Rapids last week headlined a rally to oppose an eastern Iowa school district's policy allowing transgender students to request a gender-affirming plan without their parents' knowledge. 

            “Across the country, parents rights are being trampled by a politically correct nanny state that's ruining our schools and telling parents they have no role in their child's education,” he said. 

            It's not as if Scott steered clear of similar criticism. 

            “If you wanted a blueprint to ruin America, you’d keep doing exactly what Joe Biden has let the far left do to our country for the last two years,” Scott said, deriding the view of U.S. history through a lens of racism and its slaveholding past. “Tell every white kid they're oppressors. Tell black and brown kids their destiny is grievance, not greatness.” 

            Instead, Scott used his own story, as the son of a single mother living in poverty, as the template for curing what he called “a crisis of optimism.” 

            “A leader with faith in America would have faith in Americans,” he said, ticking through a typically Republican-themed agenda of tax cuts, energy deregulation and religious freedom as policies, along with personal responsibility, that benefited his. “Faith in the American people means faith in freedom, free enterprise and free speech, because we are a free people."" 

            Scott also was scheduled to headline a county Republican fundraising banquet in suburban Des Moines Wednesday. Scott has traveled often to Iowa, home of the leadoff 2024 presidential nominating caucuses, though this was his first time in 2023 and comes as he is testing potential support with speeches like Wednesday's. 

            Should Scott launch a campaign, he would enjoy an instant financial advantage compared to several potential opponents. Scott, in the Senate since 2012, won what he has said would be his last Senate campaign last year, and had a robust roughly $22 million in his campaign account, which could be transferred to a campaign for president.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818669,Tiny Nevada town gets county OK to lift ban on alcohol sales,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Alcohol sales will soon be allowed in a tiny Nevada town where religious roots led to a decades-long ban on buying beer, wine and liquor. 

            Bars still won't be allowed, but stores will be able to sell alcohol in Alamo after the Lincoln County Commission on Tuesday unanimously endorsed a local board vote taken several months ago to repeal a prohibition adopted in 1985, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

            Many of the approximately 1,100 people who live in the unincorporated jurisdiction about a 90-minute drive north of Las Vegas are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Town Board Chairman Vern Holaday told the Review-Journal ahead of the county commission vote. 











            The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, preaches abstinence from alcohol.

            Alamo’s repeal could become effective in about 30 days, Lincoln County District Attorney Dylan Frehner said. 

            That will leave Panaca as the only remaining town in Nevada to prohibit alcohol sales, the Review-Journal reported. That town of 1,000 people is the Lincoln County seat and is a more than two-hour drive north of Las Vegas.

            A handful of communities in neighboring Utah, where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saint is based, also prohibit alcohol sales. Voters in Blanding, a rural town of about 3,300 residents that attracts visitors to national parks including the Grand Canyon rejected a 2017 ballot measure that would have allowed beer and wine sales for the first time in more than 80 years. In Hyde Park, population 4,000, voters in 2013 lifted a ban on alcohol sales.

            Alamo leaders decided last year they want the local supermarket and gas station to be able to compete with rival businesses outside of town that sell alcohol, Holaday told the county commissioners.

            “It’s not like there’s going to be a bar in every corner in town” he said. County law bans alcohol sales within 1,500 feet (457 meters) of a church, school or other alcohol business.

            A Las Vegas-based convenience store chain has proposed adding a motel, gas station and a market selling liquor at a former truck stop it acquired just outside Alamo, Holaday told the Review-Journal. The chain already sells alcohol at a store 7 miles (11 kilometers) away in Ash Springs.

            Holaday did not immediately respond to a message left by The Associated Press at his business, the 16-room Alamo Inn.

            Varlin Higbee, a county commissioner who owns a ranch is in Alamo, noted in an email that liquor licensees still must meet town and county requirements.

            “An over-the-counter bar isn’t going to happen in Alamo, zoning laws wont allow it,” Higbee told the AP on Wednesday.LAS VEGAS (AP) — Alcohol sales will soon be allowed in a tiny Nevada town where religious roots led to a decades-long ban on buying beer, wine and liquor.Bars still won't be allowed, but stores will be able to sell alcohol in Alamo after the Lincoln County Commission on Tuesday unanimously endorsed a local board vote taken several months ago to repeal a prohibition adopted in 1985, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.Many of the approximately 1,100 people who live in the unincorporated jurisdiction about a 90-minute drive north of Las Vegas are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Town Board Chairman Vern Holaday told the Review-Journal ahead of the county commission vote.The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, preaches abstinence from alcohol.Alamo’s repeal could become effective in about 30 days, Lincoln County District Attorney Dylan Frehner said.That will leave Panaca as the only remaining town in Nevada to prohibit alcohol sales, the Review-Journal reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818670,Eagles reserve lineman waives arraignment in rape case,"CAMBRIDGE, Ohio (AP) — A reserve offensive lineman for the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles will make his initial court appearance in Ohio on rape and kidnapping charges next month after waiving his arraignment in the case.

            Josh Sills, an undrafted free agent who appeared in just one game this season, was scheduled to appear in Guernsey County Common Pleas Court on Feb. 16. He instead chose to waive his appearance, and a not guilty plea was entered on his behalf. Sills remains free on a $25,000 cash bond he posted and he's is due to appear at a pretrial hearing March 9.

            The rookie, who played at West Virginia and Oklahoma State, was indicted Jan. 31 by a Guernsey County grand jury. His attorney, Michael Connick, has said the allegations are false and that Sills will be aggressively defended.











            Sills was listed as a backup guard and played just four snaps on special teams against the Cardinals on Oct. 9 — the one game he played. He was on the inactive list for most of the year and was placed on the commissioner’s exempt list after he was indicted, meaning he couldn't practice, play or travel with the Eagles as they prepared for their Super Bowl matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs.

            The indictment accuses Sills, who is from Sarahsville, Ohio, of engaging in sexual activity that was not consensual and holding a woman against her will on Dec. 5, 2019. A statement issued by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost said the incident was immediately reported, and that the county sheriff’s office conducted a detailed investigation.CAMBRIDGE, Ohio (AP) — A reserve offensive lineman for the NFC champion Philadelphia Eagles will make his initial court appearance in Ohio on rape and kidnapping charges next month after waiving his arraignment in the case.Josh Sills, an undrafted free agent who appeared in just one game this season, was scheduled to appear in Guernsey County Common Pleas Court on Feb. 16.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818671,"Titans release Lewan, Woods, Bullock to clear up cap space","NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — New Tennessee Titans general manager Ran Carthon started clearing up some much-needed salary cap space Wednesday. 

            
                The Titans announced they released three-time Pro Bowl left tackle Taylor Lewan for a failed physical and also released veteran wide receiver Robert Woods and kicker Randy Bullock. They later released linebacker Zach Cunningham also for failing a physical. 

            Lewan, the 11th pick overall in the 2014 draft out of Michigan, tore his right ACL last September. He tore the same ACL in 2020 and has played only 20 games combined over the past three seasons. The nine-year veteran had been due $14.8 million in the final year of his contract. 











            He started 100 of 105 games played for Tennessee. His podcast “Bussin' With the Boys"" announced his release on social media, and Lewan, who turns 32 in July, retweeted the post with his own message to Titans' fans. 

            “I hope I did enough to create something all the titan fans can be proud of, I love you all,” Lewan wrote.

            The Titans started Wednesday approximately $23.5 million over the salary cap of $224.8 million for the 2023 season, a number they must reach by the start of free agency March 15. Only Jacksonville, New Orleans and Tampa Bay had worse cap situations, according to Spotrac.com. 

            These are just the start of the changes for Tennessee, which led the NFL for most players used because of injuries in each of the past two seasons. The Titans (7-10) couldn't overcome those injuries in 2022, missing the playoffs on a season-ending, seven-game skid. 

            These four moves resulted in a swing of $37.9 million, creating approximately $11.3 million of cap space for their top 51 players per Spotrac.com. Lewan and Woods had been set to carry the sixth and seventh-highest salary cap hits for the team in the 2023 season. 

            Lewan's release has been expected since he tore his ACL last September and was placed on injured reserve. 

            Woods, acquired from the Rams by trade last offseason, led the Titans with 53 catches for 527 yards with two touchdowns. He started 15 of 17 games, but was due $13.7 million in base salary with a cap hit of $14.6 million. His release cost the Titans only $2.6 million in dead cap money. 

            The receiver, who turns 31 in April, wrote on social media “Free” after being released.

            “Where should I go,” Woods wrote as a follow-up with a couple of emojis. 

            Bullock appeared in 31 games the past two seasons. He had been due $1.64 million in the final season of the two-year deal he signed last offseason, and releasing the 33-year-old kicker from his sixth NFL team saves the Titans $2.6 million against the cap with a $600,000 dead cap cost. 

            His release apparently frees up the kicker job for Caleb Shudak, the undrafted rookie free agent out of Iowa that the Titans kept around after he hurt his kicking leg in June. He appeared in one game for Tennessee, making three of his four field goals. 

            The Titans originally claimed Cunningham, the 57th overall pick in the 2017 draft, off waivers in December 2021 from Houston. He played four games that season as Tennessee wrapped up the AFC's No. 1 seed with a 12-5 record. 

            But an elbow injury limited him to six games in 2022, and he finished with only 23 combined tackles, one quarterback pressure and one pass defended. His release saved the Titans a cap hit of $8.9 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818673,"Justices OK overtime pay for $200,000-a-year oil rig worker","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that an energy company employee who earned more than $200,000 a year still qualified for overtime pay under a New Deal-era federal law meant to protect blue-collar workers.

            By a 6-3 vote, the justices sided with Michael Hewitt, who was a “tool-pusher” supervising 12 to 14 workers on an offshore oil rig. Hewitt was paid a minimum of $963 for any day he worked as part of an unusual schedule on the oil rig.

            Between 2014 and 2017, Hewitt was paid more than $200,000 a year from his employer, Helix Energy Solutions Group. But Hewitt earned no overtime, even when he worked more than 80 hours a week, as sometimes happened.











            Business groups had told the court that a ruling for Hewitt would turn the Fair Labor Standards Act on its head by encouraging highly trained and well-paid workers to sue under a law that was meant to address substandard wages and dangerously long hours.

            In an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan, the court held that Hewitt qualified for overtime pay under the FLSA, despite a provision of the law that exempts “bona fide executives.” Under Labor Department regulations, employees making more than $100,000 a year generally don't have to be paid overtime.

            Hewitt prevailed, Kagan wrote, because the company paid him by the day and not weekly. The regulation at issue “applies solely to employees paid by the week (or longer); it is not met when an employer pays an employee by the day, as Helix paid Hewitt,” Kagan wrote. 

            In dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh lamented the court's “head-scratching assertion” that Hewitt wasn't guaranteed a weekly minimum in any week he worked even as he was “guaranteed to receive $963 for any day that he worked.” Justice Samuel Alito joined Kavanaugh's dissent and Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented separately.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818674,Cornell Univ. returns Native American remains dug up in 1964,"Cornell University has returned ancestral remains to the Oneida Indian Nation that were inadvertently dug up in 1964 and stored for decades in a school archive.

            “We’re returning ancestral remains and possessions that we now recognize never should have been taken, never should have come to Cornell and never should have been kept here,"" Cornell President Martha E. Pollack said at a small repatriation ceremony Tuesday, according to the university.

            Pollack apologized on behalf of the Ivy League school in Ithaca, New York, noting the “disrespect shown to these ancestors.” 











            The remains, possibly more than 300 years old, were unearthed by people digging a ditch for a water line on an upstate New York farm east of Binghamton in August 1964.

            Police called a Cornell anthropology professor, who determined the remains belonged to a young adult male of Native American ancestry. Repatriation records recently filed with the federal government indicate the remains represent “at minimum” three people.

            The remains were stored on campus until after the professor’s death in 2014, when they were transferred to the anthropology department. They were rediscovered by colleagues during an archival inventory.

            “These individuals, an adult man, a child of four years or younger and another child or adolescent of undetermined age, will be once again laid to rest in the traditions of our people,” Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter said at the ceremony.

            Twenty-two “funerary” objects that were interred with the remains also were returned. The objects include pieces of pottery, a piece of leather, a large mammal skull fragment and an acorn.

            The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act requires federally funded institutions, such as universities, to return remains and cultural items.

            Cornell is among colleges, museums and other institutions returning Native American artifacts and ancestral remains. Colgate University in November returned to the Oneidas more than 1,500 items once buried with ancestral remains, some dating back 400 years.

            The dig site in Windsor, New York. was once a large settlement located on the banks of the Susquehanna River, in the traditional territory of the Oneidas.Cornell University has returned ancestral remains to the Oneida Indian Nation that were inadvertently dug up in 1964 and stored for decades in a school archive.“We’re returning ancestral remains and possessions that we now recognize never should have been taken, never should have come to Cornell and never should have been kept here,"" Cornell President Martha E.

Repatriation records recently filed with the federal government indicate the remains represent “at minimum” three people.The remains were stored on campus until after the professor’s death in 2014, when they were transferred to the anthropology department. They were rediscovered by colleagues during an archival inventory.“These individuals, an adult man, a child of four years or younger and another child or adolescent of undetermined age, will be once again laid to rest in the traditions of our people,” Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter said at the ceremony.Twenty-two “funerary” objects that were interred with the remains also were returned. The objects include pieces of pottery, a piece of leather, a large mammal skull fragment and an acorn.The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act requires federally funded institutions, such as universities, to return remains and cultural items.Cornell is among colleges, museums and other institutions returning Native American artifacts and ancestral remains. Colgate University in November returned to the Oneidas more than 1,500 items once buried with ancestral remains, some dating back 400 years.The dig site in Windsor, New York. was once a large settlement located on the banks of the Susquehanna River, in the traditional territory of the Oneidas.",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818675,Vaughn eager to keep building Nets after landing new deal,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jacque Vaughn was passed over the last time the Brooklyn Nets hired a coach. It appeared they had someone else in mind when the job came open again this season.

            Vaughn just focused on his work, not worrying about whether he would ever have a real chance to lead the organization.

            “I just kept doing my job,"" Vaughn said.











            Now he has the chance to keep doing it well into the future.

            The Nets gave Vaughn a multiyear contact extension Tuesday, rewarding him for keeping the team in playoff position heading into the final stretch of a season that's included the trades of All-Stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

            Brooklyn is 34-24, fifth in the Eastern Conference with 24 games to go. But there's plenty of work to stay in the top six for a guaranteed postseason spot, with the Nets still integrating the four new starters they acquired in the trades with Dallas and Phoenix, and the season-long challenge of getting the most out of Ben Simmons.

            “For me, I’m excited about the challenge ahead of growing with this group, getting the most out of this group and pushing this group,” Vaughn said Wednesday.

            Vaughn had steadied the Nets three years ago after they fired Kenny Atkinson in March 2020, guiding them to a 7-3 finish and a playoff berth when the season restarted in a COVID-19 “bubble” environment, even though a number of key players didn't join the team at Walt Disney World.

            The Nets then hired Steve Nash as coach, despite him having no experience in the position. Vaughn stayed with the organization as one of Nash's assistants.

            Nash and the Nets split on Nov. 1 after the team started 2-5. By the time Vaughn coached them that night against Chicago, the Nets had already had discussions with Ime Udoka, their former assistant who had led the Boston Celtics to the 2022 NBA Finals before being suspended by the organization for violating team rules by having a relationship with a female staffer within the organization.

            The Nets decided about a week later to stick with Vaughn, who hopes his perseverance despite some disappointments with his job is a lesson for his kids.

            “I’ve seen it all here, whether it’s multiple coaches, it’s the bubble, whether it’s a toenail over the 3-point line, whether it’s trade requests, whether it’s all of the above, and so to still be a part of this organization means a lot to me,” Vaughn said. ""That means the way I carry myself on a daily basis, people appreciate it. So there’s something to that, but at the end of the day I just kept doing my job and showing up every single day and ready to rumble every single day.”

            Vaughn was 58-158 with the Orlando Magic from 2012-15 in his lone previous coaching stint. He is 39-22 now with the Nets and didn't fret about whether that would be good enough to earn a contract beyond this season.

            “I knew there was some conversation behind the scenes going on, but for me I did not worry about it or get stressed about it or put any additional food on my plate at all,” Vaughn said. ""Just did my job every day and being rewarded for doing that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818676,Egg diet 'reasonable' to explain boxer's failed doping test,"LONDON (AP) — Conor Benn was cleared of intentional doping when the WBC ruled Wednesday that the British boxer's consumption of eggs presented a “reasonable explanation” for his failed test.

            Benn's catchweight bout with Chris Eubank Jr. scheduled for last October had been canceled after Benn's urine test showed trace amounts of fertility drug Clomiphene, a banned substance that boosts testosterone levels while burning fat.

            The all-British bout was scheduled to take place 30 years after the fathers of Benn and Eubank Jr. — Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank — fought in the ring in one of British boxing’s great rivalries.











            “Mr. Benn's documented and highly elevated consumption of eggs during the times relevant to the sample collection raised a reasonable explanation for the adverse finding,” the WBC said in its ruling.

            The WBC said it will reinstate the 26-year-old Benn in its rankings. The sanctioning body said there was “no conclusive evidence that Mr. Benn engaged in intentional or knowing ingestion of Clomiphene.”

            Benn's status remains in doubt despite the WBC's ruling.

            British boxing authorities had called off Benn's bout following the tests conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association. Benn, who has denied any wrongdoing, had then relinquished his license with the British Boxing Board of Control.

            The board and UK Anti-Doping are still investigating.

            “The BBBoC has not been party to the review conducted by the WBC and has not been provided with sight of any evidence submitted on Mr. Benn's behalf,"" the board said in a statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818677,Year 3 could be blast or bust as Austin FC chases MLS title,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — From frustration to elation, Austin FC’s first two seasons were quite a ride.

            Given how close the club came to playing for the 2022 championship and the burden of new expectations it created, Year 3 could be a blast, or a bust. 

            Austin rose from the bottom of the Western Conference in 2021 to get within a game of the MLS final last season. An offensive attack fueled by goals from the left foot of forward Sebastian Driussi has added more scoring punch with the recent signing of Gyasi Zardes for 2023.











            That normally would have Austin gliding into a new season brimming with the confidence needed to deliver on expectations that it could again challenge for the title.

            But this season also comes with the uncertainty of front office upheaval amid former sporting director Claudio Reyna's connection to a controversy involving U.S. Soccer.

            Reyna used his international soccer connections to build Austin’s first roster from scratch during the pandemic, then shaped it quickly into a title contender. He's now been moved to a “technical adviser” role the club has yet to define.

            That leaves coach Josh Wolff with a lot to manage. 

            “The success of last year, there was the validation of what year two gave these guys from an emotional standpoint, a quality standpoint, but it also is a big marker on your back,"" Wolff said. “We have to come back and perform.” 

            Driussi clearly feels he has more to do. The Argentine striker tied for second in MLS scoring with 22 goals last season and wants more. He also signed a new contract that keeps him with the team through 2025 with an option for 2026.

            “Improving would be being the MVP and winning the Golden Boot,” awarded to the player with the most regular-season goals, Driussi said. 

            “What’s needed for this year? Austin raising a trophy,"" Driussi said. ""It would be something very special for me.”

            The field could open even wider for Driussi to score with the addition of the 31-year-old Zardes, who has 97 career goals. Austin is his fourth MLS club. 

            “We thought we were a good team at the start of last year. Maybe we surprised some teams, I think that’s probably what happened. Now ... expectations are going to be different,"" midfielder Ethan Finley said. “He knows how to score goals in this league.”

            But Zardes is only one new piece of the lineup. Austin had to add defensive help after giving up 49 goals last season, the most among the top three teams in the Western Conference. That included a 3-0 loss to LAFC in the conference final.

            “We scored a lot of goals last year,"" Finley said. ""(But) probably gave up more than we liked.”

            To help tighten up the back, Austin signed Egyptian free agent Amro Tarek, who has five previous seasons in MLS, most recently with the New York Red Bulls from 2019-2021. 

            “Red Bull has a certain DNA that they look for for their players from a physical standpoint. Speed, athleticism, power will be there,” Wolff said. ""A little added heat, a little added bite in the (defense) is a good thing. He’ll bring that.”

            That's the on-field stuff. Adjusting to the front office changes amid the fallout from Reyna's clash with U.S. men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter may be tougher.

            Reyna and his wife Danielle complained to the U.S. Soccer Federation about their son Gio's lack of playing time at the World Cup. Danielle Reyna told them of a 1991 incident in which Berhalter kicked a woman who later became his wife, Rosalind Santana Berhalter, who was Danielle’s college roommate. The USSF hired the law firm Alston & Bird to investigate and the probe is ongoing.

            It was shortly after that rift was made public that Austin announced Reyna would no longer be the team's sporting director. The club did not say if the move was directly related to the controversy.

            Now Wolff and director of player personnel Sean Rubio will manage the roster, player development and the team salary cap in a chase for the championship.

            “The leadership inside the building is strong,” Wolff said, insisting his relationship with Reyna isn't broken.

            Reyna, Berhalter and Wolff have a long history together.

            Reyna and Berhalter were teammates on the U.S. national team and Wolff was an assistant under Berhalter with the national team and Columbus Crew in MLS. Reyna hired Wolff as the head coach in Austin. The club even signed Berhalter’s son, Sebastian, in 2021, but he was not retained after one season. 

            “I've been friends with Claudio a long, long time and I expect that to stay the same,"" Wolff said. “I respect what Claudio’s decision is and we have to move forward as he does.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818678,Crowdfunding helps Washington sheriff's office ID remains,"PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) — A sheriff's office in Washington state used crowdfunding to pay for advanced DNA testing and genetic genealogy research that helped identify a missing woman's remains.

            The Clallam County Sheriff's Office on the Olympic Peninsula said a woman’s size 8 sneaker with a foot inside was discovered near the mouth of the Elwha River in December 2021.

            The office usually relies on the Washington State Patrol and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System for forensic analysis, Sgt. Brian Knutson told The Seattle Times. But the nature of the evidence meant the remains did not meet the criteria for testing through either agency.











            Last month, the sheriff’s office asked the public to help it raise $7,500 through DNASolves.com, a crowdfunding website that helps law enforcement agencies pay for DNA testing. The money helped the sheriff's office partner with Othram Labs, located in The Woodlands, Texas, which provided a list of people related to the missing person's DNA.

            Detectives contacted a family member who provided their own DNA, confirming the remains as belonging to Jerilyn L. Smith, 68, of Sequim, who disappeared in January 2018.

            Smith’s husband had found her car parked near the Elwha River Bridge, west of Port Angeles after her disappearance. Search-and-rescue dogs tracked her scent to the middle of the bridge, and authorities believe she died by jumping into the river.

(AP) — Five employees of an environmental consulting firm died when a small airplane they were traveling in crashed outside an industrial area of Little Rock on Wednesday shortly after the plane took off, authorities said.

            The twin-engine plane crashed several miles south of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Lt. Cody Burk said. The Federal Aviation Administration said five people were on board the plane.

            The twin-engine plane crashed a couple of miles south of the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport, Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Lt. Cody Burk said. The Federal Aviation Administration said five people were on board the plane.











            The Beech BE20 had departed the Little Rock airport and was headed to John Glenn Columbus International Airport in Columbus, Ohio, the FAA said.

            Burk did not immediately release the names or ages of the people on the plane. The FAA said it and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the crash.

            CTEH, an environmental consulting firm based in North Little Rock, said the five people on board the plane — including the pilot — were its employees. A company spokesman said the employees were responding to an explosion at an Ohio metals plant this week that killed one worker and sent more than a dozen to the hospital. 

            “We are incredibly saddened to report the loss of our Little Rock colleagues,” Paul Nony, senior vice president of CTEH, said in a statement released by the company. “We ask everyone to keep the families of those lost and the entire CTEH team in their thoughts and prayers.”

            The crash occurred as a line of thunderstorms that the National Weather Service said included wind gusts of 40 mph (64 kph) moved through the Little Rock area. Burk said it would be up to investigators to determine if weather was a factor.

            Nearby residents said they saw an intense fire from the crash.

Gordon told the paper that several smaller explosions followed, and then a huge fire.“It was just red, then it starts turning black, and there’s this burnt smell,” Gordon told the paper.",2023/02/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818681,Former Virgin Galactic CEO enters US House race north of LA,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides announced Wednesday he is seeking the seat held by Republican Rep. Mike Garcia in a district north of Los Angeles that is considered one of the most competitive House battlegrounds in the country.

            In a narrowly divided House — where Republicans hold a 222-212 edge with one vacancy — the contest could end up being critical in the 2024 fight to control the chamber.

            “Congress isn’t doing enough to help people in our part of California and Congressman Garcia has become part of the problem,"" Whitesides, a Democrat, said in a statement announcing his candidacy. “He supports taking away a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions and plays politics instead of focusing on the issues that matter and finding solutions to our biggest challenges.” 











            In a statement, Garcia said, “I applaud anyone’s decision to try to step in the arena and serve the nation.” 

            “It’s a decision I made when I was 18 and will continue to do so as long as necessary to ensure our nation’s prosperity and security,” Garcia added, referring to his entry into the U.S. Naval Academy.

            Democrats hold a 12-point registration edge in the 27th District, a once-conservative stretch of suburbs and high desert communities that then-Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden carried by double digits in the 2020 election. 

            Garcia, a former Navy fighter pilot who flew over 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, defeated Democrat Christy Smith in three consecutive contests in the district — including by just 333 votes in November 2020. 

            Garcia’s 2022 victory handed Republicans control of the House and gave the GOP a rare reason to celebrate in a state dominated by Democrats. He is the sole GOP House member with a district within heavily Democratic Los Angeles County.

            Whitesides served as NASA chief of staff during former President Barack Obama’s administration. He spent a decade leading Virgin Galactic, which aims to send paying passengers on space tourism flights.

            California is known nationally as a liberal monolith, but pockets of conservative strength remain, mainly in the Southern California suburbs and rural and farming stretches. Democrats dominate the state's congressional delegation — the largest in the House — 40-12.

            In the 2022 contest, Smith argued Garcia was out of step with district voters: He was endorsed by then-President Donald Trump in 2020, then joined House Republicans who rejected electoral votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania and opposed Trump’s impeachment after the Capitol insurrection. She also highlighted Garcia’s opposition to abortion rights.

            Garcia emphasized his military service and pointed to his vote supporting $2,000 stimulus checks as one example of his political independence. He’s also stressed local issues, including concern over illegal marijuana cultivation.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides announced Wednesday he is seeking the seat held by Republican Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818682,Vermont considers ending clergy abuse reporting exemption,"MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) — The Vermont Legislature is considering a proposal that would end an exemption to the state’s child abuse and neglect reporting laws for members of the clergy. 

            On Wednesday, the Vermont Senate Judiciary Committee held the first of what could be several meetings on the subject before it votes on the proposal. 

            Attorney Benjamin Novogroski, of the office of Legislative Counsel, says Vermont’s mandated reporting law includes doctors, teachers and social workers who are required to report suspected child abuse and neglect. In some circumstances, members of the clergy also are required reporters, but not when the member of the clergy learns of the abuse during a setting such as the confessional.











            Novogroski said that in researching the proposal, he found that when other jurisdictions have attempted to enact similar legislation it has been criticized for ostensibly interfering with the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.

            “”But, really, how that would play out in Vermont is unclear,"" he said.

            “I feel like the balancing test here is weighing the importance of reporting child abuse versus the importance of protecting the person’s confidentiality when they want to confess because they feel guilty,"" said Democratic Sen. Nader Hashim, a Democrat from Windham County. 

            Aryka Radke, the commissioner of the Family Services Division of the Vermont Department for Children and Families, said the division supports the proposal. 

            “Eliminating the clergy exemption could provide an additional path for reporting child abuse, which is definitely consistent with our department’s child welfare mission,"" she said.

            The measure was proposed by state Sen. Richard Sears, the longtime chair of the Judiciary Committee who has worked for years to fight child abuse. 

            Sears made the proposal after learning through a news story published last year by The Associated Press that Vermont is one of 33 states that exempt clergy in certain circumstances from laws requiring professionals such as teachers, physicians and psychotherapists to report information about alleged child sex abuse to police or child welfare officials.

            Nationwide, the exemption has resulted in an unknown number of predators being allowed to continue abusing children for years despite having confessed the behavior to religious officials. In many cases, the privilege has been invoked to shield religious groups from civil and criminal liability after the abuse became known to civil authorities.

            Sears said in December that over the years there have been cases in Vermont in which mandated reporters didn’t report instances of abuse as required but that he was unaware of any cases specifically involving members of the clergy.

            During the meeting at the Statehouse in Montpelier, lawmakers heard from a judge, criminal lawyers, and a social worker, but there were no members of religious organizations present either in person or participating remotely. 

            After the hearing, Hashim said the proposal is not aimed at any specific faith. He said he would like members of religious faiths to testify at future hearings. 

            “I think hearing from a religious scholar who has an understanding of multiple religions and their laws, I think it’d be helpful,"" he said.MONTPELIER, Vt.

            EUROPA LEAGUE

            Some of the world's biggest soccer clubs could be heading out of European competition entirely this season as they prepare for the second legs of the knockout round playoffs. One of them will definitely be either Barcelona or Manchester United. The two heavyweights of the continent are locked at 2-2 after a gripping first leg at Camp Nou last week. Barcelona has never won the second-tier European competition — it used to be known as the UEFA Cup — and its hopes have been hit by injuries to Pedri and Ousmane Dembélé, along with a suspension ruling out midfielder Gavi. United returns to Old Trafford having lost just one of its last 19 games in all competitions and with forward Marcus Rashford having scored 16 goals in 17 games since returning from the World Cup. Also, Juventus is 1-1 with Nantes ahead of the second leg in France and Ajax is 0-0 with Union Berlin ahead of the return match in Germany. Seven of the eight playoffs are tightly poised — only one goal separates the teams — but Sevilla is in good shape against PSV Eindhoven, holding a 3-0 lead from the first leg in Spain. All teams are looking to reach the last 16.











            CONFERENCE LEAGUE

            Italian teams Fiorentina and Lazio are in contrasting positions as they look to advance into the round of 16 as one of the eight playoff winners. Fiorentina is in total control after winning 4-0 at Portuguese team Braga, but Lazio holds a slender 1-0 lead as it travels to Romania to face Cluj. Meanwhile, Bulgarian club Ludogorets goes to Brussels to take on Anderlecht with a 1-0 lead. Four of the other playoff openers finished 1-0 while the other finished 0-0 and there are no away goals.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818688,Debate on abortion access turns to Wisconsin high court race,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — National groups on both sides of the abortion fight on Wednesday pledged significant spending in the race for a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, tossing the perennial battleground state into the spotlight of the searing debate over abortion access.

            The winner of the April 4 general election will determine majority control of the court, which is expected to rule on cases affecting abortion, gerrymandered legislative districts and voting rights heading into the 2024 presidential election. The court, with a 4-3 conservative tilt, came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and both major parties are preparing for another close margin in next year's presidential contest.

            Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz, who campaigned as an abortion rights supporter and received the most votes in Tuesday’s primary, wasted no time attacking her Republican-backed opponent, Dan Kelly. Both are seeking to replace a retiring conservative justice.











            Protasiewicz (pronounced Pro-tuh-SAY-witz) launched a pair of new television ads Wednesday, including one labeling Kelly an “extremist” because of his position on abortion. Kelly is endorsed by the state's three largest anti-abortion groups, while Protasiewicz is endorsed by EMILY’s List, which works nationwide to elect Democratic abortion rights supporters.

            State and national Planned Parenthood political groups say they expect to spend in the seven figures, but would say only that their total would be more than $1 million to support Protasiewicz. Their strategy will include radio, TV and online advertising, plus direct mail. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin has hired staff across the state to support door-to-door and other campaign efforts.

            Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the most influential groups in the anti-abortion movement, said it had committed “six figures” to helping elect Kelly during the primary campaign through mailers, phone calls and text messages. The group said in a statement that it plans to continue supporting Kelly during the general election through its Women Speak Out campaign organization.

            Protasiewicz told supporters at her victory party that if Kelly wins, he will vote to uphold Wisconsin’s 1849 law banning abortions, a claim repeated in her new ad. The law, enacted a year after Wisconsin became a state, went back into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. A Democratic-backed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban is expected to make its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court this year or the next.

            Kelly has expressed opposition to abortion in the past, including in a 2012 blog post in which he said the Democratic Party and the National Organization for Women were committed to normalizing the taking of human life. Kelly also has done legal work for Wisconsin Right to Life.

            He has cited Protasiewicz's support for abortion rights as evidence that she's willing to rule based on “personal tastes and desires” rather than what the law dictates.

            “It is just unbelievable that a judicial candidate would do that,"" Kelly said Wednesday on WTMJ-AM radio. “But that’s the fight. It really is to maintain the constitutional order in the state of Wisconsin, to make sure that we live under the rule of law and not the rule of Janet.”

            
                Spending on the race is expected to to shatter the previous high for a state supreme court race, which was $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004.

            More than $9 million has already been spent on the primary for television ads by both sides, according to a tally by AdImpact Politics. Republican megadonor Richard Uihlein has given at least $1.5 million to Fair Courts America, a group that ran ads supporting Kelly.

            Outside groups spent about $2.5 million to benefit Kelly and about an equal amount attacking his conservative primary challenger, whom Democrats viewed as a tougher potential general election opponent. While the race is officially nonpartisan, the candidates have clear positions that lean liberal or conservative on some major topics.

            The Wisconsin Democratic Party endorsed Protasiewicz immediately after her win and is also poised to spend big on the race. It raised $3.5 million in the first five weeks of the year, compared with just $56,000 by the Wisconsin Republican Party.

            While turnout in off-year spring elections is always fairly low, there are signs it will be higher this year. Turnout for Tuesday’s primary neared 21%, the highest in at least 20 years.

            Republicans are trying to motivate conservative voters by placing two measures opposed by Democrats on the April ballot, including one asking if certain adults must be searching for work to receive “welfare benefits.”

            In a potentially positive sign for Democrats, the total primary votes for Protasiewicz and another liberal candidate who finished a distant fourth were nearly 8 percentage points higher than the votes for Kelly and the other conservative.

            Kelly was endorsed by Trump in 2020, when he was on the same ballot as the Democratic presidential primary and trying to win a full term on the court after serving four years following an appointment.

            He ended up losing that race to Justice Jill Karofsky by more than 10 percentage points. Afterward he worked for both the state and national Republican parties, including advising on the scheme in Wisconsin to have fake electors cast ballots for Trump.

            “This is an election that we know is going to largely focus on abortion and the ability to make a healthcare decision, and other important issues like voting rights and redistricting,"" Democratic strategist Melissa Baldauff said. ""These are issues that the people of Wisconsin are very clear on their position and are not aligned with Dan Kelly.”

            Republican leaders urged unity following the bitter primary battle between Kelly and conservative Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow.

            “Now is the time to unite and ensure our Supreme Court stays in conservative hands,” Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson tweeted Wednesday.

            Dorow urged her supporters to back Kelly.

            Wisconsin is not the only battleground state with a high-stakes supreme court election this year.

            In Pennsylvania, Republicans are hoping to win a vacant seat to narrow the Democratic majority from 4-2 to 4-3. The primary is May 16 and the general election is Nov. 7.

            That court has handled a number of high-profile election cases in the past two years, including deciding disputes over the state’s mail-in voting law and rejecting bids to effectively overturn Biden’s victory.

            ___ Associated Press writers Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Geoff Mulvihill in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, contributed to this report.MADISON, Wis. (AP) — National groups on both sides of the abortion fight on Wednesday pledged significant spending in the race for a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court, tossing the perennial battleground state into the spotlight of the searing debate over abortion access.The winner of the April 4 general election will determine majority control of the court, which is expected to rule on cases affecting abortion, gerrymandered legislative districts and voting rights heading into the 2024 presidential election. The court, with a 4-3 conservative tilt, came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and both major parties are preparing for another close margin in next year's presidential contest.Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz, who campaigned as an abortion rights supporter and received the most votes in Tuesday’s primary, wasted no time attacking her Republican-backed opponent, Dan Kelly. Both are seeking to replace a retiring conservative justice.Protasiewicz (pronounced Pro-tuh-SAY-witz) launched a pair of new television ads Wednesday, including one labeling Kelly an “extremist” because of his position on abortion. Kelly is endorsed by the state's three largest anti-abortion groups, while Protasiewicz is endorsed by EMILY’s List, which works nationwide to elect Democratic abortion rights supporters.State and national Planned Parenthood political groups say they expect to spend in the seven figures, but would say only that their total would be more than $1 million to support Protasiewicz. Their strategy will include radio, TV and online advertising, plus direct mail. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin has hired staff across the state to support door-to-door and other campaign efforts.Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the most influential groups in the anti-abortion movement, said it had committed “six figures” to helping elect Kelly during the primary campaign through mailers, phone calls and text messages. The group said in a statement that it plans to continue supporting Kelly during the general election through its Women Speak Out campaign organization.Protasiewicz told supporters at her victory party that if Kelly wins, he will vote to uphold Wisconsin’s 1849 law banning abortions, a claim repeated in her new ad. The law, enacted a year after Wisconsin became a state, went back into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. A Democratic-backed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban is expected to make its way to the Wisconsin Supreme Court this year or the next.Kelly has expressed opposition to abortion in the past, including in a 2012 blog post in which he said the Democratic Party and the National Organization for Women were committed to normalizing the taking of human life. Kelly also has done legal work for Wisconsin Right to Life.He has cited Protasiewicz's support for abortion rights as evidence that she's willing to rule based on “personal tastes and desires” rather than what the law dictates.“It is just unbelievable that a judicial candidate would do that,"" Kelly said Wednesday on WTMJ-AM radio. “But that’s the fight. It really is to maintain the constitutional order in the state of Wisconsin, to make sure that we live under the rule of law and not the rule of Janet.”Spending on the race is expected to to shatter the previous high for a state supreme court race, which was $15.2 million in Illinois in 2004.More than $9 million has already been spent on the primary for television ads by both sides, according to a tally by AdImpact Politics. Republican megadonor Richard Uihlein has given at least $1.5 million to Fair Courts America, a group that ran ads supporting Kelly.Outside groups spent about $2.5 million to benefit Kelly and about an equal amount attacking his conservative primary challenger, whom Democrats viewed as a tougher potential general election opponent. While the race is officially nonpartisan, the candidates have clear positions that lean liberal or conservative on some major topics.The Wisconsin Democratic Party endorsed Protasiewicz immediately after her win and is also poised to spend big on the race. It raised $3.5 million in the first five weeks of the year, compared with just $56,000 by the Wisconsin Republican Party.While turnout in off-year spring elections is always fairly low, there are signs it will be higher this year. Turnout for Tuesday’s primary neared 21%, the highest in at least 20 years.Republicans are trying to motivate conservative voters by placing two measures opposed by Democrats on the April ballot, including one asking if certain adults must be searching for work to receive “welfare benefits.”In a potentially positive sign for Democrats, the total primary votes for Protasiewicz and another liberal candidate who finished a distant fourth were nearly 8 percentage points higher than the votes for Kelly and the other conservative.Kelly was endorsed by Trump in 2020, when he was on the same ballot as the Democratic presidential primary and trying to win a full term on the court after serving four years following an appointment.He ended up losing that race to Justice Jill Karofsky by more than 10 percentage points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818689,Prosecutors charge man in killing of Los Angeles bishop,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prosecutors charged a man Wednesday with killing a Catholic bishop in a crime that stunned Los Angeles religious and immigrant communities.

            
                Auxiliary Bishop David O’Connell, 69, was fatally shot multiple times Saturday in the bedroom of his home in Hacienda Heights, an unincorporated community about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.

            The suspect, Carlos Medina, is the husband of O’Connell’s housekeeper. Medina had done work at the bishop’s home and was arrested Monday by a SWAT team.











            LA County District Attorney George Gascón said Wednesday that Medina is charged with one count of murder with a special allegation that he personally used a firearm. 

            “Charging Mr. Medina will never repair the tremendous harm that was caused by this callous act, but it does take us one step closer to accountability,” Gascón said.

            Medina faces 35 years to life in prison. He appeared in court Wednesday afternoon, and his arraignment was postponed to March 22. 

            The public defender’s office, which is representing Medina, said in a statement that Medina is presumed innocent “and entitled to a vigorous defense.""

            Because the case is so serious, a senior deputy was appointed to handle it, the statement said.

            “We are sensitive to the impact this case has had on our community but at the same time caution against any rush to judgment,"" the statement said.

            O’Connell had been a priest for 45 years and was a native of Ireland, according to Angelus News, the news outlet of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest. In 2015, Pope Francis named him one of several auxiliary bishops of the archdiocese.

            Lt. Michael Modica of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who is leading the homicide investigation, said Medina told detectives of several reasons for the violence, “and none of them made any sense to investigators,"" so the motive remains unclear.

            Previous reports that Medina said O'Connell had owed him money appear to be incorrect, Modica said.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prosecutors charged a man Wednesday with killing a Catholic bishop in a crime that stunned Los Angeles religious and immigrant communities.Auxiliary Bishop David O’Connell, 69, was fatally shot multiple times Saturday in the bedroom of his home in Hacienda Heights, an unincorporated community about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles.The suspect, Carlos Medina, is the husband of O’Connell’s housekeeper.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818690,Teen athlete loses legs in crash; prosecutor asked to resign,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The Missouri attorney general called Wednesday for the resignation of St. Louis' elected prosecutor, after a motorist who repeatedly violated his bond conditions on earlier charges crashed and injured a teenage volleyball player from Tennessee, resulting in amputation of both of her legs.

            The case has renewed criticism of Democratic St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner amid questions about why the driver wasn't behind bars after court records showed more than 50 violations of bond conditions.

            Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said Gardner must step down by noon Thursday, or he'll try to remove her from office.











            “Instead of protecting victims, Circuit Attorney Gardner is creating them,"" Bailey said in a statement. ""My office will do everything in its power to restore order, and eliminate the chaos in St. Louis caused by Kim Gardner’s neglect of her office.”

            Others, including Democrats, joined in the criticism of Gardner. Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, a Republican, said Gardner should resign, calling her “incompetent and grossly unfit to hold her office.” Missouri House Speaker Dean Plocher also urged Gardner to step down.

            Democratic St. Louis Mayor Tishaura O. Jones said Gardner had “lost the trust of the people,"" but did not call for her resignation.

            Janae Edmondson, a 16-year-old player in town for a volleyball tournament, was injured Saturday night when the crash left her pinned between two cars in downtown St. Louis while walking back to a hotel with her family. The high school senior, from Smyrna, Tennessee, was in stable condition, her coach said, but faced complications that could keep her hospitalized for weeks.

            As of Wednesday night, a GoFundMe campaign to support her family had raised more than $343,000.

            Police said Daniel Riley, 21, an unlicensed driver, was speeding and failed to yield at an intersection when his vehicle hit another car that then struck Edmondson. Riley was out on bond after a 2020 robbery charge that was dismissed and re-filed last year.

            His bond violations included letting his GPS monitor die and breaking terms for his house arrest, according to court records, which show he violated bond at least seven times since Feb. 1, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

            Court officials said they didn’t know Riley had violated his bond because prosecutors had never filed a motion to revoke it.

            A judge on Tuesday ordered Riley held without bond after Riley's attorney, Daniel Diemer, argued for a reduced bond, saying Riley had no serious criminal history other than the robbery charge. At that same hearing, Edmondson's parents said her father used his military training to stem the bleeding with tourniquets made of belts until paramedics arrived.

            Gardner, in a statement Wednesday night, said Riley was released on bond in August “against the state's wishes.” She said her office sought a bond hearing in January but got no response from the court.

            “Judges have the sole authority to determine the bond conditions of a defendant,” Gardner said. “Bond violations and decisions do not solely rest on the shoulders of prosecutors. In this matter, prosecutors asked on several occasions for higher bonds, and those requests were denied.""

            A bill advancing in the Missouri Legislature would allow Gov. Mike Parson to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crimes in St. Louis, with supporters contending Gardner has not been tough enough on crime during her tenure. Gardner's supporters rallied earlier this month in Jefferson City, saying the effort to take away her power was racially motivated.

            Gardner was first elected in 2016. In 2018, she charged then-Gov. Eric Greitens with felony invasion of privacy, accusing him of taking a compromising photo of a woman during an extramarital affair. Greitens, a Republican, accused her of a political attack. The charge was later dropped but Greitens, also under investigation by Missouri lawmakers, resigned in June 2018.

            The case drew scrutiny that led to the conviction of Gardner's investigator, and discipline for her.

            In March, investigator William Tisaby pleaded guilty to misdemeanor evidence tampering. A month later, Gardner reached an agreement with the Missouri Office of Disciplinary Counsel in which she acknowledged that she failed to produce documents as part of the Greitens investigation and mistakenly maintained that all documents had been provided to Greitens’ lawyers. She received a written reprimand.

            She drew the ire of St. Louis police in 2019 when she placed dozens of officers on an “exclusion list,” prohibiting them from bringing cases. The list was developed after a national group accused the officers of posting racist and anti-Muslim comments on social media.

            In 2020, Gardner filed a lawsuit accusing the city, a police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. The lawsuit alleged violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, which was adopted to thwart efforts to deny the civil rights of racial minorities.ST.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818691,Wales-England to go ahead in Six Nations after strike threat,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — The Six Nations rugby match between Wales and England on Saturday will go ahead after potential strike action from Welsh players over a contract dispute was averted.

            More than 100 players gathered at Wales’ training base on Wednesday to discuss a range of issues with members of the Professional Rugby Board. Among the players were many in the Wales squad out of contract at their regional teams at the end of this season.

            Players were threatening to go on strike because of the failure of the Welsh Rugby Union and its four regions to reach agreement on a new six-year financial deal and the fact that no playing budgets had been finalized.











            A compromise was reached between the WRU and Wales players on certain issues, meaning the game against England in Cardiff will go ahead. Having to call off the game would have cost the WRU around 9 million pounds ($10.8 million).

            “We felt we had to make a stand,"" Wales captain Ken Owens said, “but the conversations that have taken place over the last 10 days or so have shown that some positive resolutions can be found.”

            Welsh rugby players were mostly unhappy they are being offered contracts that would see them receive 80% of their salary, with the remaining 20% comprising bonuses.

            They also wanted Wales’ minimum 60-cap selection rule for players playing outside the country to be scrapped, and a voice at meetings of the PRB.

            After talks on Wednesday, players will be free to play for Wales if they are based in another country if they have won 25 caps or more.

            Players will also have the option of a fixed contract with their region or a fixed and variable deal.

            “I understand totally the position the players were in,"" acting WRU chief executive Nigel Walker said, ""and we at the PRB shouldn’t have put them in that position.

            “We are going to make sure we don’t get into this position again. There are a number of things we’ve got to do to ensure this dialogue continues every week and every month from here on in.""

            Owens said Welsh rugby had turned into the “laughingstock.""

            “Of course it has been a distraction with everything that has been going on,"" the hooker said, ""but I have got to commend the players’ professionalism in this.

            “When we have crossed that white line at training, we’ve prepared well and done our work as professional players. We are really ready for Saturday, and looking forward to getting out there and going toe to toe with England.""

            Wales coach Warren Gatland held off announcing his team on Tuesday, raising the threat of the match being called off. The team will now be announced Thursday.

            Wales has lost the first two matches of the Six Nations — against Ireland then Scotland — for the first time in 16 years.

            The Welsh haven’t started with three straight losses since 2003.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818692,Kraken partner with Muckleshoot Indian Tribe for jersey ad,"The NHL’s Seattle Kraken have partnered with the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe to put the tribe's logo on their jerseys and help increase Indigenous youth participation in the area.

            The team announced the agreement Wednesday at a news conference in Seattle. The Kraken will be the first team in the four major North American men's professional sports leagues to feature the name of a Native American tribe, unrelated to a casino, on jerseys since advertisements became commonplace in recent years.

            “To be able to assert sort of our place and our identity within the city, within the region, with organizations like the Kraken, it’s hugely important and it’s hugely meaningful and really a powerful step for our tribe, for our people,” Muckleshoot Vice Chairman Donny Stevenson said. 











            The multiyear agreement also involves the construction of a sports court on the Muckleshoot Reservation, more Indigenous art at Climate Pledge Arena and the creation of hockey programs for Indigenous youth in the area. The Kraken are on track to make the playoffs in their second year of existence.

            “One dream I have is young people throughout the Pacific Northwest who perhaps haven’t felt a part of it will now feel a part of it,” Kraken CEO Tod Leiweke said. “A dream of mine is someday a young person learns this support and succeeds, and maybe someday a young Muckleshoot kid wears that jersey with that patch on it.”

            Gila River Resorts & Casinos, owned by the Indian community of that name, is the sponsor on Arizona Coyotes jerseys.

            The Kraken's latest deal with the Muckleshoot Tribe comes at a time when appreciation for Native American and First Nations influences in the sport is on the rise.

            But it's nothing new for the NHL's 32nd franchise, which before it had a name or an arena invited members of Coast Salish tribes in the area for lunch in 2019 to get their input on everything from land acknowledgements before games to how to best reach out to members of the community.

            Leiweke and Mari Horita, senior VP of social impact and government relations for the Kraken, look back at that gathering as the start of a long-lasting partnership for an organization that has sought to be more progressive than hockey at large.

            “One of the things we talk about a lot is trying to build the most inclusive and representative and welcoming hockey culture in the country,” Horita said. “Hockey has not historically been the most representative sport, and this is an incredible opportunity to start to shift that narrative and expand who hockey is for, so that a nontraditional hockey community can suddenly say, ‘Wow, this is a sport for me.’”

            Leiweke, who previously worked for the NFL, the Seattle Seahawks, the NBA's Golden Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers and the NHL's Minnesota Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning — the latter of which he was a minority owner — called it a business partnership and a community one. In informing team staff of the agreement, he said he “referred to it as one of the proudest moments” of his career.

            “We’re new,” Leiweke said. “We’re second year in. To have this endorsement from the Muckleshoots means so much to us.”

The Kraken are on track to make the playoffs in their second year of existence.“One dream I have is young people throughout the Pacific Northwest who perhaps haven’t felt a part of it will now feel a part of it,” Kraken CEO Tod Leiweke said. “A dream of mine is someday a young person learns this support and succeeds, and maybe someday a young Muckleshoot kid wears that jersey with that patch on it.”Gila River Resorts & Casinos, owned by the Indian community of that name, is the sponsor on Arizona Coyotes jerseys.The Kraken's latest deal with the Muckleshoot Tribe comes at a time when appreciation for Native American and First Nations influences in the sport is on the rise.But it's nothing new for the NHL's 32nd franchise, which before it had a name or an arena invited members of Coast Salish tribes in the area for lunch in 2019 to get their input on everything from land acknowledgements before games to how to best reach out to members of the community.Leiweke and Mari Horita, senior VP of social impact and government relations for the Kraken, look back at that gathering as the start of a long-lasting partnership for an organization that has sought to be more progressive than hockey at large.“One of the things we talk about a lot is trying to build the most inclusive and representative and welcoming hockey culture in the country,” Horita said. “Hockey has not historically been the most representative sport, and this is an incredible opportunity to start to shift that narrative and expand who hockey is for, so that a nontraditional hockey community can suddenly say, ‘Wow, this is a sport for me.’”Leiweke, who previously worked for the NFL, the Seattle Seahawks, the NBA's Golden Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers and the NHL's Minnesota Wild, Vancouver Canucks and Tampa Bay Lightning — the latter of which he was a minority owner — called it a business partnership and a community one. In informing team staff of the agreement, he said he “referred to it as one of the proudest moments” of his career.“We’re new,” Leiweke said. “We’re second year in. To have this endorsement from the Muckleshoots means so much to us.”___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818694,Alex Ovechkin returns to Capitals following death of father,"ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) — Alex Ovechkin is back with the Washington Capitals, eager to play hockey again while he and his family are still mourning the death of his father, Mikhail.

            
                Ovechkin missed four games over the past week to fly to Moscow. He went straight from the airport to the team's practice facility Wednesday after landing to take part in practice with an eye on returning to game action as soon as Thursday.

            ""Obviously it was a hard week mentally, physically,"" Ovechkin said after skating for roughly 45 minutes to get his conditioning back. “It was probably toughest situation I’ve been through my whole NHL career. But it’s life, and we move on.”











            Ovechkin thanked the Capitals for their moment of silence dedicated to Mikhail prior to a game last week and for the support shown by members of the organization and fans. He said he got the chance to speak to his dad by video call before his death at age 71 last week and expects his mother and brother to visit him in the U.S. soon.

            ""We try to do the best we can in that kind of hard moment,"" Ovechkin said.

            In his hard moment, Ovechkin wanted badly to get back on the ice. After only skating once during his absence, the 37-year-old captain said this season felt like training camp.

            But there also wasn't time to waste. The Capitals went 0-4 during Ovechkin's absence and have lost five in a row in regulation for the first time in nine years.

            “I just want to come back right away, put my mind in a different position,” Ovechkin said. ""We’re struggling right now, so I just want to try to do my best to bring energy, bring something to the team.”

            Having been outscored 20-8 during the franchise's longest skid since 2014 — the previous time the Capitals missed the playoffs — they'll gladly take the lift that comes with Ovechkin returning.

            “He’s our leading scorer,” coach Peter Laviolette said. “He helps in a lot of different areas: offensively, power play, leadership, size, physicality, presence, so there’s a lot of things that Alex brings to the table. I’m glad he was able to get home and be with his family, and we’re certainly glad to have him back.”

            Tears welled in Ovechkin's eyes when talking about his dad getting him into the sport, being along for his journey to second on the NHL goal-scoring list and getting to share a day with the Stanley Cup together in the summer of 2018 after he and Washington won it after several years of disappointment.

            “He give me everything: all his health, all his time,” Ovechkin said. ""He traveled with me all over the world and (was) at every practice when he had a chance.”

            Mikhail Ovechkin was a familiar face at practices for years until his health kept him back in Russia. Longtime teammate Nicklas Backstrom and other Capitals players remembered Ovechkin's dad for his smile and support around the rink, even though his English was limited.

            “He had a great sense of humor,"" Ovechkin said. ""Even when he don’t understand people, he always tried to ask something. But, yeah, the people who know him, they’re going to miss his smile. They’re going to miss his energy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818695,Pitcher Song OK for Phillies after transfer to Navy reserves,"CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) — The Philadelphia Phillies say Noah Song's transfer from active duty to the Navy reserves frees up the pitching prospect to report to camp with the team on Thursday.

            Song, a 25-year-old aviator from California, was taken by the Phillies in the winter meeting draft in December with hopes he would play after military service.

            The 6-foot-4, 200-pound right-hander was picked from the Boston Red Sox system in the draft for unprotected minor league players. Philadelphia put him on the military list while he continued active duty.











            The Red Sox drafted Song in the fourth round — he likely would’ve gone much higher, but his impending military service caused teams to back off.

            Song impressed in his only pro season, making seven starts for Boston’s Class A Lowell affiliate in 2019, with a 1.06 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 17 innings. With a fastball clocked in the upper 90s mph, the right-hander dominated that year as a senior at the U.S. Naval Academy, going 11-1 with a 1.44 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 94 innings.

            In November 2019, Defense Secretary Mark Esper signed a memo clearing the way for athletes at military academies to delay service commitments and play pro sports after graduation. Song’s request to have those rules retroactively applied to him was denied.

            Song began school as a flight officer in the summer of 2020 and finished that phase last April. He started additional aviation training the next month.

            Song was among the 15 players, including three Boston pitchers, taken in the big league phase of the winter meeting draft. Washington took righty Thad Ward from Boston’s Triple-A roster with the first pick. Baltimore took Red Sox minor league pitcher Andrew Politi with the ninth choice and the Phillies chose Song with the 11th selection.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818696,Idaho bill would bring back execution by firing squad,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho could bring back firing squads as a method of execution under legislation introduced by a panel of lawmakers Wednesday. 

            The state eliminated its never-used firing squad option in 2009, but has been unable to secure the drugs needed for lethal injection executions. Only Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina currently have laws allowing firing squads if other execution methods are unavailable, but a judge has put South Carolina's law on hold until a lawsuit challenging the method is resolved. 

            In the bill sponsored by Idaho Rep. Bruce Skaug, a Republican from Nampa, firing squads would be used when lethal injection isn't available. Skaug noted that the state canceled the planned execution of Gerald Pizzuto Jr. late last year after Idaho Department of Correction officials said they were unable to get the chemicals needed for lethal injection. 











            Pizzuto has spent more than three decades on death row for his role in the 1985 slayings of two gold prospectors.

            “The way it stands now, they may never get those materials for the lethal injections,” Skaug told the House Ways and Means committee. “This is a rule of law issue: Our criminal system should work and our penalty should be exacted.” 

            The suitability and origin of lethal injection drugs are frequently called into legal question when states are planning executions. Ineffective drugs can lead to botched executions, violating the U.S. Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Major pharmaceutical companies have long refused to sell medications to states if they think they will be used for executions, prompting some prison officials to switch to novel or sometimes questionable sources for the chemicals. 

            Public support and use of the death penalty has declined for the past two decades, in part because of the high rate of “botched"" or highly problematic executions, according to an annual report from the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center. 

            Skaug acknowledged that death by firing squad can cause severe pain, but he said it was a better option than lethal injection.

            “There can be about 10 seconds of extreme pain before death at times, but I find it to be, in my personal view, more humane than lethal injection,” he said. 

            The vast majority of states that allow executions use lethal injection as their primary method, though some states also allow other methods like electrocution. There have been only three firing squad executions in the United States since 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

            Eight people, including Pizzuto, are on death row in Idaho, according to the Department of Correction.

            The Idaho bill still needs a public hearing before the committee will decide whether to send it to the full House for consideration.BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Idaho could bring back firing squads as a method of execution under legislation introduced by a panel of lawmakers Wednesday.The state eliminated its never-used firing squad option in 2009, but has been unable to secure the drugs needed for lethal injection executions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818697,NATO chief sees 'some signs' China could back Russia's war,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO's chief said Wednesday that the military alliance has seen “some signs” that China may be planning to support Russia in its war in Ukraine, and strongly urged Beijing to desist from what would be a violation of international law.

            NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also told The Associated Press in an interview that the alliance, while not a party to the war, will support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”

            Asked whether NATO has any indication that China might be ready to provide arms or other support to Russia’s war, Stoltenberg said:











            “We have seen some signs that they may be planning for that and of course NATO allies, the United States, have been warning against it because this is something that should not happen. China should not support Russia’s illegal war.”

            Stoltenberg said potential Chinese assistance would amount to providing “(direct) support to a blatant violation of international law, and of course (as) a member of the U.N. security council China should not in any way support violation of the U.N. charter, or international law.”

            On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted the Chinese Communist Party's most senior foreign policy official — Wang Yi — raising concern in the West that Beijing might be ready to offer Moscow stronger support in the almost year-old war.

            China has pointedly refused to criticize the invasion of Ukraine while echoing Moscow’s claim that the U.S. and NATO were to blame for provoking the Kremlin. China, Russia and South Africa are holding naval drills in the Indian Ocean this week.

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said any Chinese involvement in the Kremlin’s war effort would be a “serious problem.” Ties between China and the U.S. are under severe strain over Taiwan and other issues.

            Stoltenberg spoke to The Associated Press in Warsaw, following a meeting of NATO's nine eastern flank members with U.S. President Joe Biden on the region's security.

            He stressed that while NATO “is no party” to the Ukraine conflict its tasks are to “ensure that Ukraine prevails” and to “prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine and becoming a full-fledged war between Russia and NATO.”

            He said the main message from the meeting in Warsaw was that “we will provide support to Ukraine for as long as it takes.”

            It would be a ""tragedy for the Ukrainians if President Putin wins in Ukraine,” Stoltenberg said, and also “dangerous for all of us” because it would “send the message to all authoritarian leaders that when they use military force, they get what they want.”

            The Russian attack on Ukraine has prompted Sweden and neighboring Finland to abandon decades of nonalignment and apply to join the 30-nation alliance. But their bids — particularly Sweden's — are being delayed by Turkey, which wants the two countries to crack down on mostly Kurdish groups Ankara regards as terrorists.

            Stoltenberg told the AP that following talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week he could see Turkey “is moving closer to being ready to ratify and (to) welcome Finland into the alliance. But (Ankara continues) to have some challenges with Sweden.”

            He said he welcomed the fact that he and Erdogan agreed to a meeting soon “of experts and officials in Brussels” from the three countries involved “to look into how we can make progress also on the ratification of Sweden as a full NATO ally.“

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4818698,West Virginia transgender sports ban halted during appeal,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Transgender athletes in West Virginia can compete in female school sports while an appeal is heard on a state law banning their participation, a divided federal appeals panel ruled Wednesday.

            The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to reinstate a preliminary injunction, sought by the American Civil Liberties Union. The 2021 law signed by Republican Gov. Jim Justice applies to middle and high schools, as well as colleges.

            Last month a federal judge dissolved the preliminary injunction, which he had issued in July 2021. The judge also ruled the law did not violate Title IX, the landmark gender equity legislation of 1972. 











            The ACLU and its West Virginia chapter filed suit on behalf of an 11-year-old transgender girl who hoped to compete in middle school cross-country in Harrison County. The lawsuit named the state and county boards of education and their superintendents as defendants.

            More than a dozen states have passed laws banning or restricting transgender athletes' participation in sports based on the premise that they have an unfair competitive advantage, despite a lack of widespread cases. 

            The West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, which oversees scholastic sports, said when the suit was filed that it had not received any complaints about transgender athletes on girls' teams.

            A 2017 study by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law used state-level, population-based surveys to estimate that West Virginia had the highest percentage (1.04%) of residents ages 13 to 17 who identified as transgender. That equated to about 1,150 teens in all.CHARLESTON, W.Va.
