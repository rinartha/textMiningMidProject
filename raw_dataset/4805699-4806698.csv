https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805707,Police video from 'Cop City' operation doesn't show shooting,"ATLANTA (AP) — Newly released Atlanta police body camera video shows officers clearing tents from the site of a planned public safety training center and then reacting after they heard the barrage of gunfire that left an environmental activist dead and a state trooper injured.

            The four Atlanta police officers whose body camera video was released late Wednesday were part of a multi-agency “clearing operation” at the site on Jan. 18, but they did not witness the exchange of gunfire. Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, who went by Tortuguita, died at the scene, and a state trooper whose name hasn't been released was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, authorities have said.

            The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said that no body camera or dashcam video of the actual shootings exists. The agency has said officers encountered Tortuguita in a tent in the woods and fired in self-defense after the activist failed to follow verbal commands and shot a trooper.











            “The videos released by the City of Atlanta raise more questions than they answer, but confirm the family’s worst fears that Manuel was massacred in a hail of gunfire,” Tortuguita's family said in a statement released Thursday by their lawyers. “The videos also show the clearing of the forest was a paramilitary operation that set the stage for the excessive use of force.” 

            Activists have questioned the official narrative and called for an independent investigation separate from that being done by the GBI. The family on Monday said an independent autopsy found that Tortuguita had been at shot at least 12 or 13 times by multiple guns and called for the release of more information.

            In response, the GBI asked for patience, saying it is “not releasing any videos currently because agents are continuing to conduct key interviews and want to maintain the integrity of the investigation.” 

            City Council approved the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd’s death in 2020.

            Self-described “forest defenders” say that building the 85-acre (34-hectare) “Cop City” would cause an environmentally damaging loss of trees. They also oppose investing so much money in a project that they say will be used to practice “urban warfare.”

            Tortuguita, who preferred that moniker over their given name, had moved from Florida months ago to join the activists in the woods who had been protesting for over a year by camping out at the site.

            The January clearing operation was the latest attempt by law enforcement to remove the project's opponents from the site.

            Body camera videos released Wednesday show a group of Atlanta police officers coming upon a pair of tents as they walk through the wooded area. They yell warnings, identifying themselves as police and ordering anyone inside to come out with hands raised.

            After determining there's no one inside, they use folding knives to tear the tents apart and seize a backpack inside one of them.

            “You think they're gonna come back now?” an officer says as he slices the green fabric of a tent.

            The officers chat and sometimes joke and laugh as they walk through the woods. But at 9:01 a.m., according to the video time stamps, four shots ring out and then, a few seconds later, roughly two dozen more shots.

            Officers reach for their guns and position themselves behind trees. One shouts to the others to, “Put your bodycams on.” Yelling can be heard in the distance, but it's not clear what is being said.

            The officers head in the direction of the gunshots as radio traffic bounces back and forth. At one point, one of the officers, seemingly reacting to the radio traffic, says, “You (expletive) your own officer up.” 

            Activists have singled out that comment, saying on social media that it supports assertions some made from the beginning that the trooper was shot by friendly fire.

            The GBI has said that records show that a handgun found at the scene was purchased by Tortuguita in September 2020. Ballistics analysis has confirmed that the bullet that injured the trooper matches that gun, the agency said.

            In a statement Thursday, the GBI acknowledged that, in the videos, “at least one statement exists where an officer speculates that the Trooper was shot by another officer in crossfire.” But it goes on to say, “Speculation is not evidence. Our investigation does not support that statement.” 

            When the officers in the video come upon a green tent after the shooting, they establish a perimeter and one of them is heard saying, “We just need to hold until we can get them out. Get the officer out first. We don't want to cause another incident."" 

            Again, the officers yell commands to exit. After giving a warning, they shoot pepper balls toward the tent and then advance toward it, determining that it's empty.

            Over the last two months, at least 19 people have been arrested on charges including domestic terrorism related to protests against the training facility. Six of those arrests came during a Jan. 21 protest in downtown Atlanta after Tortuguita's death that prompted GOP Gov. Brian Kemp to declare a state of emergency, giving him the option of calling in the Georgia National Guard to help “subdue riot and unlawful assembly.”

            Since then, local officials have vowed to move forward with the project.ATLANTA (AP) — Newly released Atlanta police body camera video shows officers clearing tents from the site of a planned public safety training center and then reacting after they heard the barrage of gunfire that left an environmental activist dead and a state trooper injured.The four Atlanta police officers whose body camera video was released late Wednesday were part of a multi-agency “clearing operation” at the site on Jan. 18, but they did not witness the exchange of gunfire.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805709,Yu Darvish gets $90 million from Padres to stay through '28,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Yu Darvish signed a new contract with the San Diego Padres on Thursday that guarantees the 36-year-old ace an additional $90 million and will keep him with the club through the 2028 season.

            The right-hander, who has a baffling array of pitches, will make $108 million over six years, including the $18 million he was already due in 2023 before he was set to become a free agent. He's set to stay under contract with San Diego until he's 42.

            The Padres planned a news conference with Darvish and general manager A.J. Preller on Friday. 











            Darvish helped the Padres reach the NL Championship Series last season, which was one of the best in his 11-year big league career. He finished the year 16-8 with a 3.10 ERA and 197 strikeouts. He was 2-1 in the postseason.

            Darvish was traded by the Cubs to the Padres in 2020.

            The deal is the latest by the free-spending Padres. Darvish heads a rotation that also includes hometown product Joe Musgrove, who signed a $100 million, five-year deal in July. They signed shortstop Xander Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year deal in December, even though Fernando Tatis Jr. will be eligible to return April 20 from an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug. Tatis will move to the outfield, probably in right.

            There could be more big spending ahead for the Padres, who are still seeking their first World Series championship. All-Star third baseman Manny Machado can opt out of his $300 million, 10-year deal after the 2023 season, and the Padres would like to have him finish his career in San Diego. Machado finished second in balloting for NL MVP last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805710,"Hawks add depth, acquire Bey for 5 2nd-round draft picks","ATLANTA (AP) — Atlanta general manager Landry Fields says the Hawks were looking to bolster their depth and improve their playoff hopes in two trades that involved the team sending out a combined seven second-round draft picks on Thursday.

            The Hawks acquired former Detroit small forward Saddiq Bey as part of a three-team trade with Golden State. The Hawks sent five second-round draft picks to the Warriors in the trade, which was made official after Atlanta's 116-107 win over the Phoenix Suns on Thursday night.

            Also, the Hawks traded Justin Holiday, Frank Kaminsky and two second-round picks to Houston for Garrison Matthews and Bruno Fernando. The 6-foot-9 Fernando began his career in Atlanta in the 2019-20 season.











            “It's still a lot of value to give up, and I think that's the value we saw in those guys,” Fields said.

            The 6-foot-7 Bey is averaging 14.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in his third season with the Pistons, and averaged a career-high 16.1 points last season.

            Fields said he expects Bey to play both forward positions.

            “He gives us a lot of depth on the wing,” Fields said. “It gives us that flexibility for our coaches to do a lot of different things.”

            The addition of Bey creates an apparent surplus of small forwards in Atlanta, where De'Andre Hunter is the starter.

            Coach Nate McMillan said the new Hawks are expected to arrive on Friday and possibly be available for Saturday night's game against San Antonio.

            Atlanta is eighth in the Eastern Conference playoff standings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805713,Students walk out after told to limit Black History program,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — More than 200 students walked out of class at an Alabama high school after they say they were told by school leaders to omit certain relevant events from an upcoming student-led Black History Month program. 

            However, school officials have denied the allegations even while acknowledging the need for students' concerns to be heard.

            
                Students told WBMA-TV they were ordered to leave out major historical moments, including slavery and the civil rights movement, from the program scheduled for Feb. 22 at Hillcrest High School in Tuscaloosa.











            The students were told they “couldn’t talk about slavery and civil rights because one of our administrators felt uncomfortable,” said Black History Month Program board member J’Niyah Suttles, a senior who participated in Wednesday's walkout.

            She said the the direction from a school administrator left her hurt.

            “My protector from 8 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. — for you to tell me I can’t talk about something that is dealing with my culture is very disturbing, it’s very confusing,” Suttles said.

            Fellow Hillcrest senior Jada Holt expressed similar emotions.

            “Why am I being censored about my culture, something that is rooted in me? Why can’t I talk about it? History is history and it’s already been made, and it can’t be erased,” she said.

            Senior Jamiyah Brown, who helped put the program together, organized the walkout, which lasted about an hour.

            “Without our history we are nothing. Without teaching our youth where we come from, how can we move forward?” Brown said.

            Tuscaloosa County Superintendent Dr. Keri Johnson, in a statement, denied allegations that an administrator told the students to leave out historical elements.

            “It is not true that faculty or staff told students that slavery or the civil rights movement could not be part of the program,"" Johnson said. “When several community members heard this and contacted Hillcrest High administration out of concern, administration explained to them that this was false information that was circulating.”

            Johnson said the school system supports the students' right to peacefully demonstrate.

            “A number of our Hillcrest High students have concerns about the culture within their school. We care deeply about our students, and it is important that their concerns are heard. We are putting together a plan to make sure our students feel heard, so that we know the right steps to put in place to ensure all students know that they are valued,” Johnson said. 

            The president of the Tuscaloosa Branch of the NAACP, Lisa Young, said the alleged direction was a disgrace.

            “I don’t know how you can talk about Black history in this country without talking about slavery or the civil rights movement,” Young said.

            She said she has asked to meet with Johnson but has yet to be given a date.

            Young said she was “angry and part of me feels like we failed our students. We want to see what we can do to assist them, and make their school a safe place.”TUSCALOOSA, Ala.

            A statue of the comic strip character that was stolen from a park in Monterey, California, last summer was found submerged in a nearby lake.

            “Today is a happy day!” Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto said Wednesday at a press conference where the statue was wheeled in on a handcart.











            The sheriff's dive team found the 3-foot-tall (1 meter) statue in Roberts Lake after Monterey city police received an anonymous tip about its location.

            Dennis the Menace has a big but oddly troubled local connection. His creator, Hank Ketcham, was a longtime resident of Monterey County and died there in 2001.

            The park's original statue was stolen in 2006 and hasn't been found. Its replacement was stolen in August 2022 by someone who cut through its foot to remove it.

            In the years between the two thefts a Dennis the Menace statue was found in a Florida scrap yard and was sent to Monterey, where officials determined it was not the right one, KSBW reported. It had actually been taken from a Florida children's hospital.

            The hospital allowed Monterey to keep that statue, which is now in front of a city parks building.

            Nieto said it's believed the statue found in the lake is the most recently stolen Dennis the Menace because its foot is damaged.

            “We're giving you back Dennis,” Nieto told Monterey Assistant Chief Mike Bruno. “Don't let him get stolen again.”MONTEREY, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805715,DeSantis nears takeover of Disney government in Florida,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis moved closer to taking over Walt Disney World's self-governing district Thursday after House Republicans approved legislation meant to punish the company over its opposition to the law critics have dubbed “Don't Say Gay.""

            The bill would leave the district intact but would change its name and require DeSantis to appoint a five-member governing board. Board members are currently named through entities controlled by Disney and are tasked with overseeing the government services the district provides in the company's properties in Florida. 

            For DeSantis, the legislation is a victory on the nation's cultural battlegrounds, where he has harnessed political tensions on gender, race and education to bolster his position as a conservative firebrand while on a path toward an expected 2024 White House run. 











            The takeover was initiated last year when Disney publicly opposed “Don’t Say Gay,” which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate. 

            DeSantis moved quickly to retaliate against the company, directing lawmakers to dissolve the district during a special legislative session in April, beginning a closely watched restructuring process.

            Last week, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate, in coordination with the governor, ordered lawmakers to return for another special session to complete a state takeover of the district, taking up a bill that would preserve its operating functions and financial responsibilities. 

            The legislation is all but certain to pass in the statehouse, where a Republican supermajority is eager to carry out the governor's agenda. Democrats have widely criticized the legislation as a retaliatory power grab by the governor but are powerless to do much else other than delay its passage. 

            “This bill sends a message from the governor to businesses in our state that if they dissent, they will be punished,” said Rep. Rita Harris, a Democrat. “And this is chilling. It’s not just chilling to me, it’s chilling to freedom of speech.”

            The penalizing of Disney, one of Florida’s biggest employers and political donors, reinforces the governor’s combative leadership style and displays his willingness to leverage the power of state government against a perceived political foe.

            DeSantis has already begun touting the move against Disney as a political win during his public appearances, telling a cheering crowd of supporters Wednesday, “So, there’s a new sheriff in town, and that’s just the way its going to be.”

            The creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the Disney government is currently known, was instrumental in Disney’s decision to build near Orlando in the 1960s, when company leaders told the state they planned to build a futuristic city — the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, also known as Epcot.

            The proposed city was to include a rapid transit system and urban planning innovations, so Disney needed autonomy in the district for building and deciding how to use the land, they said. The futuristic city never materialized, and instead Epcot morphed into a second theme park that opened in 1982.

            Having a separate government allows the Disney government to issue bonds and provide zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure services on its land. Republican critics of the district argue it gives Disney a commercial advantage unavailable to others. 

            “Any time a corporation can self govern, like they have the last 55 years, it’s an advantage over any of their competitors,” said Rep. Fred Hawkins, a Republican who sponsored the bill.

            The bill, aside to having the governor pick board members, would rename the district as the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and make it subject to various layers of state oversight. It also prevents people who have worked with or contracted with a theme park in the past three years from serving on the district's new governing board.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805716,Rioter who menaced officer with Confederate flag gets prison,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Delaware man who threatened a Black police officer with a pole attached to a Confederate battle flag as he stormed the U.S. Capitol was sentenced on Thursday to three years in prison.

            
                Kevin Seefried, 53, tearfully apologized for his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot before U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden sentenced him.

            “I never wanted to send a message of hate,” Seefried said.











            McFadden said it was deeply troubling that Seefried wielded the flagpole as a weapon against the officer.

            “Bringing a Confederate flag into one of our nation's most sacred halls was outrageous,"" the judge said.

            McFadden allowed Seefried to remain free until he must report to prison at a date to be determined.

            Justice Department prosecutors had recommended a prison sentence of five years and 10 months for Seefried, a drywall mechanic from Laurel, Delaware.

            Seefried and his adult son, Hunter, stormed the Capitol together after attending the “Stop the Steal” rally, where then-President Donald Trump addressed thousands of supporters in Washington. Kevin Seefried was the 12th rioter to set foot inside the building that day, according to prosecutors.

            In October, McFadden sentenced Hunter Seefried to two years of imprisonment.

            Widely published photographs showed Kevin Seefried carrying his Confederate flag inside the Capitol after he and his son, then 22, entered the building through a broken window.

            Kevin Seefried told an FBI agent that he did not view the Confederate flag as a symbol of racist hate. FBI agents said they did not find any evidence linking him or his son to any far-right extremist groups.

            Seefried is embarrassed and ashamed that many may view him as a racist, his lawyers said in a court filing.

            “He had brought the flag as a symbol of protest, but had not considered the logic of those who see the flag as a symbol of American racism,"" they wrote. “Now that photos of him with the flag have become iconic symbols of the horror of January 6, Mr. Seefried completely understands the harm he has caused.”

            Within a minute of entering the building, Kevin Seefried jabbed his flagpole at Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman and joined other rioters in chasing the officer up a flight of stairs, a harrowing scene captured on video. Seefried was the first rioter to encounter Goodman near the base of the staircase, prosecutors said.

            Goodman, who testified at the Seefrieds’ trial, said Seefried cursed at him and jabbed at him with the base of his flagpole three or four times without making contact. Goodman recalled that Seefried asked where members of Congress were counting the votes and said, “You can shoot me, man, but we’re coming in.”

            “That flagpole was not only a weapon capable of causing serious injury; a Confederate Battle flag was affixed to it and it was brandished by a man standing at the front of a volatile, growing mob towards a solitary, Black police officer,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.

            Goodman led rioters away from the Senate chamber as senators and then-Vice President Mike Pence were being evacuated. He also directed Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, to turn around and head away from the mob.

            McFadden convicted the father and son of riot-related charges in June after hearing two days of trial testimony without a jury. The judge convicted both of obstructing an official proceeding, the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory.

            McFadden also convicted the Seefrieds of misdemeanor charges that they engaged in disorderly conduct and illegally demonstrated inside the Capitol. The judge acquitted Hunter Seefried of other misdemeanor charges for clearing a shard of glass from a broken window.

            The judge described Kevin Seefreid as the “prime mover” in his family’s decision to travel to Washington on Jan. 6. McFadden rejected the defense argument that the elder Seefried never intended to interfere with the congressional proceedings. 

            “I find that he knew what he was doing,” McFadden said.

            The Seefrieds were the first Capitol riot defendants to get a bench trial on a felony charge. Neither testified.

            Nearly 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 riot. More than 500 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. Approximately 400 have been sentenced, with over half getting terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.

            Viktoria Nasyrova, 47, was found guilty by a jury on Wednesday of trying to kill 35-year-old Olga Tsvyk with cheesecake laced with a powerful sedative and then stealing her passport and other valuables in August 2016, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a news release.

            The two women resemble each other, with dark hair and similar skin tones, and Nasyrova hoped to impersonate Tsvyk after killing her, the district attorney said. 











            “The jury saw through the deception and schemes of the defendant,"" Katz said. “She laced a slice of cheesecake with a deadly drug so she could steal her unsuspecting victim’s most valuable possession, her identity. Fortunately, her victim survived and the poison led right back to the culprit.”

            According to prosecutors, Nasyrova brought the cheesecake to Tsvyk's home in the Forest Hills section of Queens on Aug. 28, 2016.

            Tsvyk ate the cheesecake, felt sick and lost consciousness, prosecutors said. A friend later found her nearly comatose in bed, and she was taken to a hospital for treatment.

            When Tsvyk was discharged from and returned home, she realized that her passport and work authorization card were missing, along with a gold ring and other valuables, prosecutors said. Residue from the cheesecake container was tested and found to contain phenazepam, a potent sedative, and Nasyrova was arrested.

            Nasyrova was convicted of charges including attempted murder, assault and unlawful imprisonment. She faces up to 25 years in prison when she is sentenced March 21.

            “While we are disappointed with the jury’s verdict, we respect it and are exploring our options going forward,” defense attorney Christopher Hoyt said. 

            Nasyrova has also been accused of fatally drugging a neighbor in her native Russia in 2014. She denied killing the woman, Alla Alekseenko, in a 2017 interview with CBS News.NEW YORK (AP) — A New York City woman accused of feeding poisoned cheesecake to her lookalike in a bid to steal the other woman's identity has been convicted of attempted murder, prosecutors said Thursday.Viktoria Nasyrova, 47, was found guilty by a jury on Wednesday of trying to kill 35-year-old Olga Tsvyk with cheesecake laced with a powerful sedative and then stealing her passport and other valuables in August 2016, Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a news release.The two women resemble each other, with dark hair and similar skin tones, and Nasyrova hoped to impersonate Tsvyk after killing her, the district attorney said.“The jury saw through the deception and schemes of the defendant,"" Katz said. “She laced a slice of cheesecake with a deadly drug so she could steal her unsuspecting victim’s most valuable possession, her identity.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805719,House votes to overturn DC criminal code and voting laws,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican-led House has launched the first salvo in what could be a long-running feud with the District of Columbia over self-government in the nation's capital.

            In back-to-back votes, the House voted Thursday to overturn a sweeping rewrite of the criminal code passed by the City Council last year and a new law that would grant noncitizens the right to vote in local elections.

            Congressional oversight of the district is written into the Constitution. And while it has been more than three decades since Congress outright nullified a D.C. law, Congress has frequently used alternative methods such as budget riders to alter laws on issues ranging from abortion funding to marijuana legalization. 











            The House voted 250-173 to overturn the rewrite of the criminal code, which among other things, reduced the maximum penalties for burglary, carjacking and robbery. The voting rights bill also was overturned by a 260-173 vote. 

            The moves may be partially symbolic since both would have to pass the Democratic-held Senate and be signed by President Joe Biden. However, both House votes garnered a notable amount of Democratic support with 31 Democrats voting to overturn the criminal code rewrite and 42 voting to overturn the voting measure. Biden has said publicly that he opposes both measures, but has not explicitly stated he would veto them. 

            Thursday's votes signal a new and openly combative phase in the District's tortured relationship with the federal government. 

            The debate has put D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in a curious political position. Bowser vetoed the rewrite of the city's criminal code in January, saying the maximum penalty reductions send “the wrong message” on crime prevention, Bowser also apposed a measure that would allow for jury trials in most misdemeanor cases, saying the sudden spike in jury trials would overwhelm the local justice system. Her veto was quickly overridden by the D.C. Council in a 12-1 vote. 

            Republican lawmakers decried the D.C. government as soft on criminals in the midst of a multi-year local spike in violent crime. Several Republican lawmakers have cited Bowser's opposition to bolster their own arguments. 

            But Bowser has publicly stated she does not want Congress to get involved in the process, while also citing congressional concern as proof of the validity of her own objections. 

            “We don’t want any interference on our local laws,"" she said last week. “Quite frankly, members of Congress have expressed similar concerns. There’s a lot of people that don’t agree with what the council did.""

            New York Rep. Anthony Esposito, a former police officer, accused the D.C. Council of “empowering criminals at the expense of the public,” and said the new criminal code would ”effectively prevent the local justice system from keeping criminals off of our streets, all while D.C. grapples with a crime wave.”

            Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C's nonvoting delegate in the Congress, spent most of the morning House debate playing defense. Norton said the new mandatory minimum penalties would still be higher than those for identical crimes in multiple U.S. states. 

            Raskin accused House Republicans of ignoring their own public dedication to states’ rights by carrying out a longstanding vendetta against the D.C. government.

            “That is the beauty of the federal system which I thought our colleagues supported,” Raskin said. “They’re not really interested in scrutinizing the actual criminal justice policy. They just want to kick the people of Washington, D.C., around. They want to lord it over them.”

            After the vote, Norton released a statement saying, “D.C. residents, a majority of whom are Black and Brown, are worthy and capable of governing themselves. It is true Congress has absolute power over D.C., but might does not make right.”

            The sweeping rewrite of D.C's criminal code has been years in the making; it was approved unanimously last year by the 13-member D.C. Council and carries the support of major stakeholders, including D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb. 

            “Today’s move to overturn our laws is not about making the District safer or more just,” Schwalb said in a post-vote statement. “Today’s actions are political grandstanding and highlight the urgent need for D.C. statehood.”

            The measure to grant noncitizens, including immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, the right to vote in local elections is not unique. Similar measures have passed in multiple jurisdictions around the country, including Takoma Park, Maryland — a liberal bastion on the outskirts of Washington that is Raskin's home district. But multiple Republican critics claimed that the unique nature of D.C. with its hundreds of foreign embassies, made it particularly inappropriate.

            Official estimates set the number of noncitizen D.C. residents at around 50,000, out of a total population of just under 700,000 residents.

            “For years, Democrats in Washington decried potential foreign influence in our electoral process, but D.C.’s new law potentially allows foreign agents from China, Russia, and other adversaries to participate in local elections held within this nation’s capital city,” said Rep. Nicholas Langworthy, R-N.Y.

            Norton, in a Wednesday night debate over the voting law, call the congressional intervention “paternalistic” and said it violated basic democratic ideals of local self-governance. 

            “There is only one question before this House,” Norton said, ""The question is: 'Do you believe in democracy?'

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805720,Review: Reminding us of a classic rom-com we 'Used to Know',"At least Julia Roberts was invited to the wedding.

            I heard myself saying that out loud, rather indignantly, about halfway into “Somebody I Used to Know,” the new wedding-crashing rom-com directed by Dave Franco and starring real-life partner (and co-writer) Alison Brie, in which parallels to “My Best Friend’s Wedding"" come early and often.

            Roberts' crafty Julianne, if you recall, hopped a plane to disrupt the wedding of the guy who got away years ago. But she was greeted with open arms at the airport, not only by the groom but by the blushing bride. Here, Brie’s Ally basically crashes her ex’s nuptial week — to the distress of the bride — creating a scenario which feels a lot meaner. Oh, she’s charming and all, but her mayhem is a lot more devious.











            Of course, as these movies go, people end up as their better selves, eventually. But there’s a late, desperate move on Ally’s part in this often entertaining but also hectic and hit-or-miss story that's so nasty, you just stop rooting for her — and wish Julianne would swoop in, 25 years later, and set her young doppelganger straight.

            We first meet Ally, a Hollywood showrunner, as she's wrapping up the third season of her reality TV show, “Dessert Island” (wherein top chefs compete to create desserts on an island, of course). Ally is great at getting people to admit private stuff on camera. But the show suddenly gets canceled.

            Devastated, Ally goes home and cries with her cat, then consults her agent (an amusing Amy Sedaris), who suggests she stick with the dessert theme — maybe a show called “Dis-Hurt Locker,” involving Jeremy Renner and baklava? (Brie and Franco have lots of fun sending up reality TV. Which is much funnier than the cat on the plane with gastric distress.)

            Speaking of that cat, Ally and her feline friend hop a plane to her hometown in Washington state, whereupon she walks in on her mom (Julie Haggerty, also amusing) having sex with her 3rd-grade teacher. Escaping to the local bar, she runs into her ex, Sean (a terrific Jay Ellis, both effortlessly charming and vulnerable).

            They decide to get a quick bite, which leads to a full night of drinking, square-dancing, eating huge pretzels, guzzling melted cheese, puking from alcohol — you know, all those things you do when you run into your ex. At sunup, Ally suggests the two go home and get even more reacquainted, an offer Sean politely turns down.

            Oops! Turns out, he neglected to mention he’s engaged! Ally doesn’t learn this until the next day when, popping by Sean’s family home and catching up with his lovely parents, the mother gives a toast to the soon-to-be newlyweds. Bride-to-be Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons) is ostensibly everything Ally is not, at least now — a free and rather innocent spirit, a punk rock musician, and young, very young.

            Anyway, it’s too late, Ally! That's what old friend Benny (Danny Pudi, in the sort-of Rupert Everett role) tells her, and it’s what anyone would tell her. But, like Roberts’ Julianne, Ally decides it’s not too late to nab the groom out of the jaws of matrimony.

            The parallels keep coming — remember that karaoke scene, where Cameron Diaz’s tone-deaf (literally) bride is forced by Julianne to sing, but ends up charming the whole room? Here it’s Ally who is baited by the bride (understandably suspicious of Ally’s motives) into performing before a crowd, with similarly unexpected results.

            Cassidy’s suspicions are clear. “You’re not going to pull some Julia Roberts ‘Best Friend’s Wedding’ type (stuff), are you?' she asks. Why, no, Ally replies. But obviously she is. Soon, Ally's taken on the role of wedding videographer.

            It’s an edgier, much updated plot, in which Brie and Franco try to tie in themes of female empowerment and work-life balance along with serious difficulties each partner had to overcome earlier in their lives. There are also elements of bisexuality and public nudism. It's a kitchen-sink approach.

            Not everything works. Especially perplexing is a half-baked subplot involving one set of parents, and this is where the story lost me, making Ally seem not only selfish but actually rather cruel, and not as smart as we thought. We end up feeling sorry for virtually everyone else.

            Ally will redeem herself in other ways, as did Julianne. But the messiness of the plot makes us nostalgic for the source inspiration. As we wind our way to a hectic conclusion, can you blame us for simply wanting to see Roberts put down her enormous 1997 flip phone (how DID that thing ever fit into an evening bag?) and dance with her dashing bestie, George, at the wedding? Check it out on YouTube. Some things don't get old.

            “Somebody I Used to Know,” an Amazon Studios release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for sexual content, graphic nudity, language throughout and brief drug use.“ Running time: 106 minutes. Two stars out of four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805721,Hope dims for families in Turkey as rescue turns to recovery,"KAHRAMANMARAS, Turkey (AP) — Precious hours have turned to tense days across earthquake-hit southern Turkey as fewer people are pulled alive from the rubble. While family members watch rescue workers shift to recovery, they also face an awful truth: that it's unlikely they'll ever be reunited with their missing loved ones. 

            In Nurdagi, a city of around 40,000 nestled between snowy mountains some 35 miles (56 kilometers) from the epicenter of the quake, throngs of onlookers — mostly family members of people trapped inside — watched on Thursday as heavy machines ripped at one building which had collapsed, its floors pancaked together with little more than a few inches in between.

            Mehmet Yilmaz, 67, watched from a distance as bulldozers and other demolition equipment began to bring down what remained of the building where six members of his family — including three children and a three-month-old baby — were trapped.











            The operation there had become one not of rescue, but of demolition.

            “There’s no hope. We can’t give up our hope in God, but they entered the building with listening devices and dogs and there was nothing,” said Yilmaz. He hasn't moved from his hopeful perch beside the building for three days. 

            He estimated about 80 people were still trapped within the collapsed structure, but said he didn’t believe any of them would be recovered alive. 

            “The building looks like stacks of paper and cardboard, the fifth floor and the first floor have collided into one,” he said grimly, his eyes full of resignation.

            Scarcely a building remains in Nurdagi that has not suffered major damage. In those where it was believed there could still be survivors, workers used pick axes, jackhammers and shovels to carefully chip away at the hunks of concrete and twisted knots of rebar in hopes of discovering a sign of life. In other buildings, like the one where Yilmaz's family was trapped, it became more about recovery.

            In Kahramanmaras, the nearest city to the earthquake’s epicenter, workers on Thursday continued to search for survivors, but most of their discoveries were comprised of the dead. Standing atop a tall mound of debris, three men reached into a crevice and pulled out a body wrapped in a red blanket, its bare feet protruding. 

            The body was placed in the bucket of a backhoe and slowly lowered to the ground. 

            One rescue worker was heard saying that his psychological state was in decline after days of searching, and that the smell of death among the rubble was becoming too much to bear.

            Nearby, an indoor sports hall serves as a makeshift morgue to accommodate and identify bodies that were recovered from the debris. On the basketball court-sized floor of the hall lay dozens of bodies wrapped in blankets or black shrouds, at least one of which seemed to be the small body of a five or six-year-old child.

            At the entrance to the morgue, a man wept aloud over a black body bag that lie next to another in the bed of a small truck. 

            “I’m 70 years old! God should have taken me, not my son!” he cried.

            Erdal Usta, an assistant to the provincial prosecutor, said the bodies that are dug from the rubble are brought to the building and catalogued, and await identification by relatives who can then transport them to receive burial. 

            One woman, who did not wish to give her name, said she had brought the body of her father-in-law to the morgue to be formally registered as deceased. She and her family, she said, had dug the man out of the debris with their own hands, but he had been crushed in the collapse.

            In Nurdagi, 67-year-old Mehmet Nasir Dusan sat in a chair watching as the remnants of a 9-floor building were brought down by excavators in billowing clouds of dust. He said he held no hope, either, of reuniting with his five family members trapped beneath the debris.

            Still, he said, recovering their bodies would bring some small comfort.

            “We’re not leaving this site until we can recover their bodies, even if it takes ten days,” he said. “My family is destroyed now.”KAHRAMANMARAS, Turkey (AP) — Precious hours have turned to tense days across earthquake-hit southern Turkey as fewer people are pulled alive from the rubble.

Standing atop a tall mound of debris, three men reached into a crevice and pulled out a body wrapped in a red blanket, its bare feet protruding.The body was placed in the bucket of a backhoe and slowly lowered to the ground.One rescue worker was heard saying that his psychological state was in decline after days of searching, and that the smell of death among the rubble was becoming too much to bear.Nearby, an indoor sports hall serves as a makeshift morgue to accommodate and identify bodies that were recovered from the debris. On the basketball court-sized floor of the hall lay dozens of bodies wrapped in blankets or black shrouds, at least one of which seemed to be the small body of a five or six-year-old child.At the entrance to the morgue, a man wept aloud over a black body bag that lie next to another in the bed of a small truck.“I’m 70 years old! God should have taken me, not my son!” he cried.Erdal Usta, an assistant to the provincial prosecutor, said the bodies that are dug from the rubble are brought to the building and catalogued, and await identification by relatives who can then transport them to receive burial.One woman, who did not wish to give her name, said she had brought the body of her father-in-law to the morgue to be formally registered as deceased. She and her family, she said, had dug the man out of the debris with their own hands, but he had been crushed in the collapse.In Nurdagi, 67-year-old Mehmet Nasir Dusan sat in a chair watching as the remnants of a 9-floor building were brought down by excavators in billowing clouds of dust. He said he held no hope, either, of reuniting with his five family members trapped beneath the debris.Still, he said, recovering their bodies would bring some small comfort.“We’re not leaving this site until we can recover their bodies, even if it takes ten days,” he said. “My family is destroyed now.”",2023/02/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805723,'Finch-smuggling kingpin' gets prison time in New York,"A man who repeatedly admitted scheming to smuggle finches from Guyana into New York for birdsong competitions was sentenced Thursday to a year and a day in prison.

            It was Insaf Ali's second time being sentenced in a Brooklyn federal court for a crime related to bird trafficking, and he vowed it would be his last.

            “I’m going to stay away from the birds,” Ali pledged in a video he submitted to the court, “because it's trouble."" 











            His lawyer, Christine Delince, said after court that she was disappointed in the sentence, which came after she and Ali detailed his longtime affinity for birds during a life fraught with personal and medical problems. 

            Ali, 62, pleaded guilty last summer to conspiring to import wildlife illegally. He was stopped at John F. Kennedy Airport in January 2022 with two packs of hair curlers that smugglers use to slip the small birds past customs officials. 

            He was previously arrested in 2018 carrying finch-stuffed hair curlers in his socks at JFK, authorities said. In that case, he pleaded guilty to smuggling and was sentenced to two years’ probation and a $7,800 fine. 

            Songbird competitions have been a pastime in the Caribbean for centuries. Aficionados judge the animals on such factors as how many times they chirp or sing. 

            But with the birds sometimes fetching thousands of dollars, the contests have fed wildlife trafficking that authorities in Latin America and the U.S. have tried to combat.

            Stuffed into curlers and concealed to evade detection, finches sometimes die as they're flown to the U.S., and U.S. Customs and Border Protection worries that such smuggling could spread bird diseases. 

            Prosecutors argued in a Jan. 31 memo that Ali deserved “significant” prison time, calling him “one of New York’s finch-smuggling kingpins."" 

            Delince asked for leniency. She said in a Jan. 26 memo that Ali is “incredibly remorseful” for a crime fueled by a love of seed finches that dates to his childhood in Guyana and has provided him solace through many personal difficulties. 

            “His actions were not just about money,” she wrote, saying the birds “are a part of him and a part of his culture.”A man who repeatedly admitted scheming to smuggle finches from Guyana into New York for birdsong competitions was sentenced Thursday to a year and a day in prison.It was Insaf Ali's second time being sentenced in a Brooklyn federal court for a crime related to bird trafficking, and he vowed it would be his last.“I’m going to stay away from the birds,” Ali pledged in a video he submitted to the court, “because it's trouble.""His lawyer, Christine Delince, said after court that she was disappointed in the sentence, which came after she and Ali detailed his longtime affinity for birds during a life fraught with personal and medical problems.Ali, 62, pleaded guilty last summer to conspiring to import wildlife illegally.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805724,Group asks how African American course violates Florida law,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The organization that created a high school African American studies program rejected by Florida said Thursday it’s still waiting for specifics from the state about how the course violates state law.

            The College Board also disputed what it said were Florida’s claims it had deleted 19 topics from the proposed Advance Placement course at Florida’s behest, saying in a statement online that it already was streamlining topics to fit into an academic year.

            In a letter Tuesday to the College Board, Florida Department of Education said it was “grateful” to see that a Feb. 1 revision had deleted the 19 topics, including Intersectionality, Reparations and the Movement for Black Lives. It also welcomed the College Board to resubmit the course for Florida to review for its 2023-24 school year.











            Florida rejected the pilot program last month, saying it violated state law and was historically inaccurate. Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate who has opposed what he calls “woke” ideologies in schools, said the course amounted to “indoctrination” rather than education.

            The state said the course promotes the idea that modern American society oppresses Black people, other minorities and women, includes a chapter on “Black Queer Studies” that the administration finds inappropriate, and uses articles by critics of capitalism.

            Last year, the governor signed legislation dubbed the Stop WOKE Act that restricts certain race-based conversations and analysis in schools and businesses. The law bars instruction that says members of one race are necessarily oppressed or privileged based on their race.

            The College Board, which said it believes all of its original pilot program had educational merit and which denied any inaccuracies, said it needs more specific information about how any of its course materials are out of compliance with Florida law.

            “We never received written feedback from the Florida Department of Education specifying how the course violates Florida law, despite repeated requests,” the organization said.

            The organization said it would be regretful for any state to reject the course. ”We believe every student should have the opportunity to immerse themselves in the facts and evidence of the African American experience,"" it said.TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805725,Musk deputy's words on Starlink 'weaponization' vex Ukraine,"BOSTON (AP) — Ukrainians reacted Thursday with puzzlement and some ire to comments by a top Starlink official that their country has “weaponized” the satellite internet service, which has been pivotal to their national survival.

            President Gwynne Shotwell of SpaceX, which runs Starlink, was also reported to have said at the same venue Wednesday that the Elon Musk-controlled company has taken unspecified action to prevent Ukraine's military from using Starlink technology against Russian invaders. 

            The network of low-orbiting satellites has been crucial to Ukraine's use of battlefield drones — a central fixture of the year-old war — and the country's defenders have no viable alternative. The satellite links help Ukrainian fighters locate the enemy and target long-range artillery strikes.











            Onstage at a conference in Washington, D.C., Shotwell said: “We were really pleased to be able to provide Ukraine connectivity and help them in their fight for freedom. It was never intended to be weaponized. However, Ukrainians have leveraged it in ways that were unintentional and not part of any agreement."" 

            Speaking separately to reporters from The Wall Street Journal and other news organizations afterward, Shotwell said SpaceX has worked to restrict Ukraine's use of Starlink for military purposes.

            “There are things that we can do to limit their ability to do that,” they quoted her as saying without offering details. “There are things that we can do, and have done.” 

            That drew the ire of a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In a tweet, Mykhailo Podolyak said SpaceX needs to decide whether it is on the side of Ukraine's right to freedom or Russia's “'right' to kill & seize territories.""

            It was not clear whether Shotwell’s comments Wednesday were made at the urging of Musk, the founder, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX. An email to SpaceX seeking comment was not immediately returned. 

            There was no indication of any interruption to Starlink service in Ukraine. 

            In a statement, the country's Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov reported ""no problems with the operation of Starlink uplink terminals in Ukraine.” A ministry official familiar with the situation said checks Thursday of cities near the war's front lines found no indications of trouble with Starlink coverage. The official spoke on condition they not be further identified.

            The 2,200-satellite constellation has been a lifeline for the country since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, especially vital as Ukraine struggles to keep electrical power and telecommunications operating under withering Russian missile and drone attacks on civilian targets.

            In the statement, Fedorov touted the arrival of the first of a new batch of 10,000 terminals provided by the German government, adding: “Starlinks help save thousands of lives daily. The energy infrastructure continues to work due to Starlinks. Doctors perform complex surgeries thanks to the connection that Starlinks provide.” 

            The Thursday statement called Musk “one of the biggest private donors of our future victory,” estimating SpaceX's contributions as worth more than $100 million. “We hope for further stable work of Starlinks in Ukraine.”

            A Ukrainian military official called Shotwell's statements “strange” given the well-established fact of the country's use of Starlink as a combat tool. 

            Musk caused a stir in October when he publicly called on the Pentagon to take over funding of Starlink's Ukraine effort. 

            The billionaire and Twitter owner later backed down. Earlier that month he raised Zelenskyy's hackles by arguing on Twitter that to achieve peace, Russia should be allowed to keep the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014. He also said Ukraine should adopt a neutral status, dropping a bid to join NATO.

            About the same time, Starlink terminals stopped working in newly liberated territories at the Ukraine-Russia front lines in the Kherson region. Ukrainian officials later said that was because the speed of their reconquest had pushed forces into areas Starlink that had “geo-fenced” to prevent Russia from using the service. 

            In a late December interview, Fedorov told The Associated Press that 24,000 Starlink terminals were operating in the country, most provided by donors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805727,Suit: NFL runs 'sham' disability program for injured players,"Ten retired NFL players are accusing the league of lies, bad faith and flagrant violations of federal law in denying disability benefits in a potential class-action lawsuit filed Thursday in Baltimore.

            The men said they left the game with lingering physical or cognitive injuries that make their daily lives difficult if not excruciating. They also said they are not alone. 

            “They're a small fraction of the players who have been wronged by the NFL's disability plan. These former players deserve far more from an organization worth billions of dollars than a sham process in which there’s no chance of success,” said lawyer Chris Seeger, who separately has been class counsel in the $1 billion settlement of NFL concussion claims.











            The new lawsuit was filed in federal court in Baltimore, and names as defendants both NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL’s Disability Board. The suit comes as league officials gather in Phoenix for the Super Bowl on Sunday. 

            The NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the NFL Players Association.

            Willis McGahee, a first-round pick in 2003 who spent 11 seasons in the NFL, said he has had more than a dozen surgeries for football injuries and often needs help getting out of bed. He is 41. 

            And Eric Smith, who spent seven seasons with the New York Jets, said he struggles to play with his young sons — and fears the dark moods. 

            “There were times I would blackout and wake up … and I’m bleeding, there are holes in the wall. My wife and kids are crying,” Smith, 39, said on a videoconference call that included McGahee and lawyers. “I went down a dark path. If I ever hurt one of them, in one of these cases, that’s probably the end. Like, I’m done.” 

            The lawsuit also alleges that the doctors who examine players for the league’s disability plan have a financial interest in denying the claims, as it makes them more likely to get future referrals from the program. One neuropsychologist who was paid more than $800,000 from the program examined a group of 29 former players and found none of them was disabled, according to the lawyers. 

            Seeger, who has worked closely with NFL lawyers on the concussion case for a decade, said the latest suit seeks to have the disability plan “fulfill its overdue legal responsibilities to players rather than continue to try to dodge accountability every step of the way.” 

            A successful claim can lead to payments between $65,000 to $265,000, but only 30 of the thousands filed to date have led to top awards, according to Sam Katz, one of several lawyers working with Seeger on the case. 

            The disability program grew out of the 2011 collective-bargaining agreement between the players and the union, and was hailed a way to help ailing former players. During the pandemic, players complained of delays in having their cases reviewed.

            “I had a great run. My name has been out there. But I feel like it’s time to step up (for other players),” said Smith, who noted he had twice been knocked out during televised games. “We deserve to be taken care of at the end of the day.""

            The other former players who signed on to the lawsuit are Jason Alford (three seasons), Daniel Loper (five seasons), Michael McKenzie (11 seasons), Jamize Olaware (eight seasons), Alex Parsons (one season), Charles Sims (four seasons), Joey Thomas (three seasons) and Lance Zeno (two seasons).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805729,AP source: Pelicans trade Graham to Spurs for Richardson,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The New Orleans Pelicans have reached an agreement to trade Devonte' Graham and four second-round draft choices to San Antonio in exchange for Josh Richardson, a person familiar with the move said Thursday.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade, which came just before the league's deadline, had not been announced.

            The exchange of veteran guards provides future financial flexibility for New Orleans. Richardson has an expiring contract while Graham, who has averaged just 15 minutes of playing time off the bench this season, has two more seasons remaining on his contract at about $12 million per year.











            The Pelicans initially acquired Graham in a sign-and-trade with Charlotte during the 2021 offseason, hoping he could provide steady perimeter shooting. Graham averaged about 28 minutes on the court in his first season in New Orleans, but the fifth-year pro out of Kansas has seen his playing time fall off this season.

            The Pelicans have a number of players competing for time at shooting guard. Swing players such as Brandon Ingram and Trey Murphy III are in that spot when All-Star power forward Zion Williamson is healthy and working in the front court along with center Jonas Valanciunas and defensive-minded forward Herb Jones.

            New Orleans also took guard Dyson Daniels in the first round of last summer's NBA draft, and he was playing regularly and even starting at times before his recent ankle injury.

            Pelicans starting point guard CJ McCollum also can rotate over to shooting guard, arguably his more natural position.

            Graham's outside shooting could potentially help the Spurs. Although he is averaging just 5.3 points per game this season, he's been hitting 34.7% from 3-point range. 

            Richardson, in his eighth NBA season out of Tennessee, has largely come off the bench for San Antonio this season and has averaged 11.5 points in about 23.7 minutes per game.

            The 32-year-old Jackson is averaging 10.9 points and 3.5 assists per game while shooting 42% from the field and 35% from 3-point range. That’s a dropoff from the 16.8 points and 4.8 assists the 12-year NBA veteran averaged last season.

            The moves allows Hornets coach Steve Clifford to focus on building around young centers Mark Williams and Nick Richards, both of whom have shown promise when they've played.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805734,GOP opens 'weaponization' probe with sweeping claims of bias,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans launched the marquee investigation of their new majority Thursday with a brazen assertion that the federal government has been used against conservatives, drawing in current and former lawmakers to make a sprawling — and at times convoluted — case that national security officials, social media companies and the media have been conspiring against them.

            The first hearing of the new House panel on what Republicans assert is the “weaponization” of government, led by Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, featured partisan and sometimes misleading or even inaccurate testimony about 2016 election interference, the COVID-19 crisis and the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, including from two top Senate Republicans. Much of it focused on grievances about actions taken by federal officials when former President Donald Trump was in office.

            ""It’s clear to me that the Justice Department and the FBI are suffering from a political infection that, if it’s not defeated, will cause the American people to no longer trust these storied institutions,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in rare testimony to the House committee.











            Rather than focusing on new information, the hearing delved into long-standing conservative complaints about the Trump-Russia investigation and misjudgments by FBI officials, including anti-Trump text messages, that have been documented for years. The FBI officials whose names were repeatedly invoked have long since left the bureau.

            Sweeping in scope, the new investigation is likely to test public appetite for the kind of partisan, aggressive oversight and investigations that Republicans have made the centerpiece of their newly-minted House majority agenda. 

            It amounts to a high-profile platform for Jordan, the panel’s chairman, who after years of leveling attacks against Justice Department officials of both parties now has a committee gavel of his own to elevate his criticism and turn it into action.

            Jordan said the first panel — comprised of Grassley, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and Tulsi Gabbard a former congresswoman from Hawaii who left the Democratic Party —- was important in “framing it up.” 

            The second panel of lawyers and former FBI and Justice Department officials, Jordan said, documented the federal government's “censorship by surrogate."" 

            He added, ""Our whole objective was to sort of frame up how important this is and how serious it is. And I certainly think that happened.”

            The hearing touched on a broad array of topics, some only loosely related, but laid bare the GOP desire to use the committee as a vehicle for attacking what they say are politically-driven decisions not only in law enforcement but also by those in the technology and health care sectors.

            It also showed the complexity of issues around free speech and the free flow of information on social media, as the government is forced to keep pace with the new ways Americans communicate their sometimes polarizing politics, views and beliefs.

            Republicans attributed their claims of weaponization to private interviews with dozens of whistleblowers over the last two years, when they were in the minority. 

            Grassley, an Iowa Republican, recounted a long list of oft-cited grievances about the origins of the investigation between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and complained about what he said was unfair media coverage and criticism of his inquiry into President Joe Biden's family. 

            “They, in a sense, were basically calling us Russian stooges,” he said of attacks from Democratic colleagues. 

            
                Johnson of Wisconsin, formerly the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, in his own statement to the committee linked the last two presidential elections, the Jan. 6th attack and the government’s response to the COVID pandemic into a wide-ranging allegation of wrongdoing by federal agencies ignored or covered up by the media. 

            “I have barely scratched the surface in describing the complexity, power and destructive nature of forces that we face,"" Johnson testified. 

            But at times their testimony veered into contested or even debunked claims. 

            Grassley testified that during the 2016 election the Democratic National Committee, along with Hillary Clinton's campaign, “colluded with the Russians.” That is not an accurate characterization of what took place, and the assertion Thursday that a special counsel investigation found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia is much less nuanced than the actual finding.

            Johnson raised questions about the origins of the coronavirus during the tenure of Anthony Fauci, the former head of a National Institutes of Health office. And as the Justice Department prosecutes Jan. 6 rioters for the attack on the Capitol, Johnson claimed the investigations did not “adequately explain why the Capitol was still woefully unprepared, or how many federal agents informants were in the crowd.”

            In response, Democrats brought in Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a former constitutional lawyer and member of the Jan. 6 committee that disbanded last year, to make the opposite argument that it is congressional Republicans, not the federal government, who are weaponizing their oversight and investigative power, but against civil servants in the Biden administration. 

            And all of it, Raskin argued, is being done in an effort to find retribution for Trump as he embarks on a reelection presidential campaign in 2024. 

            “Now of course, a serious bipartisan committee focused on the weaponization of the government would zero in quickly on the Trump administration itself, which brought weaponization to frightening new levels across the board,"" Raskin said.

            Raskin, who serves as ranking Democrat of the Oversight committee, voiced concerns that GOP pursuit of federal agencies and their employees could prove to be dangerous. He noted that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have observed an increase in violent threats against those individuals and facilities over the last year.WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans launched the marquee investigation of their new majority Thursday with a brazen assertion that the federal government has been used against conservatives, drawing in current and former lawmakers to make a sprawling — and at times convoluted — case that national security officials, social media companies and the media have been conspiring against them.The first hearing of the new House panel on what Republicans assert is the “weaponization” of government, led by Republican Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805735,Nigerian universities to close for vote over security fears,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian authorities on Thursday directed all universities to shut down for nearly three weeks for this month's presidential elections, citing security concerns.

            The National Universities Commission said “concerns expressed on the security of staff, students and properties of our respective institutions,” were a factor in the decision, in a letter to universities signed by Chris Maiyaki, its deputy executive secretary.

            On Feb. 25, Nigerians will elect a successor for President Muhammadu Buhari, as well as state governors and lawmakers. An unprecedented 94 million are registered to vote.











            The decision to close the country’s more than 200 universities from Feb. 22 to March 14 followed “extensive consultations with the relevant security agencies,” Maiyaki said.

            Nigeria is battling various armed groups in its northwest and southeast, while overstretched security forces continue to fight decade-long extremist violence in the northeast. In recent years, gunmen have targeted universities in the troubled northern region, with hundreds of students abducted and later freed — sometimes in exchange for ransoms.

            In addition to ensuring the safety of students, the university closure will also let students enrolled at faculties in other parts of the country return where they're registered to vote, Haruna Lawal Ajo, the university commission's director of public affairs, told The Associated Press. Nigeria’s electoral law doesn't allow people to vote away from where they're registered.

            With students comprising 28% of the electorate, the planned closure could boost election-day turnout that has been low in previous voting. Only 34% of eligible voters cast their ballots in the 2019 presidential election, the lowest turnout since Nigeria returned to democratic rule in 1999.

            ""Most of the students are above 18 and have vote cards, they can exercise their civic right,” Ajo said.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Nigerian authorities on Thursday directed all universities to shut down for nearly three weeks for this month's presidential elections, citing security concerns.The National Universities Commission said “concerns expressed on the security of staff, students and properties of our respective institutions,” were a factor in the decision, in a letter to universities signed by Chris Maiyaki, its deputy executive secretary.On Feb. 25, Nigerians will elect a successor for President Muhammadu Buhari, as well as state governors and lawmakers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805737,Police: 2 killed when commuter train hits SUV in Florida,"DELRAY BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two people are dead after their SUV was struck by a high-speed commuter train in South Florida, the latest in a string of accidents that have plagued Brightline since its inception more than five years ago, authorities said.

            The train crashed Wednesday night in Delray Beach, south of West Palm Beach. Witnesses told police the vehicle was on the tracks when it was hit by the southbound Brightline train, officials said.

            The National Transportation Safety Board announced that it was launching a team to conduct a safety investigation of the crash.











            At least 88 deaths have now been connected to Brightline, Florida’s privately owned passenger railroad, since it began operations in July 2017, running from West Palm Beach to Miami. 

            That’s one death for approximately every 32,000 miles (51,000 kilometers) its trains travel, the highest rate among the nation’s more than 800 railroads, according to an ongoing Associated Press analysis that began in 2019. 

            Among U.S. railroads that log at least 100,000 train-miles (160,000 train-kilometers) a year, the next-highest rate since 2017 belongs to central Florida’s SunRail commuter service, which has averaged one death for every 117,000 miles (188,000 kilometers).

            None of the deaths involving Brightline have been found to be the railroad’s fault. Most have been suicides, pedestrians who tried to run across the tracks ahead of a train or drivers who maneuvered around crossing gates rather than wait. 

            Brightline this year plans to expand its service, building rails that will connect West Palm Beach and Orlando.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805738,Family: Suspect in power grid plot embraced racist ideology,"NORTH EAST, Md. (AP) — A woman accused of plotting an attack on Baltimore’s power grid wanted to draw attention to the white supremacist ideology she embraced during years spent in prison, where she acquired a Swastika tattoo and increasingly radical, racist views, family said. 

            Sarah Beth Clendaniel, who believed her days were numbered because of serious health conditions, allegedly conspired with a Florida-based neo-Nazi leader, planning to shoot out several electrical substations around Baltimore and create chaos in the majority-Black city.

            “She’s going out with a bang,” her nephew Daniel Clites told The Associated Press.











            Clendaniel’s recent arrest thwarted the planned attack, but the case has garnered national attention as authorities say the American power grid could become a vulnerable target for domestic terrorists. 

            In announcing charges against Clendaniel and her co-defendant earlier this week, federal authorities referenced “hate-fueled violence” but declined to specify how the suspects sought to fulfill a racist motive. Recent comments from Clendaniel’s relatives provide more insight. 

            “She would have no problem saying she’s racist,” Clites said. “She wanted to bring attention to her cause.”

            Clites said he disagreed with her extremist views, as did her mother, Lanette Clendaniel. They said her descent into neo-Naziism occurred against a backdrop of mental health issues and drug addiction that sometimes landed her in prison.

            “I knew what she believed, and she knew what I believed,” said Lanette, who’s raising two of Clendaniel’s children. “There was nothing I could do.”

            She said arguing with her daughter was useless. “But my philosophy is that we all live on this planet, so we better get along,” she added.

            Clendaniel befriended other white supremacists over the years — including her co-defendant Brandon Russell, who helped establish Atomwaffen Division, an obscure neo-Nazi group based in Florida. The group’s mission is civilizational collapse, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

            Together, they were planning to target five electrical substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, according to prosecutors. Both have been charged with conspiracy to destroy an energy facility. 

            Since her arrest last week, Clendaniel, 34, expects to die behind bars because her health is failing, according to her mother and nephew. 

            She allegedly told an FBI informant she wanted to “accomplish something worthwhile” before her death. In a document investigators compared to a manifesto, which mentioned Hitler and other terrorists, Clendaniel wrote she would give up “everything” to create “a chance for our cause to succeed,” according to a criminal complaint unsealed earlier this week. 

            “It would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste,” she told the informant, according to prosecutors.

            A Maryland public defender assigned to her case didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. 

            Before her latest arrest, Clendaniel was living in suburban Baltimore County, where she remained under parole supervision from a 2016 robbery case. She recently visited her mother and other relatives, including her children. 

            Lanette and Clites spoke during an interview Wednesday at their home in Cecil County where Clendenial grew up.

            An overwhelmingly white, conservative enclave in the northeast corner of Maryland bordering both Delaware and Pennsylvania, Cecil County sits about an hour outside Baltimore. The area has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity, even in recent decades. 

            In 2013, local officials allowed a local KKK group to meet inside a county administration building, according to an AP report. And in 1992, local Klan members were met with angry protesters when they held a Fourth of July recruitment drive at a nearby coastal city.

            Clites said Clendaniel would mock KKK members for being “dumb racists.” 

            After losing her father, a railroad worker who died in a car crash in 1999, Clendaniel struggled with trauma and spent much of her adolescence in institutions, including psychiatric placements and alternative schools, Lanette said. 

            As a teenager, Clendaniel was arrested for robbing a Cecil County convenience store with a butcher knife. Arresting officers noted “track marks, cuts and infections” on both her arms. She was pregnant at the time, and her attorney said she was receiving methadone treatment, according to The Cecil Whig. 

            She gave birth to her first child behind bars.

            “The prison system is just a revolving door, just another fallen system,” Lanette said. “There’s no real help” for people facing addiction. 

            Sometime after her release in 2008, Clendaniel moved to Iowa. There, she dated a man with substance abuse issues and white supremacist connections, court records show. In their shared apartment, police once found an estimated 2,000 syringes, some with the needles exposed, in the presence of a child. After her boyfriend landed in federal prison, Clendaniel returned to Maryland. 

            In 2016, she was arrested at the same convenience store in her hometown, this time for brandishing a machete and demanding cash. Police said she had a crack pipe, hypodermic needles and various pills in her possession. She later pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced to nine years in prison.

            Meanwhile, Russell was arrested in 2017 after Florida law enforcement officers responded to a double homicide involving his roommates and discovered bomb-making materials in the garage. A third roommate confessed to the killings, saying he wanted to prevent a planned terrorist attack targeting U.S. infrastructure. He said Russell, who was then serving in the Florida National Guard, knew nothing about the killings. Russell pleaded guilty to explosives charges. 

            An attorney representing Russell didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

            Sometime in 2018, while Clendaniel and Russell were incarcerated in separate prisons, they struck up a correspondence, according to federal investigators. 

            Officials declined to define the relationship or detail how they got in touch, but the criminal complaint says they discussed having kids together. Text messages linked to Russell included a statement that “going to prison was worth it because I might not have met you otherwise.”

            Clendaniel had recently mentioned Russell, but gave no indication they were plotting an attack, her mother said. She also mentioned recent power grid attacks in other states.

            Lanette said she’s been too busy raising her grandchildren to worry much about her daughter’s personal life and increasingly radical views. 

            Despite their contrasting ideologies, they found common ground in supporting Donald Trump and his anti-establishment politics. 

            Since her daughter’s arrest last week, Lanette said she’s leaned heavily into her Christian faith.

            “The Lord has a plan for each and every one of us,” she said. “I’m just taking one day at a time.”

            Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this report.NORTH EAST, Md. (AP) — A woman accused of plotting an attack on Baltimore’s power grid wanted to draw attention to the white supremacist ideology she embraced during years spent in prison, where she acquired a Swastika tattoo and increasingly radical, racist views, family said.Sarah Beth Clendaniel, who believed her days were numbered because of serious health conditions, allegedly conspired with a Florida-based neo-Nazi leader, planning to shoot out several electrical substations around Baltimore and create chaos in the majority-Black city.“She’s going out with a bang,” her nephew Daniel Clites told The Associated Press.Clendaniel’s recent arrest thwarted the planned attack, but the case has garnered national attention as authorities say the American power grid could become a vulnerable target for domestic terrorists.In announcing charges against Clendaniel and her co-defendant earlier this week, federal authorities referenced “hate-fueled violence” but declined to specify how the suspects sought to fulfill a racist motive. Recent comments from Clendaniel’s relatives provide more insight.“She would have no problem saying she’s racist,” Clites said. “She wanted to bring attention to her cause.”Clites said he disagreed with her extremist views, as did her mother, Lanette Clendaniel. They said her descent into neo-Naziism occurred against a backdrop of mental health issues and drug addiction that sometimes landed her in prison.“I knew what she believed, and she knew what I believed,” said Lanette, who’s raising two of Clendaniel’s children. “There was nothing I could do.”She said arguing with her daughter was useless. “But my philosophy is that we all live on this planet, so we better get along,” she added.Clendaniel befriended other white supremacists over the years — including her co-defendant Brandon Russell, who helped establish Atomwaffen Division, an obscure neo-Nazi group based in Florida. The group’s mission is civilizational collapse, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.Together, they were planning to target five electrical substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, according to prosecutors. Both have been charged with conspiracy to destroy an energy facility.Since her arrest last week, Clendaniel, 34, expects to die behind bars because her health is failing, according to her mother and nephew.She allegedly told an FBI informant she wanted to “accomplish something worthwhile” before her death. In a document investigators compared to a manifesto, which mentioned Hitler and other terrorists, Clendaniel wrote she would give up “everything” to create “a chance for our cause to succeed,” according to a criminal complaint unsealed earlier this week.“It would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste,” she told the informant, according to prosecutors.A Maryland public defender assigned to her case didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.Before her latest arrest, Clendaniel was living in suburban Baltimore County, where she remained under parole supervision from a 2016 robbery case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805739,"Police: Reporter pushed down, arrested had refused to leave","The arrest of a broadcast reporter who was pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference came after he got into an argument with the head of the Ohio National Guard and refused to leave, police said Thursday.

            NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was arrested Wednesday at an elementary school in East Palestine where Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was giving an update about the derailment of a train carrying toxic chemicals. Video of the arrest that followed Lambert's live broadcast during the event showed the cable news reporter facedown on the ground being handcuffed.

            Lambert was charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest, both misdemeanors. He spent about five hours in jail before being released on a $750 bond, according to court records.











            “No journalist expects to be arrested when you’re doing your job, and I think that’s really important that that doesn’t happen in our country,” Lambert said after his release.

            East Palestine Police Chief J.C. Brown said in a statement that Lambert was talking loudly while on the air from the back of the gym at the same time DeWine was speaking.

            Two Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers and Maj. Gen. John Harris Jr., commander of the Ohio National Guard, told Lambert to stop the broadcast, Brown said.

            Harris and Lambert then got into an argument and Harris told officers the reporter was coming at him in an aggressive manner and he felt threatened so he pushed Lambert away, the police chief said.

            “I instinctively put my hands on his chest to keep him from bumping into me, which I felt was inevitable if I had not protected myself,"" Harris said in a statement made to investigators and provided by his office.

            Harris said he removed his hands after less than a second and walked away after Lambert yelled that he had been assaulted, the statement said.

            Lambert was then told he needed to leave the news conference but refused several times, Brown said. The reporter was told he was being arrested and attempted to pull away while being removed from the building, Brown said.

            East Palestine detective Daniel Haueter and Columbiana County Chief Deputy Jennifer Tucker forced Lambert to the ground and handcuffed him, Brown said.

            Harris declined to comment beyond his statements to police, said Capt. Jenna Walton, public affairs officer for the National Guard. Message seeking comment were left with the county sheriff and the state patrol.

            A message also was left with Lambert's attorney.

            DeWine said he did not authorize the arrest or even see the disagreement, adding that reporters have “every right” to report during briefings.

            He told NewsNation in an interview Thursday he did not want to see Lambert jailed or prosecuted, but he stopped short of saying the charges should be dropped.

            “We would like to see this whole thing go away,” he said. “What I don’t know, again, is all the facts.”

            Michael Corn, president of news for NewsNation, said Lambert was just doing his job.

            “The many videos of this incident taken by bystanders speak for themselves,” he said. ""We will let people draw their own conclusions about how this incident was handled by the officers involved.”

            Mike Viqueira, NewsNation’s Washington Bureau chief, said Lambert handled the situation with professionalism.

            The Society of Professional Journalists said police should drop the charges and apologize, saying reporters should be able to keep the public informed without interference from law enforcement.The arrest of a broadcast reporter who was pushed to the ground and handcuffed while covering a news conference came after he got into an argument with the head of the Ohio National Guard and refused to leave, police said Thursday.NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert was arrested Wednesday at an elementary school in East Palestine where Ohio Gov.

            Makar, who has 13 goals and 45 points in 45 games this season, was hurt on a check by Pittsburgh's Jeff Carter on Tuesday night.

            Makar won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP last season when the Avalanche stopped Tampa Bay's two-year reign as NHL champions by winning a six-game Stanley Cup Final.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805751,Gun safety bills gain in Minnesota amid Democratic control,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Gun safety bills are advancing at the Minnesota Legislature, backed by Democrats who are hoping their new control of both chambers will help them pass proposals that Republicans were able to block in recent years.

            The two main bills would expand background check requirements for firearm sales and other transfers, and allow authorities to temporarily confiscate guns from people in crisis under what are commonly known as red flag laws or extreme risk protection orders. They're moving ahead as the national debate over preventing gun violence becomes increasingly polarized. 

            The former Minnesota Senate GOP majority prevented much discussion of the proposals in their body over the last several years. But Democrats gained a one-seat Senate majority in the November elections to win the trifecta — control of both chambers and the governor's office — for the first time in eight years. That's given gun safety advocates hope while putting Second Amendment activists on the defensive.











            The House Judiciary Committee approved the bills on party-line votes Thursday and sent them to what's likely to be their third and final committee stop before floor votes in the coming weeks. But it remains to be seen if there will be enough support among Senate Democrats, whose one-seat majority held firm on tough votes on abortion and climate change over the past two weeks.

            “Criminal background checks are in use all around the country,"" Democratic Rep. Dave Pinto, of St. Paul, a Ramsey County prosecutor, told the committee as it took up his bill. ""They're keeping the residents of those states safer.”

            The red flag bill would allow family members, mental health professionals and law enforcement to seek orders from judges to temporarily prohibit people in immediate danger of harming themselves or others from possessing or purchasing firearms for up to a year.

            While Minnesota already requires instant criminal background checks for gun sales at licensed dealers, that bill would extend them to most private transfers of pistols and “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons.” Police chiefs and sheriffs could deny transfer permits if they deem an applicant a danger to the public or themselves. 

            “It has been shown to be an impactful and effective tool in the states that are using it,” said Democratic Rep. Cedrick Frazier, a New Hope attorney and lead author of the red flag bill.

            While police, mental health groups and Gov. Tim Walz support both bills, the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, the National Rifle Association and Republican lawmakers are trying to fight them off.

            “This is a great one-two punch to dismantle our Second Amendment,” said Republican Rep. Brian Johnson, of Cambridge, a former Isanti County deputy.

            Democratic President Joe Biden reiterated his support for expanded background checks and red flag laws in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. But a shooting at a Target store in Nebraska last month demonstrated how gun laws can fail to keep firearms out of the hands of deeply troubled people, despite a national effort to pass red flag laws in recent years. 

            Nineteen states have red flag laws, but each new mass shooting seems to widen the political divide on who should be allowed to have guns and what types should be permitted. Disputes over gun laws on the books often wind up in court because of constitutional issues.

            Rob Doar, senior vice president of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, said in an interview that Democrats couldn't enact gun restrictions when they had the trifecta 2013-14. But some powerful rural Democratic champions of gun rights back then are now gone. Doar said their successors have been “very quiet” on where they stand, and that it's not clear whether they'll be as enthusiastic about the two proposals as their colleagues from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area.

            Senate Judiciary Chairman Ron Latz, of St. Louis Park, the chief author in his chamber of both proposals, declined to say when he'll schedule hearings on them. He said in an interview that he's ""cautiously optimistic"" about them becoming law but that the Democrats' one-seat majority and the presence of many freshmen senators who are new to the debate mean passage is not a sure thing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805752,Ukrainian driver acquitted in crash ordered to be deported,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A judge has ordered the deportation of a commercial truck driver from Ukraine who was taken into custody by immigration authorities last year shortly after he was acquitted of causing the deaths of seven motorcyclists in New Hampshire. 

            Volodymyr Zhukovskyy, 27, of West Springfield, Massachusetts, had a series of immigration hearings after he was acquitted in August on seven counts of manslaughter, seven counts of negligent homicide and one count of reckless conduct. The charges stemmed from a June 21, 2019 crash in Randolph, New Hampshire, that killed seven members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club, an organization of Marine Corps veterans and their spouses.

            Zhukovskyy's attorney has asked for asylum for his client, who came to the U.S. when he was 10 years old. His lawyers say he has permanent residency status. However, on Feb. 3, the immigration judge ordered Zhukovskyy’s removal, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review. 











            Zhukovskyy, who has been held in Pennsylvania, has until March 8 to file an appeal. 

            “I'm not going to be able to give you any comments on the record,"" his attorney, Kevin Murphy, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Zhukovskyy's family declined to comment. 

            U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ordered Zhukovskyy to be detained after the 2019 crash, and he was picked up following the verdict in New Hampshire on Aug. 9. He had been jailed in New Hampshire between the time of the crash and the verdict. 

            Motorcyclists from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island died in the accident. 

            Prosecutors argued that Zhukovskyy — who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine earlier on the day of the crash — repeatedly swerved back and forth before the collision and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blamed the lead biker, Albert “Woody” Mazza Jr., saying he was drunk and not looking where he was going when he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Zhukovskyy’s truck.

            “At this point in time and with everything that happened the way it did, it’s really superficial to me,"" Manny Ribeiro, a former Jarheads member who was injured in the crash, said of the deportation order. “In the big picture, it’s miniscule.""

            According to ICE, Zhukovskyy was previously convicted of drug possession, driving with a suspended license, furnishing false information and larceny.

            It was unclear under what circumstances he could be sent back to Ukraine, given that the country is a war zone. Details of the judge's decision were not made public. 

            In March 2022, ICE paused repatriation flights to Ukraine after the country was attacked by Russia. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also announced it was authorizing Ukrainians for Temporary Protected Status for 18 months.

            The designation “is based on both ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Ukraine that prevent Ukrainian nationals, and those of no nationality who last habitually resided in Ukraine, from returning to Ukraine safely,"" the department said.

The charges stemmed from a June 21, 2019 crash in Randolph, New Hampshire, that killed seven members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club, an organization of Marine Corps veterans and their spouses.Zhukovskyy's attorney has asked for asylum for his client, who came to the U.S. when he was 10 years old. His lawyers say he has permanent residency status. However, on Feb. 3, the immigration judge ordered Zhukovskyy’s removal, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review.Zhukovskyy, who has been held in Pennsylvania, has until March 8 to file an appeal.“I'm not going to be able to give you any comments on the record,"" his attorney, Kevin Murphy, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Zhukovskyy's family declined to comment.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ordered Zhukovskyy to be detained after the 2019 crash, and he was picked up following the verdict in New Hampshire on Aug. 9. He had been jailed in New Hampshire between the time of the crash and the verdict.Motorcyclists from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Rhode Island died in the accident.Prosecutors argued that Zhukovskyy — who had taken heroin, fentanyl and cocaine earlier on the day of the crash — repeatedly swerved back and forth before the collision and told police he caused it. But a judge dismissed eight charges related to whether he was impaired, and his attorneys blamed the lead biker, Albert “Woody” Mazza Jr., saying he was drunk and not looking where he was going when he lost control of his motorcycle and slid in front of Zhukovskyy’s truck.“At this point in time and with everything that happened the way it did, it’s really superficial to me,"" Manny Ribeiro, a former Jarheads member who was injured in the crash, said of the deportation order. “In the big picture, it’s miniscule.""According to ICE, Zhukovskyy was previously convicted of drug possession, driving with a suspended license, furnishing false information and larceny.It was unclear under what circumstances he could be sent back to Ukraine, given that the country is a war zone. Details of the judge's decision were not made public.In March 2022, ICE paused repatriation flights to Ukraine after the country was attacked by Russia. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also announced it was authorizing Ukrainians for Temporary Protected Status for 18 months.The designation “is based on both ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in Ukraine that prevent Ukrainian nationals, and those of no nationality who last habitually resided in Ukraine, from returning to Ukraine safely,"" the department said.____Associated Press reporter Michael Casey contributed to this story.",2023/02/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805755,"20 years later, Senate eyes repeal of Iraq war authorization","WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the Senate will vote to repeal two decades-old measures giving open-ended approval for military action in Iraq, raising the hopes of a bipartisan group of senators who want to reclaim congressional powers over U.S. military strikes and deployments. 

            The vote, which would come after consideration in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, could take place just before the 20th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. It would repeal the 2002 measure that greenlighted that March 2003 invasion, along with a separate 1991 measure that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War to expel Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait. 

            “Every year we keep this authorization to use military force on the books is another chance for a future president to abuse or misuse it,” Schumer said. “War powers belong squarely in the hands of Congress, and that implies that we have a responsibility to prevent future presidents from hijacking this AUMF to bumble us into a new war.” He was referring to the Authorization for Use of Military Force.











            The bill, led by Sens. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Todd Young, R-Ind., passed the Senate Foreign Relations panel and the then- Democratic-led House in 2021. But it never came up for a vote in the full Senate, despite significant bipartisan support. 

            The Iraq war authorizations “are no longer necessary, serve no operational purpose, and run the risk of potential misuse,” Kaine said Thursday. 

            The House is now led by Republicans, and it’s unclear if leaders would bring the bill up for a vote. Forty-nine House Republicans supported the legislation two years ago, but current House Speaker Kevin McCarthy opposed it. 

            The Biden administration has supported the move, arguing that ending the war authorization against Iraq of the Saddam Hussein era would make clear that the Iraq government of today is a partner of the United States. It would also remove a grievance for rival Iran to exploit, State Department officials have said. 

            But Republican opponents have argued that revoking the two authorizations for military force would signal U.S. weakness to Iran. 

            “The ayatollah is listening to this debate,” Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, when the panel debated the legislation two years ago. 

            Republicans also pointed out that President Donald Trump’s administration had cited the 2002 Iraq war resolution as part of its legal justification for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassim Soleimani. 

            Supporters of the repeal said presidents should instead come to Congress. 

            “The framers gave Congress the grave duty to deliberate the questions of war and peace, but for far too long this body has abdicated this duty,"" said Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican sponsor of the bill in the House. “We must do our job.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805756,"US Open adds NCAA champion, slight tweaks to exemptions","The U.S. Open has added the NCAA champion and Latin America Amateur champions to the list of exempt players, along with making slight tweaks to categories for players who don't have to qualify.

            Some of the changes were due to golf coming fully out of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for qualifying to be held in England and Japan for international players.

            The U.S. Open is June 15-18 at Los Angeles Country Club.











            Players who have signed on with Saudi-funded LIV Golf are still exempt from qualifying, which was expected. The Masters announced in December it was sticking to its criteria as an invitation tournament. The U.S. Open and British Open have made it clear in recent months the very nature of its name keeps it from being a closed shop.

            There was one asterisk in the exemption category for everyone who made it to the Tour Championship at East Lake. The category now reads, “players who were qualified and eligible,” with a footnote that such players must be considered eligible under PGA Tour regulations.

            Talor Gooch had enough points to finish 29th and be eligible for the Tour Championship, but he was suspended for playing in the LIV Golf league. That means he will not be exempt, unless he wins the Masters or stays in the top 60 in the world by May 22.

            The asterisk also applies to some of the new categories. The U.S. Open has created spots for the leading five players in the current FedEx Cup standings (provided they aren't already qualified) through May 22, which is the end of the PGA Championship.

            It also will exempt from qualifying the leading two players from last year's European tour's points list, and the top European points earner from this year through May 22.

            Because of travel restrictions during the pandemic, the London 36-hole qualifier has not been held the last three years. In its place was a special points list based on five European tour events for 10 players.

            The U.S. Open again will hold the qualifier in England. It will keep the special points list and offer spots to the leading two players. Now that qualifying has resumed, the U.S. Open no longer is giving spots to the money leader from tours in Asia, Australia and South Africa.

            The Masters did not create a category for the NCAA champion, rather it offered reigning champion Gordon Sargent a special invitation. It's an official category for the U.S. Open. The NCAA champion will be crowned two weeks before the Open.

            The U.S Open has strived over the years to make sure roughly half of the 156-man field has to go through qualifying.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805760,Longtime NFL veterans finding the playoff promised land,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Carlos Dunlap was tired of losing.

            He was tired of putting in the work — those soul-crushing days in the heat of training camp, the daily grind of the regular season — only to reach the playoffs and watch it all go to waste with yet another disappointing defeat.

            Six times, the veteran defensive end had played in the postseason. Six times, he went home a loser.











            “I'd done a lot of football,” Dunlap acknowledged, “without winning a playoff game.”

            Not anymore. Six months after signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, Dunlap has not one playoff win but two, and a chance to add a third — the biggest one possible — when they play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in the Super Bowl.

            “The number of guys who, you know, come to me saying they want to get it done for me, I'm very appreciative,” Dunlap said, “but I want us to get this done for us. That's why I say the job's not done. Just lock in for these next couple days and we'll have forever to celebrate. It took me 200 games to get to this one.""

            It took 205, to be exact.

            Dunlap isn't the only player Sunday with a chance to go from playoff-zero to Super Bowl hero. On the opposite sideline, Eagles pass rusher Robert Quinn had played 171 games and lost both of his previous playoff games, and cornerback Darius Slay had suited up 154 times and been 0-3 in the postseason, before their wins over the Giants and 49ers this season.

            “I was in Detroit for seven years, which was hard to get past. I’ve been to the playoffs twice when I was in Detroit and didn’t get past the first round,” said Slay, who also lost with Philadelphia in the wild-card round last season. ""I’m thankful for the Eagles trading for me to make me come over here and I’m getting to experience my first Super Bowl.”

            Some players spend their entire careers without ever having that experience.

            Take retired linebacker Takeo Spikes, who spent 15 seasons and appeared in 219 games for the Bengals, Bills, 49ers, Chargers and, yes, the Eagles. All those teams qualified for this year's postseason, incidentally, yet none made it while he was on their roster. Instead, they found themselves in the midst of teardowns, rebuilds or frustrated by near-misses.

            No player in the Super Bowl era has appeared in more games without making a single playoff appearance.

            Rian Lindell came close, though. Before he retired, Lindell had kicked in 212 games for the Bills, Seahawks and Buccaneers — coincidentally, three teams that likewise made this year's postseason but never qualified while he was around.

            Then there's the players that reached the postseason but never won a game. Tops on that list, according to Sportradar, is Jason Hanson, who kicked in 327 games over 21 years for the Lions without a single playoff victory.

            That's the dubious list that Dunlap, Quinn and Slay were on until this season.

            “It's been wild,” said Quinn, who thought he was destined to play the rest of his career in Chicago after signing a five-year, $70 million deal in April 2020, only to get traded for the third time in his career barely two years later.

            This trade turned out to be a welcome change.

            “To leave the situation in Chicago and the fashion in which it happened, and to come to an organization and be able to enjoy the success that they started building before I got here was a blessing,"" Quinn said. “It’s great to be in this position, playing in the Super Bowl after so long waiting in my career for this moment.”

            Was there ever a doubt it would happen?

            “One day at a time,” Quinn replied. “Really, one year at a time. Usually by halfway through, you’ll definitely know whether you can make it that year. This is definitely the best team I’ve been a part of.”

            That was true for both Quinn and Slay the moment the Eagles, who earned the NFC's top seed and a first-round playoff bye, romped past the Giants in the divisional round. But it was underscored when they trounced the banged-up 49ers two weeks ago, giving each an opportunity to finish the year with a Super Bowl ring.

            If they don't come through, it means that Dunlap did.

            Five straight years, he had helped the Bengals reach the playoffs, and five straight times they immediately lost in the wild-card round. When Dunlap was traded to Seattle in 2020, and cast from a rebuilding franchise to a perennial winner, he did his best to help the Seahawks clinch the NFC West, only to lose in the wild-card round again.

            Now with the Chiefs, all those letdowns have made every successful step this season so much sweeter.

            “It's been an amazing journey,” Dunlap said, “but the job's not done. That's my motto right now: job's not done.”

I’ve been to the playoffs twice when I was in Detroit and didn’t get past the first round,” said Slay, who also lost with Philadelphia in the wild-card round last season. ""I’m thankful for the Eagles trading for me to make me come over here and I’m getting to experience my first Super Bowl.”Some players spend their entire careers without ever having that experience.Take retired linebacker Takeo Spikes, who spent 15 seasons and appeared in 219 games for the Bengals, Bills, 49ers, Chargers and, yes, the Eagles. All those teams qualified for this year's postseason, incidentally, yet none made it while he was on their roster. Instead, they found themselves in the midst of teardowns, rebuilds or frustrated by near-misses.No player in the Super Bowl era has appeared in more games without making a single playoff appearance.Rian Lindell came close, though. Before he retired, Lindell had kicked in 212 games for the Bills, Seahawks and Buccaneers — coincidentally, three teams that likewise made this year's postseason but never qualified while he was around.Then there's the players that reached the postseason but never won a game. Tops on that list, according to Sportradar, is Jason Hanson, who kicked in 327 games over 21 years for the Lions without a single playoff victory.That's the dubious list that Dunlap, Quinn and Slay were on until this season.“It's been wild,” said Quinn, who thought he was destined to play the rest of his career in Chicago after signing a five-year, $70 million deal in April 2020, only to get traded for the third time in his career barely two years later.This trade turned out to be a welcome change.“To leave the situation in Chicago and the fashion in which it happened, and to come to an organization and be able to enjoy the success that they started building before I got here was a blessing,"" Quinn said. “It’s great to be in this position, playing in the Super Bowl after so long waiting in my career for this moment.”Was there ever a doubt it would happen?“One day at a time,” Quinn replied. “Really, one year at a time. Usually by halfway through, you’ll definitely know whether you can make it that year. This is definitely the best team I’ve been a part of.”That was true for both Quinn and Slay the moment the Eagles, who earned the NFC's top seed and a first-round playoff bye, romped past the Giants in the divisional round. But it was underscored when they trounced the banged-up 49ers two weeks ago, giving each an opportunity to finish the year with a Super Bowl ring.If they don't come through, it means that Dunlap did.Five straight years, he had helped the Bengals reach the playoffs, and five straight times they immediately lost in the wild-card round. When Dunlap was traded to Seattle in 2020, and cast from a rebuilding franchise to a perennial winner, he did his best to help the Seahawks clinch the NFC West, only to lose in the wild-card round again.Now with the Chiefs, all those letdowns have made every successful step this season so much sweeter.“It's been an amazing journey,” Dunlap said, “but the job's not done. That's my motto right now: job's not done.”___AP Pro Football Writer Josh Dubow in Phoenix contributed to this report.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805761,Bacharach leaves behind lush trove of romantic songs,"NEW YORK (AP) — Music played softly, almost imperceptibly, in the background of a hotel lounge where Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello talked about their songwriting collaboration, “Painted From Memory.”

            Bacharach noticed, however, that it was the instrumental version of “The Look of Love,” his song popularized by Dusty Springfield. He mischievously asked, during their 1998 interview with The Associated Press, if Costello had arranged to play it. Nope. It wasn't the first time he'd been interrupted by Bacharach's work.

            “It happens all the time,” Costello said.











            That will surely happen again, too. The composer, who died at age 94 Wednesday in Los Angeles, left behind an indelible songbook that will long outlive him.

            At its heart were the collaborations with songwriting partner Hal David and singer Dionne Warwick, 19 of them Top 40 hits. 

            “Anyone Who Had a Heart.” “Walk on By.” “I Say a Little Prayer.” “Do You Know the Way to San Jose.” “I'll Never Fall in Love Again.” “Alfie.”

            The work extended far beyond that, every title a memory and invitation to break out into song — even if you can't carry a tune.

            “Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head.” “That's What Friends Are For."" “What the World Needs Now."" “Always Something There to Remind Me.” “This Guy's in Love With You.” “One Less Bell to Answer.” “I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself.”

            “I’ve always been inclined to write romantic music, hopefully from the heart,” Bacharach said in that 1998 interview. “There are not a lot of up-tempo songs in my catalog.”

            If you hear a flugelhorn, chances are you're listening to a Burt Bacharach composition.

            The work with Costello was a milestone long after the Top 40 charts had moved on, and is being celebrated in a box set being released March 3.

            “I'm so sad to hear we've lost Burt Bacharach,” the English singer Badly Drawn Boy said on Twitter on Thursday. “Growing up in the '70s, his music somehow penetrated my soul and has remained every since. When it comes to melodic songwriting, there’s never been anyone better.”

            Bacharach's songs were often categorized, even minimized, as “easy listening,” perhaps because so many flowed freely during a tumultuous time in the nation's history. While the “Austin Powers” movies may have brought Bacharach's music to the ears of younger listeners, the cheesy context did him no favors.

            What may have been easy listening was usually quite complex, said Nathaniel Sloan, musicologist at the University of Southern California and co-host of the “Switched on Pop” podcast.

            Bacharach would frequently stretch beyond pop conventions into odd time signatures, which would challenge musicians but usually go unnoticed by regular listeners. Sloan cited the way the beat changes in “I Say a Little Prayer,” later copped by OutKast for their hit “Hey Ya.”

            Similarly, “Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head” is constructed to convey both the ominousness of life's storms and the narrator's confidence (""nothin's worrying me""), he said.

            Bacharach drew from classical and jazz music to enrich his harmonies, giving the music a memorable lushness. Think “This Guy's in Love With You.”

            “He told me he just didn't want to do anything that was milquetoast,” said songwriter Daniel Tashian, one of the last musicians to work with Bacharach extensively. “He wanted to do something that got him excited, got him fired up.”

            A debonair celebrity who married — and later divorced — actor Angie Dickinson, Bacharach seemed at ease with his musical talents compared to another 1960s genius, Brian Wilson, who often seemed tortured by them, Tashian said.

            The Beach Boys songwriter was one of the first musicians to tweet a tribute to Bacharach after his death was announced on Thursday.

            “Burt was a hero of mine and very influential on my work,” Wilson wrote.

            Tashian released the collaboration “Blue Umbrella” with Bacharach in 2020 and is finishing up two new songs they wrote together. The Nashville-based composer, writer of the Kacey Musgraves hit “Slow Burn,” got to know Bacharach through a demo he recorded with another singer who sent it to him.

            He believed Bacharach appreciated his talents and also took pity on him because Tashian couldn't read music.

            At one point in their collaboration, Tashian recorded a vocal that he knew wasn't quite right, yet hoped the authenticity of the performance outweighed a few technical flaws.

            Bacharach wasn't buying it.

            “There's nothing wrong,” the veteran composer told him, “with a little bit of perfection.”NEW YORK (AP) — Music played softly, almost imperceptibly, in the background of a hotel lounge where Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello talked about their songwriting collaboration, “Painted From Memory.”Bacharach noticed, however, that it was the instrumental version of “The Look of Love,” his song popularized by Dusty Springfield.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805762,Republican lawmakers advance transgender bill in Kentucky,"FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Republican lawmakers in Kentucky advanced a bill Thursday to allow teachers to misgender their transgender students, plunging into a culture war issue despite pleas to resist doing so from a Senate colleague whose transgender son died recently.

            The GOP-dominated Senate Education Committee heard impassioned pleas from transgender advocates warning that the measure would put transgender youths at greater risk of harm. The bill won overwhelming approval from the committee to advance to the full Senate.

            Democratic Sen. Karen Berg watched from the audience, saying later that she wanted her colleagues to ""have to make that vote in front of me.” Berg's son, Henry Berg-Brousseau, was a transgender rights advocate who died late last year at age 24. The cause was suicide, his mother said.











            “I was praying that my colleagues would have enough respect for me not, at least, to do it in the Senate,” Berg said later in an interview. “To let them do it in the House and say: ‘This session we won’t bring it here.' But clearly I was wrong.”

            The measure won committee approval a day after being introduced by Republican Sen. Max Wise, the running mate for GOP gubernatorial Kelly Craft. Craft, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, is among a dozen Republicans seeking their party’s nomination in Kentucky’s May primary. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is seeking a second term in the GOP-trending Bluegrass State.

            In a Senate floor speech promoting his new bill on Wednesday, Wise said: “School administrators and faculty are being unnecessarily pressured to conform to an agenda that has no place within our public schools. It’s time to remove these unnecessary distractions from our classrooms."" 

            Berg spoke next, urging her colleagues to ""avoid politicizing issues that are literally killing our children.”

            Craft has railed against the state's education department in campaign speeches, accusing top education leaders of “pushing woke agendas in our schools.”

            Wise said Thursday that his bill would enhance communication between schools and parents regarding health services and school curriculum around sexuality.

            The measure would prohibit education leaders from requiring policies to keep students’ information confidential from their parents, he said. Schools could choose to withhold the information if, based on past conduct, they believe the information would lead to parental abuse.

            Another key provision in the bill would prevent policies compelling school staff to use pronouns that don't conform to a student's biological sex.

            “The bill does not prevent students from requesting identification by a non-birth-conforming pronoun, nor prevent staff and students from addressing those students with non-conforming pronouns,” Wise told the committee.

            Transgender advocates pushed back, saying the bill would hurt transgender youths.

            “I was ‘out’ at school because it was so nice to have one place where I could just be myself and have people call me the right name,"" Mason Chernosky, a transgender man, said in recalling his own youth. “However, I was terrified that someone at my school was going to tell my parents.”

            If that had happened, ""everything was going to get so much worse for me,” Chernosky said.

            While his friends benefited from mental health support, he didn't seek out the assistance out of fear that school officials would tell his parents, Chernosky said.

            “That’s why I think this bill would be dangerous for the mental health of children across Kentucky,” he said. “I was one of those children whose mental health would have been harmed by this bill.”

            The bill would require that parents get two weeks’ notice and an opportunity to review materials before human sexuality instruction begins at their children's school. An alternate assignment would have to be made available for students whose parents disapprove of the instruction.

            “These are all topics and discussions that parents need to be aware of always in the upbringing of their children,” Wise said.

            The measure advances to the full Senate next and would still need House approval if it clears the Senate. Both chambers have Republican supermajorities.

            Berg said she sees political motivations driving the bill, coming amid the gubernatorial campaign.

            “I see it as a cheap way to build a base — just to say, ‘I’m stopping the wokeness.’ What is that?” she said.

            Asked about the issue on Thursday, Beshear said he was “struck by the callousness” of the bill, coming less than two months since the death of Berg's son. The governor also expressed concerns that the measure would lead to increased bullying in schools,

            “School’s hard and bullying is real,"" Beshear said at his weekly news conference. ""We ought to be really thoughtful that we don’t do things that subject our kids – anybody’s kids, no matter who they are -- to more bullying.”FRANKFORT, Ky.

            FTX founder keeps talking, ignoring typical legal strategy

            NEW YORK (AP) — Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of FTX, has been unusually talkative following the November collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange and his subsequent indictment on fraud and other charges. He’s given a series of interviews intended to present his version of events and used social media to criticize the new management of FTX. The atypical chattiness for a criminal defendant is likely causing Bankman-Fried’s attorneys to scratch their heads, or worse. Prosecutors can use any statements, tweets or other communications against him at his trial, which is scheduled for October. Bankman-Fried returned to Manhattan federal court Thursday for a hearing related to his bail package.

            Pilot shortage puts pressure on airline operations

            GOODYEAR, Ariz. (AP) — A shortage of pilots is limiting the number of flights that airlines can operate, which can cause problems during peak travel periods. The problem is most severe at small, regional airlines, but it could spread to the major carriers. In response, airlines have been in a hiring frenzy that is likely to continue for several years as the carriers replace pilots who reach the federal mandatory retirement age of 65. They are also creating new training programs for novices. Still, airline executives warn that it could take years to produce enough pilots to meet Americans’ growing desire to travel. The largest pilots’ union says airlines just need to boost pay to attract people who already have pilot licenses.

Peltz phoned into CNBC Thursday to say that his firm, Trian Fund Management, got everything it wanted with the changes imposed by Iger. Peltz last month announced that he would seek a seat on the board of the entertainment company, citing a failed succession after Iger departed about two years ago and named Bob Chapek as his replacement. Chapek floundered as the chief executive and was ousted on Iger’s return.

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is hearing about the December meltdown at Southwest Airlines. A Southwest executive said Thursday the airline is upgrading software this week to better respond to disruptions such as winter storms. The president of the pilots’ union at Southwest says Congress needs to hold the airline accountable, and give firm dates for how it will fix a crew-scheduling system that was overwhelmed in December. Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the committee holding the hearing, says there will be other snowstorms, so we need to learn why Southwest’s operation collapsed and what needs to change so it doesn’t happen again. Southwest canceled nearly 17,000 flights over the December holidays.

Figures show spirits surpassed beer for U.S. market-share supremacy, based on supplier revenues. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States made the announcement Thursday. The rise to the top was fueled in part by the resurgent cocktail culture, including the popularity of ready-to-drink concoctions. Tequila and American whiskey had strong growth. In 2022, spirits gained market share for the 13th straight year in the U.S. beverage alcohol market. Its supplier sales reached over 42%. Beer was right behind it.

Treasury yields rose, and the two-year yield hit its highest level since November. More companies announced layoffs, but the overall number across the economy remains relatively low.___Senate panel probes holiday meltdown at Southwest AirlinesWASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is hearing about the December meltdown at Southwest Airlines. A Southwest executive said Thursday the airline is upgrading software this week to better respond to disruptions such as winter storms. The president of the pilots’ union at Southwest says Congress needs to hold the airline accountable, and give firm dates for how it will fix a crew-scheduling system that was overwhelmed in December. Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the committee holding the hearing, says there will be other snowstorms, so we need to learn why Southwest’s operation collapsed and what needs to change so it doesn’t happen again. Southwest canceled nearly 17,000 flights over the December holidays.___Nevada battery recycler wins $2B loan from Energy DepartmentMCCARRAN, Nev. (AP) — A Nevada company that recycles batteries for electric vehicles has won a $2 billion green energy loan from the Biden administration. Redwood Materials, a recycling venture founded by the former chief technology officer at Tesla, secured a conditional loan from the Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, which helped Tesla more than a decade ago. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm toured Redwood’s facility in Nevada with Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo on Thursday.___Liquor before beer: Spirits beat brews in new market dataLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Producers of spirits have new bragging rights in the age-old whiskey vs. beer barroom debate. Figures show spirits surpassed beer for U.S. market-share supremacy, based on supplier revenues. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States made the announcement Thursday. The rise to the top was fueled in part by the resurgent cocktail culture, including the popularity of ready-to-drink concoctions. Tequila and American whiskey had strong growth. In 2022, spirits gained market share for the 13th straight year in the U.S. beverage alcohol market. Its supplier sales reached over 42%. Beer was right behind it.___Applications for jobless aid rise last week, but remain lowWASHINGTON (AP) — More Americans filed for jobless benefits last week, but layoffs remain historically low despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate policy intended to cool the economy and bring down inflation. Applications for jobless aid in the U.S. for the week ending Feb. 4 rose by 13,000 last week to 196,000, from 183,000 the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It’s the fourth straight week claims were under 200,000. Jobless claims generally serve as a proxy for layoffs, which have been relatively low since the pandemic wiped out millions of jobs in the spring of 2020.___Average long-term US mortgage rates inch back up this weekWASHINGTON (AP) — The average long-term U.S. mortgage rate ticked up slightly this week after four weeks of declines, a possible sign of stability that could draw in home shoppers with spring buying season weeks away. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate inched up to 6.12% this week from 6.09% last week. The average long-term rate reached a two-decade high of 7.08% in the fall as the Federal Reserve continued to raise its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and and bring down stubborn, four-decade high inflation.___The S&P 500 dropped 36.36 points, or 0.9%, to 4,081.50.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805765,Black lawmakers cite racism as Missouri House OKs crime bill,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Racial tensions in Mississippi echoed in Missouri Thursday, as Black Democratic lawmakers accused the state's Republican House leadership of racism for shutting down a Black lawmaker's speech and passing a bill that could strip power from the Black woman elected as prosecutor in St. Louis. 

            The discord in the Missouri House came just days after a similar situation in Mississippi, where Black lawmakers denounced the majority-white, Republican-led Legislature for voting to take power away from local leaders in the predominantly Black city of Jackson. 

            Like in Mississippi, Missouri's legislature has a largely white Republican majority. Most of the Black lawmakers represent the state's two largest urban areas of St. Louis and Kansas City. 











            Missouri Republicans have made anti-crime legislation a priority this session, often highlighting high crime rates in St. Louis as an impetus. The House passed legislation by a 109-35 vote that would allow Republican Gov. Mike Parson to appoint a special prosecutor to handle violent crimes in areas with high homicide rates, such as St. Louis. The bill also would expand mandatory minimum sentences for persistent felony offenders, among other things.

            State Rep. Kevin Windham, a Black Democrat from St. Louis County, was reading aloud a news article about the Mississippi situation during the House debate when some white Republican lawmakers objected that his speech had nothing to do with the Missouri legislation. 

            House Speaker Dean Plocher ruled Windham out of order, halting his speech. Windham's microphone was turned off. House Majority Leader Jon Patterson then made a motion to shut off debate on the bill, which the Republican majority voted to do — leaving other Black Democrats standing without getting a turn to speak. 

            Black lawmakers were outraged. 

            “It’s racist to not allow him to speak,” Rep. Marlene Terry, a St. Louis County Democrat who is chair of the Missouri Black Legislative Caucus, told reporters after the debate. 

            Terry said she was calling on Black leaders and community activists to come to the Capitol. 

            “From now on there’s no more peaceful – no more peaceful – it’s going to be actions,"" Terry said. ""We’re going to let them know that we are here to be heard.”

            The Rev. Darryl Gray, a St. Louis pastor and a leading racial justice activist, posted a Facebook message urging people to rally at the state Capitol next Wednesday to stand up “against state control & white suppression.” 

            Patterson defended his role in halting the debate, saying the “conversation was devolving and may have gotten worse.”

            “I don't discount any of the experiences that our Black lawmakers have had, or the white lawmakers,” Patterson told The Associated Press. “I can guarantee this — it did not play a role in me deciding that it was time to have a vote on the bill.""

            In Mississippi, tensions were stirred Tuesday by two separate votes. The Mississippi Senate voted to create a regional board to eventually take control of Jackson’s struggling water system, which is now overseen by a federally appointed administrator. Then the House voted to create a new court in part of Jackson with judges who would be appointed rather than elected.

            Democratic Mississippi state Sen. John Horhn said during a Legislative Black Caucus news conference that the actions ""amount to a symbolic decapitation of Black elected leadership.”

            Missouri's debate on Thursday was relatively brief. But the House had spent several hours debating and amending the bill the previous day. The final vote didn't fall exclusively on racial lines. Among those voting for the bill were a Black Republican lawmaker from suburban St. Louis and two Black Democratic lawmakers from Kansas City. That included Democratic Rep. Mark Sharp, who supported a provision in the bill making it a crime to discharge a firearm with criminal negligence in city limits. 

            Plocher said passage of the bill — which now heads to the Republican-led Senate — was an exciting step. 

            “We’re beginning a process to improve Missourians’ lives by cracking down on crime,"" Plocher said.

            The office of St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner issued a statement calling the legislation “a political stunt.”

            Zaki Baruti, leader of the St. Louis-based Universal African People’s Organization, described the effort to strip power from Gardner as “a move against Democracy.""

            Gardner is the first and only Black circuit attorney elected in St. Louis, and she has pursued a progressive agenda. She stopped prosecuting low-level marijuana crimes, favors diverting first-time, non-violent offenders to community programs instead of jail, and has developed an “exclusion list” of several dozen police officers who are not allowed to bring cases to her office, based in part on concerns of potential racial bias among those officers.

            “She represents the hopes and aspirations of the Black community,” Baruti said. He added: “Clearly this is an attack and not just happening here in St. Louis but across America, where when Black people seize key positions of power and do actions that some lawmakers feel that they can’t go along with, they come under tremendous attack.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805768,Zelenskyy optimistic Ukraine will get European fighter jets,"Brussels may have been the third stop on Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy's European tour but that didn't damper the excitement in the EU's capital on Thursday.The red carpet was rolled out in the European Parliament and crowds of staff lined the spiral staircase leading from the VIP entrance up to the chamber of the house, all hoping to get a glimpse of Zelenskyy — in town for an EU summit — and snap a picture on their phone.Every now and then a shout of ""Slava Ukraini"" (Glory to Ukraine) emanated from somewhere in the crowd and Zelenskyy was welcomed warmly by a beaming European Parliament President Roberta Metsola before he addressed a rapt crowd of EU parliamentarians.""A Ukraine that is winning is going to be a member of the European Union,"" Zelenskyy said to applause. It was only his second foreign trip since Russia launched a full-scale invasion on his country almost one year ago.The mood was similarly buoyant in the European Council buildings, where EU leaders congregated for talks on the increasingly tense question of migration management, and on the bloc's response to the US green spending spree, the Inflation Reduction Act.But Zelenskyy's visit, news of which had leaked earlier in the week, undoubtedly stole the show on Thursday.Dressed in a black sweatshirt, combat trousers and sturdy boots, Zelenskyy stood out among the sharp tailoring and formal attire of other leaders when posing in the traditional pre-summit line-up photo.He certainly got a warm welcome, ample ceremony and pomp — not to mention the photo opportunities. But did he actually get what he came for?The Ukrainian president's main messages in London, Paris and Brussels were pleas for long-range missiles and fighter jets to beef up his armed forces, and (to the EU) the necessity of rapid entry into the bloc.In London on Wednesday, he made progress, with British promises to train Ukrainian pilots to fly NATO-standard aircraft. Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Zelenskyy also said there had been movement towards a solution on the question of long-range missiles.Zelenskyy also indicated to reporters that European allies would provide fighter jets, but made no concrete announcements. ""Europe will be with us until our victory. I've heard it from a number of European leaders... about the readiness to give us the necessary weapons and support, including the aircraft,"" he said at a press conference.In addition, Zelenskyy hinted that decisions had been made in both London and Paris (where he met French President Emmanuel Macron as well as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz) that could not yet be announced.Whether this is spin or whether a deal on jets will soon materialise remains to be seen. No major announcements were made by EU leaders themselves.Kyiv has been lobbying its Western allies for modern warplanes in recent weeks. The US and many European countries have been heavily arming Ukraine since the outbreak of the war but most are concerned that supplying planes and missiles could escalate or even expand the conflict by equipping Kyiv to strike deep inside Russian territory. Moscow certainly sees the move as provocative.Bruno Lete, a fellow from the German Marshall Fund in Brussels, told DW he believed that Kyiv would soon get its hands on the fighter jets it wants despite misgivings among allies. ""Red lines are a purely political concept, and they adapt to the reality of battlefields,"" he said.Where Zelenskyy looks set to go home empty-handed is on EU accession. Standing alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, Zelenskyy said he wanted the bloc to open formal negotiations this year already, and that this was a question of morale for the armed forces.Von der Leyen said only that there was ""no rigid timeline"" for accession, and that it was ""a merits-based process,"" depending on how quickly a candidate could enact the necessary reforms.Ukraine was named an EU candidate country last year, but few in Brussels – Lete included - believe there is any chance of Kyiv joining very soon.EU accession is a highly complex process, typically taking years or even decades of often difficult reform. A long-standing concern in Ukraine is corruption. Allowing Kyiv to queue-jump into the EU would likely anger other candidates.""I don't think there will be any further enlargement of the EU before there are reforms,"" Lete said. Germany has made it clear it wants treaty change first, he pointed out.""Ukraine is huge. It's 40 million people,"" Lete said. Kyiv joining would ""fundamentally alter the power structures in the EU. Think about the seats in the European Parliament big countries will have to give up. Think about something like EU subsidies to agriculture."" Big recipients like France or Poland would have to give some of their share to farming-heavy Ukraine, he said. ""It's really about power and money.""Zelenskyy knows accession won't happen so quickly, Lete said, but pushing harder on accession means Ukraine could get a good deal on trade and single market access. ""In politics, you have to ask for the maximum in order to get the thing in the middle.""Additional reporting by Jack Parrock

                Ashland County District Attorney David Meany told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Thursday that there isn’t enough evidence to show former Senate Minority Leader Janet Bewley acted in a criminally negligent or reckless way. He added that police and Wisconsin State Patrol investigators haven’t referred charges to his office, either. 

            Alyssa Ortman, 27, and daughter Khaleesi Fink were killed in the crash July 22 in Ashland County. Police say Bewley, 70, pulled out onto a highway in front of Ortman’s car. Ortman collided with Bewley, then spun across the median into the path of another vehicle, driven by Jodi Munson.











            
                Ortman was traveling at 100 mph, nearly 60 mph over the speed limit, at the time of the crash, according to Wisconsin State Patrol investigation records. State troopers found a vape pen in her car containing Delta8, a compound similar to marijuana. 

            Police have reported that Bewley was distracted by a hands-free mobile phone at the time of the crash. Bewley also told police she had had cataract surgery on one eye the day before but her eyesight was fine. 

            Meany told the Journal Sentinel that nothing suggests that she had stopped using the hands-free feature when the crash happened or that her vision was impaired.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805770,US Postmaster general delivers upbeat report to governors,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said there is new ""energy, focus and improvement” across the Postal Service, and he touted upcoming electric delivery trucks as making the Postal Service a leader in carbon footprint reduction during an upbeat report to postal governors on Thursday.

            The Postal Service made improvements consistent with a 10-year plan in the latest quarter that included the busy holiday period and election ballots, DeJoy told the governors.

            “This is a new Postal Service recognizing it’s a new day in a new economy, and we’re leading the way to improve this cherished institution,” he said.











            Customers will notice a visible change when new delivery trucks start hitting the mail routes. 

            The post office said it is spending nearly $10 billion to electrify its aging fleet, including installing a modern charging infrastructure at postal facilities and ensuring 66,000 of 106,000 new delivery trucks will be battery powered. The spending includes $3 billion provided by Congress.

            The upbeat mood accompanied positive financial news, with revenue growing even though volume was down across all categories, some of which reflected a return to normalcy after the pandemic.

            The Postal Service’s operating revenue was $21.5 billion for the quarter, an increase of $206 million, even though volume declined by 1.7 billion pieces, or 4.8%, compared with the same period last year.

            All told, the Postal Service reported a net loss of $1 billion for the first quarter. But that was a $519 million improvement over the $1.5 billion net loss during the same period last year.

            It wasn’t all good news. Governor Ronald Stroman expressed concern about a “dramatic escalation” of mail theft and robberies of letter carriers, saying they are “now almost a daily occurrence.” The Postal Service is hardening mail receptacles and mail vehicle locks and working with the law enforcement to reverse the trend, he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805771,SpaceX ignites giant Starship rocket in crucial pad test,"SpaceX is a big step closer to sending its giant Starship spacecraft into orbit, completing an engine-firing test at the launch pad on Thursday.

            Thirty-one of the 33 first-stage booster engines ignited simultaneously for about 10 seconds in south Texas. The team turned off one engine before sending the firing command and another engine shut down — “but still enough engines to reach orbit!” tweeted SpaceX's Elon Musk.

            Musk estimates Starship’s first orbital test flight could occur as soon as March, if the test analyses and remaining preparations go well.











            The booster remained anchored to the pad as planned during the test. There were no signs of major damage to the launch tower.

            NASA is counting on Starship to ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon in a few years, linking up with its Orion capsule in lunar orbit. Further down the road, Musk wants to use the mammoth Starships to send crowds to Mars.

            Only the first-stage Super Heavy booster, standing 230 feet (69 meters) tall, was used for Thursday's test. The futuristic second stage — the part that will actually land on the moon and Mars — was in the hangar being prepped for flight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805772,Former worker at US women's prison sentenced for sex abuse,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A former worker at a federal women's prison in California was sentenced Thursday to 20 months in prison for sexually abusing an inmate.

            U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sentenced Enrique Chavez to four more months than prosecutors recommended. His term will be followed by 10 years of supervised release.

            Chavez pleaded guilty in October to one count of abusive sexual contact with a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institute, Dublin in the San Francisco Bay Area.











            Chavez was the fifth employee at the Dublin prison to be charged with sexual abuse of inmates since June 2021. Others included the prison’s former warden and a chaplain. 

            Federal prosecutors said Chavez was a food service foreman at Dublin in 2020 when he locked the door to the pantry and fondled an inmate.

            The former warden, Ray Garcia, was convicted in December of molesting inmates and forcing them to pose naked in their cells. 

            Garcia was charged with abusing three inmates between December 2019 and July 2021. He was found guilty of all eight charges and faces up to 15 years in prison.

            The former chaplain, James Theodore Highhouse, was sentenced to seven years in prison.

            Last year, an Associated Press investigation revealed years of sexual misconduct at FCI Dublin. The AP also detailed steps that were taken to keep abuse secret, such as ignoring allegations, retaliating against whistleblowers and sending prisoners to solitary confinement or other prisons for reporting abuse.

            The U.S. Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons convened a task force of 18 senior executives to visit Dublin, examine conditions and meet with inmates and staff members.OAKLAND, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805773,Eagles deep run game fuels Super Bowl run,"PHOENIX (AP) — While the fight song for the Philadelphia Eagles may be “Fly, Eagles Fly,” the offensive formula that carried the team to the Super Bowl was more grounded.

            With a trio of capable running backs, one of the best running quarterbacks and a dominating offensive line, the Eagles eschewed the pass-happy approach that has taken over the league in recent years to rely more on the ground game to overwhelm opponents physically.

            “It’s like a boxing match,” running backs coach Jemal Singleton said. “Hopefully we’re getting enough body blows in the first and second quarter that when it comes to the third and fourth quarter, those body blows get a little bit heavier and you start to diminish your opponent a little bit. That’s part of what we try to do is just stay physical throughout the game.”











            Few teams have done that as well as the Eagles, who have run the ball on half their offensive plays and averaged 153.9 yards rushing per game, including the playoffs — which would be the highest mark for a Super Bowl champion since the 1998 Denver Broncos. Philadelphia's 39 TD runs are the most ever in a season.

            The Eagles have a variety of options to fuel the running game with Miles Sanders leading the way with a career-high 1,269 yards and 11 TDs in a contract year.

            “This year was kind of one of those years where I just wanted to make everybody feel me,” Sanders said. “So I just took it upon myself to just control what I could control and just go out there and ball out every game, every time I touch the ball and make everybody pay for it.”

            He has done that and gotten plenty of help from Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell, as well as quarterback Jalen Hurts. Gainwell leads the team with 160 yards rushing this postseason, with Scott adding two TD runs. 

            “It’s a really cool situation because we are all able to do pretty much everything you want,” Scott said. “Whatever is asked of us, whether it’s pass-block, running routes, running in between the tackles, outside speed, we can all do it. It’s not really a situation where defense is going to be like, OK, this guy’s in and he’s doing this and that. It kind of helps us be unpredictable.”

            While some teams try to fool defenses with motion, the Eagles prefer a more static approach, believing a line led by All-Pro center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson can control the trenches without using deception.

            Philadelphia used motion on just 34% of running plays — about 10 percentage points lower than the next-lowest team. 

            “You might know what’s coming, but the NFL is all about matchups,"" Johnson said. “So they’re going to put matchups on and create matchup problems for the D-line, for linebackers with our schemes and what we do.”

            While the backs get the majority of the yards on the ground, the threat of Hurts running fuels the run game for the Eagles. They were held to 154 yards rushing in the two games he missed with a shoulder injury — about half their season average.

            Hurts has rushed for 833 yards in his 17 starts with his 15 touchdown runs the most ever for a quarterback in the regular season and playoffs combined. 

            But just his presence is what makes the run game so successful.

            “Even if he’s handed the ball off, he may hold a guy for one step that allows us to hit a crease and gain 10 more yards we wouldn’t have gotten had he not been a threat as a runner,” Singleton said. “He’s a big part of our run game, a big part of what we do. I wouldn’t say honorary member, he might be the president of the entire deal.”

            The Chiefs use a different philosophy offensively, leaving the ball in Patrick Mahomes' hands to win by the pass.

            Kansas City threw the ball on nearly 62% of offensive plays in the regular season, which would be the second-highest mark ever by a team to win the Super Bowl, behind only Tampa Bay in 2020.

            They know slowing the Eagles run game down and forcing Hurts to pass will be key to their success on Sunday. But that won't come easily.

            “The talent is in the players No. 1, the scheme No. 2, and then you put a quarterback in there that can do the things he can do, that makes them really difficult to defend,” defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. “You have to be on point with scheme. Players have to be on point with responsibility. You can see when that doesn't happen with people they've played, they expose them.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805774,Cavaliers not expecting buyout with veteran Kevin Love,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Kevin Love wasn't moved at the NBA's trade deadline, and the Cavaliers don't expect him to leave anytime soon.

            Although Love has been dropped from Cleveland's rotation, Cavs president of basketball operations Koby Altman said Thursday he has not had any discussions with the five-time All-Star or his agent about a contract buyout.

            ""I have not been approached by them at all and I don’t anticipate it either,” Altman said shortly after the deadline passed without the Cavs changing their roster.











            Cleveland explored several trades, but Altman, who acquired All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell in a swap last summer, decided to stand pat.

            “We just didn’t feel like anything was going to really move the needle for us,” he said. “We could have made a move that was lateral, multiple moves that were lateral that I didn’t think appreciably made us better.”

            Love's situation is another matter.

            His four-year, $120 million contract expires after this season, so there had been speculation Love might draw trade interest from teams looking to use his deal ($28.9 million) as an asset to clear salary-cap space.

            That didn't happen, so Love is in Cleveland — for now.

            Love, who has been one of the the Cavaliers' core players since 2014, hasn't played in the last five games despite being healthy. With forward Dean Wade recently returning from injury and coach J.B. Bickerstaff tinkering with lineup combinations for his young team, Love is the odd man out.

            “It’s not easy for Kevin, I’m sure,” Altman said. “I’ve had conversations with him. He wants to play. I think he’ll have an opportunity to play again this year. But where we’re at now, I think J.B. is really comfortable with the rotation that we have.”

            The Cavs are currently fourth in the Eastern Conference and poised to make the playoffs for the first time since 2018, when they made the last of four straight Finals appearances with LeBron James.

            Love struggled earlier this season while playing with a thumb injury. He's averaging 8.5 points and 6.8 rebounds in 20 minutes.

            And while the 34-year-old's most productive days are behind him, the Cavs still value Love and Altman believes he can still have a major on-court impact at some point this season — or in the playoffs.

            “We’re asking Kevin to make another sacrifice this year,” Altman said, “to do what he’s doing right now, which is be a great teammate, stay positive every day, stay ready and work on your body, work on your shot, work on everything to be ready for when that opportunity comes next.”

            Love has not publicly expressed any frustration with his reduced role.

            It's possible he could ask the Cavs for a buyout. However, Love, who has been the subject of trade speculation almost since he arrived nine years ago, has spoken about how much he enjoys being part of a team building toward another title run.

            There has also been some internal discussion about Love staying with the organization beyond this season.

            The Cavs acquired Love in 2014 in a trade from Minnesota.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805775,Wary residents return home after toxic train derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Hours after being told she could go home for the first time since a train hauling chemicals derailed and later sent up a toxic plume near the Pennsylvania state line, Melissa Henry nervously walked inside her house.

            First, she washed her sheets and pillow cases. Then she started throwing out everything left on her kitchen counters. She opened all of her windows too, hoping to air out whatever might have seeped inside while fearful of the air outside too.

            “Was that the right thing to do or not? You just don’t know,” she said Thursday. “It was a nightmare, it still is.”











            Residents forced to evacuate the Ohio village of East Palestine began trickling home after being told Wednesday that hundreds of air samples showed no dangerous levels of toxins following the controlled release and burn of five tankers that were among nearly 50 cars that derailed last Friday.

            Some, including Henry, came back within the first few hours while others were waiting to see the results of air sampling inside their homes before returning.

            “I was a nervous freaking wreck last night,” she said. “My kids are here that’s my biggest concern.”

            Henry and her two boys had stayed with her parents for nearly five days while waiting for the derailment to be cleaned up. She left on Saturday before the mandatory evacuations were ordered because her youngest son's “eyes turned red as tomato and he was coughing a lot,” she said.

            Since coming home, she and the boys have been washing clothes, changing filters in the furnace and scrubbing down just about everything. “I don’t know if that’s going to work, but we have to do something,” she said.

            Mayor Trent Conaway acknowledged people remain frustrated by lingering odors, and promised the village is “not just taking the word"" of rail operator Norfolk Southern Railway and has Environmental Protection Agency representatives involved in air testing. The village’s drinking water system is being tested daily and is safe, he said.

            The mayor expressed frustration that trains started running through the area again right after the evacuation order was lifted, and said that was sooner than he’d expected.

            He said his primary concern is his residents and their health, and he promised to hold Norfolk Southern accountable.

            “This isn’t going to get swept under the rug. I’m not going to be the country bumpkin that gets, you know, talked over by a big corporation,"" Conaway said. ""We’re going to hold their feet to the fire. They’re going to do what they said they were going to do, and they’re going to protect the people of this town.”

            About 300 requests for air testing in homes have been received so far, Columbiana County EMA Director Peggy Clark said. The testing takes a half-hour for each home, and is being handled by four teams working 10 hours a day, she said.

            James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday it was unlikely there be would any dangerous levels of toxins inside any homes or businesses based on readings from air monitors around the community.

            Schools in East Palestine, which were closed all week because of the derailment, tentatively plan to reopen Monday but will remain closed this week to deep-clean buildings and have HVAC systems inspected.

            Mallory Burkett, who lives just outside the area where residents were forced to leave but decided to evacuate on her own, said it was strange feeling to return.

            “Nobody really knows what this is going to do,” Burkett said. “Ten years from now is when we’ll really know.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805776,Man convicted in St. Paul bar shootout that killed 1,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A man involved in a gunfight at a crowded bar that left one person dead and more than a dozen wounded in St. Paul was convicted Thursday of eight counts of attempted murder.

            Prosecutors said Devondre Phillips, 30, of Las Vegas, and another man, Terry Lorenzo Brown, 34, shot at each other on Oct. 10, 2021, at the Seventh Street Truck Park bar near downtown.

            Marquisha Wiley, a 27-year-old bystander from St. Paul, was killed, and at least 15 others including Brown and Phillips were wounded, as bar patrons fled in panic. 











            The criminal complaint said officers arriving at the bar found a chaotic scene, with multiple people being treated for gunshot wounds and spent shell casings and bullet fragments all over the floor. 

            Phillips will be sentenced March 27. 

            Defense attorney John Lesch argued that his client acted in self-defense when he fired a 9 mm handgun he bought the same night in the Truck Park parking lot because he felt threatened by Brown and others, The St. Paul Pioneer-Press reported. 

            Phillips testified at trial that conflicts with Brown and two of Brown’s friends had escalated since June 2021, including four violent encounters.

            He said he fired when one of Brown’s friends approached him with a gun in his waistband and said, “Caught ya, you’re dead.” 

            Assistant Ramsey County Attorney Treye Kettwick told the jury in closing arguments that video surveillance and photos showed Phillips shot first at Brown's friend and then toward Brown.

            According to the complaint, Brown told investigators that he and Phillips were in conflict because of allegations of domestic abuse against Brown. He also said that Phillips shot him first and Brown returned fire.

            Brown, 34, who is charged with second-degree murder and 11 counts of attempted murder, is scheduled for trial on April 3. Prosecutors have said he fired the shot that killed Wiley, KARE-TV reported.

(AP) — A man involved in a gunfight at a crowded bar that left one person dead and more than a dozen wounded in St. Paul was convicted Thursday of eight counts of attempted murder.Prosecutors said Devondre Phillips, 30, of Las Vegas, and another man, Terry Lorenzo Brown, 34, shot at each other on Oct. 10, 2021, at the Seventh Street Truck Park bar near downtown.Marquisha Wiley, a 27-year-old bystander from St. Paul, was killed, and at least 15 others including Brown and Phillips were wounded, as bar patrons fled in panic.The criminal complaint said officers arriving at the bar found a chaotic scene, with multiple people being treated for gunshot wounds and spent shell casings and bullet fragments all over the floor.Phillips will be sentenced March 27.Defense attorney John Lesch argued that his client acted in self-defense when he fired a 9 mm handgun he bought the same night in the Truck Park parking lot because he felt threatened by Brown and others, The St. Paul Pioneer-Press reported.Phillips testified at trial that conflicts with Brown and two of Brown’s friends had escalated since June 2021, including four violent encounters.He said he fired when one of Brown’s friends approached him with a gun in his waistband and said, “Caught ya, you’re dead.”Assistant Ramsey County Attorney Treye Kettwick told the jury in closing arguments that video surveillance and photos showed Phillips shot first at Brown's friend and then toward Brown.According to the complaint, Brown told investigators that he and Phillips were in conflict because of allegations of domestic abuse against Brown. He also said that Phillips shot him first and Brown returned fire.Brown, 34, who is charged with second-degree murder and 11 counts of attempted murder, is scheduled for trial on April 3. Prosecutors have said he fired the shot that killed Wiley, KARE-TV reported.Wiley’s family members declined to comment Thursday after the verdict was read.The Seventh Street Truck Park bar is in an entertainment district just south of the Xcel Energy Center, where the NHL’s Minnesota Wild play.",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805777,South Dakota lawmakers seek foreign-owned land investigation,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota lawmakers are advancing a number of bills that would curb Chinese influence in South Dakota's farmland amid concerns among Republican leaders after a spy balloon was spotted and shot down last week.

            Republican Rep. Will Mortenson proposed Thursday investigating partnerships between landowners and foreign entities. It comes a week after other lawmakers pushed forth other propositions tackling foreign influence, like banning contracts between state land and foreign countries, and establishing a committee to oversee future foreign purchases. 

            “We don't know what we don't know, and we're going to start finding out so we can make the next step,” Mortenson said, after his bill passed a house committee vote with a unanimous vote. 











            The proposals stem from Republican Gov. Kristi Noem’s recent history of curbing the state’s relationship with China. Last year, she banned state employees and contractors from accessing the video platform TikTok on state-owned devices, citing its ties to China. She also said late last year that the state held no direct investments in China after a review.

            Noem’s emphasis on her perception of threats posed by China comes as she plans for a series of three policy speeches in Washington that seem to portend the rollout of a possible 2024 bid for the Republican presidential nomination.

            Next week, according to a person familiar with Noem's plans, Noem will use one of the three speeches — a Feb. 15 address at the America First Policy Institute — to highlight South Dakota’s response to the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. She’ll also discuss an executive order, which Noem signed last month, barring the state from engaging in business with some telecom companies owned or controlled by “evil foreign governments,” including China, according to the executive order. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the person is not yet authorized to speak about Noem's plans publicly. 

            Alan Vester, Noem's deputy general counsel, testified Thursday in support of the bill that would provide further insight into the how much of South Dakota's land is owned by foreign governments. 

            “Gov. Kristi Noem believes strongly in protecting our state from maligned foreign governments from acquiring foreign agricultural land to the detriment of our state’s security, critical infrastructure or food security,” Vester said. 

            Last week, Republican Sen. Erin Tobin proposed an act to create the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to regulate foreign purchases of agricultural land from out-of-country buyers. This oversight is intended to curb international influence in the state’s food supply and will be heard further by a Senate committee on agriculture and natural resources Feb. 14.

            Tobin has been in discussion with states like North Dakota, where China’s government bought a tract of land near their air force base. She said that was an eye-opener to the rest of the country about the lack of knowledge about who's taking ownership in state land and for what purpose, like spying. The committee would do a deep dive to investigate the motives behind any foreign purchase by looking at the buyer’s history.

            “You realize that China’s kind of coming in the front door and nobody’s putting any restrictions on anything,” Tobin said. “When you really start paying attention and looking at what’s happening, you get even more concerned.” 

            
                Foreign entities and individuals control less than 3% of U.S. farmland, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, those with ties to China control less than 1%, or roughly 600 square miles (340 square kilometers).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805782,Lens beats Lorient to reach French Cup quarterfinals,"LORIENT, France (AP) — Facundo Medina converted the final spot kick to send Lens to the French Cup quarterfinals in a 4-2 penalty shootout win over Lorient after the teams were tied 1-1 in regulation time Thursday.

            The visitors took the lead in the 21st minute when Angelo Fulgini tapped home after goalkeeper Vito Mannone had palmed a cross from Ismael Boura into the path of the Lens midfielder.

            Lorient midfielder Enzo Le Fee leveled the round-of-16 game with a dipping free kick in the 84th to force a penalty shootout.











            All the Lens players converted their spot kicks while Le Fee hit the bar before Ibrahima Kone had his penalty saved by goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca.

            “We’re not going to hide, it’s an objective to go and win the Cup,” Leca told BeIN Sports television. “We tinkered a bit. But in spite of that, I think we still had a good game.”

            Lens has been runner-up three times but has never won the French Cup. The team will visit Cup holder Nantes next month in the only quarterfinal game between two top-tier teams.

            In the other quarterfinal games, Marseille will host Annecy, Grenoble will visit Lyon, and Toulouse will face Rodez.

            Sitting in third place in the French league, Lens shuffled its starting lineup by making seven changes ahead of a tough game against Lyon this weekend.

            Lens had an opportunity to double the lead on the stroke of halftime, but Mannone turned David Pereira da Costa’s low strike around the post.

            Lorient, which won the French Cup in 2002, raised its game in the second half. But Leca saved Le Fee’s long-range strike in the 51st and palmed away a curling shot from Yoann Cathline in the 67th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805784,California movie producer gets 5 years in prostitution case,"NEW YORK (AP) — A California movie producer was sentenced in New York City to the maximum five years in prison Thursday after he admitted operating a high-end prostitution service for seven years, providing women to wealthy clients for up to $15,000 and organizing sex parties in the U.S. and abroad.

            Dillon Jordan, of Lake Arrowhead, California, was sentenced in Manhattan. U.S. District Judge John P. Cronan said he would have imposed a longer prison sentence if he had the authority to do so, citing the permanent physical and emotional scars the women sustained.

            Jordan pleaded guilty to a conspiracy count and five years was the maximum sentence available.











            Prosecutors said Jordan operated the business from 2010 to 2017 through a purported party and event planning company and his actual movie production company.

            They said in a presentence submission that Jordan tried to parlay his prostitution business to produce legitimate movies, since several investors and well-known producers were also clients of his prostitution ring. At least one client invested $250,000 in Jordan's movie projects, they said.

            Jordan is listed among dozens of producers on films including the 2018 film “The Kindergarten Teacher,” which featured Maggie Gyllenhaal, and the 2019 movie “The Kid,” which starred Ethan Hawke.

            At sentencing, Jordan apologized to the victims.

            One victim who spoke during the two-hour hearing said she nearly died a decade ago when Jordan invited her to a party and then fed her a mix of drugs that left her permanently brain damaged.

            “I never wanted to prostitute my body,” she said, pausing to collect herself before urging the maximum sentence.

            The judge said prison was appropriate for a man who operated a prostitution ring that earned him at least $1.4 million.

            “To be sure, this was an illegal operation that Dillon Jordan ran and one that caused real harm to real women. And, as we saw today, permanent harm,” Cronan said.

            Prosecutors said Jordan was released from a prison in Cuba in 2010 after serving eight years for sex crimes there, and he immediately began linking wealthy individuals he knew with high-end prostitutes, charging between $3,000 and $15,000 per encounter. The government said he pocketed about 40% of the fee.

            They said he once boasted that 75 women worked for him, including some he sent abroad to a madam in the United Kingdom.

            In a presentence submission, defense lawyers wrote that Jordan entered the sex industry after a “horrific childhood that was replete with physical, sexual, and psychological abuse” but left the prostitution business in 2017 and established himself in the film business before becoming a home design consultant.

            They said he was not a traditional pimp, but rather was paid fees to organize parties with adult sex workers or to arrange large events, or to book women to attend bachelor parties and adult-themed shows.

            U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a release that Jordan had “operated and profited from an extensive prostitution business that catered to wealthy men and was predicated on the exploitation of young women.”NEW YORK (AP) — A California movie producer was sentenced in New York City to the maximum five years in prison Thursday after he admitted operating a high-end prostitution service for seven years, providing women to wealthy clients for up to $15,000 and organizing sex parties in the U.S. and abroad.Dillon Jordan, of Lake Arrowhead, California, was sentenced in Manhattan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805785,Slain cinematographer's Ukrainian relatives sue Alec Baldwin,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Ukrainian relatives of a slain cinematographer are seeking damages in her death from actor Alec Baldwin in connection with a fatal shooting on the set of a Western movie, under a civil lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles.

            The new lawsuit against Baldwin was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Hutchins' parents and younger sister, who works as a nurse on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv and is married to a Ukrainian man fighting in the war against Russia.

            Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie “Rust"" in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.











            The new lawsuit alleges negligence and the depravation of benefits, based on the emotional or financial support that Hutchins previously provided to younger sister Svetlana Zemko and parents Olga Solovey and Anatolii Androsovych. The lawsuit also names as defendants a long list of “Rust” crew members, an ammunition supplier, producers of the film and affiliated businesses.

            Separately, Baldwin and weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed are confronting felony criminal charges of involuntary manslaughter in New Mexico District Court, with a remote first appearance scheduled later this month in which pleas may be entered. Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed have vowed to dispute the charges, while an assistant director has agreed to plead guilty to lesser charges.

            Los Angeles-based attorney Gloria Allred described Zemko as a working emergency operating-room nurse who is raising an infant and 4-year-old child while her husband fights in the war.

            At a news conference, Allred said that Zemko “had a very close and loving relationship with her big sister, Halyna, and she feels strongly that anyone who is responsible for her loss must be held accountable.”

            Contacted Thursday, an attorney for Baldwin in New Mexico had no immediate comment.

            The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as legal costs. Allred declined to quantify possible demands.

            Matthew Hutchins, widower to Halyna Hutchins, reached an undisclosed settlement with Baldwin and other producers of Rust late last year. Part of the settlement calls for Matthew to be a producer on “Rust” as it potentially resumes filming.

            Baldwin has sought to clear his name by suing people involved in handling and supplying the loaded gun. Baldwin, also a co-producer on “Rust,” said he was told the gun was safe.

            In his lawsuit, Baldwin said that while working on camera angles with Hutchins, he pointed the gun in her direction and pulled back and released the hammer of the weapon, which discharged.

            The new lawsuit against Baldwin, though filed in California, relies on provisions of New Mexico state law regarding the depravation of benefits, also known as “loss of consortium.”SANTA FE, N.M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805786,Chicken farmers say their eggs could help reduce prices,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — U.S. chicken producers want to do their part to bring down current soaring egg prices by selling their 400 million surplus eggs to food producers.

            But first they have to convince the FDA to change the rule that prevents eggs laid by chickens in the meat industry to be used for human consumption.

            Egg prices have surged over the past year thanks to the ongoing bird flu outbreak and the highest inflation in decades, prompting calls for a price-gouging investigation. The national average retail price of a dozen eggs hit $4.25 in December, up from $1.79 a year earlier, according to the latest government data.











            The National Chicken Council trade group submitted a formal petition to the Food and Drug Administration Thursday asking officials to drop a rule passed in 2009 that keeps chicken producers from selling their excess eggs because they aren't refrigerated right away. 

            “Already faced with record egg prices, consumers might be hit even harder in their wallets as we head into the Easter season unless FDA provides us with a pathway to put these eggs to good use,” said Ashley Peterson, the trade group’s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs.

            The bird flu outbreak has had an outsized impact on egg prices because more than 43 million of the 58 million birds that have been slaughtered to help control the spread of the virus have been egg-laying hens. But egg farmers have also been grappling with high feed, fuel and labor costs that have contributed to the rising prices.

            It’s not clear exactly how big of an impact the eggs chicken producers want to sell might have on prices because there are roughly 100 billion eggs a year produced in the U.S., so adding 400 million more to the market may not have a huge effect. 

            The FDA said it would review the Chicken Council's petition and respond directly to that group. But concerns about food safety are what drove them to adopt the rule that prohibited the sale of the eggs in the first place.

            When a broiler hatchery produces eggs, they are kept at 65 degrees until they are ready to be placed in incubators to be hatched. The FDA said in its rule that eggs that are going to be used for food need to be stored at temperatures below 45 degrees within 36 hours.

            The Chicken Council said it believes the eggs would be safe because they would be pasteurized before they were used by food producers. The eggs that chicken producers don't need to produce more chickens for meat production wouldn't be sold to consumers in grocery stores. Instead they would go to makers of food products and processed eggs that are sold to bakers and other food companies.

            The Chicken Council estimates that this FDA rule prohibiting the sale of these eggs costs chicken farmers about $27 million a year because currently the eggs are either thrown away, rendered or used for animal food. 

            But the United Egg Producers trade group said it would be a bad idea to relax food safety rules to allow these eggs laid by chicken producers to be sold.

            “The safety of eggs is always the priority for America’s egg farmers, as is firm compliance with all regulatory requirements related to food safety,"" said Oscar Garrison, the egg trade group’s vice president of food safety regulatory affairs. “United Egg Producers opposes the petition by the National Chicken Council because it does not comply with the egg safety rule.""OMAHA, Neb.

The national average retail price of a dozen eggs hit $4.25 in December, up from $1.79 a year earlier, according to the latest government data.The National Chicken Council trade group submitted a formal petition to the Food and Drug Administration Thursday asking officials to drop a rule passed in 2009 that keeps chicken producers from selling their excess eggs because they aren't refrigerated right away.“Already faced with record egg prices, consumers might be hit even harder in their wallets as we head into the Easter season unless FDA provides us with a pathway to put these eggs to good use,” said Ashley Peterson, the trade group’s senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs.The bird flu outbreak has had an outsized impact on egg prices because more than 43 million of the 58 million birds that have been slaughtered to help control the spread of the virus have been egg-laying hens. But egg farmers have also been grappling with high feed, fuel and labor costs that have contributed to the rising prices.It’s not clear exactly how big of an impact the eggs chicken producers want to sell might have on prices because there are roughly 100 billion eggs a year produced in the U.S., so adding 400 million more to the market may not have a huge effect.The FDA said it would review the Chicken Council's petition and respond directly to that group. But concerns about food safety are what drove them to adopt the rule that prohibited the sale of the eggs in the first place.When a broiler hatchery produces eggs, they are kept at 65 degrees until they are ready to be placed in incubators to be hatched. The FDA said in its rule that eggs that are going to be used for food need to be stored at temperatures below 45 degrees within 36 hours.The Chicken Council said it believes the eggs would be safe because they would be pasteurized before they were used by food producers. The eggs that chicken producers don't need to produce more chickens for meat production wouldn't be sold to consumers in grocery stores. Instead they would go to makers of food products and processed eggs that are sold to bakers and other food companies.The Chicken Council estimates that this FDA rule prohibiting the sale of these eggs costs chicken farmers about $27 million a year because currently the eggs are either thrown away, rendered or used for animal food.But the United Egg Producers trade group said it would be a bad idea to relax food safety rules to allow these eggs laid by chicken producers to be sold.“The safety of eggs is always the priority for America’s egg farmers, as is firm compliance with all regulatory requirements related to food safety,"" said Oscar Garrison, the egg trade group’s vice president of food safety regulatory affairs. “United Egg Producers opposes the petition by the National Chicken Council because it does not comply with the egg safety rule.""",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805787,"Brett Favre sues auditor, sportscasters in defamation case","JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre filed lawsuits Thursday in Mississippi, accusing the state auditor and two national sportscasters of defaming him in public discussions about the misspending of welfare money that was supposed to help some of the poorest people in one of the poorest states in the nation.

            The lawsuit against Auditor Shad White says the Republican “has carried out an outrageous media campaign of malicious and false accusations against Brett Favre — the Hall of Fame quarterback and native son of Mississippi — in a brazen attempt to leverage the media attention generated by Favre’s celebrity to further his own political career."" 

            In a separate lawsuit against former NFL player Shannon Sharpe, Favre said Sharpe made “egregiously false” statements about him on the Fox Sports talk show “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,"" including that Favre “stole money from people that really needed money.”











            And in another lawsuit against retired NFL player Pat McAfee, Favre said McAfee had used “outrageous falsehoods” that included calling Favre a “thief” who was “stealing from poor people in Mississippi.”

            Favre is not facing criminal charges in the Mississippi welfare scandal, but he is among more than three dozen people or businesses the state is suing to try to recover misspent money through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.

            
                Favre has repaid $1.1 million he received for speaking fees from a nonprofit group that spent TANF money with approval from the Mississippi Department of Human Services. White said Favre never showed up to give the speeches.

            In December, the state Department of Human Services made a new demand of up to $5 million against Favre and a university sports foundation, saying welfare money was improperly used to pay for a volleyball arena at Favre's alma mater, the University of Southern Mississippi.

            Favre's daughter started playing volleyball at the university in 2017. The volleyball facility was a pet project of the retired quarterback, and he pledged to lead fundraising efforts for it. Previous filings in the state's civil lawsuit show text message exchanges between Favre and others about directing money to the volleyball facility from a nonprofit organization that had Department of Human Services contracts.

            The Associated Press sent an email to a representative of McAfee and left phone messages for Sharpe on Thursday, seeking comment about the defamation lawsuits. They did not immediately respond.

            The lawsuit Favre filed against the auditor Thursday accuses White of “shamelessly and falsely attacking Favre’s good name” to gain attention for himself, “including appearances on television shows on CNN and HBO, a popular ESPN podcast, as well as interviews for print and online media. None of these national media outlets would have paid White the slightest attention had he not been attacking Favre.""

            Fletcher Freeman, a spokesman for White, said in a statement: ”Everything Auditor White has said about this case is true and is backed by years of audit work by the professionals at the Office of the State Auditor. It’s mind-boggling that Mr. Favre wants to have a trial about that question.""

            Freeman also said that Favre has called White and the auditor's team liars, despite repaying some of the money the auditor's office demanded from him.

            “He’s also claimed the auditors are liars despite clear documentary evidence showing he benefitted from misspent funds,” Freeman said. ""Instead of paying New York litigators to try this case, he’d be better off fully repaying the amount of welfare funds he owes the state.”JACKSON, Miss.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805788,DA says libel case against N. Carolina Attorney General over,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A North Carolina prosecutor said Thursday that campaign-related charges won't be pursued further against Attorney General Josh Stein or his aides, one day after an appeals court ruled the political libel law her office was seeking to enforce is most likely unconstitutional.

            Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said that the ongoing investigation and prosecution of potential misdemeanor violations related to a 2020 ad from Stein's campaign has been closed. 

            A senior assistant prosecutor in Freeman's office had been investigating allegations whether the commercial criticizing Stein's Republican challenger at the time broke a 1931 law that makes certain political speech unlawful. When it appeared last summer that Freeman's office could soon seek indictments, Stein's campaign and others sued in federal court to stop the effort and asked that the law be declared unconstitutional. 











            In August, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, blocked enforcement of the law while an appeal was heard. On Wednesday, the same appeal panel vacated a trial judge's ruling that had refused to order Freeman to stop using the law to prosecute anyone over the disputed commercial.

            A statement released by Freeman also said the ruling prevents her office from moving foward given that there is two-year statute of limitations for such a misdemeanor. 

            “Understanding that the case was one of intense public interest, it has been the assigned prosecutor’s intent to exercise due diligence and to evaluate the evidence and apply the law without partiality from the beginning of this matter,” Freeman said. “As prosecutors, we respect the role of the court in determining the constitutionality of a duly enacted state law.” 

            The decision by Freeman — the local prosecutor for North Carolina's largest county — ultimately could make the Stein lawsuit moot. And Stein, who announced last month he would run for governor in 2024, will no longer have the potential for an uncomfortable prosecution from the office led by a fellow Democrat. Current Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper had sided with Stein in the legal affair, previously calling the potential prosecution “an unprecedented repression of free speech.”

            The litigation originated from a commercial that Stein has called a corrective to what he considered false accusations made by then-challenger Jim O’Neill. He had alleged Stein had failed to act on more than 15,000 untested rape kits since becoming attorney general in 2017. Stein’s ad accused O’Neill, the Forsyth County district attorney, of letting more than a thousand rape kits go untested. 

            O'Neill complained to the State Board of Elections, mentioning a law that makes it illegal to help circulate “derogatory reports” about a candidate designed to harm their election chances while “knowing such report to be false or in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.” The elections board and ultimately Freeman's office investigated, with the help of the State Bureau of Investigation. 

            Wednesday's ruling overturned a decision by U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles, who had said the law appeared to meet constitutional standards. The prevailing opinion, written by Circuit Judge Toby Heytens, said it was likely unconstitutional because “derogatory reports"" could also include statements that were in fact true. And someone could tell tremendous lies about a candidate as long as they weren't specifically disclosed to hurt the person at the ballot box, Heytens wrote. 

            Stein campaign strategist Morgan Jackson said late Thursday the Stein ad ""was true, and we are gratified that the 4th Circuit put an end to this nonsense.""

            Citing the ad's subject, Freeman's statement said she hoped that efforts would continue to reduce backlogs for the testing of sexual assault kits following a 2019 state law that was designed to eliminate that inventory, adding that delays continue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805793,US says China balloon could collect intelligence signals,"WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States will explore taking action against entities connected to China's military that supported the flight of a Chinese spy balloon into U.S. airspace last week, a senior State Department official said on Thursday.Washington is confident that the manufacturer of the Chinese balloon, shot down by the U.S. military last weekend off the U.S. East Coast, has a ""direct relationship"" with the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the official said in a statement.White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre echoed the notion that Washington would look at taking action, but the U.S. government has not specified what measures are under consideration.Jean-Pierre told reporters the United States would also look at broader efforts to ""expose and address"" China's larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to U.S. national security and to allies and partners.The FBI, which is leading efforts to analyze recovered remains of the balloon, told reporters in a briefing that it had obtained only limited physical evidence and did not yet have enough information to assess its capabilities.""It's very early for us in this process, and the evidence that has been recovered and brought to the FBI is extremely limited,"" a bureau official said.FBI officials said they still did not have access to the majority of the balloon's ""payload"" where most of the onboard electronics were likely carried, and that much of it remains underwater.Separately on Thursday, speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman highlighted the flight of the Chinese balloon as another sign of Beijing's efforts to reshape the international order.""This irresponsible act put on full display what we've long recognized: that the PRC (People's Republic of China) has become more repressive at home and more aggressive abroad,"" Sherman told the hearing.Sherman said Washington would continue to block China from using U.S. technology to advance its military modernization.""The PRC is the only competitor with the intent and means to reshape the international order,"" Sherman said, adding that the balloon's violation of U.S. sovereignty and international law was the ""latest example of that reality.""Nevertheless, Sherman said she hoped Washington and Beijing would be able to continue to work together on issues of shared concern such a climate change ""at this difficult time.""POLITICAL OUTRAGEThe spectacle of the Chinese balloon drifting over the United States last week caused political outrage in Washington and brought into sharp focus the challenge posed by China to the United States and its allies.It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a trip to Beijing that both countries had hoped would patch up frayed relations. Blinken would have arrived in Beijing Sunday.Instead, Thursday's slew of briefings and hearings highlighted the political pressure that President Joe Biden's administration remained under to address the incident.Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers sharply criticized the U.S. military and the Biden administration for failing to shoot down the balloon when it first entered U.S. airspace, and instead waiting a week to do so. The House of Representatives voted 419-0 for a resolution condemning China for the balloon incursion.U.S. lawmakers have demanded more information from the Biden administration about the incident.""I hate to disappoint you. We haven't learned anything more than what everyone always knew,"" Senator Bob Menendez, the Democratic chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after emerging from a classified briefing given by administration officials on the balloon on Thursday.The U.S. Air Force downed the balloon off South Carolina on Saturday, a week after it entered U.S. airspace. China's foreign ministry has said it was a weather balloon that had blown off course and accused the United States of overreacting.On Monday, the United States briefed 150 foreign diplomats in Washington and sent information to its missions around the world to share details about the balloon incident.On Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning dismissed U.S. charges that the balloon was part of a worldwide spying fleet, saying that allegation could be part of a ""U.S. information war against China.""PLA-LINKED MANUFACTURERIn the statement released by the State Department, the senior official said the balloon manufacturer has a direct relationship with China's military and is an approved vendor of the People's Liberation Army.The company also advertises balloon products on its website and hosts videos from past flights, which appear to have overflown U.S. airspace and the airspace of other countries, the official said, without naming the business.The official said the United States has collected high-resolution imagery of the balloon from U-2 aircraft flybys that revealed it was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.China had conducted similar surveillance flights over more than 40 countries on five continents, the official said.State Department spokesman Ned Price told a briefing later that activity had occurred ""over the course of several years.""",2023/02/10,530,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805806,New debt plan proposes spike in Puerto Rico power bills,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Residential electric bills in Puerto Rico could increase by an average of $19 a month if a federal bankruptcy judge approves a proposal filed Thursday to restructure the staggering debt held by Puerto Rico’s power company.

            The plan would cut by nearly half the more than $10 billion debt held by the Electric Power Authority — the largest of any government agency — and has the support of at least three major classes of creditors, according to a federal control board that oversees the U.S. territory’s finances and filed the proposal.

            Board Chairman David Skeel noted that customers are not to blame for the power company’s bankruptcy, and that the legacy charge would be painful for residents and businesses already paying high power bills amid ongoing blackouts, but that there is no way to completely erase the company’s liabilities.











            Skeel said that almost half of the power company’s 1.4 million residential customers would not pay the additional charge if they consume less than 500 kilowatt hours of electricity a month.

            In 2021, the average monthly electricity consumption for a U.S. residential customer was about 886 kilowatt hours, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

            The average $19 a month increase for non-subsidized residential customers would include a flat $13 monthly connection fee and additional charges depending on power use. Meanwhile, there would be a $16.25 monthly connection fee for small businesses, $20 monthly for smaller industrial companies and $1,800 monthly for large businesses, plus additional charges depending on power use.

            The proposed charges would still have to be approved by Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau. 

            Skeel stressed that the newest debt restructuring proposal carries the least burden compared with other agreements that the board and Puerto Rico’s government had reached with creditors previously.

            In a bid to contain the slowly spreading outrage of Puerto Ricans who have long struggled with chronic power outages and multiple increases in electric bills, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said the cost should be absorbed by the island’s power company.

            He also said that electricity consumption might not become more expensive given the recent privatization of power generation and ongoing efforts to reduce the island’s dependence on petroleum.

            The island’s power company’s debt is the only one that hasn’t been resolved ever since the U.S. territory declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion debt accumulated through decades of corruption, mismanagement and heavy borrowing. In 2017, the government filed for the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805807,US VP's husband urges global action against antisemitism,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Doug Emhoff, the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, took his campaign against antisemitism to the United Nations Thursday, urging diplomats from many nations to speak out against the rising global hatred of Jews and stressing: “Silence is not an option.”

            The first Jewish spouse of either a U.S. president or vice president, the California lawyer said those who don’t speak out should be called out, and there must be “consequences” for all those engaged in antisemitism.

            Emhoff — officially called the Second Gentleman — pointed to celebrity comedians too often using antisemitism “to draw cheap laughs, high profile entertainers and politicians openly spouting tired antisemitic tropes (and) others making comments laced with not so subtle innuendo.”











            “We must build coalitions to tackle this epidemic of hate,” he said. “We must bring together people from all backgrounds, all faiths, all ethnicities, because hate is interconnected. It affects everyone.”

            Emhoff recently returned from what he called an “emotional” and “somber” trip to Poland and Germany where he visited the former site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp and commemorated the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War II as well as the others killed including Roma, Sinta, the disabled, LGBTQ people, and political dissidents. 

            In Berlin, Emhoff said, he hosted an interfaith round-table with clergy and lay people who are working together to promote tolerance and inclusiveness. He singled out a young activist named Brock who “spoke passionately” about a project he is leading called Young Muslims in Auschwitz that seeks to engage fellow German Muslim teens in discussions about history, antisemitism and stereotypes through a visit to Auschwitz.

            The Muslim teens see that like Jews they are targets of right-wing violence and belong to an often-stigmatized minority, Emhoff said, and “this powerful realization often leads to solidarity and understanding.” This kind of dialogue must be strengthened, he said.

            “We need to make clear to the haters, the antisemites out there that there is no safe harbor for them anywhere,” Emhoff said.

            U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield led to the event on “Globalizing Efforts to Combat Antisemitism” in the U.N. Economic and Social Council chamber. It was co-hosted by Argentina, Canada, Israel, Morocco and the United Kingdom.

            Thomas-Greenfield pointed to an upsurge in antisemitism and antisemitic attacks around the world, saying this hatred, both in person and online, “is being stoked not only by extremist groups but also by mainstream political leaders, popular celebrities and people in positions of power.”

            In tackling this upsurge, Emhoff said President Joe Biden and vice-president Harris “have made revitalizing our partnerships and alliances a priority, and that extends to fighting hate and antisemitism.”

            “This moment requires bold collective action and urgency, not just words, not just concepts,” he told the U.N. diplomats. “And I know we will meet this moment together.”UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Doug Emhoff, the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, took his campaign against antisemitism to the United Nations Thursday, urging diplomats from many nations to speak out against the rising global hatred of Jews and stressing: “Silence is not an option.”The first Jewish spouse of either a U.S. president or vice president, the California lawyer said those who don’t speak out should be called out, and there must be “consequences” for all those engaged in antisemitism.Emhoff — officially called the Second Gentleman — pointed to celebrity comedians too often using antisemitism “to draw cheap laughs, high profile entertainers and politicians openly spouting tired antisemitic tropes (and) others making comments laced with not so subtle innuendo.”“We must build coalitions to tackle this epidemic of hate,” he said. “We must bring together people from all backgrounds, all faiths, all ethnicities, because hate is interconnected. It affects everyone.”Emhoff recently returned from what he called an “emotional” and “somber” trip to Poland and Germany where he visited the former site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp and commemorated the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during World War II as well as the others killed including Roma, Sinta, the disabled, LGBTQ people, and political dissidents.In Berlin, Emhoff said, he hosted an interfaith round-table with clergy and lay people who are working together to promote tolerance and inclusiveness. He singled out a young activist named Brock who “spoke passionately” about a project he is leading called Young Muslims in Auschwitz that seeks to engage fellow German Muslim teens in discussions about history, antisemitism and stereotypes through a visit to Auschwitz.The Muslim teens see that like Jews they are targets of right-wing violence and belong to an often-stigmatized minority, Emhoff said, and “this powerful realization often leads to solidarity and understanding.” This kind of dialogue must be strengthened, he said.“We need to make clear to the haters, the antisemites out there that there is no safe harbor for them anywhere,” Emhoff said.U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield led to the event on “Globalizing Efforts to Combat Antisemitism” in the U.N. Economic and Social Council chamber. It was co-hosted by Argentina, Canada, Israel, Morocco and the United Kingdom.Thomas-Greenfield pointed to an upsurge in antisemitism and antisemitic attacks around the world, saying this hatred, both in person and online, “is being stoked not only by extremist groups but also by mainstream political leaders, popular celebrities and people in positions of power.”In tackling this upsurge, Emhoff said President Joe Biden and vice-president Harris “have made revitalizing our partnerships and alliances a priority, and that extends to fighting hate and antisemitism.”“This moment requires bold collective action and urgency, not just words, not just concepts,” he told the U.N. diplomats. “And I know we will meet this moment together.”",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805808,"San Francisco mayor delivers pro-police, anti-drug address","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In her San Francisco state of the city address Thursday, Mayor London Breed pushed back against critics who said the city was dead or dying and pledged to beef up police staffing, crack down on drugs, offer tax breaks to new businesses and build more housing for essential workers like bus drivers. 

            Breed said her San Francisco is one of resilient dreamers and talented reinventors who go on despite challenges such as a rampant fentanyl crisis, shuttered businesses and learning loss among students. But San Francisco's downtown, once bustling with office tech workers, is not returning to its pre-pandemic hustle, Breed said.

            “And you know what? That’s ok,” she said. “Let’s keep some perspective. In 1907, downtown was mostly rubble and ash. That’s considerably worse than today’s shift in how people work.”











            Last year, voters recalled three politically progressive members from the San Francisco Board of Education and ousted the district attorney, saying he sympathized too much with criminals. They voted in Brooke Jenkins, who shares Breed's vision of improved relations with police, heavier law enforcement and consequences for people who commit crimes. 

            Like many other U.S. cities, San Francisco struggles to house its homeless residents, estimated at 7,800 in a city of about 835,000. Residents and businesses complain frequently over tent encampments, vandalism and street trash. And San Francisco, like the state, faces a budget shortfall. 

            Nevertheless, Breed told a room filled with cheering supporters Thursday that she will seek an extra $25 million for overworked police, improve the city's permitting process so small businesses can more easily open and grow, and remove barriers to building more housing. The mayor is looking to build 82,000 homes partly by rezoning for taller buildings and cutting red tape that makes it expensive to build in San Francisco. Critics have said the plan would result in too many luxury units and not enough homes for low- and middle-income households. 

            Breed also announced a plan to remake downtown San Francisco, in part through tax relief for businesses hardest hit by the pandemic, such as retail shops, restaurants, arts and entertainment venues. She also wants to offer tax breaks for up to three years to office businesses that open in the city. 

            San Francisco Supervisor Dean Preston, who is a frequent critic of the mayor's policies, said she is putting corporate profits ahead of working people. 

            “Tax breaks for rich corporations, deregulation of luxury housing development, and a $25 million giveaway for the police department. That’s the mayor’s plan in a nutshell, and it’s nothing more than doubling down on failed strategies that don’t work,"" he said in a statement. 

            She previously announced intentions to crack down on open-air drug dealing and drug use, especially in the city's Tenderloin neighborhood, once in December 2021 and then in October. But there has been no change. 

            Breed is a native San Franciscan who grew up in public housing and is the first Black woman to be elected mayor. She was elected in 2018 following the sudden death of Ed Lee and she faces re-election next year. 

            ""We are San Franciscans,"" she said. “We’re not victims of circumstances. We are the captains of our own ship.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805809,"Officer drew gun as he approached Tyre Nichols, report finds","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — One of three Memphis Police officers who initially detained Tyre Nichols last month has admitted he did not witness the alleged reckless driving that was the justification for pulling over Nichols but still approached his car while brandishing his gun, according to police documents seeking to bar him from working in law enforcement.

            That Jan. 7 traffic stop quickly escalated into a beating, and Nichols died three days later.

            Officer Preston Hemphill’s own body camera showed that from the very beginning of the traffic stop he and two other officers approached Nichols with force that was disproportionate for the alleged offense of reckless driving, according to a statement from the disciplinary hearing that took place before he was fired. 











            Hemphill was fired last week but has not been charged for his role in Nichols' beating and arrest, which has sparked widespread outrage and reignited a national discussion of police brutality against Black people. Five other officers, who are Black and were caught on video pummeling Nichols with their fists, feet and a baton, have been charged with murder and other offenses.

            Hemphill did not take part in the second, more violent encounter, which took place after Nichols ran from police. But the documents highlight that he was heard on his body camera telling his partner: “I hope they stomp his ass!”

            The information about Hemphill’s actions is contained in supporting documents attached to a Wednesday request from Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis to strip Hemphill, who is white, of his police certification so that he could not work in law enforcement again. Hemphill’s lawyer did not immediately comment Thursday because he had not fully read the documents.

            The documents help create a fuller picture of the initial encounter with the 29-year-old Nichols that involved Hemphill, Demetrius Haley and Emmitt Martin III. Haley and Martin were fired last month and charged with second-degree murder in Nichols' death along with Tadarrius Bean, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith.

            The police chief has said she saw no justification in video of the incident for pulling Nichols over in the first place.

            Meanwhile, the office of the top prosecutor in Memphis said in a statement Thursday that it will review all previous cases, “closed and pending,” of the five officers charged in the Nichols investigation. It was not immediately clear how many cases the review by the Shelby County District Attorney’s Office will involve, but there is at least a chance that some cases could be re-opened if problems emerge.

            The new documents state that Nichols was not given the opportunity to step out of the car before being forced out by Haley. Martin then grabbed one of Nichols’ wrists and claimed that Nichols tried to grab his gun. That claim was later repeated by Hemphill and Haley but was contradicted by the video evidence.

            Once they had Nichols out of his car, the officers took him to the ground while yelling profanity at him. Hemphill threatened to use a stun gun on Nichols, while placing the gun against Nichols’ leg. Martin threatened to break one of his arms. Haley sprayed Nichols in the eyes with pepper spray while he was on the ground.

            Nichols, by contrast, was “not using profanity” or showing any “signs of violence,” according to the documents. When Nichols managed to get free and started running away, Hemphill deployed his stun gun, even though police policy forbids the use of a stun gun against a subject who is running away or as a means of gaining compliance with someone who is not violent.

            The hearing officer also faulted Hemphill for deploying his stun gun while Nichols was in the middle of the street. “You put everyone involved at risk of serious bodily injuries due to oncoming traffic,” the statement reads.

            Within a few minutes, Bean, Mills and Smith caught Nichols a few blocks away and began beating him. They were joined by Haley and Martin, while Hemphill remained with the vehicle.

            In all, 13 officers have either been disciplined or are under investigation for their roles in Nichols' death. Two Shelby County sheriff's deputies were also suspended, and three emergency medical technicians with the Memphis Fire Department have been fired.

(AP) — Warren Buffett's company has now sold nearly 95 million of its original 225 million shares of Chinese electric carmaker BYD's stock, but it remains a significant shareholder.

            Berkshire Hathaway said in a filing with the Hong Kong stock market Thursday that it had sold another 4.235 million BYD shares since last month. Disclosure rules only require Berkshire to reveal when its ownership stake decreases into another percentage point. 

            After the most-recent sales, Berkshire still held 130.3 million BYD shares or about 12% of the stock. At its last report late last month, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska, controlled 13% of the stock.











            Until last August, Berkshire had never sold any of the BYD shares it bought in 2008. The stake Berkshire paid $232 million for had ballooned in value to be worth billions of dollars. 

            BYD, based in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, is one of the biggest electric vehicle makers in the world, having sold nearly 1.9 million cars in 2022 including pure electrics, plug-ins and hybrids. 

            Buffett didn't respond to questions Thursday about why he was selling the shares, but he doesn't typically comment on stocks he is buying and selling while he is still making those moves.

            Many investors follow Buffett's investments because of his remarkably successful track record over the years.

            In addition to the BYD stock, Berkshire holds a sizeable portfolio with major investments in Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola and other stocks. Besides that, Berkshire also owns an assortment of more than 90 companies, including Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a number of manufacturing and retail firms.OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805811,Companies agree to pay $45M over California oil spill,"SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) — Shipping companies have agreed to pay $45 million to thousands of Southern California fishermen, tour companies and property owners who sued after an offshore oil spill sent crude washing ashore, attorneys said Thursday.

            A tentative settlement was reached after months of negotiations between the MV Beijing and MSC Danit and their associated companies and the businesses and residents who sued them, the plaintiffs' lawyers said in a statement.

            A federal judge still needs to sign off on the agreement for it to take effect. 











            “Nobody deserves this more than the citizens of Orange County and the coastal community to have this matter resolved quickly,” said Wylie Aitken, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, which include businesses that provide surf lessons and leisure cruises and shops that sell swimwear and fishing bait. 

            Messages seeking comment were sent via email to attorneys listed for the vessels.

            A pipeline owned by Amplify Energy Corp. ruptured and spilled 25,000 gallons (94,600 liters) of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean near Huntington Beach in October 2021. While less severe than initially feared, the spill shuttered beaches in the area for a week, fisheries for more than a month, oiled birds and threatened area wetlands.

            Southern California residents and business owners sued the Houston-based oil company seeking compensation for their losses, as well as the shipping vessels that Amplify said damaged the pipeline when they dragged their anchors across it during a January 2021 storm. 

            Amplify sued the two vessels and an organization that helps oversee marine traffic. A trial on those allegations is scheduled for April 24.

            “We are pleased to see the ships that struck our pipeline take responsibility for the damages their negligence caused the community following this event,” Amy Conway, an Amplify spokesperson, said in a statement Thursday.

            Amplify last year agreed to pay the plaintiffs $50 million and reached a plea deal with federal authorities for negligently discharging crude.SANTA ANA, Calif.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805816,"Review: Reese Witherspoon, Ashton Kutcher shine in a rom-com","If you decide to settle in and watch “Your Place or Mine” to see the sparks fly between Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher, you'll be initially disappointed. They're not in the same room until the last 12 minutes.

            The premise of this particular Netflix rom-com is two old friends switching homes for a week and snapping each other out of their ruts. Might they also fall in love? (Do many rom-coms not end that way?)

            In this one, Witherspoon and Kutcher play opposites — he's a rich consultant who lives in a chic but chilly New York apartment; she's an earthy and protective single mom to a 13-year-old boy in Los Angeles. They hooked up 20 years ago but decided friendship was the better path.











            These two talk every day, forcing the filmmakers to spend a fortune on split screens. It's an intimate relationship over two decades as each supports and encourages the other. Someone asks him the obvious question — “If you like each other so much, why aren’t you guys together?” — and there is no really good answer. She offers another: “Uh, barf.”

            A last-minute emergency triggers the film's central action: Witherspoon needs to fly to New York but her childcare main option flakes, so Kutcher's character decides to go to Los Angeles as backup. “You need help and I’m coming,” he tells her. They find themselves in each other's homes, getting to know each others' friends and generally shaking things up.

            Written and directed by Aline Brosh McKenna, “Your Place or Mine” is cute and light from a creator known more for satires like “Devil Wears Prada” and “My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” This Valentine's Day, it hits the spot if you're in the mood for pretty people acting insecure and clueless. 

            At first, though, the film meanders with an alarming lack of urgency, as if Brosh McKenna was happy enough just filling the screen with her two beautiful leads and putting them in pretty places. You might initially mistake it as a rom-com for real estate.

            Eventually, each start to see the other as a project that needs fixing. Kutcher tries to loosen up his best friend's son — snack on junk food, letting him watch scary movies and allowing him to try out for the hockey team, all things forbidden when mom's around. He sees it all as an extension of work: “That’s what I do: I get in, manage things, no muss, no fuss.”

            On the other coast, Witherspoon finds an old manuscript her best friend has hidden from her and decides she must try to get it published. She also flirts with a hunky publisher — Jesse Williams, smoldering — and breaks all logic when she doesn't immediately fall into the cool, sensual piercing blue of his eyes and never wants to leave... Wait, where was I?

            The film soon mines an interesting area, namely how much do best friends really know about each other? When Witherspoon's character finds the book, she is in shock. “We tell each other everything,” she says. Replies a friend: “Obviously you don’t.” This is also a film that champions taking a chance, going for it and not playing it safe.

            The film allows Witherspoon and Kutcher to show off their naturally funny sides, especially when they're fishes out of water. But many of the scenes drag on and sometimes the exposition is chalky, like when Witherspoon says: “I have to finish this program before the end of the year so I can apply for that open senior accounting position at the regional school district.”

            Some smaller roles give important jolts of quirky, like Zoë Chao as a slinky former flame of Kutcher’s character in New York and Tig Notaro and Steve Zahn in LA. Notaro's wit is as dry as a cactus, while Zahn plays a loopy gardener who is credited for writing two oddball songs on the soundtrack.

            Speaking of songs, the producers must have forked over tons of cash to the estate of Ric Ocasek. To establish Kutcher's character as a fan of The Cars, no less than nine songs — including “Heartbreak City,” “Drive” and “You Might Think” — have been used. The film's soundtrack could double as a greatest-hits album.

            The film builds to — finally! — a scene when Witherspoon and Kutcher are in the same zip code and a nice flipping of the traditional rom-com airport scene on its head. That's when the film answers the question can men and women just be friends with a strong: “Uh, barf.”

            “Your Place or Mine,” a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for “suggestive material and brief strong language.” Running time: 111 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

She offers another: “Uh, barf.”A last-minute emergency triggers the film's central action: Witherspoon needs to fly to New York but her childcare main option flakes, so Kutcher's character decides to go to Los Angeles as backup. “You need help and I’m coming,” he tells her. They find themselves in each other's homes, getting to know each others' friends and generally shaking things up.Written and directed by Aline Brosh McKenna, “Your Place or Mine” is cute and light from a creator known more for satires like “Devil Wears Prada” and “My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.” This Valentine's Day, it hits the spot if you're in the mood for pretty people acting insecure and clueless.At first, though, the film meanders with an alarming lack of urgency, as if Brosh McKenna was happy enough just filling the screen with her two beautiful leads and putting them in pretty places. You might initially mistake it as a rom-com for real estate.Eventually, each start to see the other as a project that needs fixing. Kutcher tries to loosen up his best friend's son — snack on junk food, letting him watch scary movies and allowing him to try out for the hockey team, all things forbidden when mom's around. He sees it all as an extension of work: “That’s what I do: I get in, manage things, no muss, no fuss.”On the other coast, Witherspoon finds an old manuscript her best friend has hidden from her and decides she must try to get it published. She also flirts with a hunky publisher — Jesse Williams, smoldering — and breaks all logic when she doesn't immediately fall into the cool, sensual piercing blue of his eyes and never wants to leave... Wait, where was I?The film soon mines an interesting area, namely how much do best friends really know about each other? When Witherspoon's character finds the book, she is in shock. “We tell each other everything,” she says. Replies a friend: “Obviously you don’t.” This is also a film that champions taking a chance, going for it and not playing it safe.The film allows Witherspoon and Kutcher to show off their naturally funny sides, especially when they're fishes out of water. But many of the scenes drag on and sometimes the exposition is chalky, like when Witherspoon says: “I have to finish this program before the end of the year so I can apply for that open senior accounting position at the regional school district.”Some smaller roles give important jolts of quirky, like Zoë Chao as a slinky former flame of Kutcher’s character in New York and Tig Notaro and Steve Zahn in LA. Notaro's wit is as dry as a cactus, while Zahn plays a loopy gardener who is credited for writing two oddball songs on the soundtrack.Speaking of songs, the producers must have forked over tons of cash to the estate of Ric Ocasek. To establish Kutcher's character as a fan of The Cars, no less than nine songs — including “Heartbreak City,” “Drive” and “You Might Think” — have been used. The film's soundtrack could double as a greatest-hits album.The film builds to — finally! — a scene when Witherspoon and Kutcher are in the same zip code and a nice flipping of the traditional rom-com airport scene on its head. That's when the film answers the question can men and women just be friends with a strong: “Uh, barf.”“Your Place or Mine,” a Netflix release, is rated PG-13 for “suggestive material and brief strong language.” Running time: 111 minutes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805817,MLB prepared to take over local TV broadcasts from Sinclair,"PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — About $1 billion of Major League Baseball's revenue is at risk if a cable television company fails to make payments for local broadcasting rights to 14 teams, and the sport is preparing to take over telecasts.

            “I think you should assume that if Diamond doesn’t broadcast, we’ll be in a position to step in,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday after an owners' meeting. “Our goal would be to make games available not only within the traditional cable bundle but on the digital side, as well.”

            Sinclair acquired 21 regional sports networks in 2019 from The Walt Disney Co., which had taken them over as part of its purchase of 21st Century Fox. Sinclair also holds rights to 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL franchises, and teams fear in an era of cord-cutting they may not get payments from Diamond Sports Group, the Sinclair Broadcast Group subsidiary operating the networks under the name Bally Sports.











            “What we do is largely dependent on how Diamond and the creditors play their cards, what they decide to do,” Manfred said. “Our No. 1 goal in terms of preparations is that if for some reason Diamond isn't broadcasting, that we want to be in a position to make sure our fans are going to get their games.”

            Asked whether $1 billion or $2 billion was at stake, Manfred said: “Closer with the first number than the second.”

            Billy Chambers, who had been Sinclair’s chief financial offer, started work this month with MLB in a new position as executive vice president for local media.

            Diamond owns rights to local broadcasts for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Guardians, Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins, Milwaukee Brewers, Minnesota Twins, St. Louis Cardinals, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays and Texas Rangers.

            Baseball executives met at The Breakers, a 97-year-old Renaissance Revival style hotel. The lobby was filled with a mix of baseball executives and women in pink floral summer dresses, some in hats, attending the Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s Palm Beach Hot Pink Luncheon and Symposium.

            OAKLAND/LAS VEGAS BALLPARK

            On other major topic, Manfred said he views the Athletics' search for a new ballpark as “Oakland and/or Las Vegas.”

            “This year they kind of got a deadline,” he said. “They need to have an agreement in place by next January — really important from the perspective of the club.”

            RAYS BALLPARK

            Tampa Bay announced plans on Jan. 30 to build a ballpark near Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg. The team has been searching for a new stadium for 15 years, and owner Stu Sternberg says the Rays can't afford to stay in their current ballpark when their lease expires after the 2027 season.

            “We did not talk about the Rays situation,"" Manfred said. ""Everything that’s happened recently Stu covered in great detail in the last owners meeting. We had a nice layout of what was coming, so there was no real update there.”

            STARTING EXTRA INNINGS WITH RUNNER ON SECOND

            The rule was adopted as a pandemic measure for the 2020 season and appears likely to stay.

            “The clubs discussed the permanence of that rule. It’s got to go back to the on-field committee,” Manfred said. ""Clubs have gotten used to the extra-innings rule. I think it’s generally well-liked by players. I don’t bet on anything, but if you were going to make a bet, it think it's a pretty good bet it’s going to continue.""

            REVENUE DISPARITY

            A new committee on economic reform met this week.

            “Revenue disparity, really important topic in the industry right now. It’s not unrelated to the local media issues,” Manfred said.

            Manfred said MLB had $10.8 billion in revenue last year. Some teams have become alarmed the New York Mets, entering their third season under owner Steve Cohen, have increased payroll to about $370 million — well above the record $291 million of the 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers.

            “I think people know what happened in the winter. I think that they understand that it happened within the confines of the system they negotiated and beating your gums about it doesn’t accomplish a lot,” Manfred said. “In aggregate, I think that the group has matured into better.”

            EXECUTIVE COUNCIL

            San Francisco chairman Greg Johnson replaced Colorado chairman Dick Montfort and Cleveland chairman Paul Dolan replaced Boston principal owner John Henry on the executive council.

            The council also includes Los Angeles Dodgers chairman Mark Walter and Detroit Tigers chairman Christopher Ilitch (whose terms expire in 2024); Philadelphia managing partner John Middleton and Kansas City chairman John Sherman (2025) and Arizona managing general partner Ken Kendrick and Seattle chairman John Stanton (2026)

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805819,South Carolina Senate passes new abortion ban after ruling,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — The South Carolina Senate passed an abortion ban on Thursday in the Republican-led chamber's latest quest to craft a law that passes constitutional muster, but differences with a stricter proposal from the House could derail the effort once again.

            Republicans have faced several setbacks in their efforts to further restrict abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal protections this summer, allowing the conservative state's previous ban to take effect.

            First, a special session spanning a dozen meetings throughout the summer and fall resulted in no new ban when neither chamber budged from their respective proposals. Then, just days before lawmakers convened this January, the state's highest court narrowly struck down a 2021 law banning abortion after cardiac activity is detected around six weeks of pregnancy.











            With Thursday's 28-12 vote, Senate Republicans insist they have found their solution in a ban on abortions after cardiac activity is detected around six weeks of pregnancy. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey emphasized that several clarifications of the bill’s language and repeals of conflicting laws will satisfy a majority on the South Carolina Supreme Court.

            The Senate measure includes exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and the patient’s life and health up to 12 weeks. Meanwhile, a full ban from conception has again advanced to the House floor in a development that threatens to prevent another abortion restriction from becoming law in South Carolina. 

            The vote indicates that Senate Republicans' position has not changed since this fall. The overall body appears uninterested in pursuing any alternative restrictions — lesser or greater. Republican Sen. Sandy Senn’s amendment to instead bar abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy failed to pass. Sen. Richard Cash, one of the Legislature’s most vocal abortion opponents, withdrew his amendment that would have matched the House proposal.

            Senators moved quickly to advance the long-sought Republican priority. Republican leadership bypassed the traditional committee process to hold a vote this week on the bill. Massey said additional public input was unnecessary given the mountain of testimony over years of hearings on the issue.

            Supporters said the court's January decision added urgency to prevent the state from serving as what Republican Sen. Billy Garrett called an “abortion haven.”

            But in doing so, some of the five women in the chamber said the Senate failed to address key nuances in the fraught subject. Democratic Sen. Margie Bright Matthews called the effort a “knee jerk"" reaction by the “heavy hand of a bunch of men.”

            Senn suggested the rush came at the proposal's own legal expense.

            ""There’s no way the court can make an informed decision with the scant legislative record,” Senn said Thursday, adding: “It was ramrodded through committee and it’s been ramrodded on this floor.”

            The Charleston Republican was the only member of her party to ultimately vote against the ban. She and Massey sparred repeatedly this week as Senn attempted time after time to amend the bill.

            The measure states outright that it does not ban contraception. One of Senn's failed amendments sought to explicitly name implants and emergency contraception like Plan B in the list of protected forms of birth control.

            Massey said the bill had been carefully crafted to ensure such contraception is allowed. Senn said a doctor had expressed concerns that the proposal’s medical definitions could be interpreted to exclude certain forms like copper intrauterine devices.

            The measure also requires physicians to share a patient’s name and contact information with the local sheriff in the event of an aborted pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. Another amendment sought to prevent that information’s disclosure unless the patient consents.

            Sen. Mia McLeod noted that most victims do not report the crime. By requiring that physicians divulge that information, McLeod said the chamber seemed to have “no appetite for balance.”

            “And there’s a reason for that,” Senn responded. “We’re not going to have balance until more women run and until more women get elected.”

            It was not the only time the lack of women got attention this week.

            The stark gender divide that unfolded in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's summer decision reemerged as Senn and the other four other senators repeatedly called attention to their minority status in the 46-member chamber.

            “Did you know that with us five women here in the state Senate, that there are millions -- literally millions -- of people here in South Carolina depending on the five of us to make sure this bill is just so?” Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson asked Senn on Wednesday.

            Several key changes were made before its final passage. Judges would have discretion to impose sentences up to two years imprisonment and fines up to $10,000 for a physician in ownership of medical records who fails to properly maintain documentation relating to abortions. Another amendment made it clear that doctors do not need to delay emergency care necessary to save a patient's life or health by first taking an ultrasound to check for a heartbeat.

            The bill would also repeal a 1974 law criminalizing people who seek abortions. While Massey said he had never heard of the statute's enforcement, the Senate wanted to remove the possibility altogether.

            Both Cash and Massey urged the lower chamber’s Republican supermajority to pass their version.

            “Let’s take the win. And if you want to continue pushing for something more aggressive then so be it. But don’t stop this one,” Massey told reporters on Thursday. “Let’s at least save thousands of lives and we can continue talking about whether we can go further or not. But pass this bill.”

Penry Gustafson asked Senn on Wednesday.Several key changes were made before its final passage. Judges would have discretion to impose sentences up to two years imprisonment and fines up to $10,000 for a physician in ownership of medical records who fails to properly maintain documentation relating to abortions. Another amendment made it clear that doctors do not need to delay emergency care necessary to save a patient's life or health by first taking an ultrasound to check for a heartbeat.The bill would also repeal a 1974 law criminalizing people who seek abortions. While Massey said he had never heard of the statute's enforcement, the Senate wanted to remove the possibility altogether.Both Cash and Massey urged the lower chamber’s Republican supermajority to pass their version.“Let’s take the win. And if you want to continue pushing for something more aggressive then so be it. But don’t stop this one,” Massey told reporters on Thursday. “Let’s at least save thousands of lives and we can continue talking about whether we can go further or not. But pass this bill.”—-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805820,"Astros beat Tucker in arbitration, Ramirez 3rd Rays hearing","ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The Houston Astros beat Kyle Tucker in arbitration on Thursday, and the All-Star outfielder will make $5 million rather than his $7.5 million request.

            Outfielder Harold Ramirez became the third player to go to arbitration with the Tampa Bay Rays, arguing for a $2.2 million salary during Thursday's hearing rather than the team's $1.9 million offer.

            Toronto infielder Bo Bichette avoided a hearing when he finalized a $33.6 million, three-year contract.











            The $2.5 million gap between Tucker and the Astros matched Bichette's with the Blue Jays for the largest among 33 players who exchanged proposed salaries with their teams last month. Tucker's case was heard Wednesday by John Stout, Fredric Horowitz and Jules Bloch, who held their decision until after Bichette's agreement was finalized.

            Tucker, 26, hit .257 with 30 homers, a career-best 107 RBIs and stole 25 bases and won a Glove Glove last year after batting .294 with 30 homers and 92 RBIs in 2021. He had a $764,200 salary last year and was eligible for arbitration for the first time.

            Teams have won three of five decisions, All-Star pitcher Max Fried ($13.5 million) lost to Atlanta and reliever Diego Castillo ($2.95 million) was defeated by Seattle, while pitcher Jesús Luzardo ($2.45 million) and AL batting champion Luis Arraez ($6.1 million) both beat Miami.

            Ramirez hit a career-best .300 last season with six homers and 58 RBIs. He had a $728,000 salary and was eligible for arbitration for the first time. His case was heard Thursday by John Woods, Melinda Gordon and Bloch.

            Tampa Bay had earlier hearings with relievers Ryan Thompson ($1.2 million vs. $1 million) and Colin Poche ($1.3 million vs. $1,175,000). Those decisions are being held for later cases to be argued or settled.

            A decision also is pending for Los Angeles Angels outfielder Hunter Renfroe.

            Rays right-hander Jason Adam and Astros right-hander Cristian Javier are among 14 players who remain scheduled for hearings, which run through Feb. 17. 

            Bichette, a son of former All-Star Dante Bichette, hit .290 with 24 homers and 93 RBIs, down slightly from a .298 average, 29 homers and 102 RBIs in 2021. He had asked for a raise from $723,500 to $7.5 million and had been offered $5 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805821,Appeals arguments begin in Boy Scouts of America bankruptcy,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — An attorney for some insurance companies that could be liable for child sexual abuse claims against the Boy Scouts of America urged a judge Thursday to reverse a bankruptcy plan for the organization, arguing collusion with claimants’ lawyers to pressure insurers to enter into settlements.

            Ted Boutros, an attorney representing non-settling insurers, said the reorganization plan was not proposed in good faith and improperly strips non-settling insurers of their rights to challenge the claims.

            “We’re just asking for fairness,” Boutros told U.S. District Court Judge Richard Andrews, who began hearing two days of arguments in appeals by certain insurers and sexual abuse claimants.











            In September, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein approved a $2.46 billion reorganization plan that would allow the Irving, Texas-based Boy Scouts of America to continue operating while compensating tens of thousands of men who say they were sexually abused as children while involved in Scouting.

            More than 80,000 men have filed claims saying they were abused as children by troop leaders around the country. Plan opponents say the staggering number of claims, when combined with other factors, suggests that the bankruptcy process was manipulated.

            “We know huge swaths of them are not legitimate claims,” Boutros said, referring to a statement made by one of the BSA’s own experts. Boutros also noted that a plaintiffs’ attorney acknowledged that some 58,000 claims probably could not be pursued in civil lawsuits because of the passage of time.

            When it sought bankruptcy protection in February 2020, the BSA had been named in about 275 lawsuits and told insurers it was aware of another 1,400 claims. The huge number of claims filed in the bankruptcy was the result of a nationwide marketing effort by personal injury lawyers working with for-profit claims aggregators to drum up clients, according to plan opponents. 

            The BSA’s largest insurers negotiated settlements for a fraction of the billions of dollars in potential liability exposure they faced. Other insurers, many of which provided excess coverage above the liability limits of the underlying primary policies, refused to settle. They argue that the procedures for distributing funds from a proposed compensation trust would violate their contractual rights to contest claims, set a dangerous precedent for mass tort litigation, and result in grossly inflated payments.

            Glenn Kurtz, an attorney for the Boy Scouts, told Andrews that opponents have to prove that Silverstein committed “clear error” in approving the plan but that they are not challenging any of the factual findings she made.

            “Frankly, the insurers, neither in their papers or today, have identified a single finding by the court that could support an ultimate conclusion of bad faith,” he said.

            Under the plan, which the BSA describes as a “carefully calibrated compromise,” the BSA itself would contribute less than 10% of the proposed settlement fund. The local BSA councils, which run day-to-day operations for troops, offered to contribute at least $515 million in cash and property, conditioned on certain protections for local troop sponsoring organizations, including religious entities, civic associations and community groups.

            The bulk of the compensation fund would come from the BSA’s two largest insurers, Century Indemnity and The Hartford, which reached settlements calling for them to contribute $800 million and $787 million, respectively. Other insurers agreed to contribute about $69 million. 

            Insurers opposing the plan argue that the BSA is contractually obligated to assist them in investigating, defending and settling claims, as it did before the bankruptcy. They say that the BSA, desperate to escape bankruptcy, colluded with claimants’ lawyers to inflate both the volume and value of claims in order to pressure insurers for large settlements, then transferred its insurance rights to the settlement trust. The insurers argue that if the BSA transfers its rights under insurance policies to the settlement trustee, it must also transfer its obligations under those policies.

            Attorneys for the Boy Scouts and plan supporters say the BSA’s obligations under the insurance policies are being transferred to the trustee — subject to the bankruptcy plan an “applicable law.” Non-settling insurers contend that language creates too much uncertainty regarding their rights and how much discretion is being given to the retired bankruptcy judge who would oversee the settlement trust.

            Andrews will hear arguments Friday by attorneys for abuse survivors who say the plan contains improper liability releases that prohibit them from being able to sue non-debtor third parties, including local BSA councils, BSA insurers and troop sponsoring organizations.WILMINGTON, Del.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805822,Push-button pitching: MLB to let pitchers call own signals,"Bases loaded, one out, full count and Justin Verlander knows exactly what pitch he wants to throw.

            Starting this month, he can call it himself.

            In yet another nod to new technology, Major League Baseball will permit pitchers in spring training to wear wristbands that will let them signal to the catcher what's coming next.











            The experiment begins Feb. 24 when exhibition play opens with the Seattle-San Diego and Texas-Kansas City games in the Cactus League. All 30 teams are scheduled to be in action the next day.

            It's an extension of the PitchCom system that MLB teams were allowed to employ last season, when catchers could push buttons on their wristbands to call for fastballs, curves, changeups and anything else, along with the location. The pitcher would then hear the result on an earpiece inside his hat.

            Now, pitchers can make the calls themselves.

            MLB will evaluate how things go and then decide whether to approve it for the regular season, executive vice president Morgan Sword said Thursday.

            Worries over clubs stealing catchers' signals — either by alert opponents or illicit electronic schemes — prompted the rise of the PitchCom system. Some teams and pitcher/catcher batteries immediately embraced the new method; others were a bit more hesitant.

            As the season went on, and boosted by tweaks to the tech aspects, more and more clubs became comfortable with putting it in play. Along with the pitcher, usually the shortstop and second baseman had earpieces so they knew what was coming.

            Catchers often wore earpieces, too, so they could hear audio confirmation of what pitch they called.

            Over the years, there have been plenty of baseball stories about pitchers calling their own games, working out a set of hidden signals with catchers.

            In a few weeks, there will no need for secrecy — pitchers can make their calls out in the open, right on the mound.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805829,EU looks to tighten borders to keep unwanted migrants away,"European Union leaders said on Thursday they would tighten their borders to keep away unwanted immigrants, with some seeking more fences and walls while others would rather spend the money on improving living conditions in worse-off parts of the world.Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland and Denmark were among the 27 national leaders meeting in EU hub Brussels to express concern about increasing irregular arrivals, with some 330,000 border crossings recorded last year.""European countries are experiencing a big increase in the number of people who are coming from outside Europe on an irregular basis,"" said Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.""It's important that we, as Europeans decide who enters our countries, not the human traffickers... Those who gain refugee status have the right to remain but others don't, and they should be returned.""Immigration has been a highly politically sensitive topic in the EU since 2015 when more than a million people - mostly fleeing the war in Syria - crossed the Mediterranean into Europe, and member states fought bitterly over how to provide for them.Unable to agree, the bloc of 450 million people has turned to tightening its borders to prevent people from the Middle East, Africa and Asia from arriving, despite criticisms that such policy was inhuman and neglected labour market gaps.From Spain and Greece to Latvia and Poland, there were more than 2,000 kilometres (1,240 miles) of border walls and fences in the EU in 2022, compared to just over 300 kilometres (185 miles) in 2014, according to a report by the European Parliament.Still, with global mobility restarting since the COVID-19 pandemic, irregular arrivals into the EU rose last year to their highest level since 2016, reviving harsher anti-immigration rhetoric.WALLS AND FENCES""We need to 'pull the brake' on illegal migration in the EU,"" said Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.""We need the money for it, no matter if you call it a fence or boarder infrastructure. Bulgaria needs help when it comes to border surveillance and personnel, with technical equipment, every fence is only as good as there is effective surveillance.""The EU's executive, which holds the bloc's shared budget, has long refused to finance border walls, though it does pay for surveillance equipment and other infrastructure.Luxembourg's prime minister, Xavier Bettel, spoke against financing walls, saying Europe's heritage was overcoming divisions after World War Two and eventually creating a 27-country zone where travellers can cross borders without checks.""For the moment what is on the table is Bulgaria-Turkey ... but this will not be enough - so there will be again new fences and again new walls... Is the conclusion that we want a fortress in Europe?""His Belgian counterpart said the situation amounted to ""a major migration crisis"", while the Dutch premier spoke in favour of restricting visas and aid to countries failing to cooperate.Italy has called for more money for Africa, Hungary wanted more walls and France said the EU should help fight poverty and terrorism around the world, as well as combat global warming to see fewer people on the move.The bloc's top diplomat said ""Fortress Europe"" was not the answer and that the EU should also offer immigrants some legal ways to get in: ""People move because in their countries there is not a future, there is no peace, there is no stability,"" said Josep Borrell.Catholic charity group Caritas said EU leaders should look into improving the bloc's asylum procedures and reception centres to ""put human rights and dignity front and centre"".(Reporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Sandra Maler)",2023/02/10,231,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805833,Kim leads Levito at Four Continents skating championships,"Yelim Kim breezed through a near-flawless short program to build the slimmest of leads over 15-year-old American Isabeau Levito on Thursday night at the Four Continents Figure Skating Championships.

            The 20-year-old from South Korea, performing to the moody piano piece “Mercy,” was fluid through an opening triple lutz-triple toe loop before landing a double axel and triple flip. When her score of 72.84 points was read inside the Broadmoor World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Kim clapped her hands and pumped her fists in delight.

            It was a strong bounce-back performance for Kim, who struggled to a sixth-place finish at the Grand Prix Final.











            “I was so, so nervous before,"" she said, “but I did an almost clean program and I am happy about that.”

            Levito was second with 71.50 points, and she would have been within a point of the lead if not for a point deduction for a time violation. South Korea's Chaeyeon Kim was third, followed by Americans Amber Glenn and Bradie Tennell.

            In the men's short program, Kao Miura rebounded from a disappointing sixth at Japanese nationals — along with a shaky opening quad salchow Thursday night — to land a massive quad-triple combination and score 91.90 points.

            That put him clear of retiring Canadian star Keegan Messing, who scored 86.70 points, and 27-year-old Jimmy Ma of the U.S., whose soaring quad to open his short program and exceptional triple axel were good for a personal-best 86.64 points in the annual competition between non-European nations.

            Four Continents continues Friday night with the pairs short program, rhythm dance and women's free skate.

            Levito, the new U.S. champion, has been a revelation in her first season of senior competition, finishing no worse than second anywhere she's been, including a silver medal at the Grand Prix Final. Her performance to music by the Israeli singer-songwriter Yasmin Levy on Thursday night was almost balletic, with its easy opening triple flip, a double axel and a triple lutz-triple toe loop. 

            The only mistake came in running over time, something Levito has been docked for in the past.

            “I haven't had time to reflect on my program so I don't have much to say about it right now,"" she said, “but for the most part, I am satisfied with my performance.”

            Glenn and Tennell were more upbeat about their short programs, which have them within range of the podium. Glenn in particular was happy when, despite putting her hand down on her triple loop, she still scored 69.63 points.

            “That's great!” she said in the kiss-and-cry area. “OK!”

            “The emotion I was feeling at the end was a bit of a disappointment,” Glenn said later. “Usually the loop is my best jump, and to put my hand down on it was very disappointing.”

            Tennell has been on the comeback from an ankle injury that sidelined her most of the season. She was second to Levito at nationals, though, and the former Four Continents bronze medalist was pleased with her showing Thursday night.

            “I haven’t competed at Four Continents since 2020,” she said, “so coming back here and it being in my home country is really exciting for me. My focus is to skate more relaxed and with more freedom in my long program. I am so grateful to be here and perform. The hard part of this journey was getting back to this level. The past year was difficult. I didn’t start getting back into training until August. So to come here and put out a program like that, I am really proud of myself.”

So to come here and put out a program like that, I am really proud of myself.”___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805834,"2 days later, LeBron still feels scoring record is 'surreal'","LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James took the microphone at center court under a spotlight Thursday night, and all the fans who guessed wrong rose to unleash a mighty roar.

            Two days after James became the NBA's scoring king, the achievement was still a thrill to him. In a pregame ceremony, he got to share it with the Lakers faithful who bought tickets one game too late to see it in person.

            James paused to gather his thoughts while the three scoreboard ribbons running the circumference of the Lakers' downtown arena all rotated the same message: “LeBron James — NBA All-Time Leading Scorer.""











            “As I sit up here and look at this thing going around right now, it’s just so surreal to me,” James said. “But the one thing I know for sure is that I’ve never cheated the game of basketball. And I would never cheat the game of basketball, because it's given so much to myself. It's given so much to my family.”

            Two days after he broke the record, James was still basking in the achievement of a lifetime — and even the fans who bought tickets for the Lakers' meeting with the Milwaukee Bucks instead of their game against Oklahoma City on Tuesday night got a memory for their efforts.

            The Lakers held a brief ceremony to recognize James, who was sitting out their first game since the record to rest his sore left foot and ankle.

            Moments before James took the court, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar offered his thoughts on James' place in the game's history after breaking Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38,387 points, a mark that had stood for nearly 39 years.

            “The game has had eras, and LeBron, without a doubt, is the greatest player of his era,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “And that era is right behind that of Shaquille (O'Neal), Michael Jordan. There are people that dominated the game, and then there are people that capture everybody’s imagination. I think that’s what Michael Jordan did. Everybody wanted to be him, to do what he did.”

            Abdul-Jabbar noted the folly of the so-called G.O.A.T debates, noting that eras in basketball vary wildly.

            “How many people in here saw Sweetwater Clifton play? I didn’t. Most of us didn’t,” Abdul-Jabbar said. ""He was awesome, but that was back in the early ’50s, without the 24-second clock. ... I think the reason they have sports bars with all those TVs is so people can go in there and argue like this, because we’re not going to find out.”

            James' place in the game's history is already secure as he attempts to revive the Lakers' playoff chances deep in his 20th NBA season. James’ left ankle has periodically forced him to miss games this season, including six since November.

            On court in a sharp suit, James was in a reflective mood: He recalled the Christmas before his fourth birthday in 1988 in Akron, Ohio, as the moment he fell in love permanently with the game when his mother, Gloria, bought him a kiddie hoop and a small basketball.

            “From that moment on, I knew that orange sphere was something that I always wanted to be a part of my journey,” James said. “Who would have known? Someone said on social media that that was the biggest investment in the history of mankind. A $20 Little Tikes hoop could turn into what it's turned into today. Mom, thank you so much.”

            James was also in an appreciative mood with his mother in attendance alongside his three children and his wife, Savannah.

            “That's my starting five right there,” James said. “Savannah ... she’s the real MVP, if you want to be completely honest. She’s the all-time leading scorer, if you want to be completely honest. My boys would say they are the all-time leading scorers, but I don’t think Savannah will allow that tonight.”

            James then addressed the Lakers' fans, who have embraced a longtime rival ever since he arrived in 2018. He assumed an exemplary public leadership role for the franchise in the wake of Kobe Bryant's death in 2020 — and later in the year, he led Los Angeles to its 17th championship.

            “My family is everything to me, and you guys over the last five years have become family to me as well, so thank you to the Laker faithful,"" James said. “You guys are unbelievable, and every night I step on the floor, I truly understand what it means to represent the Los Angeles Lakers.”

            James' absence and the Lakers' flurry of trades over the past two days left them with only nine players in uniform when they faced the powerhouse Bucks.

            Los Angeles traded away Russell Westbrook, Patrick Beverley, Thomas Bryant, Juan Toscano-Anderson and Damian Jones while acquiring D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt, Malik Beasley, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed.

            The moves are an attempt to salvage another disappointing year for James and the Lakers, who have foundered at the back of the Western Conference pack all season long with Anthony Davis struggling through his annual injury problems. The 13th-place Lakers fell to 25-30 with their 133-130 loss to Oklahoma City on James' historic night.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805835,Pence subpoenaed by special counsel probing Trump,"Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel overseeing investigations into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to a person with direct knowledge of the event.

            The subpoena to Pence as part of the investigation by special counsel Jack Smith was served in recent days, according to the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday to discuss a sensitive issue.

            The extraordinary scenario of a former vice president potentially testifying against his former boss in a criminal investigation comes as Pence considers launching a 2024 Republican presidential bid against Trump. The two have been estranged since a mob of Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop Democrat Joe Biden's victory.











            The subpoena is an aggressive step from a prosecutor who for years led the Justice Department’s public corruption section and who oversaw indictments against major political figures. The move sets the stage for a likely executive privilege fight, given Pence’s close proximity to Trump for four years as major decisions were being contemplated and planned. It is unclear whether efforts to secure voluntary testimony from Pence stalled before the subpoena was issued.

            Spokespeople for Pence and Smith declined to comment on the issuance of the subpoena, which was first reported by ABC News.

            Pence was a central figure in Trump's efforts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. Trump falsely insisted that his vice president, who had a ceremonial role in overseeing the certification of the election, could simply reject the results and send them back to the battleground states he contested.

            On Jan. 6, Trump supporters, driven by the lie that the election was stolen, marched to the Capitol building, brutally pushed past the police and smashed through the windows and doors while Pence was presiding over the certification of Biden’s victory. The vice president was steered to safety with his staff and family as some in the mob chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!”

            While the mob was in the Capitol, Trump tweeted, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.”

            Smith, who was named special counsel in November by Attorney General Merrick Garland, has been tasked with overseeing investigations into Trump’s attempts to subvert his defeat, his actions leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol and his possession of top-secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago.

            Federal prosecutors have been especially focused on a scheme by Trump allies to elevate fake presidential electors in key battleground states won by Biden as a way to subvert the vote, issuing subpoenas to multiple state Republican party chairs.

            Federal prosecutors have brought multiple Trump administration officials before the grand jury for questioning, including former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Pence’s own former chief of staff, Marc Short.

            In a sign of the expanding nature of the investigation, election officials in multiple states whose results were disputed by Trump have received subpoenas asking for communications with or involving Trump and his campaign aides.

            A House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack recommended that the Justice Department bring criminal charges against Trump and associates who helped him launch a pressure campaign to try to overturn his 2020 election loss.Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel overseeing investigations into efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election, according to a person with direct knowledge of the event.The subpoena to Pence as part of the investigation by special counsel Jack Smith was served in recent days, according to the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday to discuss a sensitive issue.The extraordinary scenario of a former vice president potentially testifying against his former boss in a criminal investigation comes as Pence considers launching a 2024 Republican presidential bid against Trump.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805836,NFL lauds preparation when it comes to player safety,"GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Dr. Allen Sills knew the moment that Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed on the field last month during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals that something serious and potentially life-threatening had happened.

            “My next reaction,” Sills said, “was tremendous confidence in the people that are there.”

            In a matter of seconds, medical personnel from both sides rushed toward Hamlin, who had gone into cardiac arrest as thousands of fans watched in the stadium and millions more watched on television. They began to administer CPR, working feverishly to resuscitate him, before loading Hamlin into an ambulance and taking him to a hospital.











            “I know the medical staffs of both of those teams and our medical staffs have trained for exactly that moment,” said Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer. “So you default to that training, and you're looking for a series of steps to occur, and those steps did occur. And you just hope and pray the body will respond and that you have a great outcome.”

            The 24-year-old Hamlin was hospitalized for more than a week, and while his road back continues, the fact that he was able to travel to Phoenix to accept a community service award this week speaks volumes about his recovery.

            It also speaks to the preparation the NFL demands of its medical personnel.

            ""They key is just the preparation that starts well before game day,"" said Sills, who provided a tour Thursday of the medical facilities available at State Farm Stadium, where the Chiefs will play the Eagles in the Super Bowl on Sunday.

            “Every team has an emergency action plan that they write for their training facility and their stadium,” Sills said, ""and it covers all of the expected emergencies that could occur: who’s going to do what, what equipment we need. And then that gets practiced, just like our players have a playbook and they practice. We practice that emergency action plan.

            “We never want one of those situations to occur, but if it does, its something that we've planned and prepared for.”

            Chiefs president Mark Donovan was watching the Bills-Bengals game on TV when Hamlin went down, and the first thing he did was text his team's trainer, Rick Burkholder. They discussed their own plan that night, and afterward, they went through their facility and ensured everyone was prepared for an emergency.

            “Rick was very complimentary of Buffalo's staff. That is exactly what they were trained to do, and the person who saw it happen diagnosed it immediately,” Donovan told The Associated Press. “The most experienced, highest-level-of-expertise people in Cincinnati to deal with that were not in hospitals that night; they were on the sideline.”

            Sills said about 30 medical professionals are at each NFL game, whether it be a run-of-the-mill preseason game played largely by backups and no-hopers, an international game where facilities might be different than those in the U.S., or the Super Bowl, for which a television audience of more than 200 million people is expected Sunday.

            Some are team trainers. Others are specialists, such as those trained to diagnose and treat airway issues. And still others are independent experts, such as the neurologists trained to identify concussions during games.

            Indeed, head injuries remain an important and controversial topic for the league.

            The NFL announced last week that concussions increased by 18% during the regular season, which Commissioner Roger Goodell attributed to updated diagnostic measures. But some very visible cases, including that of Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, forced the league to once more revise its protocols midway through the season.

            Tagovailoa took a scary hit during a September game against Buffalo but was allowed to continue playing, then took another hard hit four days later against Cincinnati, when he was taken off an a stretcher and diagnosed with a concussion. Tagovailoa missed two games before returning to the field, only to sustain another concussion against Green Bay in December.

            The NFL now states that any player showing concussion symptoms must sit out the remainder of the game.

            “I think we've made great strides in the area of concussion, both in our ability and understanding how to diagnose and in safely returning players,” Sills said, ""but our focus is really on prevention, and not only concussions but head impacts.

            “We've got technology to actually be able to quantify that,” Sills said. ""We can count how many helmet impacts for each player. We'll be sharing that information with coaches, with players, teams, so that we can act against it. And make no mistake, our goal is very simple: We want to see the number of impacts go down.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805837,Georgia considers heavier trucks despite official opposition,"ATLANTA (AP) — It's the heavyweight lobbying battle of this year's Georgia legislative session: Should the state allow heavier trucks on its roads?

            The House Transportation Committee voted 18-11 on Thursday to advance a House bill which would increase the weight limit for large trucks to 90,000 pounds (40,800 kilograms). Now, most trucks are limited to 80,000 pounds, the same as the federal limit on interstate highways.

            The bill advanced to the full House after a five-and-a-half hour hearing, despite a furious counterattack from the Georgia Department of Transportation.











            “The fact is allowing heavier weights on the highways and bridges shortens the lifecycle of our bridges and pavements,"" Meg Pirkle, the department's chief engineer, told committee members, as state Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry sat next to her.

            Trucks hauling agricultural or natural resource products are allowed to carry 84,000 pounds on state roads except interstates. Logging, farming and trucking groups have long wanted a further increase, saying they could save money by hauling the same amount of freight over fewer trips.

            “This is their business. This is their livelihood, and are we taking a look at that and saying ‘Hey, can we help them be more efficient?’ They pay taxes as well."" said the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Steven Meeks of Screven, a farmer.

            Opponents warn taxpayers will pay more for infrastructure repairs, essentially subsidizing truckers. They also fear that heavier trucks could pose more danger to people riding in lighter passenger vehicles.

            McMurry estimated that it could cost billions more to rebuild damaged state highways and to replace state bridges that wouldn’t meet the new weight standard, suggesting Georgia might have to increase fuel taxes.

            “We’ll have to redirect our funding and spend billions — let me say that again, billions — more in maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction rather than advancing many of the critical projects you all need in your districts,"" McMurry said.

            He also said the state would immediately post weight limits on another 1,400 bridges to bar 90,000-pound trucks, on top of the 1,400 that are already posted to bar 80,000-pound trucks. He said that could lead to long detours, or even make some parts of the state inaccessible to super-heavy trucks.

            “You’re going to drive a lot further to go around, which costs money,"" McMurry said.

            The bill would put into law a move that Gov. Brian Kemp has already made for heavy trucks that get permits. The Republican governor has repeatedly renewed a supply chain emergency order, after he stopped signing broader COVID-19 orders, that allows some trucks of up to 95,000 pounds on roads. The current order lasts through March 11.

            Thursday’s hearing packed a committee room with dozens of lobbyists and onlookers, as 30 of the committee’s members questioned witnesses for hours.

            Georgia Poultry Federation President Mike Giles said a study shows each heavier truck degrades a road more, but that fewer trips would offset the damage. Pirkle disputed the point, saying fewer heavier loads may do more damage.

            He said fewer trips would also emit less carbon dioxide.

            “If I can carry them 10% more product, I don’t have to go back as often.” said Weyman Hunt, the owner of Godfrey's Feed in Madison, which supplies cattle feed.

            Toby McDowell of Locust Grove, who owns a logging company, said Kemp's executive order had increased revenue enough that he was able to buy new trucks and trailers and is now delivering the same tonnage of logs with five trucks instead of nine.

            “If the order goes away, a business such as my own, we lose that revenue,"" McDowell said.

            But city and county officials said big trucks are harming local roads and bridges, with more than 100 signing a letter opposing the weight increase. Nancy Thrash, a Lamar County commissioner, said a log truck damaged a freshly paved road in her county, which now it needs to be paved again. 

            “The weight increase this industry is asking for is unsustainable,"" Thrash said. ""Rural counties have a hard time keeping our roads maintained due to budget constraints and inflation costs.”

            Steve Owings, an Atlanta man whose son was killed in 2002 when a truck plowed into his stopped car in Virginia, said increased weight limits would make trucks “demonstrably less safe.”

            Owings, a co-founder of Road Safe America, said that physics show increased weight means it takes a longer distance for trucks to stop.

            “This is a step, potentially, in exactly the wrong direction,” Owings said. “If anything, we should be finding ways to make big trucks safer in Georgia.”

Now, most trucks are limited to 80,000 pounds, the same as the federal limit on interstate highways.The bill advanced to the full House after a five-and-a-half hour hearing, despite a furious counterattack from the Georgia Department of Transportation.“The fact is allowing heavier weights on the highways and bridges shortens the lifecycle of our bridges and pavements,"" Meg Pirkle, the department's chief engineer, told committee members, as state Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry sat next to her.Trucks hauling agricultural or natural resource products are allowed to carry 84,000 pounds on state roads except interstates. Logging, farming and trucking groups have long wanted a further increase, saying they could save money by hauling the same amount of freight over fewer trips.“This is their business. This is their livelihood, and are we taking a look at that and saying ‘Hey, can we help them be more efficient?’ They pay taxes as well."" said the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Steven Meeks of Screven, a farmer.Opponents warn taxpayers will pay more for infrastructure repairs, essentially subsidizing truckers. They also fear that heavier trucks could pose more danger to people riding in lighter passenger vehicles.McMurry estimated that it could cost billions more to rebuild damaged state highways and to replace state bridges that wouldn’t meet the new weight standard, suggesting Georgia might have to increase fuel taxes.“We’ll have to redirect our funding and spend billions — let me say that again, billions — more in maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction rather than advancing many of the critical projects you all need in your districts,"" McMurry said.He also said the state would immediately post weight limits on another 1,400 bridges to bar 90,000-pound trucks, on top of the 1,400 that are already posted to bar 80,000-pound trucks. He said that could lead to long detours, or even make some parts of the state inaccessible to super-heavy trucks.“You’re going to drive a lot further to go around, which costs money,"" McMurry said.The bill would put into law a move that Gov. Brian Kemp has already made for heavy trucks that get permits. The Republican governor has repeatedly renewed a supply chain emergency order, after he stopped signing broader COVID-19 orders, that allows some trucks of up to 95,000 pounds on roads. The current order lasts through March 11.Thursday’s hearing packed a committee room with dozens of lobbyists and onlookers, as 30 of the committee’s members questioned witnesses for hours.Georgia Poultry Federation President Mike Giles said a study shows each heavier truck degrades a road more, but that fewer trips would offset the damage. Pirkle disputed the point, saying fewer heavier loads may do more damage.He said fewer trips would also emit less carbon dioxide.“If I can carry them 10% more product, I don’t have to go back as often.” said Weyman Hunt, the owner of Godfrey's Feed in Madison, which supplies cattle feed.Toby McDowell of Locust Grove, who owns a logging company, said Kemp's executive order had increased revenue enough that he was able to buy new trucks and trailers and is now delivering the same tonnage of logs with five trucks instead of nine.“If the order goes away, a business such as my own, we lose that revenue,"" McDowell said.But city and county officials said big trucks are harming local roads and bridges, with more than 100 signing a letter opposing the weight increase. Nancy Thrash, a Lamar County commissioner, said a log truck damaged a freshly paved road in her county, which now it needs to be paved again.“The weight increase this industry is asking for is unsustainable,"" Thrash said. ""Rural counties have a hard time keeping our roads maintained due to budget constraints and inflation costs.”Steve Owings, an Atlanta man whose son was killed in 2002 when a truck plowed into his stopped car in Virginia, said increased weight limits would make trucks “demonstrably less safe.”Owings, a co-founder of Road Safe America, said that physics show increased weight means it takes a longer distance for trucks to stop.“This is a step, potentially, in exactly the wrong direction,” Owings said. “If anything, we should be finding ways to make big trucks safer in Georgia.”___Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter: twitter.com/jeffamy.",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805838,"Analysis: After trade deadline, NBA title road got tougher","Phoenix now has NBA champion and perennial All-Star Kevin Durant. Dallas now has NBA champion and perennial All-Star Kyrie Irving. In Los Angeles, the Lakers and Clippers have more depth. Memphis and New Orleans just acquired more shooters. Denver got a backup for its two-time MVP. Golden State brought back a key from last season's championship run.

            All eight of those teams, right now, have to be feeling good about what they pulled off at trade-deadline time.

            Now, remember this: At least four of those teams — and maybe more of the clubs in that group — won't even make the second round of the playoffs.











            Trade Deadline Day has come and gone, and above all else, it reaffirmed that getting out of the Western Conference and making the NBA Finals is going to be incredibly daunting this season. There was no shortage of contenders out West before Thursday, and there might be even more teams thinking that they're contenders now after finding ways to add talent.

            “Chaos,"" was the word Cleveland president of basketball operations Coby Altman used to describe the barrage of moves being made around the league Thursday.

            He wasn't wrong.

            There were the blockbusters — Irving earlier in the week going to the Mavericks, then the middle-of-the-night deal late Wednesday or early Thursday, depending on where you were sleeping, that sent Durant to the Suns. 

            Irving and Durant were Brooklyn teammates when this week started. Now, they're rivals in the West, Irving joining Luka Doncic, Durant being added to Devin Booker and the still-chasing-a-ring Chris Paul, who figures to have another chance at grabbing that elusive piece of jewelry.

            Nets general manager Sean Marks said the team traded Durant “after thorough evaluation of the best path forward."" With that, what Brooklyn envisioned as a Big Three era — Durant and Irving with James Harden — is now completely over. Harden was traded last season, Durant and Irving this week, and the Nets begin anew once again, now 20 years removed from the franchise's last trip to the East finals. 

            The bad news: Brooklyn's title window, for now, is closed. The good news: The Nets loaded up on draft picks, which were in short supply after other deals in recent years.

            Not all the moves made in the last few days, most of them Thursday, had to be blockbusters to be winners.

            The Lakers changed much of the supporting cast that'll play with LeBron James and Anthony Davis for the stretch run. Denver was on the other side of one of the Lakers' moves, getting Thomas Bryant to play backup to two-time reigning MVP Nikola Jokic. Memphis added Luke Kennard, the Clippers added Eric Gordon. Golden State brought back Gary Payton II and trimmed a ton of money off its still-enormous tax bill. Milwaukee landed Jae Crowder, who was a big part of Miami's run to the NBA Finals in 2020, and Phoenix's trip there in 2021. Philadelphia got out of the luxury tax entirely, a move that doesn't mean anything for the 76ers in the standings right now but could certainly matter down the road.

            There were some teams that held firm and didn't overpay for what the market presented them with. Miami looked into moves; nothing really materialized except for one earlier in the week in which the Heat moved Dewayne Dedmon to San Antonio to clear a roster spot and save a little money. Toronto was expected to be a seller; the Raptors wound up holding on to Fred VanVleet, O.G. Anunoby and others, then brought back Jakob Poeltl from the Spurs after trading him to San Antonio as part of the Kawhi Leonard deal.

            And then there were the teams thinking solely about down the road. San Antonio — now fully into a rebuild — added almost 10 draft picks in the last few days, almost all of them second-round selections. 

            More than 30 second-round picks from the next few years were traded this year at the deadline, as many as five of them being attached to some trades. It spoke to where the NBA is right now: some teams are willing to shoot their shot and not worry about future draft capital, other teams are willing to stockpile assets and see what the drafts can bring.

            There's never been a season, at least not in recent memory, where this many teams seem like actual contenders to win a championship. Trade Deadline Day didn't change that. Some teams got better, sure, but now it's absolutely certain that winning a title this year won't be a cakewalk for anybody.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805839,Montana lawmakers amend proposed transgender harassment bill,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Montana lawmakers on Thursday amended a proposed bill that opponents criticized as letting students avoid punishment for intentionally misgendering or deadnaming their transgender peers.

            Under the changed legislation, schools would be allowed to discipline those who refer to transgender students by their birth name or birth gender when such behavior rises to the level of bullying.

            Opponents argued that the modified bill just creates a gray area that allows harassment and leaves schools with no way to discipline it until it meets the state's legal definition of bullying.











            The House Judiciary Committee passed the amended legislation 13-6, a day after hearing from dozens of opponents who testified that the measure would increase bullying and harassment of students already struggling to fit in. 

            The bill declares that misgendering and deadnaming of transgender students by their classmates is not illegal discrimination.

            Its sponsor, Rep. Brandon Ler, has said he did not intend to allow bullying of transgender students, and he supported the amendment. During Wednesday's hearing he argued that “Children should not be forced to call somebody something they’re not.” 

            Democratic Rep. Laura Smith, a committee member who opposed the legislation, said that under the amended bill, students could harass transgender students until the behavior rises ""to a secondary standard of bullying, and without that you can’t address it."" 

            Kevin Hamm, president of Montana Pride, also said the amendment does not fix the proposed measure.

            “Putting something in there that says, ‘Oh, I can’t get in trouble for using your deadname or misgendering you because it's on your legal paperwork,' is still an attack on trans people and will be used as an attack on trans people,” he said.HELENA, Mont.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805844,EU calls out Twitter for incomplete disinformation report,"LONDON (AP) — Twitter failed to provide a full report to the European Union on its efforts to combat online disinformation, drawing a rebuke Thursday from top officials of the 27-nation bloc.The company signed up to the EU's voluntary 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation last year — before billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought the social media platform.All who signed up to the code, including online platforms, ad-tech companies and civil society, agreed to commit to measures aimed at reducing disinformation. They filed their first “baseline” reports last month showing how they're living up to their promises.Google, TikTok, Microsoft as well as Facebook and Instagram parent Meta showed “strong commitment to the reporting,” providing unprecedented detail about how they're putting into action their pledges to fight false information, according to the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. Twitter, however, “provided little specific information and no targeted data,"" it said.“I am disappointed to see that Twitter report lags behind others and I expect a more serious commitment to their obligations stemming from the Code,” Vera Jourova, the commission's executive vice president for values and transparency, said in a statement. “ Russia is engaged also in a full-blown disinformation war and the platforms need to live up to their responsibilities.”In its baseline report, Twitter said it's ""making real advancements across the board"" at fighting disinformation. The document came in at 79 pages, at least half the length of those filed by Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok.Twitter did not respond to a request for further comment. The social media company’s press office was shut down and its communications team laid off after Musk bought it last year. Others whose job it was to keep harmful information off the platform have been laid off or quit.EU leaders have grown alarmed about fake information thriving on online platforms, especially about the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian propaganda amid the war in Ukraine. Last year, the code was strengthened by connecting it with the upcoming Digital Services Act, new rules aimed at getting Big Tech companies to clean up their platforms or face big fines.But there are concerns about what shows up on Twitter after Musk ended enforcement of its policy against COVID-19 misinformation and other moves such as dissolving its Trust and Safety Council that advised on problems like hate speech and other harmful content.An EU evaluation done last spring before Musk bought Twitter and released in November found the platform took longer to review hateful content and removed less of it in 2022 compared with the previous year. Most other tech companies signed up to the voluntary code also scored worse.Those signed up to the EU code have to fill out a checklist to measure their work on fighting disinformation, covering efforts to prevent fake news purveyors from benefiting from advertising revenue; the number of political ads labeled or rejected; examples of manipulative behavior such as fake accounts; and information on the impact of fact-checking.Twitter’s report was “short of data, with no information on commitments to empower the fact-checking community,” the commission said.Thierry Breton, the commissioner overseeing digital policy, said it's “no surprise that the degree of quality” in the reports varies greatly, without mentioning Twitter.The commission highlighted other tech companies' actions for praise. Google's report indicated that it prevented more than 13 million euros ($14 million) of advertising revenue from reaching disinformation actors, while TikTok's report said it removed more than 800,000 fake accounts.Meta said in its filing that it applied 28 million fact-checking labels on Facebook and 1.7 million on Instagram. Data indicated that a quarter of Facebook users and 38% of Instagram users don't forward posts after seeing warnings that the content has been flagged as false by fact-checkers.___This story has been corrected to show that TikTok removed more than 800,000 fake accounts.",2023/02/10,112,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805852,Investors turn picky in Asia after easy wins from China’s reopening,"SINGAPORE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - As a swift and broad rally in Asian stock markets after China's reopening from COVID curbs peters out, investors are targeting beaten down stocks in sectors including retail, hospitality and technology to lead a narrower advance from here.
The initial wave of optimism over the lifting of lockdowns in the world's second-largest economy lifted a host of trade and tourism stocks around the region, led predictably by the most obvious beneficiaries - sectors such as Macau hotels and Thailand tourism.
But three months in, investors reckon it is time to get more discerning.
""We believe the next phase of the market's recovery will be focused on companies that can deliver resilient earnings growth,"" said Robert Secker, portfolio specialist in the equity division at T. Rowe Price.
Herald van der Linde, HSBC's head of equity strategy for Asia Pacific, points out that travel and gaming stocks have already benefited.
""I think in the remainder of 2023 it is all about how the recovery in China filters through to consumer companies and banks outside of China,"" he said.
For investors looking for their next leg of growth, analysts recommend sectors that stand to benefit from the pent-up demand of Chinese consumers, such as hospitality firms, retailers, and industries that struggled during the economic downturn, including online recruiters and shopping mall operators.
Investors are banking that sky-high Chinese household savings, which jumped to 17.8 trillion yuan ($2.62 trillion) last year, will be released and boost these sectors.
Man Wing Chung, lead manager for Value Partners' Asia ex-Japan Fund is adding to technology hardware and semiconductor stocks in Taiwan, saying their ""valuation has already priced in a lot of the negative sentiment on the downward tech cycle.""
While shares of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) have risen 45% from their October lows, they still trade at 15.5 times forward earnings, below a 5-year average of 18.8 times.

TSMC forward valuation below 5-yr average

Driven by expectations people in the world's most populous country will rush to travel and socialise after three years of the most stringent pandemic lockdowns, shares of Macau gaming companies Sands China (1928.HK), Wynn Macau (1128.HK), MGM China (2282.HK) have all more than doubled in the past three months.
Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) is up 12%, while Trip.com Group Ltd (9961.HK) has gained 68% in the same period.
China's market has naturally benefited most, with the MSCI China index (.dMICN00000PUS) up nearly 50% since start of November, far outperforming the 13% rise in the MSCI Southeast Asia index (.MISU00000PUS) and 26% gain in MSCI's broad Asia-Pacific index (.MIAPJ0000PUS).
That has led investors to hunt for sectors and companies with depressed valuations outside China.
Also, since China accounts for more than 20% of exports from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a recovery in China will lift up growth of the entire region, said Value Partners' Chung, who is overweight on markets in the ASEAN bloc.
Data from stock exchanges in Taiwan, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea shows foreigners purchased $8.8 billion worth of stocks in January, with Taiwan and South Korea witnessing their biggest monthly purchases in at least two years.
Foreign investors had sold $57.2 billion in regional equities last year.
GLOBAL PUSH OR CHINA PULL?
After a torrid 2022, investors have been betting that a swift recovery in China's economy will somewhat cushion the impact of a global slowdown and possible recession.
Value Partners' Chung said the concerns over global recession have been largely priced into the market and the benefits from China reopening have yet to be felt.
With global inflation showings signs of easing and investors expecting major central banks to soon end their monetary tightening, their attention has been switching to the possibilities of a global recession.

""China and its reopening trade, on the other hand, are in early stages and may be the additional tailwind for Asian equities later this year.""SINGAPORE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - As a swift and broad rally in Asian stock markets after China's reopening from COVID curbs peters out, investors are targeting beaten down stocks in sectors including retail, hospitality and technology to lead a narrower advance from here.The initial wave of optimism over the lifting of lockdowns in the world's second-largest economy lifted a host of trade and tourism stocks around the region, led predictably by the most obvious beneficiaries - sectors such as Macau hotels and Thailand tourism.But three months in, investors reckon it is time to get more discerning.""We believe the next phase of the market's recovery will be focused on companies that can deliver resilient earnings growth,"" said Robert Secker, portfolio specialist in the equity division at T. Rowe Price.Herald van der Linde, HSBC's head of equity strategy for Asia Pacific, points out that travel and gaming stocks have already benefited.""I think in the remainder of 2023 it is all about how the recovery in China filters through to consumer companies and banks outside of China,"" he said.For investors looking for their next leg of growth, analysts recommend sectors that stand to benefit from the pent-up demand of Chinese consumers, such as hospitality firms, retailers, and industries that struggled during the economic downturn, including online recruiters and shopping mall operators.Investors are banking that sky-high Chinese household savings, which jumped to 17.8 trillion yuan ($2.62 trillion) last year, will be released and boost these sectors.Man Wing Chung, lead manager for Value Partners' Asia ex-Japan Fund is adding to technology hardware and semiconductor stocks in Taiwan, saying their ""valuation has already priced in a lot of the negative sentiment on the downward tech cycle.""While shares of Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) have risen 45% from their October lows, they still trade at 15.5 times forward earnings, below a 5-year average of 18.8 times.Driven by expectations people in the world's most populous country will rush to travel and socialise after three years of the most stringent pandemic lockdowns, shares of Macau gaming companies Sands China (1928.HK), Wynn Macau (1128.HK), MGM China (2282.HK) have all more than doubled in the past three months.Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) is up 12%, while Trip.com Group Ltd (9961.HK) has gained 68% in the same period.China's market has naturally benefited most, with the MSCI China index (.dMICN00000PUS) up nearly 50% since start of November, far outperforming the 13% rise in the MSCI Southeast Asia index (.MISU00000PUS) and 26% gain in MSCI's broad Asia-Pacific index (.MIAPJ0000PUS).That has led investors to hunt for sectors and companies with depressed valuations outside China.Also, since China accounts for more than 20% of exports from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a recovery in China will lift up growth of the entire region, said Value Partners' Chung, who is overweight on markets in the ASEAN bloc.Data from stock exchanges in Taiwan, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea shows foreigners purchased $8.8 billion worth of stocks in January, with Taiwan and South Korea witnessing their biggest monthly purchases in at least two years.Foreign investors had sold $57.2 billion in regional equities last year.After a torrid 2022, investors have been betting that a swift recovery in China's economy will somewhat cushion the impact of a global slowdown and possible recession.Value Partners' Chung said the concerns over global recession have been largely priced into the market and the benefits from China reopening have yet to be felt.With global inflation showings signs of easing and investors expecting major central banks to soon end their monetary tightening, their attention has been switching to the possibilities of a global recession.""Everyone seems to 'know' we're going to have a recession, and everyone seems to 'know' it will be mild,"" said Christy Tan, investment strategist at Franklin Templeton Institute.""China and its reopening trade, on the other hand, are in early stages and may be the additional tailwind for Asian equities later this year.""",2023/02/10,180,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805857,"Isner wins 499th tiebreaker, reaches Dallas Open quarters","DALLAS (AP) — John Isner extended his record by winning his 499th career tiebreaker, advancing to the quarterfinals of his hometown Dallas Open with a 6-3, 7-6 (1) victory over Daniel Altmaier on Thursday.

            Isner won the final seven points after falling behind 1-0 in the tiebreaker, getting two of his 18 aces. The fifth-seeded American reached the semifinals of the inaugural Dallas event last year.

            Another 2022 semifinalist, top-seeded American Taylor Fritz, joined Isner in the quarters with a 7-6 (5), 6-4 victory over wild-card entry Jack Sock of the United States.











            Isner got the only break of his match for a 4-2 lead in the first set, then closed out the set at love on his serve.

            The second-round victory came after Isner won both tiebreakers in a straight-sets victory over Chun-Hsin Tseng. The big-serving Isner won the final six points of the second tiebreaker against Tseng. Roger Federer is second in career tiebreaker victories with 466.

            Isner will face Emilio Gomez, who rallied to oust fourth-seeded Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic 2-6, 7-6 (4), 6-4.

            Fritz's quarterfinal opponent is seventh-seeded American Marcos Giron, a 6-4, 6-3 winner over Germany's Oscar Otte.

            No. 8 seed Adrian Mannarino of Italy advanced to the quarters with a 6-2, 7-6 (3) victory over Australia's Jordan Thompson.

            Mannarino will face China's Yibing Wu, who beat third-seeded Canadian Denis Shapovalov 7-6 (1), 6-4.

            Isner was up 3-1 in the tiebreaker when Altmaier lost a second consecutive point on his serve by getting to a volley from Isner but sending it wide, the German slamming his racket in frustration.

            After an ace and a volley winner from Isner, Altmaier was wide on a drop shot on match point.

            “I played a great tiebreaker just now to win the match, and I played a great tiebreaker my first-round win as well,” said Isner, whose home is a few blocks from the indoor venue on the SMU campus.

            Fritz, who had a bye in the first round, won the final two points of a tight first-set tiebreaker, got the only break of the match to start the second set and advanced on his third match point. Fritz, ranked eighth, beating Sock in this event for the second consecutive year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805860,Jones' first test back on home soil against Pumas in Sydney,"BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Eddie Jones’ first test at home in his second stint as Australia’s head coach will be against Argentina in Sydney on July 15, two weeks before the Wallabies host the New Zealand All Blacks in Melbourne.

            Australia’s opening test of the season will be against World Cup champion South Africa in Pretoria on July 8. The Rugby Championship is being truncated this year as all four nations prepare for the Rugby World Cup in France starting in September.

            The Wallabies have only played three tests at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, winning thee last of those 20-15 against New Zealand in 2007.











            “The Rugby Championship is one of the toughest competitions in the world and to play against high-quality sides (such as) South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina in a World Cup year is perfect preparation for our team,"" Jones said in a statement Friday. ""To be able to play in Sydney against the Pumas is going to be a great hit-out and then you’ve got the MCG which is one of the most iconic stadiums in the world.

            “There’s plenty to be done between now and then but I can’t wait to bring the team together and get to work.”

            The return match in the two-test Bledisloe Cup series will be staged in Dunedin on Aug. 5.

            Jones' short-term objective is for the Wallabies to win back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 2002 and he has said his main aim for 2023 is for Australia to win the World Cup for the first time since 1999.

            The 63-year-old Jones coached the Wallabies to the World Cup final in 2003, which they lost to England, before being fired in 2005.

            He’s back in charge until 2027 after replacing Dave Rennie, who led the Wallabies to wins in just five of 14 test matches in 2022.

            Rennie was contracted though until the end of the World Cup, which starts on Sept. 8, but Rugby Australia officials moved to sign Jones when he was dismissed as England head coach in December after a poor recent run in England — a 2022 record of six losses, one draw and five wins in 12 tests.

            Jones won the Six Nations three times with England and racked up 18 straight wins through his mostly successful tenure, which included multiple wins over the Wallabies. 

            Australia has won the World Cup twice, behind the three each by New Zealand and South Africa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805861,UN says threat from Islamic State extremists remains high,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The threat posed by Islamic State extremists remains high and has increased in and around conflict zones, and the group’s expansion is “particularly worrying” in Africa’s center, south and Sahel regions, the U.N. counter-terrorism chief said Thursday.

            Undersecretary-General Vladimir Voronkov told the U.N. Security Council that the group, also known by its Arabic acronym Daesh, continues to use the Internet, social media, video games and gaming platforms “to extend the reach of its propaganda to radicalize and recruit new supporters.”

            “Daesh’s use of new and emerging technologies also remains a key concern,” he said, pointing to its continuing use of drones for surveillance and reconnaissance as well as “virtual assets” to raise money.











            Voronkov said the high level of threat posed by the Islamic State and its affiliates, including their sustained expansion in parts of Africa, underscores the need for multifaceted approaches to respond – not just focused on security but on preventive measures including preventing conflicts.

            The Islamic State declared a self-styled caliphate in a large swath of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in 2014. The extremist group was formally declared defeated in Iraq in 2017 following a three-year bloody battle that left tens of thousands dead and cities in ruins, but its sleeper cells remain in both countries.

            Some 65,600 suspected Islamic State members and their families — both Syrians and foreign citizens — are still held in camps and prisons in northeastern Syria run by U.S.-allied Kurdish groups, according to a Human Rights Watch report released in December.

            Voronkov said the pace of repatriations remains too slow “and children continue to bear the brunt of this catastrophe.” At the same time, he said, “foreign terrorist fighters” who joined the extremist group are not restricted to Iraq and Syria and “move between different theaters of conflict.” 

            Voronkov, who heads the U.N. Office of Counter-Terrorism, said “foreign terrorist fighters with battlefield experience relocating to their homes or to third countries further compounds the threat” from Daesh.

            Weixiong Chen, acting head of the Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee’s executive directorate, told members that the failure to repatriate foreign nationals from the camps provides Daesh “with ongoing opportunities to recruit from camps and prisons and facilitate radicalization to violence and the spread of terrorism.”

            He said the threat from Daesh “presents a complex, evolving and enduring threat in both conflict and non-conflict zones.”

            Chen pointed to Daesh’s continued exploitation of “local fragilities and intercommunal tensions” particularly in Iraq, Syria and parts of Africa and the expansion of its affiliates notably in parts of central, southern and western Africa.

            He also cited Daesh’s revenue generation and fundraising through a wide range of ways “including extortion, looting, smuggling, taxation, soliciting donations and kidnapping for ransom” as well as its use of social media and gaming platforms. The Islamic State's dominant means of moving money continues to be unregistered informal cash transfer networks and mobile money services, he said.

            Daesh’s access to conventional and improvised weapons, “including components of unmanned aircraft systems and information and communications technologies continue to contribute to the terrorist menace,” Chen said, pointing to its use of improvised, stolen or illegally trafficked weapons to launch lethal attacks against a range of targets.UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The threat posed by Islamic State extremists remains high and has increased in and around conflict zones, and the group’s expansion is “particularly worrying” in Africa’s center, south and Sahel regions, the U.N. counter-terrorism chief said Thursday.Undersecretary-General Vladimir Voronkov told the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805862,New National Security Council deputy chief says China likely to collapse before taking Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The newly appointed Deputy Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) Liu Te-chin (劉得金) has said Taiwan needs to be prepared for a Chinese invasion, but the communist regime risks collapse before taking the democratically-governed nation.The Presidential Office announced on Thursday (Feb. 9) the appointment of the retired lieutenant general and senior national security research fellow as deputy chief to the country's top advisory body, which coordinates national security, military and foreign policies.Born in Hsinchu, Liu is a graduate of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Military Academy. He received training at multiple prestigious institutions in the U.S., including the Army Infantry School, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and Harvard Kennedy School.Liu once served as the principal of Taiwan’s Military Academy, as well as the commander of the Eighth Army Corps, according to the defense ministry. Given his previous experience and his familiarity with carrying out combat exercises and intelligence analysis, his abilities make him the perfect candidate for the position, the Presidential Office said.Liu is also known as an amateur writer who pens novels and prose under the pseudonym Jing Ge (金戈).In an interview with Hakka News on Thursday (Feb. 9), Liu shared his views on cross-strait relations and Taiwan's strategic importance to the world. He supports efficient military training during mandatory military service to boost the country's military readiness.""The training has to be mission-oriented, and the training that is irrelevant to the mission has to be terminated,"" he said.Asked about the China threat, Liu said it is there and all we can do is prepare ourselves for the worst and strengthen resilience. On the other hand, he added, the war against Taiwan would come at a cost to the communist regime due to internal power struggles and the many problems that face the party.""It is easy for China to start a war but it is more likely that the party risks collapsing before taking Taiwan,"" Liu commented.",2023/02/10,4885,Politics

            Miami used a five-point possession to tie it at 72-all with 4:25 left. Cavinder started it with two free throws following a technical foul on Florida State coach Brooke Wyckoff, and then Jasmyne Roberts sank a 3-pointer from the corner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805888,"Bo Bichette, Blue Jays finalize $33.6M, 3-year contract","TORONTO (AP) — Infielder Bo Bichette and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided a salary arbitration by finalizing a $33.6 million, three-year contract on Thursday.

            Bichette gets a $3.25 million signing bonus payable within 30 days of the contract's approval by the commissioner's office and salaries of $2.85 million this year, $11 million in 2024 and $16.5 million in 2025.

            His salary would escalate in all following seasons by $2.25 million for winning an MVP award, by $1.25 million for finishing second or third in the voting and by $250,000 for finishing fourth or fifth.











            The 24-year-old, a son of former All-Star Dante Bichette, hit .290 with 43 doubles, 24 home runs, and 93 RBIs last year. He was an All-Star in 2021, when he batted .298 with 29 homers and 102 RBIs.

            He had asked for a raise from $723,500 to $7.5 million and had been offered $5 million, matching the largest gap among 33 players and teams who swapped proposed salaries last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805891,Patrick Mahomes wins 2nd MVP award ahead of Super Bowl,"PHOENIX (AP) — Patrick Mahomes dominated the voting for the AP NFL Most Valuable Player award. Now, he’ll try to break the MVP curse.

            Mahomes, who also won in 2018, easily outdistanced Jalen Hurts, receiving 48 of 50 first-place votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league. He earned 490 points to 193 for Hurts, who got one first-place vote, 26 seconds, 11 thirds and 10 fourths.

            
                Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) face Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles (16-3) in the Super Bowl on Sunday.











            Mahomes thanked the Chiefs organization and his teammates in a video at NFL Honors on Thursday night.

            “I would never be standing here without y’all,” Mahomes said. “Every day we’ve given everything we have together to win the ultimate goal, the Super Bowl. Let’s continue to go for that dream this weekend.”

            The last nine MVPs to play in the Super Bowl that season are 0-9. Kurt Warner was the last to win both the MVP award and Super Bowl following the 1999 season.

            Bills quarterback Josh Allen received the other first-place vote, finishing third with 151 points. Bengals QB Joe Burrow placed fourth and Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson came in fifth.

            The 27-year-old Mahomes is the third player to win his second MVP before turning 28, joining Brett Favre (27) and Jim Brown (22).

            Mahomes was the 2018 NFL MVP in his first full season as a starter. 

            The Chiefs lost the AFC championship game that season but Mahomes led them to a Super Bowl victory over San Francisco the following season.

            In the second-closest race Thursday, Brian Daboll won AP Coach of the Year after leading the New York Giants to their first playoff appearance in six years.

            Daboll received 16 first-place votes and 123 total points to outpace 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, who got 12 votes for first and 100 points. 

            Jaguars coach Doug Pederson finished third with 75 points, including five first-place votes.

            “It’s a tremendous honor,” Daboll said. ""You don’t think about that when you take a job. You think about leading a team and building the culture.

            Other awards announced Thursday: 

            DeMeco Ryans, who spent the past two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the 49ers, was named AP Assistant Coach of the Year. He is now the head coach of the Texans.

            Nick Bosa made it a landslide for the AP Defensive Player of the Year award. San Francisco’s All-Pro defensive end received 46 first-place votes after leading the NFL with 18 ½ sacks in the regular season.

            Bosa and the 49ers lost to the Eagles 31-7 in the NFC title game. He joked that he's ready to start the season now.

            “One weekend in Las Vegas is enough for me,” Bosa said.

            Jets cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year award. Gardner, the No. 4 overall pick in the draft, started every game for the Jets. He had two interceptions and allowed just 33 catches on 73 targets.

            Jets receiver Garrett Wilson edged out Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker for the AP Offensive Rookie of the year award. 

            “This means everything.,” Wilson said. “You put in a lot of work to end up in this point and to see it come to fruition, it’s awesome.”

            Wilson and Gardner are the third teammates to win the offensive and defensive rookie awards in the same season. Alvin Kamara and Marshon Lattimore did it with the Saints in 2017 and Detroit’s Mel Farr and Lem Barney did it in 1967.

            “I was more happy for Garrett,” Gardner said. 

            Justin Jefferson ran away with the AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Minnesota’s All-Pro wide receiver got 35 first-place votes and earned 192 points, outdistancing runner up Mahomes by a significant margin.

            “It means a lot, especially where I come from, this doesn’t happen,” Jefferson said. “I was always doubted, wasn’t highly recruited. Having this award is amazing.”

            Geno Smith, who earned his first Pro Bowl berth after becoming a full-time starter for the first time since 2014, is the AP Comeback Player of the Year. The Seattle Seahawks quarterback threw for 4,282 yards, 30 TDs and led Seattle to an NFC wild-card berth.

            Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott was the Walter Payton Man of the Year. The prestigious award recognizes an NFL player for outstanding community service activities off the field, as well as excellence on the field.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805892,"Taylor, Hadwin lead in Phoenix after frost delay, gusty wind","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Morning frost gave way to gusting wind Thursday in the WM Phoenix Open, leading to tricky scoring conditions at TPC Scottsdale.

            “I actually felt the best swing I made of the day was the par-3 seventh, and hit it 20 yards over the green,” top-ranked Rory McIlroy said after an opening 2-over 73 that left him seven strokes behind.

            The frost delayed the start for 1 hour, 50 minutes, with the wind picking up from the northeast and gusting to 25 mph. The temperature climbed from the low 40s in the morning to the high 60s in the afternoon as golf’s biggest party kicked off Super Bowl week in the Valley of the Sun.











            “Tricky day,” McIlroy said. “Hopefully, the wind keeps up this afternoon for the guys out there, and we’ll get back at it tomorrow.”

            Canadian friends Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin shared the lead at 5-under 66 when play was suspended because of darkness with the entire afternoon wave unable to finish.

            Xander Schauffele opened with a 67. Jason Day and Jim Herman also were 4 under, with Day finishing 10 holes and Herman 13.

            Taylor played the back nine in 6-under 30 after making the turn at 1 over. The two-time PGA Tour winner lives in the area and often practices at TPC Scottsdale.

            “I don’t see a whole lot of northeast wind here,” Taylor said. “It’s definitely the tougher of the winds, especially coming down the stretch. All those holes are playing a lot longer than typical. I’ve seen a lot of wind conditions, but this was one of the toughest stretches I’ve played out here.”

            Hadwin also lives in area.

            “You had to be a lot more patient than you normally do around this place,” Hadwin said. “You couldn’t really chase birdies like we typically do out here.”

            He parred the last four holes to miss out on bragging rights over Taylor.

            “I’m really disappointed I didn’t get to 6 under because I saw Nick up there, and I wanted to hold it over him tonight,” Hadwin said.

            Local favorite Jon Rahm eagled the par-5 13th to get to 3 under as play was suspended. The former Arizona State star from Spain opened the year with consecutive victories in the Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express.

            Defending champion Scottie Scheffler was 1 under through 11 holes.

            Jordan Spieth shot 71, making four birdies and four bogeys. Justin Thomas was 1 over after 12 holes.

            McIlroy is trying to make it three wins in a row on the PGA Tour after taking the Tour Championship in August and The CJ Cup in October. He also won two weeks ago in Dubai on the European tour in his first start of the year.

            McIlroy pulled off an amazing recovery shot on the par-4 second hole after a wild tee shot left him up against a metal fence, hitting a 127-yard shot to the center of the green to set up a two-putt par.

            “I sort of got lucky because the wind was hard off the left and I needed to hit that hard draw against the wind,"" McIlroy said. ""It was the only way to stop it on that green.”

            McIlroy's playing partners also struggled, with Collin Morikawa also shooting 73 and two-time Phoenix Open winner Hideki Matsuyama following at 74.

            DIVOTS: In response to Saudi-funded LIV Golf, the tournament is an elevated PGA Tour event with a purse of $20 million and a winner’s share of $3.6 million. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805894,"Moves by Texas, Oklahoma from Big 12 to SEC bumped to 2024","AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas and Oklahoma are heading to the Southeastern Conference in 2024, a year earlier than originally planned, after Big 12 officials cleared the way Thursday for the storied programs to exit their league.

            Texas and Oklahoma will leave behind the $50 million each school would have received over the next two seasons under the Big 12's media contracts.

            Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormak said the league would only agree to an early departure “if it was in our best interest.”











            “By reaching this agreement, we are now able to accelerate our new beginning as a 12-team league and move forward in earnest with our initiatives and future planning,” Yormak said in a statement announcing the agreement.

            BYU, Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston are joining the Big 12 prior to the 2023 football season, giving the league a temporary membership of 14 schools.

            The agreement must still be approved the Texas and Oklahoma boards of regents, but that is considered a formality.

            SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement that the schools will become full members of the conference on July 1, 2024.

            “We are continuing our preparation for this membership transition, and we look forward to welcoming the conference’s new members and moving into our future as a 16-team league,” Sankey said.

            The moves by Texas and Oklahoma have been in the works since 2021, when the SEC invited the Big 12’s marquee programs to join what is already the strongest football conference in the country. 

            Oklahoma and Texas have combined for 10 national championships as determined by The Associated Press, but none since the Longhorns’ 2005 season championship. TCU, which made it the College Football Playoff championship game last season, joined Oklahoma as the only Big 12 teams to make the playoff.

            Big 12 officials were initially stunned by the departure. Former Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby even accused ESPN of trying to “destabilize” the league to help Texas and Oklahoma leave early. 

            Thursday's announcement was much more cordial. Texas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec, who is also the chairman of the Big 12 Board of Directors, called the agreement “fair to all parties,” and said it could not have happened without collaboration with the league's broadcast partners ESPN and Fox.

            Money has been a driving factor in the shifting landscape of college athletics realignment. The SEC reported a revenue distribution of $49.9 million per school for the 2021-2022 school year, exceeding by more than $7 million what the Big 12 distributed to its members for the same period.

            Adding Texas and Oklahoma to the SEC’s broadcast portfolio is expected to only increase the league’s payout. They will land in their new league just in time for a new $3 billion deal with ESPN that gives the network the broadcast rights to all the conference’s football games.

            The additions of BYU, Cincinnati, Houston and UCF will boost the Big 12's national footprint and push the league into new media markets.

            Texas and Oklahoma haven’t already left for the SEC because both schools have been tied to the Big 12 and its other members through a grant of media rights through the 2024-25 school year. That deal ran concurrently with the conference’s television contracts with Fox and ESPN.

            “We have always been committed to fulfilling our contractual obligations to the Big 12. The collegiate athletics landscape has continued to evolve rapidly, and working together to accelerate our exit produced benefits for all parties,” Texas President Jay Hartzell said. “The Big 12 has been a respected partner for nearly three decades, and we look forward to a final season of spirited competition with our friends and rivals.”

TCU, which made it the College Football Playoff championship game last season, joined Oklahoma as the only Big 12 teams to make the playoff.Big 12 officials were initially stunned by the departure.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805895,Lawyer: Santos had 2017 Pennsylvania theft charge expunged,"U.S. Rep. George Santos was charged with criminal theft in Pennsylvania in 2017 in connection with bad checks apparently used to buy puppies from dog breeders, according to a lawyer who said she helped the Republican with the case.

            The case was ultimately dismissed after Santos said the nine checks, totaling more than $15,000, were from a checkbook that had been stolen from him, according to information provided to The Associated Press on Thursday by the attorney, Tiffany Bogosian.

            The theft case, first reported by Politico, adds to the controversy surrounding the first-term Long Island congressman, who faces multiple investigations and has acknowledged lying about elements of his life story.











            A spokesperson for the York County district attorney's office in Pennsylvania, where the charges were filed, said the office cannot comment on expunged cases. Pennsylvania state police officials did not return messages seeking comment.

            A congressional aide to Santos referred questions to his attorney, Joseph Murray, who didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Santos has previously denied any illegal doings.

            The charges date to a time when Santos claimed to be leading a group, Friends of Pets United, that benefited sick, abandoned or neglected animals.

            Some people familiar with the group have questioned what became of the money it raised. FBI agents recently visited a New Jersey man who complained that Santos had raised $3,000 for his terminally ill dog, but never delivered the cash or helped the sick animal. 

            It’s not the first time Santos has been linked to a criminal investigation involving checks. Court records in Brazil, first reported by The New York Times, show Santos was the subject of a criminal charge there for using two stolen checks in 2008, when he would have been 19, to buy about $1,350 worth of items at a clothing shop in the city of Niteroi.

            The Times quoted local prosecutors as saying the case was dormant because Santos had never appeared in court. Santos has denied being sought by authorities in South America.

            Bogosian said she began helping Santos with the Pennsylvania theft case in 2020, after he told her he had been served with an extradition warrant. She gave the AP email correspondence she had with a Pennsylvania state trooper in February 2020.

            In the email to the trooper, she wrote that Santos told her one of four checkbooks he received from his bank disappeared in 2017 and he immediately called the bank, had the checks canceled and put stop pay orders on all the checks. He later closed the account.

            In the email, Bogosian said Santos was not aware of the checks written to the dog breeders until after he was charged. Defending her friend, she also wrote that the signatures on the checks differed from each other and from Santos' own signature.

            “A review of the below and attached will make clear my client is not only the victim of fraud but so are the additional payees listed below and whom received the attached checks,” Bogosian wrote in the email.

            Santos, she wrote, suspected that his roommate at the end of 2017, “a person only known as ‘Sydney Lima,'"" had access to the checks and was perhaps responsible.

            The charges were later expunged, but it is not clear exactly why.

            The memo lines on some of the bad checks written to the dog breeders said they had been used to buy “puppies.” 

            Shortly after the checks were written, Friends of Pets United held a puppy adoption event at a pet store in New York City, at which people paid hundreds of dollars for the animals.

            
                The New York Times reported Monday that after that adoption event, in November 2017, Santos asked the pet store owner to write a check from the proceeds to Anthony Devolder, the name Santos was going by at the time. 

            The owner rejected the request and instead made the check payable to Friends of Pets United. The owner, Daniel Avissato, told the Times he later discovered in his bank records that someone had blotted out Friends of Pets United on the check's recipient line and replaced it with Anthony Devolder.

            Santos has refused to answer questions about Friends of Pets United, but said in a tweet responding to some of the fundraising allegations that “my work in animal advocacy was the labor of love & hard work.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805913,NY Fashion Week: Siriano channels Audrey Hepburn in a garden,"NEW YORK (AP) — Christian Siriano lined his New York Fashion Week runway Thursday with thousands of multicolored flowers and put wide-brimmed hats worthy of muse Audrey Hepburn on some of his models to top off a big week.

            First, there was the custom burgundy power suit he made Vice President Kamala Harris for Tuesday's State of the Union. He nailed it in one trip to Washington, D.C., in one fitting.

            “And we had the Grammys and fashion week,” Siriano told The Associated Press in a backstage interview. “We had no time and I was like, well, we hope it works. It's just such an honor. We wanted to make her look really beautiful and powerful.""











            Then there was his update of Alicia Silverstone's iconic “Clueless” yellow plaid skirt set for her Rakuten Super Bowl commercial airing Sunday. He even scored a cameo as a student in Cher Horowitz's debate class.

            Siriano and Silverstone are long-time pals and she sits often on his front rows. She was away filming this time around. Lindsay Lohan, with brother Dakota and one of her sisters walking in the show, attended with Quinta Brunson and Julia Stiles.

            “Growing up, literally any young fashion designer is obsessed with ‘Clueless.’ I mean, Cher is your muse. It felt really full circle,” he said of his Super Bowl moment.

            Siriano had another muse on his mind for his latest collection: Hepburn. To be precise, Hepburn in a rose garden at midnight. He was inspired by a 1990s TV documentary series she did with Michael York, “Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn.”

            The series had Hepburn visiting spectacular gardens in England, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the U.S. and elsewhere.

            Siriano honored the series with Japanese-influenced hats in purple check and large 3D floral embellishments in looks of fuchsia, or as he described it, “orchid purple.” He incorporated roses into a swirly black-and-white print and offered up sunny yellow in solids and color blocked looks.

            And there were youthful, girly little black dresses, more matronly, roomy dresses and other looks, and a standout barely there evening dress in body-hugging, delicate tulle.

            Siriano took his flower mission seriously, sending out one model in one of his big hats adorned with huge blossoms, with more huge blossoms on the top of a matching fuchsia pantsuit.

            Wearable? It would take courage. A beautifully cut, long tuxedo coat with pants, all in the same pinky purple hue, might be easier.

            All thanks to Hepburn's first and only television series.

            “It was incredible and fabulous,” Siriano said of the show, “and just very inspiring.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805916,No. 2 Indiana uses late surge to beat No. 5 Iowa 87-78,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — Indiana guard Grace Berger came back for her fifth season to win a Big Ten championship.

            Her gritty play Thursday night put the Hoosiers on the precipice.

            She finished with a season-high 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists, Mackenzie Holmes added 24 points and the duo spurred a late charge to send No. 2 Indiana past Iowa 87-78.











            “I just really wanted to win,” Berger said. “I remember losing to them three times last year and in the Big Ten (Tournament) championship game, so any time you play a team like that, it means a little more.”

            Not surprisingly, the rematch and the first top-five matchup in Big Ten play in nearly 30 years lived up to the billing. 

            But after playing to a draw through each of the first two quarters, Berger asserted herself in the second half by making one big play after another and routinely bringing the record Assembly Hall crowd to its feet.

            Indiana (23-1, 12-1) has broken the attendance mark three times since January, this time with 13,046 inside the historic building as it won its 11th straight to take a 1 1/2-game lead in its quest for a second regular-season conference crown. Indiana's only other title came in 1982-83, the Big Ten's inaugural season of sponsoring women's basketball.

            Berger was 10 of 20 from the field and teamed up with Holmes to score 20 of Indiana's 23 third-quarter points and nearly half of the points in the decisive 17-7 fourth-quarter run.

            “I loved Grace’s mindset tonight,"" coach Teri Moren said. “You could tell she was not going to be denied. I’ve seen that look a lot, and I knew she wanted to lead us throughout the 40 minutes.”

            
                Caitlin Clark did everything she could to give Iowa (19-5, 11-2) a shot. Despite going 12 of 28 from the field, 3 of 11 on 3-pointers and logging eight turnovers, Clark still finished with 35 points, 10 assists and four rebounds.

            But Berger and Holmes made sure Clark couldn't keep Iowa's eight-game winning streak intact. Iowa center Monika Czinano finished with six points and fouled out in the fourth quarter.

            “Mackenzie Holmes did an excellent job in the post,” coach Lisa Bluder said. “I thought Grace Berger was outstanding. She played really, really well. So good game by Indiana and we’ll bounce back.”

            Berger's midrange jumper to close the third quarter finally gave Indiana a 62-57 lead, matching its biggest of the night. Then the Berger-Holmes combination spurred the big fourth-quarter run that made it 79-69 with 3:24 to play and Iowa never got within a possession again.

            Iowa went 12 of 23 at free-throw line and Indiana finished 22 of 34 on the night. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa: Clark is one of the frontrunners for national player of the year, and there's little doubt the Hawkeyes are among the nation's top teams. But in this raucous environment, the Hawkeyes lost their poise. They turned the ball over 18 times, went 6 of 23 on 3-pointers and it could cost last year's regular-season co-champs a shot at a second straight title.

            Indiana: The Hoosiers answered any lingering doubters with a gutsy performance. They struggled, at times, offensively, and played through some serious foul trouble before improving to 7-0 this season against ranked teams. They've also won 16 straight at home.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Indiana did what it needed to retain the highest ranking in school history. With no game until Monday, the showdown between the nation's only remaining unbeaten teams in No. 1 South Carolina and No. 3 LSU on Sunday could determine if Indiana gets another week at No. 2.

            Iowa, meanwhile, shouldn't slide much — if at all — after going toe-to-toe for 40 minutes at Indiana.

            SHE SAID IT

            “I thought the crowd was good,” Clark said when asked about the tension inside the arena. “I don't think we helped ourselves by starting the game with three turnovers in a row. I think there was a lot of self-inflicted problems by us. But you're a competitor and those are the moments you live for.”

(AP) — Indiana guard Grace Berger came back for her fifth season to win a Big Ten championship.Her gritty play Thursday night put the Hoosiers on the precipice.She finished with a season-high 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists, Mackenzie Holmes added 24 points and the duo spurred a late charge to send No. 2 Indiana past Iowa 87-78.“I just really wanted to win,” Berger said. “I remember losing to them three times last year and in the Big Ten (Tournament) championship game, so any time you play a team like that, it means a little more.”Not surprisingly, the rematch and the first top-five matchup in Big Ten play in nearly 30 years lived up to the billing.But after playing to a draw through each of the first two quarters, Berger asserted herself in the second half by making one big play after another and routinely bringing the record Assembly Hall crowd to its feet.Indiana (23-1, 12-1) has broken the attendance mark three times since January, this time with 13,046 inside the historic building as it won its 11th straight to take a 1 1/2-game lead in its quest for a second regular-season conference crown. Indiana's only other title came in 1982-83, the Big Ten's inaugural season of sponsoring women's basketball.Berger was 10 of 20 from the field and teamed up with Holmes to score 20 of Indiana's 23 third-quarter points and nearly half of the points in the decisive 17-7 fourth-quarter run.“I loved Grace’s mindset tonight,"" coach Teri Moren said. “You could tell she was not going to be denied. I’ve seen that look a lot, and I knew she wanted to lead us throughout the 40 minutes.”Caitlin Clark did everything she could to give Iowa (19-5, 11-2) a shot. Despite going 12 of 28 from the field, 3 of 11 on 3-pointers and logging eight turnovers, Clark still finished with 35 points, 10 assists and four rebounds.But Berger and Holmes made sure Clark couldn't keep Iowa's eight-game winning streak intact. Iowa center Monika Czinano finished with six points and fouled out in the fourth quarter.“Mackenzie Holmes did an excellent job in the post,” coach Lisa Bluder said. “I thought Grace Berger was outstanding. She played really, really well. So good game by Indiana and we’ll bounce back.”Berger's midrange jumper to close the third quarter finally gave Indiana a 62-57 lead, matching its biggest of the night. Then the Berger-Holmes combination spurred the big fourth-quarter run that made it 79-69 with 3:24 to play and Iowa never got within a possession again.Iowa went 12 of 23 at free-throw line and Indiana finished 22 of 34 on the night.BIG PICTUREIowa: Clark is one of the frontrunners for national player of the year, and there's little doubt the Hawkeyes are among the nation's top teams. But in this raucous environment, the Hawkeyes lost their poise. They turned the ball over 18 times, went 6 of 23 on 3-pointers and it could cost last year's regular-season co-champs a shot at a second straight title.Indiana: The Hoosiers answered any lingering doubters with a gutsy performance. They struggled, at times, offensively, and played through some serious foul trouble before improving to 7-0 this season against ranked teams. They've also won 16 straight at home.POLL IMPLICATIONSIndiana did what it needed to retain the highest ranking in school history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805918,No. 9 Duke women dominate Boston College 68-27,"BOSTON (AP) — Duke coach Kara Lawson looked down at the postgame box score and marveled at the numbers she saw.

            Or, more precisely, the numbers she didn't see.

            The ninth-ranked Blue Devils held Boston College to single-digit scoring in all four quarters in a 68-27 victory on Thursday night. The 27 points were the fewest allowed by Duke this season and second-fewest the Blue Devils have ever yielded in an Atlantic Coast Conference game. 











            “If we’ve held a team in single digits in a quarter ... then we’re like, ‘OK, we played a good defensive quarter,’” Lawson said. “Didn’t expect to have four in a row. But I felt like we played pretty good defense in the first quarter that we held them to nine and that ended up being the quarter we gave up the most points in.”

            Reigan Richardson scored 14 points and Celeste Taylor added 11 for Duke, which earned the 1,000th victory in program history. Richardson scored 10 points in the second quarter, when the Blue Devils (21-3, 11-2 ACC) turned a five-point lead into a 32-14 runaway. 

            Boston College (14-13, 4-10) made just two baskets in the period, going scoreless for the last 7:55 of the half. Duke held BC to one basket in the third while extending the lead to 26 points, and two in the fourth, shutting the Eagles out for the last four minutes of the game. 

            “I never would have thought it, that I would coach a team that scores that little in a basketball game,” BC coach Joanna Bernabei-McNamee said. “We just never had a really good flow. That’s a credit for Duke, and how they defend.”

            Maria Gakdeng had 11 points and seven rebounds for the Eagles, who shot 18.4% from the field.

            ROAD REPRESENTATION

            The blowout pleased the many Blue Devils fans in the crowd of 2,347 — the biggest of the season at the Conte Forum. A boisterous cheer erupted when Duke reserve Shay Bollin, who is from nearby Raynham, scored with 32 seconds left.

            Also showing their support were Celtics forward Grant Williams and team president Brad Stevens. Lawson, who was an assistant for the NBA team before taking the job at Duke, brought the Blue Devils to the Celtics game against Philadelphia on Wednesday night. 

            “The Celtics organization gave me my first opportunity to coach,” she said. “It’s a family, and I’m still part of that family. I still root really hard for them and I want them to win. And so it was a chance to kind of blend my two families.”

            1,000-WIN CLUB

            Lawson, who has won 41 games since taking over at Duke in 2020, deferred credit for the 1,000-win milestone to those who came before her.

            “Obviously, when you coach at Duke, you know it’s way bigger than any one person, any one player,” she said. “I think it just speaks to the tradition and the level of success and the type of people that we have in our program. I’ve only been here three years, so we’re making a little contribution to that but not a very big one.”

            BIG PICTURE

            The Blue Devils grabbed sole possession of first place in the ACC with a victory at Notre Dame on Sunday. Duke faces fifth-place Miami on Sunday and then third-place Virginia Tech on Thursday in Blacksburg.

            BC had won two straight against Duke, including a win in Durham last year that was the Eagles’ first in Cameron Indoor Stadium since joining the ACC. But the Eagles lost for the eighth time in nine games.

(AP) — Grace Berger finished with a season-high 26 points, nine rebounds and six assists and Mackenzie Holmes added 24 points as No. 2 Indiana used a late scoring run to pull away from No. 5 Iowa 87-78 on Thursday night.

            The Hoosiers (23-1, 12-1 Big Ten) used a 17-7 fourth-quarter run to earn their 11th consecutive win, this time in front of a record crowd of 13,046. Indiana has broken the attendance mark three times since January and now has a 1 1/2-game lead in the chase for its first regular-season conference crown since the Big Ten’s inaugural season of 1982-83.

            Caitlin Clark had 35 points, 10 assists and four rebounds to lead the Hawkeyes (19-5, 11-2), who lost for the first time since Jan. 1.











            NO. 1 SOUTH CAROLINA 83, AUBURN 48

            AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Zia Cooke had 15 points and four assists in 20 minutes to lead South Carolina to its 30th straight win.

            The Gamecocks (24-0, 11-0 Southeastern Conference) dominated from the start in a game sandwiched between a pair of top-5 matchups. They were coming off an 81-77 win over No. 4 UConn and host No. 3 LSU on Sunday.

            Aliyah Boston had 10 points and eight rebounds for South Carolina before exiting with 8:54 left to end a string of eight straight double-doubles. 

            Sydney Shaw tied her career high with 15 points and made 3 of 4 3-pointers to lead the Tigers (13-10, 3-8). Auburn played without its top scorer and rebounder Aicha Coulibaly, who sat out with a leg injury. Mar’shaun Bostic added 10 points.

            TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Cameron Brink and Haley Jones each scored 18 points and Stanford used a strong rebounding performance to beat Arizona.

            The Cardinal (23-3, 11-2 Pac-12) won their sixth straight against the Wildcats (18-6, 8-5), a streak that includes the 2021 NCAA title game. Stanford moved into first place in the conference, a half-game ahead of No. 7 Utah.

            Jones shot 8 for 11 from the field and added 12 rebounds and six assists. Brink scored all her points and added eight rebounds in 21 minutes.

            EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Diamond Miller had 18 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Maryland eased past struggling Northwestern for its seventh win in eight games.

            Brir McDaniel added 14 points and the Terrapins (20-5, 12-3 Big Ten) followed up the program’s most lopsided win over a top-10 opponent with another dominant performance.

            Coming off a 90-54 romp over then-No. 10 Ohio State on Sunday, Maryland outscored Northwestern (8-16, 1-12) 18-2 while holding the Wildcats without a field goal in the second quarter. 

            Paige Mott led Northwestern with 15 points. 

            NO. 9 DUKE 68, BOSTON COLLEGE 27

            BOSTON (AP) — Reigan Richardson scored 14 points and Celeste Taylor added 11 to lead Duke to the 1,000th win in the program’s history.

            Richardson scored 10 points in the second quarter, when the Blue Devils (21-3, 11-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) turned a five-point lead into a 32-14 runaway. Boston College (14-13, 4-10) made just two baskets in the period, going scoreless for the last 7:55 of the half.

            Senior guard Dayshanette Harris led the Panthers (8-16, 1-12) with a season-high 20 points.

            North Carolina was without two starters for the second straight game in Alyssa Ustby (13.6 points and 8.9 rebounds) and Eva Hodgson (10.2 points) due to injury. Deja Kelly led North Carolina (17-7, 8-5) with a career-high 32 points. Kennedy Todd-Williams added 14 points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805921,Braden Smith leads No. 1 Purdue past Iowa 87-73,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Braden Smith scored a career-high 24 points to lead No. 1 Purdue to an 87-73 victory over Iowa on Thursday night.

            Smith, a freshman guard, shot 8 of 10 — including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. 

            “I wish he would shoot more, from Day One I told him that,” Purdue coach Matt Painter said. “He’s a 40 to 45% 3-point shooter and it didn’t make sense. Any time you have to ability to play through ball screens, get to the rim and shoot or take the pull-ups and open shots, too. 











            ""He likes to get everyone involved. He has really good instincts, but at times he doesn’t play off his instincts.”

            But Smith did exactly that against Iowa.

            “I attack the game the same way,” Smith said. “When the shots fall, the confidence goes up a little bit. It just felt good to make a couple of shots.”

            Zach Edey scored 14 points on 4-of-7 shooting. Edey, who was averaging 22.4 points entering the game, had just four points until the final 8 1/2 minutes. He grabbed a team-high 14 rebounds, and Caleb Furst added 10 as Purdue held a 43-23 edge.

            “They doubled Zach every time he touched the ball and we still scored 87 points,” Painter said.

            Fletcher Loyer scored 17 points, Furst 11 and Mason Gillis 10 for the Boilermakers (23-2, 12-2 Big Ten). 

            “It's cool to see, but when teams want to play like that we have a bunch of guys that can step up,” Edey said. “We have a really deep team and we've got a lot of guys that can hurt you and that was showing today.”

            Kris Murray led Iowa with 24 points on 10-of-16 shooting, and Filip Rebraca had 17 for the Hawkeyes (15-9, 7-6).

            “He’s (Smith) terrific, but everybody on the team is really good, that’s why they are ranked No. 1,"" Iowa coach Fran McCaffery said. “Our anticipation rotations were not good enough. It’s hard because their team is very unselfish, they share the ball. That gives you a lot of ground to cover.

            The Boilermakers led by as many as 21 points early in the second half. Purdue was ahead 68-51 when the Hawkeyes went on a 13-2 spurt to close the deficit to 70-64 with 5:39 remaining.

            Edey, who had been quiet most of the game, sank a hook shot and made a dunk to give Purdue a 74-64 edge.

            “We’re not shocked by it,"" Smith said. ""We knew they were able to come back and hit those shots. We handled it well and got some shots to fall.”

            Purdue took a 38-21 lead at halftime on Smith’s jumper with 3 seconds left. Smith led Purdue with 10 points in the first half. The Boilermakers took the lead at 4-2 on a basket by Loyer and led the rest of the game.

            Purdue shot 44% in the first half while holding Iowa to 29%. The Hawkeyes shot 60% in the second half.

            “I didn’t think we moved well enough in our motion game,” McCaffery said of the first half “They’re a good defensive team. It’s a hard team to drive on. It doesn't help we were 1 of 10 on 3s in the first half.”

            For the game, Purdue shot 55%, while Iowa shot 45%.

            The one negative for Purdue is it 17 turnovers, nine more than Iowa.

            Painter won his 250th game at Mackey Arena, improving his home record to 250-43.

            BIG PICTURE

            Iowa: After being dominated for the first 30 minutes, the Hawkeyes woke up offensively and got as close as six points. Iowa is seeking to lock up an NCAA Tournament bid with a strong finish in the final six Big Ten regular-season games.

            Purdue: The Boilermakers rebounded from its loss at Indiana with a dominating performance for most of the game, holding Iowa to a mere 21 points in the first half. The Hawkeyes were averaging 81.5 points per game.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The Boilermakers stayed on course to remain No. 1 with an easy home victory with a game Sunday at Northwestern.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805939,"Subs Anthony, Bol key Magic's win over West-leading Nuggets","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Reserves Cole Anthony and Bol Bol each scored 17 points to lead the Orlando Magic to a 115-104 win over the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets on Thursday night.

            Wendell Carter Jr. led seven Magic scorers in double figures with 19 points, and Orlando's bench outscored the Nuggets' reserves 56-10.

            “This second group is starting to really figure it out,” said Cole, who had seven rebounds and seven assists. “As a unit we’re just really locking in on that defensive end and trying to let our defense spark our offense.”











            Aaron Gordon had a season-high 37 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Nuggets. Nikola Jokic had 29 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, and combined with Gordon to score all 29 of Denver's points in the third quarter.

            But after a shaky start, the Magic, who stand 13th in the Eastern Conference at 23-33, had their way.

            “Our guys know and get that we can play with anybody in the league, and that’s what we’re going to continue to prove,” Magic coach Jamahn Mosley said. “That’s how we’re going to continue to play on a nightly basis.”

            After missing their first five shots and falling behind 12-0, the Magic shot 63% (27 for 43) for the rest of the first half. They led by 16 points before Gordon and Jokic helped Denver cut its deficit to 10 points — 65-55 — halftime.

            “The message was simple at halftime — we’re not playing hard enough, we’re not playing physical enough,” said Denver coach Michael Malone. “They’re outworking us, they’re diving on the floor for loose balls and we’re bending over, trying to pick them up.”

            Gordon (17 points) and Jokic (12) handled all the scoring for the Nuggets in the third quarter, and a 3-pointer by Gordon pulled them to within three late in the period.

            But Gordon and Jokic spent the first 3:34 of the final period on the bench, and Anthony and Bol led a rally that pushed Orlando's lead back to 107-88 with 6:05 remaining.

            “I didn't do the job tonight,” said Ish Smith, who went scoreless in 14-plus minutes off the Denver bench. “When they are rolling and getting 50/50 balls, getting second shots, and playing with a lot of energy, you have to match their energy, and we didn't do the job.” 

            Bol scored 12 straight points before leaving the game with 4:36 remaining. Anthony finished with 17 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.

            “I think Cole was fantastic tonight,” said Mosley. “He did such a great job or us being able to push the pace ... a big part is him just being himself, being aggressive early, attacking, and being able to break the defense down.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805946,Oregon court refuses to overturn order blocking gun measure,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — The Oregon Supreme Court has again refused to overturn a lower court ruling blocking a voter-approved gun measure from taking effect. 

            In a ruling Thursday, the high court concluded it would be inappropriate to get involved while the matter is still being addressed in a trial court, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. The measure remains blocked pending a hearing on its constitutionality.

            Voters in November narrowly approved the measure, which requires a permit to buy a gun and a background check to be completed before a gun can be sold or transferred. It also restricts the sale, manufacture and use of magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. 











            There have been legal challenges in federal and state courts. 

            Four federal cases have been consolidated. The judge in that matter has ruled that the law could take effect while she hears further arguments but allowed the state to postpone implementing the permit requirement until the systems needed to administer it are in place. Additional testimony is expected later this month. 

            The case before the state Supreme Court arose from litigation in Harney County. Because the lawsuit challenged the measure under the Oregon Constitution, it held precedence in the state, legal experts have said.

            In December, Circuit Court Judge Robert Raschio temporarily blocked the measure from taking effect. The Oregon Department of Justice asked the state Supreme Court to overturn that order, but the justices declined to consider the appeal. Raschio later extended his order.

            The state Supreme Court said its decision Thursday does not preclude a future challenge.

            Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said her office intends to ""continue to defend the law zealously in the Harney County court.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805975,US assistant defense secretary says China will not attack Taiwan before 2030,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner predicted that a Taiwan Strait conflict would not happen before 2030 during a senate foreign relations committee hearing on U.S.-China policy Thursday (Feb. 9).

            Responding to a question by Senator Marco Rubio about whether China will attack Taiwan in this decade, Ratner said, “I think we can get to the end of this decade without them committing major aggression against Taiwan.”

            Senator Chris Murphy asked Ratner if he thought a Taiwan Strait conflict was unavoidable. The assistant secretary said that U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the Department of Defense (DOD) “do not believe an invasion of Taiwan is imminent or inevitable.” “That continues to be our assessment,” he said.

            He added the DOD is “laser-focused” on maintaining deterrence long into the future and will continue cooperating with regional allies and partners to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific.











            Ratner reiterated the U.S. is fixated on “understanding and communicating with Taiwan” about its defensive needs required for deterrence. He said Washington was dedicated to its commitments listed in the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), including “providing Taiwan with self-defense capabilities and maintaining our own capacity to resist any use of force that jeopardizes the security of the people of Taiwan.”

            “The TRA is backed by strong, bipartisan support and has formed the bedrock of peace, stability, and deterrence in the Taiwan Strait over the last four decades,” he said.

            National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told a press conference on Wednesday (Feb. 8) the U.S. takes seriously the responsibility to help Taiwan defend itself. Taiwan’s Minister of National Defense announced the same day it signed two contracts with the United States worth NT$2.56 billion (US$85.32 million) to secure the maintenance of its F-16 fighter jets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805978,No. 1 South Carolina women beat Auburn for 30th straight win,"AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — South Carolina didn't get caught looking back or ahead in a game tucked between two higher-profile matchups.

            Zia Cooke had 15 points and four assists in 20 minutes to lead the top-ranked Gamecocks to their 30th straight win, 83-48 over Auburn on Thursday night.

            The Gamecocks (24-0, 11-0 Southeastern Conference) dominated from the start. They were coming off an 81-77 win over No. 4 UConn and host No. 3 LSU on Sunday.











            “We have a team that just takes care of what’s in front of them, doesn’t look ahead,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “We stay current and that’s because we’ve got a very experienced, seasoned team. They’ve always been that way. No matter what game that’s in front of us, they’ve stayed current.”

            Aliyah Boston had 10 points and eight rebounds for South Carolina before exiting with 8:54 left to end a string of eight straight double-doubles. Victaria Saxton scored six of the Gamecocks' first eight points and finished with 10. Kierra Fletcher had nine points and five assists.

            South Carolina outrebounded Auburn 50-26 and had 11 players score. Cooke and Boston both got to sit early while the deep bench kept it going.

            “They played probably four or five minutes less than what they normally play,” Staley said. “We’ve got a really good bench. They are locked in. We have developed that bench over the season. 

            ""The maturity level, the growth, the communication, they’re so very competitive that there’s no letdown. They don’t want to let each other down.”

            Sydney Shaw tied her career high with 15 points and made 3 of 4 3-pointers to lead the Tigers (13-10, 3-8). Auburn played without its top scorer and rebounder Aicha Coulibaly, who sat out with a leg injury. Mar'shaun Bostic added 10 points.

            No. 2 scorer Honesty Scott-Grayson was held to four points on 2-of-11 shooting.

            South Carolina doubled up Auburn in the first half, 42-21, after scoring the first eight points of the second quarter.

            It didn't get closer.

            The Gamecocks made 34 of 69 shots (49.3%). Auburn was 19-of-61 shooting (31.1%) against the nation's top scoring defense.

            “I thought they battled,” Auburn coach Johnnie Harris said. “There's a lot of things we have to work on. We have a lot to fix, but I thought this game was important.

            ""If you’re a competitor you want to be in this game. They’re the No. 1 team in the country for a reason so even though we’re young you want to be in this game because you want to be able to see where you go from here.”

            BIG PICTURE

            South Carolina: Has won the last 14 meetings. The Gamecocks had assists on 19 of 34 baskets.

            Auburn: Dropped its second straight after a three-game SEC winning streak. South Carolina won the first meeting 94-42 on Jan. 5.

            GOOD LUCK JERSEY

            Staley wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey and has high hopes for her team against Kansas City in the Super Bowl.

            “I feel good,” she said. “I think everyone time someone asks me that, we move it up by a touchdown, so we’re going to win by four touchdowns.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805980,"Van Riemsdyk, Hart lead Flyers to shootout win over Oilers","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — James van Riemsdyk and Morgan Frost scored in the shootout, Carter Hart made 34 saves and the Philadelphia Flyers defeated the Edmonton Oilers 2-1 on Thursday night.

            Kevin Hayes scored in regulation for Philadelphia. It was the Flyers’ second win in 11 tries in games past regulation.

            “We haven’t won many of them, but tonight was a big one for us,” coach John Tortorella said.











            Evander Kane scored and Connor McDavid had an assist for the Oilers, who lost for just the second time in 10 games. Edmonton has earned points in both of those defeats during the stretch, as they have come past regulation. Stuart Skinner stopped 35 shots for Edmonton.

            After Philadelphia’s Travis Konecny and McDavid failed to score, Frost and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins converted in the shootout. Van Riemsdyk then gave Philadelphia a 2-1 advantage by shooting past Skinner’s right pad before Hart clinched the victory with a pad save of Leon Draisaitl’s attempt.

            “He shot five-hole, and I made the save,” Hart said. “Big two points for us.”

            Hart made a fantastic glove save on McDavid’s wrister 3:30 into the extra session, after McDavid, who leads the NHL in goals and points, came flying into the zone.

            “I thought we played really well in front of him, but he made some key saves at key times,” Tortorella said of Hart.

            The Oilers appeared to go in front 2-1 with 12:36 left in regulation when Zach Hyman shot the puck into an empty net. But the goal was overturned after Tortorella challenged the play. Hart made the initial save on Warren Foegele’s close-range attempt. Foegele then crashed into Hart, and the puck sat in the crease for an easy tap-in by Hyman. Officials initially called it a good goal, but overturned the call on the ice after video review because Hyman interfered with Hart.

            Hart was convinced the goal would be overturned.

            Said Hart, “His momentum runs into me and he takes me out of the crease. It was pretty obvious and the right call.”

            Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft disagreed.

            “I thought it was a goal, but I’m not the guy who makes the decision,” he said.

            Edmonton nearly went ahead with two minutes to play in the third period on Kane’s wraparound try that hit off the skate of defenseman Ivan Provorov. But Provorov recovered to clear the puck just before it crossed the goal line. Philadelphia had its best scoring chance of the period just over a minute later when Noah Cates got open in the slot, but his wrister was stopped by Skinner’s blocker.

            McDavid recorded his NHL-leading 94th point by passing to Kane for the tying goal 1:56 into the second. The six-time All-Star created space in the offensive zone and then dropped the puck to Kane, who shot past Hart’s right pad from the left circle for his eighth of the season. McDavid’s 53rd assist of the season extended his point streak to 14 contests, with nine goals and 13 assists during that span.

            Hayes, Philadelphia’s All-Star representative last weekend in Florida, netted his 16th of the season 7:50 into the contest to put the Flyers up 1-0. Travis Sanheim set up the goal with a drop pass, and Hayes fired a wrist shot from the right circle past Skinner’s glove side.

            Tortorella liked the way his team came out to start – and throughout.

            “If you don’t have a readiness against that team, you’ll get spanked,” he said. “I’m very happy we played the full 65 (minutes).”

            NOTES: The teams meet for the second and final time on Feb. 21 in Edmonton. … Several “E-A-G-L-E-S!” chants for the Philadelphia Eagles broke out throughout the game as the city is abuzz in anticipation of Sunday’s Super Bowl. … The Flyers extended their scoreless streak on the power play to 0 for 13 after failing to convert on their three man-advantage chances.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805981,"Vasilevskiy ends 84-game shutout drought, Lightning beat Avs","TAMPA, Fla, (AP) — Andrei Vasilevskiy made 30 saves to stop an 84-game regular-season shutout drought, Branon Hagel had two goals and an assist, and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Colorado Avalanche 5-0 on Thursday night.

            This was the first meeting between the teams since Colorado ended Tampa Bay’s two-year run as NHL champs with a series win in last season’s Stanley Cup Final.

            Vasilevskiy made a nifty glove save on Matt Nieto’s early second-period breakaway shot en route to his 29th career shutout and first since blanking Seattle on Nov. 26, 2021.











            “Hopefully they come in bunches,"" Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “It was great. The crowd was great at the end, cheering for him. It's weird. Some years, you get a ton of them, and some years they get broken up late and it happened to him a couple times this year.”

            Vasilevskiy is 11-0-0 at home, dating to December and became the second NHL goalie to post multiple 11-game win streaks, joining Montreal Hall of Famer Ken Dryden.

            Vasilevskiy said he was unaware of how long his shutout drought was.

            “I know how many wins I have this season,” he said. ""That’s the only thing that matters.”

            Corey Perry, Brayden Point and Mikhail Sergachev also scored for the Lightning, who had lost two in row. 

            Nikita Kucherov got his NHL-leading 56th assist on Point’s goal to break his own record (2018-19) with a point in his 17th consecutive home game. Alex Killorn had three assists.

            Tampa Bay set a team record with a point in 14 straight home games.

            Alexandar Georgiev stopped 27 shots as Colorado fell to 7-2-1 in its last 10 games. The Avalanche were coming off a 2-1 overtime loss Tuesday night at Pittsburgh.

            “Not finishing,"" Colorado right wing Mikko Rantanen said. “I think in the first we were playing pretty good. We were creating enough chances to score. Some really good looks in the first. We could have easily got the first goal, but we didn't. We've got to find a way to score more frequently and better percentage.""

            Hagel and Point, on the power play, scored 1:57 apart midway through the second to make it 3-0.

            After Vasilevskiy made a strong save on Rantanen, Anthony Cirelli got his second assist setting up Hagel at 8:32.

            Point was credited with his 32nd goal when Colorado’s Valeri Nichushkin put a clearing attempt into his own net with 9:31 left in the period.

            Hagel put the Lightning up 4-0 with 1:53 remaining in the second.

            Perry opened the scoring during a power play at 15:15 of the first. It gave the right wing his 15th season of 10 or more goals, and moved him within one goal of tying Tony Amonte (416) for 93rd place on the career list.

            Sergachev had a third-period goal.

            MAKAR MISSING

            Avalanche D Cale Makar didn’t play due to a head injury and will miss at least one additional game. He was hurt on a check by Pittsburgh’s Jeff Carter on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805982,"Conley's maturity, experience led T-wolves to Russell trade","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Three years after the Minnesota Timberwolves acquired D'Angelo Russell for what then was their dream pairing with Karl-Anthony Towns, they traded him for a much older point guard.

            In an NBA with so few teams settled on their stars, the Wolves made yet another alteration of their core in their latest attempt to keep up in the crowded Western Conference race.

            
                Out goes Russell and the best shooting of his eight-year career, and in comes Mike Conley and his proven experience as a distributor on the floor and a mentor off of it.











            “We got a really good passer, and we had to move a really good passer,” Timberwolves president of basketball operations Tim Connelly said on Thursday night after the three-team, eight-player, four-draft pick deal with the Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz was finalized. “The thing that jumped out with Mike is the package of player and person. We saw it was the best way to continue to grow this team and how can we best complement some of our core pieces. Again, D-Lo did that at a very high level. We’re hoping we identified another guy who can do it in a different way in Mike.”

            Money played a role, with Russell's contract expiring this summer and more than $31 million set to come off Minnesota's salary cap charge. Conley is signed through the 2023-24 season, making about $9 million less. He's more than 8 years older.

            Conley's previous success throwing lobs to and running pick-and-rolls with Rudy Gobert with the Jazz was also attractive to the Wolves. Minnesota paid a big price to get Gobert entering this season, but Russell never meshed with the big man.

            Ultimately, there's an immaturity the inconsistent Wolves are carrying that Connelly was clearly motivated to address by bringing in a well-regarded leader like Conley even though he has been limited by injuries in his 30s and isn't nearly as quick at 35 as he once was.

            “Mike as a rookie had elite habits, and they got better and better and better. You don’t play at this level at this age without taking care of yourself, without having a tremendous attention to detail both on and off the court,” Connelly said.

            Conley and Nickiel Alexander-Walker — the other guard acquired in the deal from the Jazz — were listed as questionable to play at Memphis on Friday, with completion of their physical exams still pending. Conley played 12 seasons for the Grizzlies before joining the Jazz, adding to the intrigue around his debut.

            The Wolves also got Utah's 2025 and 2026 second-round picks and a 2024 second-round pick from the Los Angeles Lakers in the deal. To make roster space, they waived guard Bryn Forbes.

            With Gobert still trying to fit in offensively with the Wolves — and vice versa — and Towns still sidelined by a severe calf strain, the trade has added yet more transitional challenges for coach Chris Finch and his staff with the cut line for the playoffs looming just one loss away.

            The Wolves are also just a few wins away from a top-four seed. 

            “A lot of teams certainly added talented players. To get good players, you have to trade good players away. How quickly can you hit the ground running? So it’ll be fun,” Connelly said.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Three years after the Minnesota Timberwolves acquired D'Angelo Russell for what then was their dream pairing with Karl-Anthony Towns, they traded him for a much older point guard.In an NBA with so few teams settled on their stars, the Wolves made yet another alteration of their core in their latest attempt to keep up in the crowded Western Conference race.Out goes Russell and the best shooting of his eight-year career, and in comes Mike Conley and his proven experience as a distributor on the floor and a mentor off of it.“We got a really good passer, and we had to move a really good passer,” Timberwolves president of basketball operations Tim Connelly said on Thursday night after the three-team, eight-player, four-draft pick deal with the Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz was finalized. “The thing that jumped out with Mike is the package of player and person. We saw it was the best way to continue to grow this team and how can we best complement some of our core pieces. Again, D-Lo did that at a very high level. We’re hoping we identified another guy who can do it in a different way in Mike.”Money played a role, with Russell's contract expiring this summer and more than $31 million set to come off Minnesota's salary cap charge. Conley is signed through the 2023-24 season, making about $9 million less. He's more than 8 years older.Conley's previous success throwing lobs to and running pick-and-rolls with Rudy Gobert with the Jazz was also attractive to the Wolves. Minnesota paid a big price to get Gobert entering this season, but Russell never meshed with the big man.Ultimately, there's an immaturity the inconsistent Wolves are carrying that Connelly was clearly motivated to address by bringing in a well-regarded leader like Conley even though he has been limited by injuries in his 30s and isn't nearly as quick at 35 as he once was.“Mike as a rookie had elite habits, and they got better and better and better. You don’t play at this level at this age without taking care of yourself, without having a tremendous attention to detail both on and off the court,” Connelly said.Conley and Nickiel Alexander-Walker — the other guard acquired in the deal from the Jazz — were listed as questionable to play at Memphis on Friday, with completion of their physical exams still pending.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805983,"Donna Kelce kept Super Bowl sons fed with chicken, ribs","PHOENIX (AP) — It's difficult enough to feed two regular-sized teenage boys, much less a pair such as Travis and Jason Kelce.

            One dedicated momma made it happen. Donna Kelce said on Thursday before the ""NFL Honors"" show that she did her best to keep up with her two sons' voracious appetites, but it was easier said than done.

            “The refrigerator was always packed, but it didn't last more than a day or so,” she said. ""Whole chickens, they would eat lots of pork, ribs. I'd have leftovers in the refrigerator and it never lasted past the day.











            “When they left for college, I got a raise.”

            All that eating eventually paid off. Travis is now a star tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs while Jason is the longtime starting center for the Philadelphia Eagles. The brother-on-brother matchup in Super Bowl 57 on Sunday in Glendale, Arizona, is the first in the championship game's history.

            Donna and her husband, Ed, have mostly kept private over the years, but she’s become a minor celebrity as she crisscrosses the country to watch her boys — often in a jersey with Travis’ front stitched to Jason’s back.

            More than 150,000 fans signed a petition for the NFL to have her do the Super Bowl coin toss, but she said in a social media post that the NFL already had someone in place.

            She looked at ease on the red carpet on Thursday night, chatting with anyone who wanted to talk about her remarkable family.

            “I just go where I’m told,” Kelce said, grinning.

            GRONK SURPRISED BRADY'S DONE

            Count Rob Gronkowski among those surprised that longtime quarterback Tom Brady has decided to retire.

            “I was just surprised a little bit because I know he can play until he’s 50 years old, 100%” Gronkowski told the AP on Thursday. “He takes care of his body to the ‘T.’ He’s such a professional. He knows the game of football like no other. So, to have about five more years left of him and to see him retire was just a little shocking, but I’m very happy for him, man.”

            Gronkowski and Brady sit second all time for regular-season touchdown combinations. Gronkowski, a four-time Super Bowl champion, caught 90 regular-season touchdown passes from Brady in his career and earned several accolades with Brady as his quarterback, including five Pro Bowl appearances and four first-team All-Pro selections.

            “I’m wishing nothing but happiness for Tom,” Gronkowski said. “He definitely deserves it. He definitely did his duties — double, double the amount. He deserves some time off now, that’s for sure.”

            “CURSE” OF KURT WARNER

            Former quarterback Kurt Warner is the last quarterback to win the regular-season MVP and the Super Bowl in the same season. 

            That was the 1999 season. After that, the next nine players to win the MVP and then appear in the Super Bowl have an 0-9 record.

            “I'm aware of that,” Warner said. “It's funny you called it a curse, because you know where the curse started? The curse also started with me. I was the last one to do it. Two years later, I won the MVP, went to the Super Bowl and lost.""

            Warner said the 0-9 record is proof that football is a team sport and one player can't carry teams to a championship. That's why he's leaning Eagles for his Super Bowl 57 pick. 

            “I'm leaning toward the Eagles,” Warner said. “I just think top to bottom they're the better team. It doesn't guarantee anything — it's whoever plays better for 60 minutes. But I'm leaning Eagles because they have so many ways to beat you, so many players who can beat you.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805985,Seoul lifts visa limits on short-term travelers from China,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea says it will remove the entry restrictions it placed on short-term travelers from China since the start of the year as officials see the COVID-19 situation in that country as stabilizing.

            South Korea in early January stopped issuing most short-term visas at its consulates in China, citing concerns about a virus surge in the country and the potential for new mutations. China abruptly eased coronavirus restrictions in December, raising the prospect of millions of Chinese traveling abroad again for the first time in three years.

            South Korea also required all passengers from China, Hong Kong and Macao to submit proof of negative tests taken with 48 hours before their arrival and put them through tests again once they arrive.











            Following an anti-virus meeting on Friday, the government decided to normalize short-term visa applications at its consulates in China from Saturday. The testing requirements were maintained but officials say those steps could be relaxed later depending on virus developments.

            While allowing the extension of existing visas, South Korea had stopped issuing most short-term visas at its consulates in China, except for essential government, diplomatic and business activities and humanitarian reasons. 

            The South Korean virus measures prompted China to retaliate by suspending South Korean short-term visa applications, raising business concerns in a country that heavily depends on exports to China. 

            China called the South Korean move a “step in the right direction towards reducing barriers to people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,” and indicated it would likely respond in kind.

            “China will actively consider taking the reciprocal approach of resuming the issuance of short-term visas for South Korean citizens,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing Friday.

            “We hope the ROK will work with us to provide more convenience for the normal flow of people between the two sides,” she said, referring to South Korea's formal name, the Republic of Korea.

            South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare said 1.4% of Chinese short-term travelers tested positive after their arrivals, compared to nearly 22% in the first week of January. As of Friday, eight of them remained in quarantine at designated hotels, compared to around 140 quarantines in early January. 

            “The downward trend apparently reflects the change in the COVID-19 situation in China, where signs of a viral emergence following the Lunar New Year’s holidays haven’t been evident and the emergence of new variants hasn’t happened,” the Health Ministry said in a statement announcing the easing of border controls. 

            According to data from South Korea’s Disease Control and Prevention Agency, about 10,600 short-term travelers from China underwent airport tests after arrival since Jan. 2 and about 7% of them tested positive.

            South Korean officials defended their measures after Beijing stopped issuing new visas in the country in apparent retaliation, saying that the spread of COVID-19 in China was creating concern about a possible emergence of new variants and complaining that Chinese authorities weren’t sharing transparent infection data.

            South Korea had previously said it would maintain the measures until the end of February, guarding a further spread of the virus in China following the Lunar New Year holidays in late January.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea says it will remove the entry restrictions it placed on short-term travelers from China since the start of the year as officials see the COVID-19 situation in that country as stabilizing.South Korea in early January stopped issuing most short-term visas at its consulates in China, citing concerns about a virus surge in the country and the potential for new mutations.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805986,"Zadina returns, scores go-ahead goal as Red Wings top Flames","DETROIT (AP) — Filip Zadina made a successful return to the Detroit lineup, scoring the go-ahead goal at 5:51 of the third period to send the Red Wings over the Calgary Flames 2-1 Thursday night.

            Zadina had not played since Nov. 5 because of a broken right leg.

            “That was lifting for our group and really happy for him,” Red Wings coach Derek Lalonde said. “Tonight I thought for the most part a pretty complete game. I don’t think we’ll apologize, or our guys won’t, I’m not saying we have to be perfect, but that’s how it has to look for us to win. And we got it done tonight.”











            Zadina passed to Oskar Sundqvist, got the puck right back and snapped it into the open right side of the net past goaltender Dan Vladar for his first goal of the season.

            “Obviously it felt pretty good,” Zadina said. “It felt even better that I could help the team to win the game. It felt amazing.”

            Flames forward Blake Coleman scored the first goal of the game at 18:54 of the second period when he deflected Noah Hanifin’s shot from the left point.

            Coleman extended his goal streak to three games. He has six points in that span.

            Red Wings captain Dylan Larkin tied the game at 19:46 of the second when he scored on the power play, his team-leading 16th goal.

            It was the first goal scored by the Red Wings against the Flames since Feb. 23, 2020, as the last two meetings were Calgary shutouts. In that 2020 game, Larkin scored twice in a 4-2 loss.

            Larkin has seven goals and four assists in 13 career games against Calgary.

            “There are no excuses at this time of year,” Coleman said. “We’ve got 30 games left and we’ve got to get every point and win the game. We took too many penalties and then it came down to one breakdown in the third period.”

            Detroit goaltender Ville Husso had 35 saves and hasn’t lost in four career games against the Flames.

            “I guess it’s playoff hockey for us,” Husso said. “Almost 30 games left, whatever, so you still want to make it there. It’s on us. We just need to come in every night and play like that and give us a chance to win.”

            Vladar finished with 15 saves.

            “I was pleased with the first two periods, especially on the road, but we took too many penalties and they got the big goal in the third,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “We’ve seen that a lot this year.”

            NOTES: Red Wings D Robert Hägg played for the first time since Dec. 8 and assisted on the game-winning goal. … Flames D Rasmus Andersson missed his first game of the season after being hit by a vehicle while riding a scooter in Detroit on Wednesday evening.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805989,Chicago police review agency: Not clear if man shot at cops,"CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago's police oversight agency cast uncertainty Thursday on whether a man fatally shot by officers fired his weapon in what Supt. David Brown has termed an “apparent exchange of gunfire.” 

            The Civilian Office of Police Accountability “can confirm a weapon was recovered at the scene and body-worn camera video captures the initial interaction as well as the subsequent shooting,” First Deputy Chief Administrator Ephraim Eaddy said in a statement. “It is unclear, nor has it been determined by COPA, if the individual discharged his weapon at police.”

            Police said the man was armed and had been involved in an altercation early Wednesday outside a bar when fatally shot by officers in an alley. The man's name has not been released.











            Brown said officers were called to the scene about 3 a.m. on a report of a man with a gun when the man ran into the alley and apparently exchanged gunfire with officers.

            Brown said Wednesday that an initial investigation, including a review of body-worn camera footage, found ""the offender fired his weapon, and the officers fired their weapon.” 

            COPA said the two officers found the man walking and suspected he was involved in an earlier altercation. After getting out of their vehicle, the officers chased the man and ordered him to drop to the ground, COPA said. 

            As the officers followed him into an alley, the man fell and was ordered to stay down, COPA said. When the man started to get up, both officers fired multiple shots.

            A police spokesperson declined to comment on COPA’s statement, telling the Chicago Sun-Times the agency is still actively investigating the shooting.CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago's police oversight agency cast uncertainty Thursday on whether a man fatally shot by officers fired his weapon in what Supt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805991,"Hamilton scores 2 on power play, Devils win without Hughes","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — Not only didn't the New Jersey Devils have leading scorer Jack Hughes for the first time this season, coach Lindy Ruff also gave red-hot goaltender Vitek Vanecek the night off.

            Mackenzie Blackwood made 34 saves filling in for Vanecek and the Devils' power play picked up the slack with Hughes out as New Jersey rolled to hits 10th win in 12 games (10-1-1) on Thursday night.

            Dougie Hamilton scored two power-play goals, fellow defenseman John Marino added an empty-net tally and Ondrej Palat had two assists as the Devils posted a 3-1 victory over the Seattle Kraken.











            “The desperation in the game was great,"" Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. ""You look at some of the opportunities ahead and the way the guys laid out the body, if you’re going to win games you’ve got to have some desperation and I thought that desperation was great.”

            Blackwood was the outstanding in making only his fifth start since Dec. 23.

            “I liked where my game was at and I liked the way it was building,” Blackwood said after improving to 7-4-2 this season. ""I guess this is just a reward for sticking with it.”

            The difference overall was the power play. New Jersey was 2 of 4 with the extra man and Seattle was 0 for 3, including a two-man advantage for more than a minute early in the second period.

            “The ultimate difference at the end of the day is they were able to run their power play,” Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said, adding he was pleased with the number of chances his team had.

            The power-play goals were the first given up by Seattle in nine games. It had gone a franchise-record eight straight games, killing off 18 straight power plays.

            Defenseman Adam Larsson scored for Seattle and goaltender Philipp Grubauer made 24 saves in losing to New Jersey for the first time in six career decisions.

            Hamilton’s game winner came with 10 minutes to play. His shot from near the blue line was deflected by Brandon Tanev, and Grubauer never had a chance.

            Hughes, who leads the Devils with 35 goals and 32 assists, is being listed as week to week with an upper-body injury. He played Monday in a win over Vancouver.

            “He’s pretty much carrying us, so huge loss for us,” Hamilton said. ""I think you could tell with our team it was a little different, but we need guys to step up and we had that tonight. we know it’s going to be a hard stretch ahead and we’re going to have to keep playing well.”

            There were two goals in the first two periods, and they came 24 seconds apart.

            Larsson, a first-round pick of the Devils in 2011, opened the scoring for Seattle at 14:05 of the second period with a shot from the right point that hit the stick of New Jersey forward Miles Wood.

            “We’re not happy with the game in Long Island,"" Larsson said of a 3-0 loss to the Islanders on Tuesday. ""I thought today we responded good. We were good enough to win today. Sometimes you fall short.”

            Hamilton tied the game at 14:29 with a straight-on shot from just above the top of the circles for his 14th goal. It came seven seconds after Kraken defenseman Will Borgen was penalized.

            The Kraken also played without their top scorer. Andre Burakovsky is week to week with a lower-body injury sustained earlier this week.

            NOTES: Hamilton now has a career-high 51 points, one more than he had with Calgary in 2016-17. With Hughes sidelined, Erik Haula centered the second line for Yegor Sharangovich and Fabian Zetterlund, and Dawson Mercer moved from the wing to center the third line. ... The Devils also scratched D Brendon Smith with an injury. ... Seattle activated D Justin Schultz off the IL earlier in the day. F Daniel Sprong got a spot in the lineup with Burakovsky out. 

            UP NEXT:

            Kraken: Finish New York-area swing playing the Rangers on Friday night. It's part of a five-game trip.

            Devils: At Minnesota on Saturday to start four-game trip.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4805992,Take charge with G-Menu from AGON by AOC - One application to manage all AGON by AOC monitors and peripherals,"SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 10 February 2023 - AGON by AOC – one of the world's leading gaming monitor1 and IT accessories brands – presents the new  G-Menu software suite for the management of all AGON by AOC-branded peripherals – ranging from monitors to keyboards, mice, headsets and mouse pads.            AGON by AOC's gaming portfolio, renowned for its award-winning monitors, has been broadened over the last years with a variety of gaming mice, mechanical gaming keyboards, mouse pads as well as gaming headsets. The AOC gaming accessories have been praised for their durability, quality, affordability, high-level specifications as well as RGB synchronisation between devices for that little bit of extra flair.   This type of comprehensive gaming ecosystem with monitors and numerous accessories necessitated a software with which to control and customise all settings at once. For keyboards and mice, this means the customisation of the keys and buttons, adjusting the sensitivity such as repeat rate, polling rate or DPI level, for headset that means managing the audio settings including the surround sound. Light FX settings and the synchronisation of the lights for monitor, keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, and headset can also be managed thanks to G-Menu.   Now, the G-Menu software enables the same set-up options as the monitor's on-screen display settings with a single click. Monitors that come with AOC's Light FX can be customised with RGB illumination, and the newest update of G-Menu allows users to preview the RGB effects first in the software before deploying it onto the devices (monitor, keyboard etc). Furthermore, G-Menu allows colour and theme synchronisation (Light FX Sync) between products, both monitor and accessories such as gaming mice, mouse pads or keyboards will be having the same RGB lighting pattern and same colours.   Today, gamers look up to their heroes and want to walk in their footsteps. Peripherals thus are purchased based on the inspirations provided by their favourite streamer or esports athlete. New user profiles for different genres/games can be created, saved and even shared with G-Menu. Inside the ""Discover"" section of the G-Menu application, users can see the descriptions as well as compatible products for a user profile, which they can then choose to copy to their own devices. Matching the DPI settings of a gaming mouse or replicating the colour and responsiveness settings of a monitor from one of the idols of the gaming community... with G-Menu all it takes is a single click.   The new G-Menu allows a great range of customisation:   - For mice and keyboards, there is large degree of freedom to assign various functions to the buttons and keys. This enables users to assign tasks such as opening a multimedia player and play/pausing the track, or tasks related to internet browsers such as refreshing a page, opening the home page, searching and more. Also, basic OS functions such as cut/copy/paste or open/save documents can be assigned to keys or buttons as well. This kind of high customisation can really be useful, whether in games or in any day-to-day task.   - Macro management is equally crucial in certain games, where the action happens so fast that the user needs to hit multiple keys/buttons simultaneously. This is where the macros come into play. Even if the game/application doesn't support it, thanks to G-Menu users can create and manage macros – meaning that they are only enabled in a particular game, for example.   The new G-Menu software suite is available for download here:    https://sg.aoc.com/index/explore/route/softwares       1 IDC Quarterly Gaming Tracker - Gaming Monitor 2021 Q4        Hashtag: #AOC

But there’s a problem: Russian President Vladimir Putin has the same medal.

            French President Emmanuel Macron pinned the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor medal on Zelenskyy’s chest after the two met in the French presidential palace Thursday, a move Macron said was meant to show France’s “immense"" recognition for Ukraine's valor since Russia invaded it a year ago.

            Some French legislators and activists have called on Macron to rescind Putin’s award because of the war. 











            Macron didn’t rule out stripping Putin of the honor bestowed by then-President Jacques Chirac in 2006.

            Macron told reporters Friday that such a decision “has serious meaning, and it should be taken at the right moment.’’ He noted that he has rescinded the honor in the past.

            Macron stripped Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of his Legion of Honor award in the wake of widespread sexual misconduct allegations against him in 2017.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806019,"South Carolina, Indiana, Stanford, UConn projected as No. 1s","South Carolina, Indiana, Stanford and UConn would be the No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament if it began now.

            The NCAA women's basketball selection committee did its first reveal of the teams in line for the top 16 seeds, although none of Thursday night’s games were factored in, including No. 2 Indiana's win over No. 5 Iowa and Syracuse's victory over No. 14 North Carolina.

            “It was incredibly hard,"" NCAA selection committee chair Lisa Peterson said in a phone interview. “We joked that the only thing that was easy was putting South Carolina at No. 1. It’s a true testament to the competitive parity of women’s basketball right now.”











            Peterson has been on the committee for three years and said this season so far has been the most difficult in placing teams.

            “This was really challenging,” she said. “The committee talked longer than other top 16s I've been a part of.”

            The top 16 seeds will host first- and second-round games with the regional rounds being played at two neutral sites for the first time instead of the traditional four. Seattle will host half of the Sweet 16 and Greenville, South Carolina, will host the other eight teams.

            South Carolina and Indiana were projected as the top seeds in the Greenville Regional with Stanford and UConn in Seattle. The unbeaten Gamecocks were the overall No. 1 seed.

            Joining the Gamecocks in their bracket were No. 2 Duke, No. 3 Maryland and No. 4 Ohio State. The Hoosiers would have No. 2 Utah, No. 3 Notre Dame and No. 4 Villanova. 

            The other top teams in Stanford's region were No. 2 Iowa, No. 3 Texas and No. 4 North Carolina. UConn would be joined by LSU, Michigan and Virginia Tech.

            LSU was fifth in the overall rankings despite being the only other undefeated team alongside South Carolina. Peterson said the Tigers' nonconference strength of schedule was ranked 321st in the nation, which is what held them from being higher. LSU faces South Carolina on Sunday.

            Teams just outside the top 16 included Florida State, Iowa State, Colorado, Oklahoma and Tennessee.

            The Final Four will be played in Dallas on March 31 and the NCAA championship game is two days later. Dallas is also hosting the Division II and III championship games on April 1.

            The NCAA has been doing in-season reveals since 2015 to give teams an early idea of where they could be come selection night. The NCAA will have one more reveal on Feb. 23 before the real seedings are announced on March 12.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806026,"Pettersson scores 2, Canucks beat Isles to snap 2-game skid","NEW YORK (AP) — Elias Pettersson scored twice in the third period and the Vancouver Canucks snapped a two-game skid with a 6-5 victory over the New York Islanders on Thursday night.

            Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Brock Boesser, Nils Aman and Anthony Beauvillier also scored for the Canucks. Collin Delia made 24 saves in the third game of a four-game trip to begin the second half of the season. J.T. Miller and Quinn Hughes each had two assists.

            “We’ve been close the previous two games, glad we found a way to get the win today,” Pettersson said. “We are trying to build here, but we can’t let in that many goals every game. We are changing our systems to play more aggressive and maybe it will take a while, but we are working to perfect it and play better as a unit.”











            Bo Horvat, picked up in a trade with Vancouver at the end of January, Kyle Palmieri, Brock Nelson, Mathew Barzal and Noah Dobson scored for the Islanders. Ilya Sorokin finished with 28 saves as the Islanders' four-game winning streak came to an end.

            Pettersson fired a wrist shot under the glove of Sorokin at 8:28 to give the Canucks a 5-4 lead. He notched his first of the game on the power play, tying the score at 4 at 4:38 of the third. Pettersson's shot from the point glanced off Sorokin’s leg before crossing the goal line. 

            “We did a good job of staying with it,” Miller said. “Power play has been a little dry lately, not bad but hard time finding the net and to see a couple go in that meant a lot, that was big for the group.”

            Beauvillier extended the Canucks lead to 6-4 late in the third period when he redirected Boeser’s shot at 16:58.

            Dobson pulled the Islanders to within one goal at 19:11 of the third with a power-play goal.

            Barzal and Horvat each scored in the middle frame to give New York a 4-2 advantage. Barzal converted a one-timer from the left face-off circle at 2:26, shortly after Horvat’s apparent power-play goal was waived off due to goaltender interference. Barzal extended his point streak to four games.

            Horvat converted a one-timer at 15:13, when Barzal slipped a backhand pass into the slot. 

            Vancouver cut its two-goal deficit in half when Aman scored from near the top of the crease. 

            “The fourth line played well, they were grinding and they deserved that goal,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “ It picked our bench up.”

            Vancouver and New York combined for four goals during a 3:29 stretch in the first period.

            Palmieri notched his eighth of the season and opened the scoring with a wrist shot that rang off the post and in at 11:05 of the first. 

            The Canucks responded with two goals within 46 seconds. Sorokin struggled to pick up Ekman-Larsson’s fluttering shot from the point due to traffic in front as Vancouver evened the score.

            Boesser buried a feed from Miller to give Vancouver a short-lived one-goal edge.

            “I saw a lot, a lot of mistakes being made and a lot of individual turnovers,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “Twenty-three giveaways, you are not going to win a hockey game doing that. ""

            Nelson took advantage of Kyle Burroughs offensive zone turnover and sent a wrist shot over the glove of Delia, tying the score at 2. The Islanders alternate captain extended his point streak to nine games.

            PRIDE NIGHT

            The Islanders celebrated the LGBTQIA+ community with the team’s annual Pride Night at UBS Arena. Proceeds from fundraisers will to NY Gay Hockey Association and LGBT Network. 

            BEAUVILLIER RETURNS

            Anthony Beauvillier returned to UBS arena for the first time since being dealt to the Canucks as part of a package in exchange for Horvat on Jan 30. The Islanders selected Beauvillier in the first round of the 2015 NHL draft, and his most memorable moment came when he scored an overtime goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning to force a Game 7 in the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals. 

            “I came here as a teenager and left as a man,” Beauvllier said before the game. “I owe everything to the organization and the guys in the locker room.”

Ilya Sorokin finished with 28 saves as the Islanders' four-game winning streak came to an end.Pettersson fired a wrist shot under the glove of Sorokin at 8:28 to give the Canucks a 5-4 lead. He notched his first of the game on the power play, tying the score at 4 at 4:38 of the third. Pettersson's shot from the point glanced off Sorokin’s leg before crossing the goal line.“We did a good job of staying with it,” Miller said. “Power play has been a little dry lately, not bad but hard time finding the net and to see a couple go in that meant a lot, that was big for the group.”Beauvillier extended the Canucks lead to 6-4 late in the third period when he redirected Boeser’s shot at 16:58.Dobson pulled the Islanders to within one goal at 19:11 of the third with a power-play goal.Barzal and Horvat each scored in the middle frame to give New York a 4-2 advantage. Barzal converted a one-timer from the left face-off circle at 2:26, shortly after Horvat’s apparent power-play goal was waived off due to goaltender interference. Barzal extended his point streak to four games.Horvat converted a one-timer at 15:13, when Barzal slipped a backhand pass into the slot.Vancouver cut its two-goal deficit in half when Aman scored from near the top of the crease.“The fourth line played well, they were grinding and they deserved that goal,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “ It picked our bench up.”Vancouver and New York combined for four goals during a 3:29 stretch in the first period.Palmieri notched his eighth of the season and opened the scoring with a wrist shot that rang off the post and in at 11:05 of the first.The Canucks responded with two goals within 46 seconds. Sorokin struggled to pick up Ekman-Larsson’s fluttering shot from the point due to traffic in front as Vancouver evened the score.Boesser buried a feed from Miller to give Vancouver a short-lived one-goal edge.“I saw a lot, a lot of mistakes being made and a lot of individual turnovers,” Islanders coach Lane Lambert said. “Twenty-three giveaways, you are not going to win a hockey game doing that. ""Nelson took advantage of Kyle Burroughs offensive zone turnover and sent a wrist shot over the glove of Delia, tying the score at 2. The Islanders alternate captain extended his point streak to nine games.PRIDE NIGHTThe Islanders celebrated the LGBTQIA+ community with the team’s annual Pride Night at UBS Arena. Proceeds from fundraisers will to NY Gay Hockey Association and LGBT Network.BEAUVILLIER RETURNSAnthony Beauvillier returned to UBS arena for the first time since being dealt to the Canucks as part of a package in exchange for Horvat on Jan 30. The Islanders selected Beauvillier in the first round of the 2015 NHL draft, and his most memorable moment came when he scored an overtime goal against the Tampa Bay Lightning to force a Game 7 in the 2021 Eastern Conference Finals.“I came here as a teenager and left as a man,” Beauvllier said before the game. “I owe everything to the organization and the guys in the locker room.”UP NEXT:Islanders: At Montreal on Saturday.Canucks: At Detroit Red Wings on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806030,NFL Honors: Hamlin joins medical staff that saved his life,"PHOENIX (AP) — The first responders who saved Damar Hamlin's life were recognized with a tribute video at “NFL Honors” before being invited onto the stage.

            The man they saved was right behind them.

            Hamlin made his second appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week Thursday night, paying tribute to those who had a hand in giving him a second chance at life.











            “My entire life, I felt like God was using me to give others hope and now with a new set of circumstances, I can say he’s doing what he’s always done,” Hamlin said from the stage at Phoenix Convention Center. “I have a long journey ahead, a journey full of unknowns and a journey full of milestones, but it’s a lot easier to face your fears when you know your purpose.”

            The Buffalo Bills safety received the NFLPA’s Alan Page Community Award on Wednesday, a little more than a month after Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.

            He appeared again at “NFL Honors” on Thursday night after the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals training and medical staffs, along with the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center — collectively called “Team Damar” — were recognized. 

            Bills assistant athletic trainer Denny Kellington, who performed CPR on Hamlin on the field, also earned a bit of appreciation during “NFL Honors,” receiving a fifth-place vote for the NFL’s MVP award.

            Once onstage, Hamlin personally thanked an ICU doctor named Yusef, who, three nights into his hospital stay, told him he had been through something similar.

            “He showed me he was OK and that meant so much to me,” said Hamlin, who also thanked everyone on stage. “There was so much uncertainty at the time and just him coming to me, showing I could live a normal life again, it meant so much to me and my mom. I want to give a big thank you to him.” 

            Hamlin collapsed on the field after a collision with Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins on Jan. 2. The sight of an elite-level athlete nearly dying on the field sent a shock across the NFL and the world.

            In the days and weeks after Hamlin's collapse, his toy drive fundraiser received unexpected GoFundMe donations. “Chasing M’s” has since raised more than $9 million. 

            “Sudden cardiac arrest is something I never would have chosen to be a part of my story, but that’s because our own visions are too small even when we think we see the whole picture,” Hamlin said. “My vision was about playing in the NFL and being the best player I could be, but God’s plan was to have a purpose greater than any game in this world.”

            Hamlin spent nearly a week in a Cincinnati hospital before being flown to Buffalo, where he spent a couple of days in the hospital before being released on Jan. 11. He has made steady progress in what will be a long recovery, appearing at the Bills facility before attending their divisional game against Cincinnati.

            Hamlin received the Alan Page Award on Wednesday and a standing ovation from his peers at “NFL Honors.""

            “Every day I’m amazed that my experiences could encourage so many others across the country and even across the world — encourage to pray, encourage to spread love and encourage to keep fighting no matter the circumstances,” Hamlin said. 

            Hamlin has said he plans to support young people through education and sports with the GoFundMe donations. He also will use proceeds from the sale of new T-shirts, emblazoned with “Did We Win?” along with his hands in the shape of a heart, to raise money for the trauma center in Cincinnati that treated him. 

            “I told my teammates you might as well give the man of the year to Damar Hamlin, just for the way he’s galvanized our country, brought us together,"" said Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who was selected as the Walter Payton Man of the Year. “(He) made so many people understand the power of prayer, the power of community, the power of coming together and resiliency, not giving up and having faith.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806031,Miller scores 18 as No. 8 Maryland pounds Northwestern 79-54,"EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) — Diamond Miller understands what's in store for No. 8 Maryland with the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments approaching and how games like this can help prepare a team.

            The Terrapins overcame a difficult first quarter, then turned things around in a big way. By the time they were through, they had another lopsided victory.

            Miller scored 18 points and Maryland beat struggling Northwestern 79-54 on Thursday night.











            “When we go into the (conference) tournament, we have no breaks and we’re gonna play three games in three days,” Miller said. “That’s what we potentially want to do, so we can’t have a game where were we don’t play good — or a quarter where we don’t play good, because we can lose and then go home and then we’re gonna be crying.”

            The Terrapins (20-5, 12-3 Big Ten) certainly weren't shedding any tears after this one. They shook off a rough start by holding Northwestern (8-16, 1-12) without a field goal in the second quarter and rolled the rest of the way. 

            Brir McDaniel scored 14 points as the Terrapins followed up the program’s most lopsided win over a top 10 opponent with another dominant performance. They also reached the 20-win mark for the 19th year in a row.

            “It's something that I'm really proud of, that consistency factor and so many great players that have come before us as well as currently,” said coach Brenda Frese, in her 21st season at Maryland. “It's that legacy for us that's really important. Also, so many great coaching staffs.”

            Coming off a 90-54 romp over then-No. 10 Ohio State on Sunday, Maryland outscored Northwestern 18-2 in the second quarter. The Terps took a 12-point lead to the locker room and never looked back.

            Miller, the Big Ten’s third-leading scorer, had nine rebounds and seven assists. The 6-foot-3 guard went to the locker room holding her hand over her eye early in the third quarter, but returned a few minutes later.

            McDaniel, a Chicago product, put on a show for her family. The freshman shot 4 of 6 from 3-point range.

            Abby Meyers scored 12 as Maryland won for the seventh time in eight games.

            Paige Mott led Northwestern with 15 points. But the Wildcats lost for the 11th time in 13 games.

            Northwestern missed 15 consecutive field goals at one point and shot just 35% overall. The Wildcats were 2 of 18 on 3-pointers.

            LOCKING DOWN

            Northwestern led 20-16 through the first quarter after Jillian Brown nailed a pull-up jumper at the buzzer. But things turned around in a big way after that.

            The Wildcats missed all 13 field goal attempts in the second. Their only points in the period came when Courtney Shaw rattled in two free throws with 27 seconds remaining in the half to cut it to 34-22.

            By then, Maryland had scored 18 straight.

            Miller had nine of her 12 first-half points in that stretch, including a free throw and driving layup early in the quarter and two more foul shots in the final minute. McDaniel made a late 3 and the aggressive Terps were 7 of 12 overall from the field in the period. 

            “It's kind of hard being away from my family because we're so family oriented,"" McDaniel said. ""This being home and being able to see every last family member that I had here, just being able to play for them was amazing.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Maryland: The Terps turned up their defense and were more aggressive at the basket after a sluggish start. That propelled them to their second straight lopsided win after losing to then-No. 6 Iowa one week earlier.

            Northwestern: The Wildcats have lost five straight against top 10 teams — including four this season — since beating then-No. 4 Michigan in double overtime a year ago. They are also 0-8 against ranked opponents this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806034,Young scores 36 as Hawks beat short-handed Suns 116-107,"ATLANTA (AP) — Seeing his short-handed team struggle in a loss to Atlanta only made Phoenix coach Monty Williams all the more eager to see Kevin Durant in a Suns uniform.

            Trae Young scored 25 of his 36 points in the second half and the Hawks beat the Suns, still awaiting the arrival of the newly acquired Durant, 116-107 on Thursday night.

            “It's more than a lift,” Williams said of the impact he expects from Durant. “I think it's more of a jolt, not just because of who is is, but his love of the game.”











            The Suns had only nine players available after trading Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges as part of a package for Durant, the 13-time All-Star, before Thursday’s trade deadline.

            “Today was a tough day in so many respects, emotionally and the human side of it,” Williams said before adding, “but going forward, it's Kevin.”

            After leading 56-47 at halftime, the Hawks extended their lead to 20 points in the third quarter.

            Josh Okogie had 25 points and Deandre Ayton added 23 points and for Phoenix, which had its three-game winning streak end.

            Durant did not join his new team for the game, but the anticipation for his arrival is growing.

            “You can put him on any team and he’s going to fit,” Suns guard Landry Shamet said of Durant before the game. “He knows how to play. He’s played in a number of different systems. He’s insertable in any of them. You can throw it to him and he’s going to go score every time. He’s going to make the right play.”

            The Hawks also made roster adjustments after two trades and also used only nine players. 

            Atlanta traded Justin Holiday, Frank Kaminsky and two second-round picks to Houston for shooting guard Garrison Matthews and center Bruno Fernando. The 6-foot-9 Fernando began his career in Atlanta in the 2019-20 season.

            Also, the Hawks acquired former Detroit small forward Saddiq Bey as part of a three-team trade and sent five second-round draft picks to Golden State. The Hawks announced the deal as official following league approval after the game.

            Atlanta led most of the game despite 19 turnovers, including nine by Young.

            “We're going to need to be sharper than that,” Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. “We've got to be sharper with execution on both ends of the floor.”

            Atlanta led 93-75 after three quarters before Phoenix scored the first nine points of the final period. Young sank a jumper to end the Suns' run, and his 3-pointer from the front of the halfcourt logo gave Atlanta a 104-91 lead.

            Dejounte Murray had 19 points and John Collins had 16 for Atlanta. 

            HOMECOMING

            The Hawks, coming off a 2-3 road trip, played only their sixth home game of 2023. They play 17 of their final 27 regular-season games at home as they look to move up from eighth in the Eastern Conference.

            “It’s good to be back home, but we have to take advantage of this home stretch that we have,” McMillan said.

            DOMINATING THE BOARDS

            Clint Capela had 17 of the Hawks’ season-high 59 rebounds. Onyeka Okongwu had 11 rebounds. No Phoenix player had more than five rebounds.

            “I think crashing the boards was big for us,” said Young, who had seven rebounds.

            TIP-INS

            Suns: F Devin Booker (groin), F Cameron Payne (right foot sprain) and Shamet (right foot soreness) were unavailable.

            Hawks: With 12 assists, Young recorded his 27th double-double of the season. He posted his 61st consecutive game with at least 10 points and five assists, leaving him five games away from matching Oscar Robertson (66) for the fourth-longest streak in NBA history.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsATLANTA (AP) — Seeing his short-handed team struggle in a loss to Atlanta only made Phoenix coach Monty Williams all the more eager to see Kevin Durant in a Suns uniform.Trae Young scored 25 of his 36 points in the second half and the Hawks beat the Suns, still awaiting the arrival of the newly acquired Durant, 116-107 on Thursday night.“It's more than a lift,” Williams said of the impact he expects from Durant. “I think it's more of a jolt, not just because of who is is, but his love of the game.”The Suns had only nine players available after trading Cam Johnson and Mikal Bridges as part of a package for Durant, the 13-time All-Star, before Thursday’s trade deadline.“Today was a tough day in so many respects, emotionally and the human side of it,” Williams said before adding, “but going forward, it's Kevin.”After leading 56-47 at halftime, the Hawks extended their lead to 20 points in the third quarter.Josh Okogie had 25 points and Deandre Ayton added 23 points and for Phoenix, which had its three-game winning streak end.Durant did not join his new team for the game, but the anticipation for his arrival is growing.“You can put him on any team and he’s going to fit,” Suns guard Landry Shamet said of Durant before the game. “He knows how to play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806036,"Reinhart, Staal score 2 each, Panthers beat Sharks","SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Sam Reinhart and Eric Staal each scored a pair of goals and the Florida Panthers beat the San Jose Sharks 4-1 Thursday night for their season-high third straight win.

            Sergei Bobrovsky made 33 saves in the win, which was No. 350 in his NHL career. Bobrovsky is the 25th goalie in NHL history to hit the mark.

            “I have been fortunate to have played with some great teammates and great coaches,’’ Bobrovsky said.











            “It is definitely a big achievement, but you focus one moment at a time right now. This was a good game, they came out fast and we defended well. The penalty kill in the end, they did a great job in front of me, clearing pucks out and then scoring two big goals,"" he said.

            Alexander Bararanov scored for the Sharks. Kaapo Kahkonen made 38 saves in the loss.

            Florida played minus captain Aleksander Barkov, who was out because of a hand injury. But Reinhart, who plays on the right side of the Panthers’ top line, helped make up for Barkov’s absence.

            “I think the important thing is we know we need to go on a bit of a run here,’’ Reinhart said. “We have to take advantage of home ice, especially with all the opportunities we have in front of us. Nights when you’re not feeling your best, you have to find ways to win. Tonight, we did a good job of that.”

            The Panthers tied it at 1 when Reinhart scored early in the second period on a wrist shot from the right circle.

            In the final minute of the second, Eetu Luostarinen — who replaced Barkov as the first-line center — drove toward the net and stumbled to the ice as he released a pass to Reinhart in the slot.

            Reinhart deflected the soft shot and put it between Kahkonen’s skates for the go-ahead goal with 40.2 seconds remaining.

            Kahkonen was pulled for an extra skater with 2:15 remaining to give the Sharks a 6-on-4.

            Only Luostarinen picked off a puck at center ice and fed Staal for the empty-net goal with 1:39 remaining.

            Staal got his second empty-net goal just 24 seconds later. 

            He became the fourth player in franchise history to score two shorthanded goals in the same game and the first since Olli Jokinen in 2002.

            “I thought early on, we had some chances and then just got a little sloppy,’’ San Jose coach David Quinn said regarding the failed four-minute power play. “It is disappointing because we had some chances to tie it early.”

            NOTES: Barkov missed his 11th game of the season due to various injuries and illness. The Panthers expect him to return to the lineup on Saturday. … San Jose center Logan Couture briefly left in the second period after being run into the backboards by Florida defenseman Brandon Montour. Couture returned after missing about five minutes of game time. … Montour saw his 10-game scoring streak come to a close. He scored three goals with 10 points during his streak.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806037,"Dinwiddie has 25 in Brooklyn return, Nets beat Bulls 116-105","NEW YORK (AP) — Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points in his first game since returning to Brooklyn and the Nets beat the Chicago Bulls 116-105 on Thursday night, hours after trading superstar Kevin Durant to Phoenix.

            Joe Harris had 18 points, and Yuta Watanabe chipped in 14 points in 22 minutes off the bench. Dorian Finney-Smith, who came with Dinwiddie from Dallas in the trade for Kyrie Irving, had nine points and nine rebounds in his Nets debut.

            “We just found a way,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. “No panic from our guys. I thought we did a really good job of focusing on the game plan. It’s great to see us really lock in, especially at the end of the game.”











            It was Dinwiddie’s first game in a Nets uniform since Dec. 27, 2020. He spent five seasons with the team and returned with 18 points in the second half. 

            “The entire last four or five days have been weird for me,” Dinwiddie said. “If I was going to revisit a spot, out of the three I’ve been at, it would definitely be here, unequivocally.”

            Zach LaVine scored 38 points and DeMar DeRozan had 14 for Chicago, which lost its second straight and fell to 10-18 on the road. 

            “Every single day that goes by we have less opportunity to take on this challenge,’’ DeRozan said. “The room for error is getting slimmer and slimmer. It’s on us to realize it.’’

            The Durant trade was agreed to in the early hours of the morning Thursday then announced shortly before tipoff. Brooklyn traded Durant and forward T.J. Warren for Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, Jae Crowder — who was subsequently flipped to Milwaukee for two second-round selections — and four first-rounders (2023, 2025, 2027, 2029) plus a pick swap in 2028.

            Durant, a 13-time All-Star who was slated to represent the Nets at the upcoming All-Star Game in Utah, averaged 29 points per game over 129 games for Brooklyn, but missed time in each of his four seasons with the Nets. His trade followed that of Irving on Sunday.

            “I’m not going to sugarcoat it, it’s always difficult when you’re trading a player of that stature and that ilk,” Nets general manager Sean Marks said. “My job as GM and our job as a front office is to try and bring in that caliber of talent. So those decisions are not easy, they come with a lot of thought, a lot of process on systemic debriefs and discussions that go along with that.”

            Playing short-handed and in danger of losing more ground in the Eastern Conference playoff race, the Nets snapped a two-game skid with a 20-6 fourth-quarter run, keyed by Dinwiddie and Watanabe. Dinwiddie scored 13 in the fourth and Watanabe hit a pair of 3s. 

            Brooklyn, which is 29th in the NBA in rebounds per game, also outrebounded Chicago 49-46, winning the rebounding battle for the first time in 16 games.

            “We only gave up 21 points in the fourth, and that was with ((Watanabe) on the floor finishing for us,” Vaughn said. “I think we saw the versatility and size come into play tonight where we didn’t get destroyed rebounding-wise and shot-discrepancy.”

            Brooklyn looked sluggish from the outset, shooting just 28.6% from the field in the first quarter, and Chicago capitalized. LaVine scored 12 in the first quarter, and the Bulls used a 16-2 run to build a 13-point advantage early in the second.

            But the Nets heated up from the outside, making 8 of 12 3-pointers, led by Harris’ six in the second. Brooklyn led by as many as seven and took a 53-50 advantage into halftime.

            “I think everybody kind of was trying to figure out each other and how we were going to be playing,” Harris said. “Once that started and the rhythm got there and everybody was able to kind of settle in, we started playing really well and played really well together.”

            Brooklyn built an 11-point advantage early in the third. But Chicago scored 30 of the quarter’s final 44 points, keyed by LaVine’s 14 in the frame.

            TIP-INS

            Bulls: The Bulls were one of just two teams that did not make a trade before Thursday’s 3 p.m. EST deadline. “It’s us vs. everybody,” LaVine said after the game. … DeRozan (right-hip soreness) returned after missing Chicago’s game in Memphis on Tuesday. 

            Nets: Bridges and Johnson were on the Brooklyn bench but didn’t dress due to the trade’s late announcement. It was Bridges’ first missed game since high school. … Cam Thomas, who scored 134 points over Brooklyn’s previous three games, had his streak of three straight 40-point games snapped. He finished with 20 points. … Center Nic Claxton missed the game, his fourth of the season, with a hamstring injury.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806039,Bowtie Offers Health Check-ups Discount to Encourage Preventive Care,"When it comes to health, prevention is better than cure

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 10 February 2023 - Living a modern busy lifestyle, the majority of Hong Kongers lack healthy dietary and exercise habits that may pose severe health risks. Not to mention most chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases rarely show symptoms at the early stages, which can be a crucial factor in patient delay. As prevention is better than cure, Bowtie’s selected VHIS customers can enjoy annual health check-ups which covers blood pressure, liver and kidney function tests, uric acid tests, blood tests and more.   70% is Lack of Routine Health Screening Habits      According to the  2020-22 Population Health Survey Report recently published by The Department of Health, among persons aged 15 or above, only 30% have received regular body check-ups, more females (31.1%) than males (28.8%) reported having done so.   Across all age groups, persons aged 85 or above had the most frequent regular health screenings, still, only 44.4% in that age group had routine medical checkup.   Body Check Helps Identify Illness at Early Stage      Although most Hong Kongers do not attend health assessments on a regular basis, it plays an important role in maintaining good health. Most chronic diseases such as cancers, heart diseases and diabetes can be diagnosed via health assessments, which is not only conducive to avoid worsening of health problems, but also helpful to enhance recovery.   Nonetheless, given that there has been an increased chronic disease prevalence among the younger generation, young people should ever overlook the importance of regular medical check-ups. Take diabetes as an example, the average age at diagnosis of diabetes has been pushed up from 50 to 30, whereas that of complications has been moved from 60 to 40. Since people can suffer from prediabetes for years without any symptoms, regular health screening can help to identify the illness at an early stage, allowing patients to have the best chance for successful treatment as early as possible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806055,Global Power Converter/Inverter Market is estimated to Experience Rapid Expansion Opportunities by 2030,"Global Power Converter/Inverter Market Analytical Outlook, Projection, And Forecast To 2030Global Power Converter/Inverter Market research report provides a comprehensive overview of key growth drivers, market size estimates, and forecasts. This report examines current market conditions, trends, market concentration rates market analysis by type and application, as well as forecasted market growth up to 2030. This report examines sales revenue, and secondary sources and provides a detailed analysis of the company’s market share within the respective markets. To calculate the market size, it is necessary to consider major market players.An electronic device known as a power converter, or inverter, converts DC (direct current), electricity into AC (alternating current). This is crucial because most electrical devices and appliances use AC power. However, most power sources such as solar panels and batteries produce DC power. There are two types of inverters or power converters: modified sine wave and pure sine wave. Pure sine wave inverters cost more, but they produce a smoother and cleaner AC power output. This makes them suitable for sensitive electronic devices like laptops, TVs, and medical equipment. Modified sine wave converters, on the contrary, are cheaper but produce a more refined AC power output. This makes them suitable for smaller devices like fans and power tools.Click Here to Download a Sample of the Power Converter/Inverter Market: https://market.biz/checkout/?reportId=439887&type=Single%20User#requestforsamplePower converters and inverters are in high demand due to the conversion of DC power from renewable energy sources into AC power. Power converters and inverters are also being demanded by the increasing electrification across many industries and applications such as the automotive sector and the transportation sector. The market is also growing due to continuous advancements in inverter and power converter technology.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806071,Suspect in custody after 2 Maryland police officers hurt,"FALLSTON, Md. (AP) — A man suspected of injuring two Maryland police officers with gunfire has been taken into custody early Friday after fleeing from the vehicle he had stolen from a detective he shot, authorities said.

            Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies surrounded the suspect in a wooded area near a shopping mall in Fallston after police used spike strips to disable the stolen vehicle, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said, and he was taken into custody about 5:45 a.m.

            “Our community is safer with this individual in custody where he belongs.” Gahler said at a Friday morning news conference.











            The suspect, earlier identified as David Linthicum, 24, wasn't injured during the arrest and charges were pending, Gahler said. He was expected to be transferred to the custody of Baltimore County Police.

            Authorities believe the suspect had fled with a rifle, so they were searching the area for a weapon, Gahler said. When the arrest was made, Gahler said the suspect had ammunition with him.

            Gahler earlier said that police found a rifle and a handgun in the recovered vehicle after the suspect fled, but later said only a rifle was left in that vehicle.

            An officer was shot Thursday night during the search for Linthicum, who authorities said wounded a different officer while firing at police the previous afternoon.

            Interim Baltimore County Police Chief Dennis Delp said early Friday that the detective who was shot Thursday night was in stable condition. Delp would not say how many times the officer was shot but noted he was wearing a ballistic vest.

            Linthicum stole the detective’s vehicle after the shooting around 9:20 p.m., Delp said.

            The first officer was injured while police were responding to a call for a person in crisis. Baltimore County officers were called Wednesday afternoon to a home on in Cockeysville, where a family member escorted them to the person in crisis, police said in a statement. 

            While the officers interacted with Linthicum, he fired multiple shots, striking one officer, police spokesperson Joy Stewart said. Officers did not fire their weapons during that interaction, she said.

            The injured officer was taken to a hospital and officials announced late Wednesday that he was released and in good spirits. 

            Officials had urged residents to shelter in place and several schools in the area were closed Thursday. The search continued into Thursday evening as police ordered residents near the home in Cockeysville to shelter in place because Linthicum was spotted in the area.

            Zach LaVine scored 38 points and DeMar DeRozan had 14 for Chicago, which lost its second straight and fell to 10-18 on the road.

            Khris Middleton scored 22 points and Jrue Holiday added 18 for the Bucks, who matched their longest winning streak since their 9-0 start to this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806077,"Thomas, Revis headline new Pro Football Hall of Fame class","PHOENIX (AP) — Joe Thomas gave fans of the new version of the Cleveland Browns something they could finally celebrate.

            The six-time All-Pro offensive lineman will join lockdown cornerback Darrelle Revis as inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on their first try, becoming the first Browns Hall of Famer from the team’s inglorious expansion era.

            “It’s really special for me because the franchise has endured some really tough times,” Thomas said. “But those fans are so loyal and passionate, and they still show up and it still is their identity that they’re Browns fans. It’s great for all of Browns Nation.”











            Since returning to the NFL in 1999, the Browns have had two playoff berths, one playoff win and the worst record in the league — including an 0-16 season in Thomas' last year in the NFL. 

            Thomas and Revis join a new class of Hall of Famers announced Thursday that also includes return finalists DeMarcus Ware, Zach Thomas and Ronde Barber. Senior candidates Joe Klecko, Chuck Howley and Ken Riley, along with coaching candidate Don Coryell also got voted into the Hall and will be inducted in Canton, Ohio, this summer.

            “I didn’t set out to be a Hall of Famer,” Barber said. “I was trying to make the team. I was trying to get on the field. All you can do is take your opportunity and run with it. And we all took our opportunities and ran with it.”

            The headliners of the class are Joe Thomas and Revis — the two first-round picks from the 2007 draft who took far different journeys to this ultimate honor.

            Revis bounced around teams seeking his best opportunities to win and thrive financially, while Thomas never moved. 

            Picked third in the draft by Cleveland, Thomas stepped in as an immediate starter and never moved until a torn triceps ended his final season in 2017.

            Thomas played 10,363 consecutive snaps before that injury as one of the only dependable parts on one of the NFL’s sorriest franchises. 

            Thomas was a Pro Bowler in all 10 healthy seasons, a first-team All-Pro six times and a second-team selection two other years. But he never even made it to the playoffs a single time with the Browns.

            Revis was always moving, whether it was following top receivers from one side of the field to the other as the game’s top lockdown cornerback of his era. 

            Revis’ best stretch came in New York with the Jets, where he was a first-team All-Pro from 2009-11 and finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting in 2009 when he repeatedly shut down top receivers by sending them to “Revis Island.”

            “I was probably the most nervous of anybody on the field,” Revis said. “You look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself: ‘It’s either me or him.' I had to stand up to the challenge. I took that responsibility to take on that assignment and shut them down.”

            Revis spent one year in New England, helping the Patriots win the Super Bowl in the 2014 season, and also played for Tampa Bay and Kansas City, along with a second stint with the Jets. 

            Ware, Barber and Zach Thomas all had longer waits before getting voted into the Hall. Ware was also a finalist last year, while Barber got in on his third time at this stage and Thomas on his fourth try.

            Ware was a four-time All-Pro in Dallas and then helped Denver win a Super Bowl in the 2015 season. He led the NFL in sacks twice and finished with 138 1/2 sacks in his career.

            Barber was a key cog to the Tampa-2 defensive scheme as a cornerback for the Buccaneers. He was a three-time All-Pro, led the NFL with 10 interceptions in 2001 and won a Super Bowl the next season. 

            Zach Thomas was a five-time All-Pro who spent 12 of his 13 seasons with Miami before finishing with one year in Dallas. He won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1996, had at least 100 tackles in his first 11 seasons.

            Coryell didn’t have the team success comparable to other coaches to get voted into the Hall, winning 111 regular-season games for the Cardinals and Chargers and never reaching a Super Bowl.

            But his impact on the game with his famous “Air Coryell” offense in San Diego was transcendent as he took advantage of rule changes that opened up the passing game in the late 1970s and put together an offense that still influences the game today.

            Howley was a five-time All-Pro in 15 seasons with Chicago and Dallas with his biggest claim being the only player from a losing team ever picked as Super Bowl MVP. Howley won MVP after intercepting two passes in Super Bowl V when Dallas lost to Baltimore 16-13. He ended up on the winning side the following season when he two takeaways in a 24-3 win over Miami. 

            Klecko was a mainstay on the Jets famed “New York Sack Exchange,” earning Pro Bowl honors at nose tackle, defensive tackle and defensive end in a 12-year career that ended with one season on the Indianapolis Colts.

            Klecko was an All-Pro twice, including in 1981 when he unofficially led the NFL with 20 1/2 sacks and finished second to Lawrence Taylor in the Defensive Player of the Year voting.

            Riley’s 65 career interceptions in 15 seasons with Cincinnati rank fifth highest in NFL history and second to Dick “Night Train” Lane’s 68 for players who were exclusively cornerbacks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806080,HarperCollins and striking union reach tentative agreement,"New YORK (AP) — HarperCollins Publishers and the union representing around 250 striking employees reached a tentative agreement providing increases to entry level salaries. If union members ratify the contract, it will run through the end of 2025 and end a walkout that began nearly three months ago.

            HarperCollins and Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers released separate, identical statements Thursday night, announcing ""increases to minimum salaries across levels throughout the term of the agreement, as well as a one time $1,500 lump sum bonus to be paid to bargaining unit employees following ratification.""

            No other details were immediately available. 











            Mid- and entry-level staffers in departments ranging from marketing to book design asked for a starting salary boost from $45,000 to $50,000, along with greater union protection and increased efforts to enhance diversity. Employees have worked without a contract since last spring and went on strike Nov. 10. 

            The industry and others closely followed the walkout, which drew attention to growing unhappiness over wages that have traditionally been low in book publishing and have made it hard for younger staffers without outside help to afford living in New York City, the nation's publishing hub. 

            Earlier this week, Macmillan announced it was raising starting salaries from $42,000 to $47,000. The other three major New York publishing houses — Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group USA and Simon & Schuster — offer starting salaries between $45,000 and $50,000.

            A months-long impasse without negotiations led to criticism of HarperCollins by agents, authors and others in the book community who alleged the publisher was not trying reach a deal. 

            HarperCollins, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, agreed on Jan. 26 to talks with a federal mediator. Soon after, HarperCollins announced plans to lay off 5% of North American employees, citing declining revenues and growing costs.New YORK (AP) — HarperCollins Publishers and the union representing around 250 striking employees reached a tentative agreement providing increases to entry level salaries.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806081,Eichel leads Vegas in 4-goal 2nd period to beat Wild 5-1,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Jack Eichel had a goal and an assist for Vegas to hasten a mid-game meltdown by Minnesota, and the Golden Knights cruised past the sputtering Wild 5-1 on Thursday night.

            Nicolas Roy, Alex Pietrangelo, Paul Cotter and Reilly Smith also scored against former Golden Knights goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who had little help in front of him and lost his cool after giving up Eichel's goal that was the fourth of the second period for the visitors.

            Kirill Kaprizov scored on a power play for the Wild against Vegas goalie Logan Thompson, who made 23 saves before a non-contact injury early in the third period left him unable to put any weight on his left leg as teammates helped him off the ice.











            Everything else up to that point was going well for the Golden Knights, who came out of a nine-day break to beat Nashville 5-1 on Tuesday with their dads proudly joining them on the road trip.

            “They bring a lot of energy. Obviously we want to play good for them,” Smith said. “They’ve supported us through our entire hockey career.”

            Jonathan Marchessault, who had two assists, flipped a pass to Eichel as he sped past Minnesota's Marcus Foligno up the right wing. Eichel, who ended a nine-game goalless streak, snapped a shot over Fleury's right shoulder for a 5-1 lead with 6:37 left before the second intermission.

            Fleury immediately turned and hammered his stick against the post before flinging it in further frustration past mid-ice. That was the third goal Fleury gave up in a span of 2:26, after Kaprizov had ignited the crowd with his team-leading 29th goal. 

            Filip Gustavsson, who was in the net for the 4-1 loss at Dallas the night before, replaced Fleury for the third period. Fleury, who has a higher goals against average and a lower save percentage than Gustavsson, stopped 18 shots before he was pulled. 

            “There’s no blame for Marc-Andre Fleury, and his teammates said that in between the second and third period,"" coach Dean Evason said. ""Everybody knows what happened.”

            One of the goals Fleury gave up was a penalty shot after Alex Goligoski was called for slashing Smith, who sent the puck between Fleury's pads after it glanced off the goalie's stick. 

            “When you’re struggling to score, you can’t be giving them free goals,” Goligoski said.

            The Wild, playing their first home game in 12 days, started a vital seven-game homestand against a bunch of winning teams. With three straight ugly losses out of their eight-day break, they're in precarious position for the playoffs — tied with Calgary for the second wild-card spot.

            Undisciplined play has been a major problem, and the absence of defenseman Jonas Brodin (lower-body injury) for a second straight game didn't help. The Wild, who lost 3-2 at Arizona on Monday and 4-1 at Central Division leader Dallas on Wednesday, were booed as the final seconds ticked off the clock.

            The Golden Knights have gone the opposite direction since their break, despite recently losing key forward Mark Stone to a back injury.

            “This is the time good teams, I think, they don’t let points slip away,” coach Bruce Cassidy said.

            FINGERS CROSSED

            Thompson, who was replaced in net by Adin Hill, was “moving around” in the dressing room afterward, Cassidy said, and will have an MRI exam on Friday morning.

            “We’ll have a much better idea, and hopefully we get good news,” Cassidy said.

            YOU GUYS WERE GOOD TRAVELERS

            The Golden Knights are 7-0-1 on their annual dads' trip since the bonding excursion was first initiated by the 2017 expansion club. The Pacific Division-leading Golden Knights were 0-2-2 in their last four games before their break.

            “It seems like they had a lot of fun, and when they come and help us win two games, especially the way we did it, I don’t see a mothers' trip coming in anytime soon,” Smith said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806115,"Bolton, Timme lead No. 16 Gonzaga past San Francisco 99-81","SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Rasir Bolton scored 23 points and had six assists, and Drew Timme added 21 points to lead No. 16 Gonzaga past San Francisco 99-81 on Thursday night.

            Gonzaga (20-5, 9-2 West Coast) extended its streak of seasons with at least 20 wins to 26, bouncing back from last weekend’s overtime loss at No. 15 Saint Mary’s. The streak is the second longest in the country behind Kansas at 32.

            Khalil Shabazz led San Francisco with 25 points and Tyrell Roberts added 16. The Dons (15-12, 4-8) never led and dropped their third straight game and have lost 26 straight to Gonzaga. Their last win over Gonzaga came in February 2012.











            Gonzaga pulled out a two-point road win against the Dons earlier this season, thanks to Bolton’s tip-in basket in the closing seconds. The Zags didn’t need the same crunch-time heroics against San Francisco this time.

            “I knew I had a big game down there last time,"" Bolton said, ""so I came out a little more aggressive and it worked out for me.”

            Gonzaga sprinted to a 10-point lead as four fouls in the first 54 seconds derailed the Dons. Gonzaga converted 15 San Francisco turnovers into 25 points and shot 79% from the free throw line on 29 attempts to build and sustain its lead.

            “This team does a good job of just taking what they give us,"" Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. ""I think the best thing we did tonight, especially in the first half, was take care of the ball — especially in lieu of where we were at earlier in the year.”

            Timme continued his rise up the all-time statistical leaderboards, becoming the conference’s 10th-leading career scorer. He also took sole possession of first place on Gonzaga’s career made field goals list. Timme also grabbed his 800th career rebound, the sixth Gonzaga player to accomplish the feat.

            “I thought we kind of got stunned with how the game started and didn’t come out with enough urgency, intensity or intent on the defensive side of the ball,"" San Francisco coach Chris Gerlufsen said. “Unfortunately, you do stuff like that here, it’s a hard place to respond and rebound from.”

            JERSEY RETIRED

            Dan Dickau became the fifth Gonzaga player to have his number retired as his No. 21 was unveiled in front of a sellout crowd. Dickau played two seasons at Gonzaga from 2000-02 and was the program’s first first-team All-America selection and led the Bulldogs to a record 29-win season and No. 6 national ranking in 2002.

            “At the end of the day, it comes down to certain people that I have to acknowledge for having a huge part of the little bit of success that I have had being a part of this program,"" Dickau said. “It’s teammates, it's coaches and it's special people around the program.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Gonzaga: The Zags are two games behind Saint Mary’s in the WCC standings with five conference games remaining, including one at home against the Gaels. Saint Mary’s was the last WCC school not named Gonzaga to win an outright regular-season conference championship in 2012. 

            San Francisco: After a three-game win streak, the Dons have lost three straight and are tied for second to last in the WCC with four regular-season games remaining. San Francisco has lost 25 straight to Gonzaga and hasn’t won in Spokane since 1989.

            Vasilevskiy made a nifty glove save on Matt Nieto’s early second-period breakaway shot en route to his 29th career shutout and first since blanking Seattle on Nov. 26, 2021.











            Corey Perry, Brayden Point and Mikhail Sergachev also scored for the Lightning, who had lost two in row. Nikita Kucherov got his 56th assist on Point’s goal to break his own record (2018-19) with a point in his 17th consecutive home game. Alex Killorn had three assists.

            Kirill Kaprizov scored a power-play goal for the Wild against Logan Thompson, who made 23 saves before a non-contact injury early in the third period left him unable to put any weight on his left leg as teammates helped him off the ice.

            DETROIT (AP) — Filip Zadina made a successful return to Detroit's lineup, scoring the go-ahead goal at 5:51 of the third period to lift the Red Wings over Calgary.

            Calgary's Blake Coleman scored the first goal of the game at 18:54 of the second period. 

            Red Wings captain Dylan Larkin tied it at 19:46 of the second when he scored on the power play. It was the first goal scored by the Red Wings against the Flames since Feb. 23, 2020, as the last two meetings were Calgary shutouts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806146,Biden faces doubt from some voters who backed Dems in 2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hillary Scholten is among the Democrats who had a surprisingly good election night in November.

            She became the first Democrat in nearly a half century to win her western Michigan congressional district, bucking expectations about her party's prospects and helping limit the Republican majority in the U.S. House to just four seats. As President Joe Biden prepares for a coming reelection bid, victories like this have bolstered him and his supporters who believe voters rewarded his steady leadership during a period of economic and political turmoil.

            But Scholten, who declined in an interview to outright endorse Biden for reelection, suggested that while the president has accomplished a tremendous amount, he wasn't the reason for her victory. She won, she insisted, by appealing to voters as someone “focused on putting the people of their district first over national politics.”











            That approach tapped into an apparent openness among voters to support Democratic candidates in the midterms even if they weren't necessarily fond of Biden, a discernment that is notable at a time when politics has become increasingly nationalized. Roughly 1 in 6 voters for Democratic House candidates said they disapproved of Biden’s job performance, according to AP VoteCast, an extensive nationwide survey of the electorate. Two-thirds of these voters said Biden was not a factor, good or bad, in their midterm decisions. 

            The findings are a warning sign for both parties at the outset of the 2024 presidential campaign. For Republicans, a constant stream of attacks on Biden may have little effect on voters who will accept him over GOP contenders seen as too extreme. But for Biden, the findings also suggest that the surprisingly strong Democratic performance last year might not translate into energy around his reelection.

            “We certainly have a problem as a party if individuals have such low satisfaction with the leader of our party,” said Scholten, who also noted she would welcome a competitive Democratic primary, an unlikely prospect for now. 

            In Michigan and beyond, VoteCast shows that about three-quarters of the midterm voters who backed Democrats but disapproved of Biden were self-identified Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents. Most said party affiliation was not very important to them.

            This group was more likely than those who approved of Biden to be sour about the economy, the issue that ranked top among them, and blame the president for inflation. They were overwhelmingly pessimistic about the country’s direction. The cohort was younger, more ideologically moderate and from lower-income households. 

            Shea Comfort of West Chester, Pennsylvania, doesn’t think there’s enough attention on working people who are struggling to feed their families when the “price of living now outweighs our check.” It’s not just Biden who isn’t doing enough, he said, but he called the president “the biggest liar of them all” and a “puppet on a string.”

            “None of these guys have seen hungry nights,” the 44-year-old cook said of politicians. “The middle class is getting kicked in the spine.” 

            Comfort said he’s a Democrat who voted for Biden in 2020 and Gov. Josh Shapiro in 2022, but he’s voted for Republicans before and would again. He said he wouldn’t vote for Biden for reelection.

            “We just were so busy focused on getting (Donald) Trump out of here that we took anything,” Comfort said. “But who else can really run that you trust anyway? So, no matter what, it’s like you’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t.”

            These voters made a “political calculus,” said Maurice Mitchell, national director of the progressive Working Families Party. That was in their best interest -- both to allow Democrats to advance their economic agenda and to reject GOP extremism -- but that doesn’t mean they’ll make the same decision in 2024.

            “I don’t think it makes sense for Democrats to take these voters for granted,” Mitchell said. “What Democrats, what the president should be doing is every single day demonstrating to those voters that they’re going to push as hard as possible for their interests.”

            Biden spent much of his State of the Union address this week focusing on so-called kitchen table economic issues that could appeal to voters in a reelection campaign. That approach was successful for some Democrats last year who sought to draw a clear contrast to their Republican opponents.

            For example, John Fetterman’s campaign flipped Pennsylvania’s Senate seat by intentionally focusing on him as an individual -- not any other Democrat -- and his specific opponent, according to Brendan McPhillips, who managed Fetterman's campaign. Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz, a celebrity surgeon endorsed by former President Donald Trump.

            There may have been underlying frustration with the president, McPhillips said, but “I don’t think it’s the same thing as looking at the Democratic Party or the president side-by-side to the alternative” and choosing the alternative.

            In Pennsylvania, the vast majority of voters for Fetterman and Shapiro said they were very concerned that Oz and Republican candidate for governor Doug Mastriano were too extreme. That included the voters who disapproved of Biden.

            About 2 in 10 of those who disapproved of Biden yet supported the Pennsylvania Democrats said they did so because they “mostly oppose” the other candidates. 

            Republican strategists suggest voters with this set of attitudes could defect with the right candidate on the ticket.

            In Arizona, this cohort of voters similarly rejected Republican candidates for governor, Kari Lake, and Senate, Blake Masters, both of whom sowed doubt about the results of the 2020 election. 

            Republican strategist Barrett Marson in Arizona was not surprised by the findings -- he himself voted for Democrat Katie Hobbs for governor despite not being a fan of Biden.

            “Up and down the ballot, throughout the country, we saw Republican candidates who were far, far, far outside the mainstream of thought,” he said, and they did not appeal to more moderate voters.

            This group of swing voters isn’t going away, said Lorna Romero Ferguson, also a Republican strategist in Arizona. Republicans instead will have to “learn from 2022 and focus on a nominee from the primary who can actually win statewide,” she said.

            “That voter bloc is going to be less inclined to just be a party loyalist,” said Romero Ferguson. “People have to earn their votes.”

            Emilee Brewer, a 21-year-old college student from Bangor, Pennsylvania, identifies as a moderate Republican. She voted for Trump in 2020, but since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, she’s felt frustrated with the Republican Party and its nominees.

            She chose to back Democrats for governor and for U.S. House in 2022 over their Republican opponents.

            “I chose the better candidate,” she said. “If the Republican Party wants to continue to grow and be better, we need to realize that we need to elect better candidates.”

            No matter who the GOP nominates for president, Biden will have to overcome serious doubts not just about his performance but about his capability and character as well. 

            Just 15% of voters for Democratic House candidates who disapproved of Biden described him as a strong leader. About half said Biden doesn’t care about people like them, and two-thirds thought he lacks the mental capability to serve effectively as president.

            Tyya Strong, a 24-year-old liberal living in West Chester, Pennsylvania, voted for Democrats last year. She often chooses Democrats because they are the “lesser of the two evils,” said Strong, who owns a marketing business.

            She voted for Biden in 2020 and would vote for him again but thinks he’s “not as fit as he could be.”

            “He’s not the vice president we had when (Barack) Obama was elected. He’s aged,” Strong said. “I think he’s doing a pretty fair job, but ... maybe sit the next one out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806147,"Celebs tout ice baths, but science on benefits is lukewarm","The coolest thing on social media these days may be celebrities and regular folks plunging into frigid water or taking ice baths.

            The touted benefits include improved mood, more energy, weight loss and reduced inflammation, but the science supporting some of those claims is lukewarm.

            Kim Kardashian posted her foray on Instagram. Harry Styles has tweeted about his dips. Kristen Bell says her plunges are “brutal” but mentally uplifting. And Lizzo claims ice plunges reduce inflammation and make her body feel better. 











            Here’s what medical evidence, experts and fans say about the practice, which dates back centuries.

            THE MIND

            You might call Dan O’Conor an amateur authority on cold water immersion. Since June 2020, the 55-year-old Chicago man has plunged into Lake Michigan almost daily, including on frigid winter mornings when he has to shovel through the ice.

            “The endorphin rush … is an incredible way to wake up and just kind of shock the body and get the engine going,"" O’Conor said on a recent morning when the air temperature was a frosty 23 degrees (minus-5 Celsius). Endorphins are “feel good"" hormones released in response to pain, stress, exercise and other activities. 

            With the lake temperature 34 degrees (1 Celsius), the bare-chested O’Conor did a running jump from the snow-covered shore to launch a forward flip into the icy gray water.

            His first plunge came early in the pandemic, when he went on a bourbon bender and his annoyed wife told him to “go jump in the lake."" The water felt good that June day. The world was in a coronavirus funk, O’Conor says, and that made him want to continue. As the water grew colder with the seasons, the psychological effect was even greater, he said.

            “My mental health is a lot stronger, a lot brighter. I found some Zen down here coming down and jumping into the lake and shocking that body,"" O’Conor said.

            Dr. Will Cronenwett, chief of psychiatry at Northwestern University’s Feinberg medical school, tried cold-water immersion once, years ago while visiting Scandinavian friends on a Baltic island. After a sauna, he jumped into the ice-cold water for a few minutes and had what he called an intense and invigorating experience.

            ""It felt like I was being stabbed with hundreds of millions of really small electrical needles,"" he said. “I felt like I was strong and powerful and could do anything.""

            But Cronenwett says studying cold water immersion with a gold-standard randomized controlled trial is challenging because devising a placebo for cold plunges could be difficult. 

            There are a few theories on how it affects the psyche.

            Cronenwett says cold water immersion stimulates the part of the nervous system that controls the resting or relaxation state. That may enhance feelings of well-being.

            It also stimulates the part of the nervous system that regulates fight-or-flight stress response. Doing it on a regular basis may dampen that response, which could in turn help people feel better able to handle other stresses in their lives, although that is not proven, he said.

            “You have to conquer your own trepidation. You have to muster the courage to do it,"" he said. ""And when you finally do it, you feel like you’ve accomplished something meaningful. You’ve achieved a goal.""

            Czech researchers found that cold water plunging can increase blood concentrations of dopamine — another so-called happy hormone made in the brain — by 250%. High amounts have been linked with paranoia and aggression, noted physiologist James Mercer, a professor emeritus at the Arctic University of Norway who co-authored a recent scientific review of cold water immersion studies.

            THE HEART

            Cold water immersion raises blood pressure and increases stress on the heart. Studies have shown this is safe for healthy people and the effects are only temporary. 

            But it can be dangerous for people with heart trouble, sometimes leading to life-threatening irregular heartbeats, Cronenwett said. People with heart conditions or a family history of early heart disease should consult a physician before plunging, he said.

            METABOLISM

            Repeated cold-water immersions during winter months have been shown to improve how the body responds to insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels, Mercer noted. This might help reduce risks for diabetes or keep the disease under better control in people already affected, although more studies are needed to prove that.

            Cold water immersion also activates brown fat — tissue that helps keep the body warm and helps it control blood sugar and insulin levels. It also helps the body burn calories, which has prompted research into whether cold water immersion is an effective way to lose weight. The evidence so far is inconclusive. 

            IMMUNE SYSTEM

The AP is solely responsible for all content.The coolest thing on social media these days may be celebrities and regular folks plunging into frigid water or taking ice baths.The touted benefits include improved mood, more energy, weight loss and reduced inflammation, but the science supporting some of those claims is lukewarm.Kim Kardashian posted her foray on Instagram. Harry Styles has tweeted about his dips. Kristen Bell says her plunges are “brutal” but mentally uplifting. And Lizzo claims ice plunges reduce inflammation and make her body feel better.Here’s what medical evidence, experts and fans say about the practice, which dates back centuries.THE MINDYou might call Dan O’Conor an amateur authority on cold water immersion. Since June 2020, the 55-year-old Chicago man has plunged into Lake Michigan almost daily, including on frigid winter mornings when he has to shovel through the ice.“The endorphin rush … is an incredible way to wake up and just kind of shock the body and get the engine going,"" O’Conor said on a recent morning when the air temperature was a frosty 23 degrees (minus-5 Celsius). Endorphins are “feel good"" hormones released in response to pain, stress, exercise and other activities.With the lake temperature 34 degrees (1 Celsius), the bare-chested O’Conor did a running jump from the snow-covered shore to launch a forward flip into the icy gray water.His first plunge came early in the pandemic, when he went on a bourbon bender and his annoyed wife told him to “go jump in the lake."" The water felt good that June day. The world was in a coronavirus funk, O’Conor says, and that made him want to continue. As the water grew colder with the seasons, the psychological effect was even greater, he said.“My mental health is a lot stronger, a lot brighter. I found some Zen down here coming down and jumping into the lake and shocking that body,"" O’Conor said.Dr. Will Cronenwett, chief of psychiatry at Northwestern University’s Feinberg medical school, tried cold-water immersion once, years ago while visiting Scandinavian friends on a Baltic island. After a sauna, he jumped into the ice-cold water for a few minutes and had what he called an intense and invigorating experience.""It felt like I was being stabbed with hundreds of millions of really small electrical needles,"" he said. “I felt like I was strong and powerful and could do anything.""But Cronenwett says studying cold water immersion with a gold-standard randomized controlled trial is challenging because devising a placebo for cold plunges could be difficult.There are a few theories on how it affects the psyche.Cronenwett says cold water immersion stimulates the part of the nervous system that controls the resting or relaxation state. That may enhance feelings of well-being.It also stimulates the part of the nervous system that regulates fight-or-flight stress response. Doing it on a regular basis may dampen that response, which could in turn help people feel better able to handle other stresses in their lives, although that is not proven, he said.“You have to conquer your own trepidation. You have to muster the courage to do it,"" he said. ""And when you finally do it, you feel like you’ve accomplished something meaningful. You’ve achieved a goal.""Czech researchers found that cold water plunging can increase blood concentrations of dopamine — another so-called happy hormone made in the brain — by 250%. High amounts have been linked with paranoia and aggression, noted physiologist James Mercer, a professor emeritus at the Arctic University of Norway who co-authored a recent scientific review of cold water immersion studies.THE HEARTCold water immersion raises blood pressure and increases stress on the heart. Studies have shown this is safe for healthy people and the effects are only temporary.But it can be dangerous for people with heart trouble, sometimes leading to life-threatening irregular heartbeats, Cronenwett said. People with heart conditions or a family history of early heart disease should consult a physician before plunging, he said.METABOLISMRepeated cold-water immersions during winter months have been shown to improve how the body responds to insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels, Mercer noted. This might help reduce risks for diabetes or keep the disease under better control in people already affected, although more studies are needed to prove that.Cold water immersion also activates brown fat — tissue that helps keep the body warm and helps it control blood sugar and insulin levels. It also helps the body burn calories, which has prompted research into whether cold water immersion is an effective way to lose weight. The evidence so far is inconclusive.IMMUNE SYSTEMAnecdotal research suggests that people who routinely swim in chilly water get fewer colds, and there’s evidence that it can increase levels of certain white blood cells and other infection-fighting substances.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806150,"'It just rang': In crises, US-China hotline goes unanswered","WASHINGTON (AP) — Within hours of an Air Force F-22 downing a giant Chinese balloon that had crossed the United States, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reached out to his Chinese counterpart via a special crisis line, aiming for a quick general-to-general talk that could explain things and ease tensions.

            But Austin's effort Saturday fell flat, when Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe declined to get on the line, the Pentagon says. 

            China’s Defense Ministry says it refused the call from Austin after the balloon was shot down because the U.S. had “not created the proper atmosphere” for dialogue and exchange. The U.S. action had “seriously violated international norms and set a pernicious precedent,” a ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement issued late Thursday. 











            It's been an experience that's frustrated U.S. commanders for decades, when it comes to getting their Chinese counterparts on a phone or video line as some flaring crisis is sending tensions between the two nations climbing.

            From Americans' perspective, the lack of the kind of reliable crisis communications that helped get the U.S. and Soviet Union through the Cold War without an armed nuclear exchange is raising the dangers of the U.S.-China relationship now, at a time when China's military strength is growing and tensions with the U.S. are on the rise. 

            Without that ability for generals in opposing capitals to clear things up in a hurry, Americans worry that misunderstandings, false reports or accidental collisions could cause a minor confrontation to spiral into greater hostilities.

            And it's not about any technical shortfall with the communication equipment, said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of Indo-Pacific studies at the German Marshall Fund think tank. The issue is a fundamental difference in the way China and the U.S. view the value and purpose of military-to-military hotlines.

            U.S. military leaders’ faith in Washington-to-Beijing hotlines as a way to defuse flare-ups with China’s military has been butting up against a sharply different take — a Chinese political system that runs on slow deliberative consultation by political leaders and makes no room for individually directed, real-time talk between rival generals. 

            And Chinese leaders are suspicious of the whole U.S. notion of a hotline — seeing it as an American channel for trying to talk their way out of repercussions for a U.S. provocation.

            “That's really dangerous,” Assistant Secretary for Defense Ely Ratner said Thursday of the difficulty of military-to-military crisis communications with China, when Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley pressed him about China's latest rebuff on Beijing's and Washington's hotline setup. 

            U.S. generals are persisting in their efforts to open more lines of communication with Chinese counterparts, the defense official said, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “And unfortunately, to date, the PLA is not answering that call,” Ratner said, referring to China's People's Liberation Army. 

            Ratner accused China of using vital channels of communication simply as a blunter messaging tool, shutting them down or opening them up again to underscore China's displeasure or pleasure with the U.S.

            China's resistance to military hotlines as tensions increase puts more urgency on efforts by President Joe Biden and his top civilian diplomats and security aides to build up their own communication channels with President Xi Jinping and other top Chinese political officials, for situations where military hotlines may go unanswered, U.S. officials and China experts say. 

            Both U.S. and Chinese militaries are building up for a possible confrontation over U.S.-backed self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. The next flare-up seems only a matter of time. It could happen with an expected event, such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's promised visit to Taiwan, or something unexpected, like the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter and a U.S. Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea. Without commanders talking in real-time, Americans and Chinese would have one less way of averting greater conflict..

            “My worry is that the EP-3 type incident will happen again,” said Lyle Morris, a country director for China for the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 2019 to 2021, now a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “And we will be in much different political environments of hostility and mistrust, where that could go wrong in a hurry.""

            Biden has emphasized building lines of communications with China to “responsibly manage” their differences. A November meeting between Xi and Biden yielded an announcement the two governments would resume a range of dialogues that China had shut down after an August Taiwan visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

            Last weekend, the U.S. canceled what would have been a relationship-building visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken after the transit of the Chinese balloon, which the U.S. says was for espionage. China claims it was a civilian balloon used for meteorological research. 

            The same week that China's balloon flew over the U.S., Austin was in the Philippines to announce an expanded U.S. military footprint there, neighboring China, noted Tiehlin Yen, director of the Taiwan Center for Security Studies, a think tank. “America is also very nationalistic these days,” Yen said.

            “From a regional security perspective, this dialogue is necessary,” Yen said. 

            What passes for military and civilian hotlines between China and the U.S. aren't the classic red phones on a desk.

            Under a 2008 agreement, the China-U.S. military hotline amounts to a multistep process by which one capital relays a request to the other for a joint call or videoconference between top officials on encrypted lines. The pact gives the other side 48 hours and up to respond, although nothing in the pact stops top officials from talking immediately.

            Sometimes when the U.S. calls, current and former U.S. officials say, Chinese officials don’t even pick up.

            “No one answered. It just rang,” recounted Kristen Gunness, a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corporation. Gunness was speaking about a March 2009 incident when she was working as an adviser to the Pentagon’s chief of naval operations. Chinese navy vessels at the time surrounded a U.S. surveillance ship in the South China Sea and demanded the American leave. U.S. and Chinese military officials eventually talked - but some 24 hours later.

            It took decades of Washington pushing to get Beijing to agree to the current system of military crisis communications, said David Sedney, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who negotiated it.

            “And then once we had it in place, it was clear that they were very reluctant to use it in any substantive purpose,” Sedney said.

            Americans' test calls on the hotline would get picked up, he said. And when Americans called to give congratulations on some Chinese holiday, Chinese officials would pick up and say thanks, he said.

            Anything more sensitive, Sedney said, the staffers answering the phone “would say, ‘We’ll check. As soon as our leadership is ready to talk, we’ll get back to you.' Nothing would happen.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806152,Prescott pays tribute to late mother while accepting award,"PHOENIX (AP) — Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott used his platform as the NFL's Walter Payton Man of the Year award recipient for an emotional tribute to his mother, whom he called his “moral compass” and his inspiration. 

            The two-time Pro Bowl selection lost his mother, Peggy, to cancer in 2013 when he was a quarterback at Mississippi State. He also honored his late brother, Jace, who died by suicide in 2020. 

            “My mother was, and still is, my moral compass,” Prescott said while accepting the award Thursday night at NFL Honors. “Through my own charitable contributions, I seek to share her strength and courage with the world.""











            “My mother told me when she was diagnosed with cancer that, ‘All greats have a story. Allow me to be your story.’ She is my ‘why.’ And with these words, just as she does and always did, my mother inspired me and motivated me to be great beyond the circumstances. And it was in her honor I that started my foundation in 2017 and named it Faith, Fight, Finish, the three words she left me and my brothers.”

            Prescott is the fourth Cowboys player to win the award, joining Roger Staubach, Troy Aikman and former teammate Jason Witten. 

            The award — the recipient of which is picked from 32 nominees, one on each team — is given to an NFL player for his community service activities, as well as on-the-field success.

            The quarterback said there was no doubt where this award ranks among the many honors he's received in his career.

            “That's easy — it's number one,” Prescott told reporters later Thursday. “When your mom gets diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, she's given months to live, she's giving you that news, and she tells you, ‘Hey, all greats have a story. Allow me to be your story.’ 

            ""That's what this award means to me.”

            Prescott's Faith Fight Finish foundation has raised funds for several causes, including colon cancer research. The quarterback has also been very open about suicide prevention and mental health. For winning the award, Prescott's foundation receives $255,000. The other 31 finalists receive $55,000 for the charity of their choice.

            “I've always been obsessed with the game of football since I was a little kid,” Prescott said. ""When she used to introduce me, she'd say ‘This is my Heisman winner.' 

            ""Obviously, I didn't win that. But I think being able to trade that for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award, my mom would have been so proud.""

            The award is named after late running back and Pro Football Hall of Famer Walter Payton. Los Angeles Rams offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth was last year's winner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806153,"Rockets send Gordon to Clips, get Wall; Griz in 3-team trade","HOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Rockets traded Eric Gordon to the Los Angeles Clippers while reacquiring John Wall in a three-team deal Thursday that also involved the Memphis Grizzlies.

            Gordon was sent to the Clippers for the rights to swap the 2023 first-round pick Houston acquired from Milwaukee with the lesser of either the Clippers' first-round pick or Oklahoma City's first-round pick with protection of picks 1-6. 

            The Rockets got Wall from the Clippers and acquired Danny Green from the Grizzlies. Before joining the Clippers this season, Wall spent the previous two seasons with the Rockets but did not play all of last season as Houston attempted to trade him.











            Gordon was the longest-tenured Rocket and the only player remaining from before Houston began its rebuild when James Harden was traded to the Nets in January 2021.

            The 34-year-old Gordon, who is in his 15th NBA season, joined the Rockets in 2016. He appeared in 379 games with 219 starts in Houston, averaging 15.7 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists. 

            He won the Sixth Man of the Year award for the 2016-17 season and helped the Rockets to the Western Conference Semifinals in each of his first four seasons. His 1,054 3-pointers rank second in franchise history behind Harden (2,029).

            “Throughout his six and a half seasons as a Rocket, Eric did everything we asked of him and more both on the court and in the community,” general manager Rafael Stone said. “We wish him nothing but the best and want him to know he’ll always have a home here in Houston.”

            Green, who is in his 14th season, has played just three games this season after recovering from a knee injury. He is a three-time NBA champion who spent the majority of his career with the Spurs.

Before joining the Clippers this season, Wall spent the previous two seasons with the Rockets but did not play all of last season as Houston attempted to trade him.Gordon was the longest-tenured Rocket and the only player remaining from before Houston began its rebuild when James Harden was traded to the Nets in January 2021.The 34-year-old Gordon, who is in his 15th NBA season, joined the Rockets in 2016. He appeared in 379 games with 219 starts in Houston, averaging 15.7 points, 2.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists.He won the Sixth Man of the Year award for the 2016-17 season and helped the Rockets to the Western Conference Semifinals in each of his first four seasons. His 1,054 3-pointers rank second in franchise history behind Harden (2,029).“Throughout his six and a half seasons as a Rocket, Eric did everything we asked of him and more both on the court and in the community,” general manager Rafael Stone said. “We wish him nothing but the best and want him to know he’ll always have a home here in Houston.”Green, who is in his 14th season, has played just three games this season after recovering from a knee injury. He is a three-time NBA champion who spent the majority of his career with the Spurs.The Rockets also waived center Boban Marjanovic.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806155,"No. 6 Stanford rebounds from rare loss, beats No. 17 Arizona","TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Stanford hasn’t lost consecutive games in more than two years. It will be even longer after the Cardinal bounced back from one of their worst performances of the season with arguably their best.

            Cameron Brink and Haley Jones each scored 18 points and the No. 6 Cardinal used a strong rebounding performance to beat No. 17 Arizona 84-60 on Thursday night.

            The Cardinal (23-3, 11-2 Pac-12) won their sixth straight against the Wildcats (18-6, 8-5), a streak that includes the 2021 NCAA title game. Stanford moved into first place in the conference, a half-game ahead of No. 7 Utah.











            Jones shot 8 for 11 from the field and added 12 rebounds and six assists. Brink scored all her points and added eight rebounds in 21 minutes.

            Stanford outrebounded Arizona 45-27. It was a much better effort on the boards than in Sunday’s 72-67 loss at Washington. In that game, the Cardinal had a season-low 24 rebounds, which they surpassed in the third quarter against the Wildcats.

            “Everything was 10 times better,” Jones said. “I think this was one of our best games we played overall, 40 minutes-wise. I was really proud of the bounce back that we had tonight.”

            Stanford tied a season-high with 59.3% shooting, narrowly missing becoming the first team to shoot better than 60% against the Wildcats since the Cardinal accomplished the feat in 2014.

            “We wanted to be aggressive, we wanted to play fast, that’s how we want to play,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerVeer said. “I think we can even do better. And I think I’ve been holding us back, honestly, I really do.”

            Paris Clark, Esmery Martinez and Cate Reese led the way for Arizona with 10 points apiece. 

            The Wildcats were coming off their first road sweep of the Los Angeles schools since 2002, but needed three overtimes, including two in Sunday’s win at USC. The Wildcats shot 35.8% and had their most lopsided loss since falling by 27 points at home to Kansas in December.

            “We just kind of died,” Arizona coach Adia Barnes said. “I think we didn’t show a tremendous amount of effort until the last six minutes.”

            Up 38-27 at the break, Stanford extended the lead to 21 points midway through the third quarter on a 3-pointer by Hannah Jump. The Cardinal were up 25 points after three periods and led by as many as 37.

            BIG PICTURE

            Stanford: The Cardinal entered the week fourth in the NET rankings, keeping them in line for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. It would be their third consecutive season as a No. 1, their longest streak since four straight No. 1 seeds from 2010-13.

            Arizona: The Wildcats fell to 3-3 this season against ranked teams. Their last win over a top-10 opponent came in Nov. 2021 against No. 6 Louisville in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with their last home win against a top-10 team coming in Jan. 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806162,China space station crew completes spacewalk,"BEIJING (AP) — The crew of China’s orbiting space station has completed the first of several planned spacewalks of their six-month mission, pushing such activities into the realm of routine for the country’s astronauts. 

            The China Manned Space Agency said that, during Friday’s seven-hour extra-vehicular activity, Fei Junlong and Zhang Lu carried out a number of tasks, including installing extension pumps outside the Mengtian laboratory module. The third member of the Shenzhou-15 mission, Deng Qingming, assisted from inside the station. The three are scheduled to carry out several other spacewalks during their time on board. 

            
                China completed the Tiangong station in November with the addition of the third of three modules, centered on the Tianhe living and command module. 











            China built its own station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese space programs’ intimate ties to the People’s Liberation Army, the military wing of the ruling Communist Party. 

            International security concerns around China were underscored last week when the U.S. military shot down an alleged Chinese military spy balloon that had drifted across the continental United States. China has maintained it was a civilian weather balloon that blew off course. 

            Tiangong weighs about 66 tons — a fraction of the 465-ton International Space Station. It can accommodate up to six astronauts, though only three will be on board for each mission. 

            With a lifespan of 10 to 15 years, Tiangong could one day be the only space station still up and running if the ISS retires around the end of the decade as expected.

            China in 2003 became the third government to send an astronaut into orbit on its own after the former Soviet Union and the United States. It conducted its first spacewalk in September 2008 and the tempo of such activities has increased since the launch of the Tianhe module in 2021. 

            The country has also chalked up uncrewed mission successes: Its Yutu-2 rover was the first to explore the little-known far side of the moon. Its Chang’e 5 probe also returned lunar rocks to Earth in December 2020 for the first time since the 1970s, and another Chinese rover is searching for evidence of life on Mars.

            An eventual crewed mission to the moon is also under consideration, although no timeline has been offered.BEIJING (AP) — The crew of China’s orbiting space station has completed the first of several planned spacewalks of their six-month mission, pushing such activities into the realm of routine for the country’s astronauts.The China Manned Space Agency said that, during Friday’s seven-hour extra-vehicular activity, Fei Junlong and Zhang Lu carried out a number of tasks, including installing extension pumps outside the Mengtian laboratory module.

It is the 17th country Asian country to have reported ASF.As such, those who import, bring in, or ship in pork products from Singapore will be fined NT$200,000 (US$6,634) for a first-time violation and NT$1 million for repeat offenses, CEOC warned. Arrivals who break the law will be denied entry and repatriated if they fail to pay the fine.Contraband includes pork jerky, sausages, ham, pork instant noodles, pork-based canned food, pork floss egg rolls, and bak kut teh soup packs.Singapore has been put on the list of countries from which passengers’ luggage and international parcels undergo vigorous X-ray inspection since 2019, as with all other countries in Southeast Asia.ASF-affected Asian countries now include China, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Korea, East Timor, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Bhutan, Thailand, Nepal, and Singapore.",2023/02/10,1998,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806176,"Bucks win 9th straight, hold off LeBron-less Lakers 115-106","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 10 rebounds, and the Milwaukee Bucks rallied in the second half for their ninth consecutive victory, 115-106 over the Los Angeles Lakers without LeBron James on Thursday night.

            James sat out to rest his sore left ankle and foot two nights after he passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA’s career scoring leader. The Bucks still fell behind by 11 in a tepid first half and never pulled away from an opponent with only nine players in uniform, but Antetokounmpo racked up 23 points in the second half.

            Khris Middleton scored 22 points and Jrue Holiday added 18 for the Bucks, who matched their longest winning streak since their 9-0 start to this season. Milwaukee is primed for the stretch run to the postseason after adding veteran Jae Crowder to its talented core at the trade deadline.











            “Our offense has been better for this stretch,” coach Mike Budenholzer said. “Tonight we did not shoot it well, but I think generally speaking, we've been shooting the ball better. I think it's been our unselfishness, the way the ball has moved, the pop that we're playing with. Getting Khris healthy makes a big difference, so it's a little bit of everything. It's hard to keep a stretch like this going, but we want to keep pushing.”

            Dennis Schröder had 25 points and 12 assists in a standout performance at point guard for the Lakers, who had only four reserves after their flurry of trades in the past two days.

            Los Angeles shipped out Russell Westbrook, Patrick Beverley, Thomas Bryant, Juan Toscano-Anderson and Damian Jones while adding D’Angelo Russell, Malik Beasley, Jarred Vanderbilt, Mo Bamba and Davon Reed.

            Russell, Vanderbilt and Beasley sat on the Lakers’ bench to watch this game with their new teammates.

            “We’ve just got to put everything together,"" said Anthony Davis, who had 23 points and 16 rebounds while battling foul trouble. ""Obviously we know what we have on paper. We’ve got to put it to the floor. We’re behind the 8-ball, so we’ve got to do it with some urgency. These guys coming in are ready to get going.”

            The Lakers are 25-31 after their third straight loss, and they're in desperate need of a winning surge if they hope to avoid missing the playoffs for the second straight season.

            James missed his 12th game of the season with an injury that has required constant maintenance. The Lakers honored his achievement with a pregame ceremony in which he thanked his fans and his family while describing the week as “surreal.”

            Despite using their 28th starting lineup in 56 games this season, the short-handed Lakers improbably took a 58-50 halftime lead while Milwaukee missed 23 of its 28 3-point attempts.

            THE REAL STORY

            Davis ended a surge of internet speculation about why he was curiously sitting on the Lakers' bench instead of watching the moment James broke the scoring record Tuesday: He didn't realize LeBron was about to make history.

            “We were losing to the Oklahoma City Thunder in a game that we needed, and I was (ticked) off that we were losing,” Davis said. “It's very simple. It's nothing had to do with Bron. He knows that.”

            TIP-INS

            Bucks: Crowder is unlikely to join the team before it returns home to Milwaukee, Budenholzer said. The Bucks gave up George Hill, Serge Ibaka, Jordan Nwora and three future second-round picks to get the defense-minded, playoff-tested Crowder, who played at Marquette. “I just feel like Jae is a winner,” Budenholzer said. “His toughness, his defense, what he brings on that end of the court is special.”

            Lakers: Coach Darvin Ham said James had “imaging” done on his foot, but it didn't show “anything extensive, just normal wear and tear.” ... Ham is hoping all five newcomers are available for their next game Saturday. “All those guys bring unique skill sets that we need,” Ham said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806180,China calls US House resolution 'political manipulation',"BEIJING (AP) — China on Friday dismissed a U.S. House of Representatives resolution condemning Beijing over a suspected Chinese spy balloon shot down above U.S. waters as “purely political manipulation and hyping up.""

            “China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a daily briefing.

            “The resolution by the U.S. Congress was purely political manipulation and hyping up,"" Mao said.











            
                The resolution, which passed unanimously on Thursday, condemned China for a “brazen violation” of U.S. sovereignty and efforts to “deceive the international community through false claims about its intelligence collection campaigns.”

            Republicans have criticized the Biden administration for not acting sooner to shoot down the balloon, but both parties’ lawmakers came together on the vote, 419-0.

            China insists the object was a civilian weather balloon that had been blown off course, but has not said whom it belonged to or offered other details. 

            Meanwhile, China’s Defense Ministry said it refused a call from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin following the downing of the balloon because the U.S. had “not created the proper atmosphere"" for dialogue and exchange.

            The U.S. action “seriously violated international norms and set a pernicious precedent,"" ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei said in a statement issued late Thursday. 

            “Given that this irresponsible and seriously wrong approach by the U.S. did not create the proper atmosphere for dialogue and exchanges between the two militaries, China did not accept the U.S. proposal for a phone call between the two defense ministers,"" Tan said. 

            China, Tan added, “reserves the right to use necessary means to deal with similar situations."" 

            After initially expressing “regret"" over the incident, China's rhetoric has hardened in recent days as the FBI gathers debris from the site of the downing in U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina and sends it to the FBI’s lab in Quantico, Virginia, for investigation.

            Beijing said the U.S. “overreacted” by shooting it down. The Foreign Ministry has labeled the action “irresponsible” and calls U.S. claims that it was spying “part of the U.S. side’s information warfare against China.”

            Austin had sought on Saturday to discuss the balloon issue with his Chinese counterpart, Wei Fenghe, but was refused, the Pentagon said.

            In the wake of the incident, Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceled a planned trip to Beijing this week that some had hoped would help stabilize bilateral relations, which have tumbled to their lowest level in decades over trade, human rights, China's threats against Taiwan and the Chinese military's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.

            The U.S. has flatly contradicted China’s version of events, saying that imagery of the balloon collected by American U-2 spy planes as it crossed the country showed that it was “capable of conducting signals intelligence collection” with multiple antennas and other equipment designed to upload sensitive information and solar panels to power them.

            The U.S. says the balloon was part of a huge aerial surveillance program that targeted more than 40 countries under the direction of the People’s Liberation Army. Similar balloons have sailed over five continents, according to the administration.

            A State Department official said the U.S. has confidence that the manufacturer of the balloon has “a direct relationship with China’s military and is an approved vendor"" of the army. The official cited an official PLA procurement portal as evidence.

            Publicly available records show several Chinese companies have been developing balloons for military use, with some openly touting their connections with the PLA, advertising airships bristling with surveillance and communications gear.

            Such high-tech balloons are often far larger than the hot air balloons used for recreational purposes. The one shot down by the U.S. was 60 meters (200 feet) tall.

            State-owned defense contractor China Electronics Technology Group boasted in 2021 that its JY400 balloon could be equipped with radar and equipment to eavesdrop and interfere with telecommunications.

            “It can effectively deal with threats from low-flying targets, cruise missiles and sea targets,” Anhui Daily said a report.

            An email sent to the company bounced back because the inbox was full. A man who picked up the telephone at a number listed for it declined to answer questions and said email was the only way to send requests for comment.

            Two balloon companies in the southern province of Hunan also tout military connections.

            The Zhuzhou Rubber Research and Design Institute makes the rubber pouches that fill with helium, making balloons lighter than air, and works with the PLA, according to procurement notices, job advertisements and a now-deleted description on its company website. 

            The deleted description said it is one of only two weather balloon makers in China, and a “military rubber products research and production unit.” 

            The company, a subsidiary of a state-owned enterprise, the China National Chemical Corp., did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.

            The website of the second company, Hunan Aerospace, says it makes balloons that can float 3 kilometers (2 miles) high for 21 days at a time. It also produces balloons called “elite scouts” able to hover in place for long periods, according to Rednet.cn, a state-backed media outlet in Hunan province. 

            A woman answering a number listed for Hunan Aerospace denied any connection with the spy balloon incident. Its parent company, state-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp., which also builds missile systems, did not immediately respond to a fax and email requesting comment.

            In 2020, the Chinese Academy of Sciences broke ground on an experimental base dedicated to developing high-altitude balloons in a remote desert site in Inner Mongolia, where analysts suspect the balloon shot down in the U.S. took flight.

            The academy has built an airship, Jimu-1, capable of flying at an altitude of 7 kilometers (4.3 miles), according to China.com.cn.

            A number listed for the academy's Institute of Optics and Electronics rang unanswered, and an email sent to an address on its website bounced.

            For the military, the strategic value of these balloons is high.

            “In the future, balloon platforms may become like submarines in the deep sea, a silent killer that brings terror,” said an article in the PLA Daily, a newspaper published by the ruling Communist Party’s Central Military Commission. 

            Balloons have been used in war for centuries. The French used balloons to spot enemy troop movement as early as the late 1700s, as did soldiers during the American Civil War.

            In 1956, Chinese authorities intercepted American spy balloons and displayed remnants at an exhibition in Beijing, accusing the U.S. of violating their airspace.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806182,Rescuers rejoice as more quake survivors emerge from rubble,"ISKENDERUN, Turkey (AP) — Six relatives huddled in a small air pocket, day after day. A desperate teenager grew so thirsty that he drank his own urine. Two frightened sisters were comforted by a pop song as they waited for rescuers to free them.

            These earthquake survivors were among more than a dozen people pulled out of the rubble alive Friday after spending over four days trapped in frigid darkness following the disaster that struck Turkey and Syria.

            The unlikely rescues, coming so long after Monday’s 7.8-magnitude quake brought down thousands of buildings, offered fleeting moments of joy amid a catastrophe that has killed nearly 24,000 people, injured at least 80,000 others and left millions homeless.











            In the Mediterranean coastal city of Iskenderun, a crowd chanted “God is great!” as Haci Murat Kilinc and his wife, Raziye, were carried on stretchers to a waiting ambulance.

            “You’ve been working so many hours, God bless you!” a relative of the couple told one of their saviors.

            One rescue worker said that Kilinc had been joking with crew members while still trapped beneath the rubble, trying to boost their morale.

            Two hours earlier in Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the epicenter, rescuers embraced and chanted their thanks to God after pulling a man from his collapsed home.

            In Adiyaman, a hard-hit city of more than a quarter-million people, rescuers and onlookers suppressed their joy so as not to frighten 4-year-old Yagiz Komsu as he emerged from the debris, according the HaberTurk television, which broadcast the rescue live.

            To distract him, he was given a jelly bean. Teams later rescued his 27-year-old mother, Ayfer Komsu, who had a broken rib.

            But the flurry of dramatic rescues could not obscure the devastation spread across a sprawling border region that is home to more than 13.5 million people. Entire neighborhoods of high-rises have been reduced to rubble, and the quake has already killed more people than Japan’s Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, with many more bodies yet to be recovered and counted.

            Relatives wept and chanted as rescuers pulled 17-year-old Adnan Muhammed Korkut from a basement in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, near the quake’s epicenter. He had been trapped for 94 hours, forced to drink his own urine to survive.

            “Thank God you arrived,” he said, embracing his mother and others who leaned down to kiss and hug him as he was being loaded into an ambulance.

            For one of the rescuers, identified only as Yasemin, Adnan’s survival hit home hard.

            “I have a son just like you,” she told him after giving him a warm hug. “I swear to you, I have not slept for four days. … I was trying to get you out.”

            Elsewhere, HaberTurk television said rescuers had identified nine people trapped inside the remains of a high-rise apartment block in Iskenderun and pulled out six of them, including a woman who waved at onlookers as she was being carried away on a stretcher. The crowd shouted “God is great!” after she was brought out.

            The building was only 600 feet (200 meters) from the Mediterranean Sea and narrowly avoided being flooded when the massive earthquake sent water surging into the city center.

            Video of another rescue effort in Kahramanmaras showed an emergency worker playing a pop song on his smartphone to distract the two teenage sisters as they waited to be freed.

            There were still more stories: A German team said it worked for more than 50 hours to free a woman from a collapsed house in Kirikhan. And a trapped woman could be heard speaking to a team trying to dig her out in video broadcast by HaberTurk television. She told her would-be rescuers that she had given up hope of being found — and prayed to be put to sleep because she was so cold. The station did not say where the operation was taking place.

            Even though experts say trapped people can live for a week or more, the odds of finding more survivors were quickly waning.

            Death loomed everywhere: Morgues and cemeteries were overwhelmed, and bodies wrapped in blankets, rugs and tarps lay in the streets of some cities.

            Temperatures remained below freezing across the large region, and many people have no shelter. The Turkish government has distributed millions of hot meals, as well as tents and blankets, but was still struggling to reach many people in need.

            The disaster compounded suffering in a region beset by Syria's 12-year civil war, which has displaced millions of people within the country and left them dependent on aid. The fighting sent millions more to seek refuge in Turkey.

            The conflict has isolated many areas of Syria and complicated efforts to get aid in. The United Nations said the first earthquake-related aid convoy crossed from Turkey into northwestern Syria on Friday — a day after an aid shipment planned before the disaster arrived.

            The U.N. refugee agency estimated that as many as 5.3 million people have been left homeless in Syria. Sivanka Dhanapala, the country representative in Syria for UNHCR, told reporters Friday that the agency is focusing on providing tents, plastic sheeting, thermal blankets, sleeping mats and winter clothing.

            Syrian President Bashar Assad and his wife, Asmaa, visited survivors at the Aleppo University Hospital, according to Syrian state media. It was the leader's first public appearance in an affected area of the country since the disaster. He then visited rescuers in one of the city's hardest-hit areas.

            Aleppo has been scarred by years of heavy bombardment and shelling — much of it by the forces of Assad and his ally, Russia — and it was among the cities most devastated by the earthquake.

            The Syrian government also announced that it will allow aid to reach all parts of the country, including areas held by insurgent groups in the northwest.

            Also Friday, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, declared a cease-fire in its separatist insurgency in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast, including some areas affected by the quake.

            Turkey’s disaster-management agency said more than 20,200 people had been confirmed killed in the disaster so far in Turkey, with more than 80,000 injured.

            More than 3,500 have been confirmed killed in Syria, bringing the total number of dead to nearly 24,000.

            Some 12,000 buildings in Turkey have either collapsed or sustained serious damage, according to Turkey’s minister of environment and urban planning, Murat Kurum. Turkey's vice president, Fuat Oktay, said more than 1 million people were being housed in temporary shelters.

            Engineers suggested that the scale of the devastation was partly explained by lax enforcement of building codes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806183,S. Africa rugby player killed by Hawaii police had acute CTE,"HONOLULU (AP) — A Black former professional rugby player from South Africa shot by police months after moving to Hawaii suffered from a degenerative brain disease often found in American football players and other athletes subjected to repeated head trauma, autopsy results show.

            The finding could help explain Lindani Myeni’s bizarre behavior before the deadly 2021 confrontation with Honolulu officers. It also offers another layer of detail about a shooting that gained international attention during heightened calls for police reform following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

            An addendum to Myeni’s autopsy report obtained by The Associated Press shows his brain tissue was sent to the Boston University CTE Center, which found the 29-year-old father of two suffered from stage three chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Commonly known as CTE, the disease can only be diagnosed posthumously. 











            Stage four is the most severe level and experts say it’s alarming for someone as young as Myeni to have such a critical case of CTE. 

            Lindsay Myeni, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit alleging police shot her husband because he was Black, said she was shocked to learn of the CTE diagnosis.

            “I had no clue. He had no clue,” she said from Richard’s Bay, South Africa, where she now lives. “So it was kind of devastating because it felt like ... someone was telling me like, hey, he died from racism at 29, but he was going to be killed from his favorite sport at 50 or 51 anyway.” 

            Police were called to a Honolulu home about a stranger who had entered uninvited. He said, “I have videos of you,” claimed a cat at the home was his and made other strange comments, according to Honolulu's prosecuting attorney, who decided not to pursue charges against any of the officers. 

            Police officials have said officers weren’t reacting to his race, but rather his behavior, which put officers' lives in jeopardy. Prosecutors found that deadly force was justified because Myeni physically attacked officers, leaving one with a concussion.

            He had been emotional earlier that day about family issues and the couple had visited numerous spiritual sites around the island of Oahu, Lindsay Myeni said, but he showed no signs of CTE symptoms. Those include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression and depression.

            She said that looking back, she wondered if maybe he was depressed or had mood swings during the pandemic, “but didn’t we all?”

            Myeni started playing rugby at around age 13, and by 19 had played professionally with the Border Bulldogs in South Africa, his wife said. He also played some rugby in Colorado and Florida, she said. She was aware of him only having two or three concussions.

            Dr. Masahiko Kobayashi, the Honolulu medical examiner who autopsied Myeni and concluded he died from gunshot wounds, said he suspected CTE after hearing about Myeni's behavior and his contact sports past.

            “The case of Mr. Myeni was really simple when I just determined the cause and manner of death. But the circumstances were very complex, and the public was greatly impacted by this case,” he said.

            Kobayashi said he hoped the CTE finding might provide a clearer picture of what led to Myeni's death.

            “We medical examiners sometimes act as a finder of facts more than the cause and manner of death,” Kobayashi said. “After I thought about all of this, I believed the results of a CTE study should be a part of a full and complete understanding of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Myeni, which is why I decided to order the test.” 

            But CTE doesn't help Lindsay Myeni understand what happened that April 14, 2021, night. 

            “To me, it still doesn't answer any questions as to why you would shoot him,” she said. 

            Myeni's behavior sounded like “classic symptoms” related to CTE, “confusion, disorientation, acting out in a very different way,” said Paul Anderson, a lawyer in Kansas City, Missouri, who represents families of athletes with brain injuries, but is not involved in the Myeni case.

            The youngest case of stage three CTE diagnosed in medical literature was Aaron Hernandez, 27, making Myeni “an example of pretty severe CTE for someone that age,” said Dr. Daniel Daneshvar, an expert on the condition and a Harvard Medical School assistant professor.

            Hernandez, a former New England Patriots football star, killed himself in 2017 in the prison cell where he was serving a life-without-parole sentence for murder.

            While people with CTE tend to have problems with memory, thinking, impulsivity and paranoia, there could be other explanations, Daneshvar said. 

            “We can’t say for sure whether or not CTE in anyone’s brain can cause them to do any particular action,” he said. 

            Honolulu Prosecuting Attorney Steven Alm said the CTE finding isn’t surprising and doesn’t change his conclusion that police were justified in using deadly force.

            “It’s just a reminder for everybody that danger can come about, either because somebody just has that type of personality or they have some kind of ... mental or emotional disability or, like this,” Alm said.

            The investigation by Alm’s office found that two days before the shooting, Myeni told his kickboxing instructor that he was going through “crazy African spiritual stuff.""

            About 30 minutes before the shooting, Myeni interjected himself in a situation where police were investigating a vehicle break-in and had to be told to go away by both the victim and officers, according to Alm's investigation.

            Myeni then asked one of the officers for money to buy food and tried to get into the back of a police car.

            From there, he drove a short distance to a home where tourists who didn’t know him were staying. Wearing a feathered headband, he followed them into the house, told the woman, “I have videos of you,” claimed a cat there was his and made comments about hunting.

            The frightened woman called 911.

            Officer body camera videos showed Myeni punching responding officers, leaving one with facial fractures and a concussion. Myeni continued punching an officer even after he was shot once in the chest, Alm said.

            Bridget Morgan-Bickerton, a Honolulu attorney representing Myeni's wife, said he wasn't aggressive, “until he was subjected to unjustified aggression, being yelled at, at gunpoint, in the dark to ‘get on the ground’ with no announcement of who was asking.”

            
                Three months before the shooting, the Myenis moved to Hawaii, where Lindsay Myeni grew up, believing it would be safer for their two Black children than in another part of the U.S.

            As a single mother of a 2- and 3-year-old, she doesn't know if she can ever return to Hawaii, so they're in South Africa, where the couple met while she was on a Christian mission trip. But it's difficult there, too.

            “It’s like I even moved out of our little township that he’s from and moved to the suburbs because ... it’s hard to even be at the house,"" she said. ""I just went for a birthday party back to his home and I’m like, oh, this is so painful.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806199,Huawei announces closure of service centers in Taipei and Taichung,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After many years of struggling with supply chain issues and international sanctions, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer Huawei announced it will drastically scale back business operations in Taiwan.On Friday (Feb. 10), Huawei shared a post saying that it would close down two of its three primary customer service centers in Taiwan. The Taipei center, located in the Syntrend department store, and the Taichung center, at the Showtime Live Wenxin shopping center, will both close their doors on March 12. A third service center in Kaohsiung will remain open, reported UDN.Huawei has been under intense scrutiny in Taiwan and abroad for many years. Multiple national governments have banned the use of Huawei’s products due to the company’s suspected ties to China’s military.Since 2020, the company’s distribution capacity in Taiwan has been severely limited. This was due primarily to Huawei factories labeling products bound for Taiwan with the designation “Taiwan, China.” The company refused to comply with regulations outlined by Taiwan’s National Communications Commission to address the issue.Huawei’s products were subsequently banned from major distribution channels in the country. The company’s troubles have been compounded by legal restrictions on importing products to the U.S., and others which prevent U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei.For the past two years, Huawei has suffered severe drops in annual revenue, reporting a 32% decrease year over year in late 2021. A further decrease of 19% year over year was reported in late 2022.In late January, it was reported the Biden administration may be preparing to cut off Huawei's access to U.S. component suppliers entirely, in a move intended to restrict China's access to critical security technologies.Although some Taiwanese customers expressed concern over Huawei’s diminishing presence in Taiwan, the company assured its customers that their customer service hotline will still be open to deal with product issues. There are also several computer and smartphone repair centers throughout Taiwan that are licensed to repair Huawei products, according to the company announcement.",2023/02/10,3038,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806236,Ex-state adviser implicated in youth center abuse lawsuits,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — The girls at New Hampshire’s youth detention center called their dormitory leader “Peepin’ Dave” because they say he leered at them through a bathroom window. But David Ball, later promoted to chief of operations, also is accused of much worse.

            Of nearly 1,000 people who say they suffered physical or sexual abuse at the Sununu Youth Services Center, 20 have accused Ball, who retired in 2014 but continued advising the state on juvenile justice matters until 2021. The allegations against Ball, made in lawsuits against the state, point to a scandal that is not only widening, but also spiraling up the hierarchy. 

            One woman, who was 14 when she was incarcerated in 1993, said Ball raped her dozens of times — sometimes while she was in a straitjacket — and repeatedly choked her to the point of unconsciousness.











            “I really thought at some point there, I was going to die,” she told The Associated Press in an interview.

            Ball, now 76, is among roughly 150 former staffers who are implicated by former residents in more than 700 lawsuits naming the state as the defendant rather than individual workers. 

            Ball said he didn’t know until a reporter called him last week that 20 lawsuits filed between October 2021 and January of this year accuse him of physically or sexually assaulting 18 girls and two boys between 1981 and 1999.

            “I don’t believe that’s true. I know it isn’t true,” Ball told the AP, saying he never hit or otherwise abused any of the children and that he has not been questioned by police.

            The attorney general's office declined to comment on whether Ball is part of the criminal investigation launched in 2019. Eleven former workers have been charged with either sexually assaulting or acting as accomplices to the assault of more than a dozen teenagers from 1994 to 2007.

            Lawyers for the victims have argued Ball and other supervisors fostered a culture of violence and in some cases were abusers themselves.

            “Mr. Ball, and employees like him, were allowed to sexually, physically and emotionally abuse kids for decades without fear of reprisal because child abuse by state employees was not only tolerated, it was condoned,” attorney Rus Rilee said after learning from the AP about Ball’s high-ranking job and post-retirement appointment to a state advisory group.

            State employment records show Ball began working at the youth center in 1974 as a dormitory assistant and became a dorm leader in 1983. He was head of the girls dormitory in 2000 when he told a reporter for the New Hampshire Union Leader that most of the residents there came from abusive homes.

            “A lot of the girls say this is the safest place they’ve been,” he told the newspaper at the time. “They don’t like it here. It’s very confining. But they don’t have to worry that someone is going to molest them at night.”

            A resume obtained by the AP lists Ball's title as chief of operations from 2001 to 2009 and describes him as responsible for overseeing all staff “including motivation and discipline” and “creating and maintaining a safe and secure environment for both staff and residents.” He then spent five years as a field administrator overseeing juvenile probation and parole offices before retiring in 2014.

            Within months, Ball joined the federally mandated State Advisory Group for Juvenile Justice. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu abruptly disbanded the group in July 2021 and replaced it with a Juvenile Justice Reform Commission, with nearly all new members. At that point, Ball had not been identified in any lawsuits, but at least one of his accusers had given his name to state police investigators.

            Sununu's spokesperson, Ben Vihstadt, said the governor wasn't aware of the allegations against Ball when he disbanded the group to bring in fresh perspectives and ensure compliance with rules for receiving federal grants.

            “He finds the allegations surrounding David Ball, who was appointed by then-Gov. Maggie Hassan, incredibly concerning, and hopes these allegations are fully investigated,” Vihstadt said.

            Hassan, a Democrat now in the U.S. Senate, appointed Ball on the recommendation of the state health commissioner. Her office declined to comment.

            Four of the lawsuits accuse Ball of sexual assault, including a woman whose lawsuit says he came into her room at night to molest her and forced her and her roommate to sexually abuse each other. Three accusers said he choked them until they passed out; two said he punched them in the face. 

            One woman claimed Ball slammed her against a wall the night she arrived at the center and told her he was going to “break her” because she looked at him wrong. Another described him as a “particularly vicious supervisor who taught and directed others to emulate him."" Several said he often watched girls in the restrooms.

            The woman whose lawsuit accuses him of putting her in a straitjacket said she once tried to escape during an off-campus medical appointment and told a police officer who found her hiding in a parking lot dumpster about the abuse. Ball dismissed her claims and took her back to the youth center, where she said Ball’s abuse intensified.

            “He told me that he had already warned us that nothing was to be said, that people were going to be punished if stuff got out and that I made it worse for the other girls by taking off,” she said. 

            The AP does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault unless they consent to being named.

            Another woman suing the state told the AP she tried to speak about the abuse in 1992 after a girl complained during a group counseling session that Ball had groped her, but that she was quickly hushed by the female counselor. 

            “I started to say, ‘I don’t appreciate Mr. Ball ...’ but she just told me to quiet down and that the best thing to do is just basically go with the flow,” she said. “All hope was shot down.”

            The woman, who was 17 at the time, said Ball backed off when she started gaining weight.

            “So then I just ate a lot, but that didn’t deter anything because then other things happened with other people,” she said. 

            Ball suggested his accusers are motivated by money they could get via the lawsuits or the state's $100 million settlement fund for those who decide not to take their claims to court. He acknowledged being “strict” with youths and said that as a supervisor he had the final say regarding discipline or decisions about weekend furloughs and other privileges.

            “So I often had to wear the hat as the guy who said no to them,” he said. “I thought, overall, I had a good relationship with most of the kids and their families.”

            
                The youth center, which is expected to close next year, is named for Sununu’s father, former Gov. John H. Sununu. It once housed upward of 100 children but now typically serves about 10. 

            Cody Belanger, 28, said he didn't cross paths with Ball when he was incarcerated in 2008, but he served with him for several years on the state advisory panel. Belanger, a former state lawmaker who now leads the new juvenile justice commission, called the allegations against Ball difficult to hear. 

            “As someone who has faced abuse at the center myself, it disheartens me to believe that somebody I have trusted would have done that, when these students are the most vulnerable youth of an already vulnerable population,” he said. “It just goes to show that the abuse that these kids went through, it just continues to grow.”MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — The girls at New Hampshire’s youth detention center called their dormitory leader “Peepin’ Dave” because they say he leered at them through a bathroom window. But David Ball, later promoted to chief of operations, also is accused of much worse.Of nearly 1,000 people who say they suffered physical or sexual abuse at the Sununu Youth Services Center, 20 have accused Ball, who retired in 2014 but continued advising the state on juvenile justice matters until 2021. The allegations against Ball, made in lawsuits against the state, point to a scandal that is not only widening, but also spiraling up the hierarchy.One woman, who was 14 when she was incarcerated in 1993, said Ball raped her dozens of times — sometimes while she was in a straitjacket — and repeatedly choked her to the point of unconsciousness.“I really thought at some point there, I was going to die,” she told The Associated Press in an interview.Ball, now 76, is among roughly 150 former staffers who are implicated by former residents in more than 700 lawsuits naming the state as the defendant rather than individual workers.Ball said he didn’t know until a reporter called him last week that 20 lawsuits filed between October 2021 and January of this year accuse him of physically or sexually assaulting 18 girls and two boys between 1981 and 1999.“I don’t believe that’s true. I know it isn’t true,” Ball told the AP, saying he never hit or otherwise abused any of the children and that he has not been questioned by police.The attorney general's office declined to comment on whether Ball is part of the criminal investigation launched in 2019. Eleven former workers have been charged with either sexually assaulting or acting as accomplices to the assault of more than a dozen teenagers from 1994 to 2007.Lawyers for the victims have argued Ball and other supervisors fostered a culture of violence and in some cases were abusers themselves.“Mr. Ball, and employees like him, were allowed to sexually, physically and emotionally abuse kids for decades without fear of reprisal because child abuse by state employees was not only tolerated, it was condoned,” attorney Rus Rilee said after learning from the AP about Ball’s high-ranking job and post-retirement appointment to a state advisory group.State employment records show Ball began working at the youth center in 1974 as a dormitory assistant and became a dorm leader in 1983. He was head of the girls dormitory in 2000 when he told a reporter for the New Hampshire Union Leader that most of the residents there came from abusive homes.“A lot of the girls say this is the safest place they’ve been,” he told the newspaper at the time. “They don’t like it here. It’s very confining. But they don’t have to worry that someone is going to molest them at night.”A resume obtained by the AP lists Ball's title as chief of operations from 2001 to 2009 and describes him as responsible for overseeing all staff “including motivation and discipline” and “creating and maintaining a safe and secure environment for both staff and residents.” He then spent five years as a field administrator overseeing juvenile probation and parole offices before retiring in 2014.Within months, Ball joined the federally mandated State Advisory Group for Juvenile Justice.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806238,"Shelton, LMU rally, overcome blunder to beat St Mary's in OT","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Cam Shelton scored all of his career-high 31 points after halftime, enough to overcome him mistakenly taking a timeout late in overtime and lead Loyola Marymount past No. 15 Saint Mary's 78-74 Thursday night.

            Loyola Marymount (17-9, 7-5 West Coast Conference) had lost 21 straight to Saint Mary's and trailed 16-0 less than six minutes into this game.

            The Lions led 76-73 with 2.6 seconds left in the extra session before Shelton called a timeout when his team had none left. Alex Ducas made just one of the two technical foul shots, then Loyola Marymount’s Keli Leaupepe hit two free throws with one second remaining to seal it.











            “My heart sank for him; he tried to do the right thing,” Loyola Marymount head coach Stan Johnson said of Shelton's timeout. ""He came back and said, ‘Coach, I got you. Stay with me. We’re going to get this done.’ That was his mindset the whole way and good things happen when you think that way.”

            Shelton scored 24 of the Lions' final 31 points, including a tying layup with two seconds left in regulation. Alex Merkviladze added 15 points for Loyola Marymount, three weeks after it won at then-No. 6 Gonzaga.

            “The game usually takes care of itself and the numbers balance out,” said Shelton, who entered as the WCC's second-leading scorer at 19.3 points per game. “If I keep shooting, the numbers say I’m going to make some shots. I was due. Just continue to trust our system and let the game come to me. I didn’t want to force anything.” 

            Logan Johnson scored a career-high 31 points and Aidan Mahaney had 24 for Saint Mary’s (21-4, 10-1), which had won 12 in a row. The Gaels were coming off a win over then-No. 12 Gonzaga on Saturday.

            “You had a 16-0 start and then you're up five with a minute to go ... we didn't take care of business. We didn't finish the work,” Saint Mary's head coach Randy Bennett said. “We didn't play well enough. We didn't defend well enough. You have to keep things in perspective. It counts as one loss and Gonzaga counts as one win.”

            Loyola Marymount became the only team in WCC history to defeat Gonzaga, BYU and Saint Mary’s in the same season.

            Shelton converted a three-point play with 20.9 seconds remaining to pull Loyola Marymount within 60-58, and Justin Ahrens made a 3-pointer with 14 seconds left to cut the Lions’ deficit to 62-61. 

            After Shelton's tying layup, Mahaney just missed a last-second heave from beyond half court at the end of regulation.

            Quickly down by 16, the Lions roared back with a 20-4 run to tie it with 6:13 remaining in the first half.

            Saint Mary’s led 30-23 at halftime and continued to lead midway through the second half. Loyola Marymount grabbed a 43-42 advantage on a layup by Merkviladze.

            BIG PICTURE

            Saint Mary’s: The Gaels fell three victories short of matching the best conference start in program history at 13-0 in 2018. After playing at Portland, Saint Mary’s travels to San Diego next Thursday before a game at home against BYU on Feb. 18.

            Loyola Marymount: After playing at Santa Clara on Saturday, the Lions host No. 16 Gonzaga next Thursday in a game that will have the Bulldogs’ complete attention. Loyola Marymount ended Gonzaga’s run of 75 consecutive home victories and 93 consecutive victories over unranked teams with a 68-67 victory on Jan. 19.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806240,Joyous parades and parties kick off New Orleans' Mardi Gras,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — A venerable fine-dining fixture on Bourbon Street helped kick off the final frantic days of New Orleans Mardi Gras season Friday — relaxing its jackets-required dress code and briefly ditching its no-pets policy for a pair of crown- and cape-wearing rescue dogs.

            The tennis-ball-loving silver Labrador retrievers — named for Pete Sampras and Billie Jean King — chowed down on lamb chops at Galatoire's as they were declared king and queen of the Mystic Krewe of Barkus. The animal welfare organization founded 30 years ago took its name as a tongue-in-cheek tribute to the major Carnival krewe Bacchus. The annual Galatoire's gathering aids fund-raising efforts.

            “The impact this has on other homeless dogs, it just goes on and on,” Billie Jean's owner, Katherine Gelderman. 











            Outside, music was already blaring from some Bourbon Street bars as the city prepared for three major parades Friday evening on historic St. Charles Avenue. Other Friday night parades were scheduled in neighboring Metairie, and there will be more than two dozen other such processions almost nightly until Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, which this year falls on Feb. 21. 

            “If you think about the complex logistics, over multiple neighborhoods, multiple krewes, multiple law enforcement agencies — this is like Times Square on New Year's Eve for two weeks,” Kelly Schulz of New Orleans & Company, the city tourism industry's trade association, said during a city news conference Thursday.

            
                Complicating that effort has been a rise in crime and a shortage of police officers, which somewhat muted the celebration's comeback last year. Since parades in 2021 were canceled because of security concerns and the pandemic, some of the routes for the 2022 parades were trimmed. 

            This year, the original routes have been restored and the local police department is bolstered by a contingent of 125 state troopers and another 170 law enforcement personnel from other state and local police agencies to help keep order. By various estimates, the local police force has dwindled to about 900 members, which is hundreds fewer than what local experts say is needed.

            Mayor LaToya Cantrell and other city officials said they are confident safety can be maintained.

            Joe Bikulege — co-owner of Le Bon Temps Roule, a neighborhood bar and music club on Magazine Street — said that businesses and residents welcome the restored routes. “People get traditions and routines based around seeing certain parades,” he said in a recent interview. 

            “That's been taken away for three years,” he said.

            And, Schulz said, it appears tourists are planning to return in strong numbers. 

            “We are seeing strong hotel bookings so far,” Schulz said. “We are seeing a lot of pent-up demand for travelers to come back to New Orleans. For many this will be their first time, since before COVID, experiencing Mardi Gras.”

            Mardi Gras is the culmination of Carnival season — which officially begins each year on Jan. 6, the 12th day after Christmas, known as King's Day, in New Orleans and closes with the arrival of Lent on Ash Wednesday.

            New Orleans’ raucous celebration is the nation’s most well-known, but the holiday is also celebrated throughout much of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806241,Revived Trump probe puts Manhattan DA back in spotlight,"NEW YORK (AP) — When Alvin Bragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney last year, one of his first big decisions was to tap the brakes on an investigation that had been speeding toward a likely criminal case against former President Donald Trump.

            The move won him few friends. Exasperated liberals dreaming of Trump in handcuffs threw up their hands. Conservatives gloated that the Democrat's hesitation to bring a charge was proof Trump had been investigated for political reasons.

            A year later, Bragg is shaking up that first impression.











            Fresh from winning a conviction against Trump's family company for tax fraud, Bragg convened a new grand jury last week in a reinvigorated investigation that could lead to the first ever criminal charges against a former U.S. president.

            The probe, lately focused on hush money payments made to two women in 2016, is one of several legal challenges Trump faces as he seeks a return to the White House. It is putting Bragg back in the spotlight after a grueling first year in office.

            “We’re going to follow the facts and continue to do our job,” Bragg said, speaking broadly about the investigation in a recent interview with The Associated Press.

            Asked if charging Trump was a real possibility, or if the former president could rest easy, Bragg replied: “I’m not going to tell anyone how to rest.”

            Bragg came into office 13 months ago amid what he calls a “perfect storm” of rising crime and political pressure. A Harvard-educated former federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general and civil rights lawyer, he came equipped with legal and management credentials, but not much experience navigating New York City politics.

            He campaigned as a progressive reformer, but one with a strong record as a prosecutor, and won an eight-way party primary before soaring to victory with 83% of the vote in deep-blue Manhattan.

            Yet he got off to a rocky start. Shortly after taking office, he wrote a “Day One” memo for his staff that outlined his philosophy on prosecuting — or not prosecuting — certain crimes. Among other things, it said the district attorney would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes, including subway fare evasion and marijuana possession.

            Republicans, and some centrist Democrats, pounced.

            Bragg, they said, was soft on crime. New York’s police commissioner said Bragg’s intention not to prosecute some people accused of resisting arrest would invite violence against police officers.

            U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican running for governor, campaigned partly on a promise to remove the independently elected Bragg from office. He also featured Bragg in a campaign ad, even though Bragg wasn’t even on the ballot.

            The vitriol became so rancid — and sometimes racist — Bragg said his friends worried for his safety.

            But Bragg, an old-school lawyer, was hesitant to push back publicly, something he now regrets.

            “I’ve learned that the work doesn’t always speak for itself,” said Bragg, who's been appearing more on TV and giving interviews to outlets as varied as Teen Vogue and Manhattan's West Side Rag.

            He likened Zeldin's TV attack ad to an infamous “Willie Horton” commercial that aired in the 1980s in support of George H.W. Bush’s presidential campaign. That ad featured a Black prison inmate who committed violent crimes while on a weekend leave as part of a program authorized by Bush’s Democratic rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.

            “If someone wants to have substantive discussion, we can have that,” Bragg told the AP. “But if someone wants to put a Black face in an ad and have Willie Horton-type fears raised, we don’t have time for that.”

            While some types of crime increased in Manhattan during Bragg’s first year in office, the number of homicides and shootings actually dropped.

            Inside the district attorney's office, Bragg faced dissent over the direction of the Trump investigation — grievances that are being aired anew in a book by a former prosecutor.

            In 2021, Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., had authorized top deputies to seek an indictment on charges that Trump had exaggerated the worth of his assets in financial statements he gave to lenders. A grand jury had been collecting evidence. Vance retired before the case was finished, leaving the decision about whether to go forward to Bragg.

            Bragg decided not to proceed immediately, citing concerns about the strength of the case.

            The delay prompted two prosecutors leading the investigation to resign.

            One of them, Mark Pomerantz, has written about his disagreement with Bragg in a new book, “People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account."" In it, Pomerantz outlines his case for charging Trump and laments Bragg’s decision not to pursue an indictment.

            Bragg countered in a statement that, in his assessment, “Pomerantz’s plane wasn’t ready for takeoff.”

            Bragg also took issue with Pomerantz’s criticism of his prosecution team. “It is appalling that he insulted the skill and professionalism of our prosecutors,"" he said at an event this week. ""We have the most outstanding lawyers in the country working every day in the Manhattan DA's office to keep our city safe from the streets to the suites.”

            Lately, those lawyers have again been turning up the heat on Trump.

            On Dec. 6 they won a conviction against the Trump Organization for helping the company’s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and other executives avoid paying personal income taxes. The company got a $1.6 million fine. Weisselberg pleaded guilty and got jail time. He qualifies for release in April.

            And a new grand jury is hearing evidence related to payments made in 2016 to two women who alleged they had sexual encounters with Trump.

            Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has already served prison time in connection with those payments after pleading guilty to campaign finance crimes. He has said the Trump Organization reimbursed him for one of the payouts and rewarded him with extra pay disguised as reimbursement for legal services.

            Bragg declined to discuss the investigation in detail, but said prosecutors had paused certain aspects of the probe until the Trump Organization trial was finished. The verdict was a green light to get back to work.

            “The trial is sort of a strong demarcation line for us,” Bragg said.

            With that, the Manhattan investigation is suddenly back on the list of potential legal perils for Trump.

            In Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney is investigating Trump’s alleged interference in that state during the 2020 election. The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating Trump's storage of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida and the former president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

            Trump has lashed out at Bragg and Pomerantz on social media, calling the district attorney's investigation “fake,” “weak,” and “fatally flawed.”

            “THE BIGGEST PROBLEM THEY HAD WITH THE “CASE” IS THAT I DID NOTHING WRONG!” he said in one recent post.

            But now, a year later, Bragg and his team might have other thoughts.

            Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/.NEW YORK (AP) — When Alvin Bragg became Manhattan's first Black district attorney last year, one of his first big decisions was to tap the brakes on an investigation that had been speeding toward a likely criminal case against former President Donald Trump.The move won him few friends. Exasperated liberals dreaming of Trump in handcuffs threw up their hands. Conservatives gloated that the Democrat's hesitation to bring a charge was proof Trump had been investigated for political reasons.A year later, Bragg is shaking up that first impression.Fresh from winning a conviction against Trump's family company for tax fraud, Bragg convened a new grand jury last week in a reinvigorated investigation that could lead to the first ever criminal charges against a former U.S. president.The probe, lately focused on hush money payments made to two women in 2016, is one of several legal challenges Trump faces as he seeks a return to the White House. It is putting Bragg back in the spotlight after a grueling first year in office.“We’re going to follow the facts and continue to do our job,” Bragg said, speaking broadly about the investigation in a recent interview with The Associated Press.Asked if charging Trump was a real possibility, or if the former president could rest easy, Bragg replied: “I’m not going to tell anyone how to rest.”Bragg came into office 13 months ago amid what he calls a “perfect storm” of rising crime and political pressure. A Harvard-educated former federal prosecutor, chief deputy state attorney general and civil rights lawyer, he came equipped with legal and management credentials, but not much experience navigating New York City politics.He campaigned as a progressive reformer, but one with a strong record as a prosecutor, and won an eight-way party primary before soaring to victory with 83% of the vote in deep-blue Manhattan.Yet he got off to a rocky start. Shortly after taking office, he wrote a “Day One” memo for his staff that outlined his philosophy on prosecuting — or not prosecuting — certain crimes. Among other things, it said the district attorney would no longer prosecute some low-level misdemeanor crimes, including subway fare evasion and marijuana possession.Republicans, and some centrist Democrats, pounced.Bragg, they said, was soft on crime. New York’s police commissioner said Bragg’s intention not to prosecute some people accused of resisting arrest would invite violence against police officers.U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican running for governor, campaigned partly on a promise to remove the independently elected Bragg from office. He also featured Bragg in a campaign ad, even though Bragg wasn’t even on the ballot.The vitriol became so rancid — and sometimes racist — Bragg said his friends worried for his safety.But Bragg, an old-school lawyer, was hesitant to push back publicly, something he now regrets.“I’ve learned that the work doesn’t always speak for itself,” said Bragg, who's been appearing more on TV and giving interviews to outlets as varied as Teen Vogue and Manhattan's West Side Rag.He likened Zeldin's TV attack ad to an infamous “Willie Horton” commercial that aired in the 1980s in support of George H.W. Bush’s presidential campaign. That ad featured a Black prison inmate who committed violent crimes while on a weekend leave as part of a program authorized by Bush’s Democratic rival, former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.“If someone wants to have substantive discussion, we can have that,” Bragg told the AP. “But if someone wants to put a Black face in an ad and have Willie Horton-type fears raised, we don’t have time for that.”While some types of crime increased in Manhattan during Bragg’s first year in office, the number of homicides and shootings actually dropped.Inside the district attorney's office, Bragg faced dissent over the direction of the Trump investigation — grievances that are being aired anew in a book by a former prosecutor.In 2021, Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., had authorized top deputies to seek an indictment on charges that Trump had exaggerated the worth of his assets in financial statements he gave to lenders. A grand jury had been collecting evidence. Vance retired before the case was finished, leaving the decision about whether to go forward to Bragg.Bragg decided not to proceed immediately, citing concerns about the strength of the case.The delay prompted two prosecutors leading the investigation to resign.One of them, Mark Pomerantz, has written about his disagreement with Bragg in a new book, “People vs. Donald Trump: An Inside Account."" In it, Pomerantz outlines his case for charging Trump and laments Bragg’s decision not to pursue an indictment.Bragg countered in a statement that, in his assessment, “Pomerantz’s plane wasn’t ready for takeoff.”Bragg also took issue with Pomerantz’s criticism of his prosecution team. “It is appalling that he insulted the skill and professionalism of our prosecutors,"" he said at an event this week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806243,Mystery Yemen drone strike renews questions over US campaign,"SANAA, Yemen (AP) — Onlookers gathered around a small, four-door car coated in dried mud, peering through its shattered windows and torn-away roof at three dead men inside. 

            Tribal leaders identified the three — killed in late January near Yemen's central city of Marib — as suspected members of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, long considered one of the extremist group’s most dangerous branches. 

            They appear to have been killed in a rare drone strike by the U.S., using a weapon that's been deployed sparingly in the past, typically against high-value targets.











            The strike renews questions over the U.S. drone campaign in Yemen, now two decades old and just as secretive as ever despite promises from the Biden administration to put more rules in place to govern them. That secrecy, coupled with a years-long war ripping at Yemen, makes it even more difficult to determine and assess the reasons behind suspected American strikes. 

            The suspected al-Qaida members appear to have been killed by a Hellfire R9X, otherwise known as the “flying Ginsu” or “knife bomb,"" based on images of the wreckage analyzed by The Associated Press and weapons experts. The R9X, known only to be used by U.S. forces, has been used in other attacks attributed to America, including the Kabul airstrike last year that killed al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. 

            The men killed in the Jan. 30 strike were not prominent members of the extremist group. One was identified as a bomb-maker, with little else known about him.

            “The R9X is for high-value target killing and we don’t have any ’Who is this guy, why does he merit this now?'” said David Sterman, a senior policy analyst at the Washington-based think tank New America, which for years has tracked U.S. drone strikes in Yemen. “If it is a U.S. strike, it raises substantial questions about what is the state of the U.S. drone war in Yemen.” 

            The White House declined to answer questions about the apparent strike,

            U.S. Air Forces Central, which oversees the Middle East, said it didn't have any information that its forces carried out any strike in Marib. The CIA, which is believed to have conducted R9X strikes including the one that killed al-Zawahri, declined to comment. 

            The U.S. government has released few public details about the the R9X Hellfire, which comes from a class of anti-tank missile used across the U.S. military for two decades. Analysts say that instead of a standard explosive warhead, the R9X has six rotating blades that pop just before the missile hits a target. In theory, this helps direct the weapon at a specific person and prevents wider casualties.

            The scenes after attacks differ greatly, depending on the type of drone used.

            Drones carrying explosives would leave smoldering rubble or even a crater, depending on the size of the munition. In suspected R9X attacks, such as the 2017 strike that killed a deputy al-Qaida leader in Syria, the roofs of targeted cars are torn through with clean lines across a multitude of cuts, while the rest of the vehicle remains intact.

            This was also the case in the Jan. 30 strike, carried out in the Wadi Ubaydah area of Marib, some 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa. The capital has been held for years by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group which has been fighting against a Saudi-led military coalition for eight years.

            New America, as well as the London-based investigative organization Airwars, cited experts and local reporting in saying that they suspected an R9X strike. 

            “It has all the features of other CIA strikes we’ve seen in the past, but until there’s transparency, we can’t know for sure,” Airwars director Emily Tripp said. 

            Two local tribal leaders, speaking on condition of anonymity given the ongoing war and the presence of extremists in Marib, told the AP that those killed were AQAP members. Masked al-Qaida fighters surrounded the area after the strike, they said.

            The leaders identified one of the dead as Hassan al-Hadrami. The Houthis, through the state-run SABA news agency they control, had identified al-Hadrami in 2021 as one of several “specialized” explosives experts in the al-Qaida branch. The extremists have been planting roadside explosives. 

            However, al-Hadrami was otherwise unknown to veteran Yemen watchers.

            United Nations experts believe AQAP numbers a few thousand members supplemented by foreign fighters. Marib remains a stronghold for al-Qaida even though Saudi-backed allies of Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile are nominally in control of the city.

            AQAP claimed the 2019 shooting at Naval Air Station Pensacola that saw an aviation student from Saudi Arabia kill three people and wound two. However, it otherwise has been unsuccessful in striking the U.S. while seeing its militants targeted by drone strikes over the last two decades.

            The first drone strike of the post-9/11 world was carried out in Marib in 2002 under then-President George W. Bush, after a missile attack killed six people, including a U.S. citizen. Since then, every American president — Barack Obama, Donald Trump and now Joe Biden — has authorized drone strikes in the Arab world's poorest country. 

            Biden in 2022 issued new guidelines curtailing the use of armed drones outside of war zones, requiring presidential approval before a suspected terrorist is added to the U.S. government’s target list for potential lethal action. However, those documents remain classified — making judging the reasons behind suspected strikes that much more difficult. 

            “These cases are happening in very remote areas with a lack of information,” Tripp said. “It would be really good to know what the policy is and the rules are behind those engagements.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806251,"Russia hits targets across Ukraine with missiles, drones","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia used strategic bombers, cruise missiles and killer drones in a wave of attacks across Ukraine early Friday, while Moscow's military push that Kyiv says has been brewing for days appeared to pick up pace in eastern areas ahead of the one-year anniversary of its invasion.

            Russian forces have launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones since late Thursday, Ukraine’s military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said.

            Ukrainian forces downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones, he added.











            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has campaigned for more Western support against Russia's military ambitions, said: “This is terror that can and must be stopped.”

            Meanwhile, the Kremlin’s ground forces were focusing on Ukraine’s industrial east, especially the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the industrial Donbas region where recent fighting has been most intense, the Ukrainian military said. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces there since 2014.

            Kremlin is striving to secure areas it illegally annexed last September — the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions — and where it claims its rule is welcomed, according to Kyiv officials.

            Moscow’s goals have narrowed since it launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 2022, military analysts say. At that time, the capital, Kyiv, and the installation of a puppet government were among its targets, but numerous battlefield setbacks, including yielding Donbas areas it had initially captured, have embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin.

            The Kremin is currently concentrating its efforts on gaining full control of the Donbas, Kyiv claims, and is pushing at key points on several fronts, though Russian progress is reportedly slow.

            In the Donetsk region, local Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian military deployed additional troops and launched offensive operations. “There is a daily escalation and Russian attacks are becoming active throughout the region,” Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said.

            In Luhansk province, the Russian army is trying to punch through Ukrainian defenses, according to regional Gov. Serhii Haidai.

            “The situation is deteriorating, the enemy is constantly attacking, the Russians are bringing in a large amount of heavy equipment and aircraft,” Haidai said.

            There has been little change in battlefield positions for weeks amid freezing winter conditions.

            Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed head of the Donetsk region, said that Russian forces had secured positions on the southern outskirts of Vuhledar. He added that Ukraine has sent additional reinforcements to the city that slowed the Russian advance.

            Pushilin’s claim couldn’t be independently verified.

            Vuhledar is a strategically important town that sits next to a railway link crossing the region on the way to Crimea. Capturing the town is important for Russia to secure the safety of the railway connection to Crimea and advance its goal of seizing the entire Donetsk region.

            The cruise missiles aimed at Ukraine were launched by Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers and from Russian navy ships in the Black Sea, military chief Zaluzhnyi said, while the S-300 missiles were launched from the Belgorod region just inside Russia and the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region.

            Ukraine’s Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Moscow once again targeted the power supply in “another attempt to destroy the Ukrainian energy system and deprive Ukrainians of light, heat, water.” The International Atomic Energy Agency said two of Ukraine’s three operating nuclear power plants reduced power “due to renewed shelling of the country’s energy infrastructure.”

            The barrage was broad, also taking aim at the capital, Kyiv, and Lviv, near Ukraine's Western border with Poland. It also struck critical infrastructure in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city in the northeast. Seven people were wounded there, two of them seriously, regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov said.

            Air raid sirens sounded across much of the country.

            Also Friday, Moldova’s Ministry of Defense said that a missile was detected traversing its airspace near the border with Ukraine. Moldova’s foreign ministry said in a statement that the Russian ambassador in Chisinau has been summoned for talks over the “unacceptable violation”.

            The ministry said that the missile was detected in its airspace at around 10 a.m. and flew over two border villages before heading toward Ukraine.

            The spokesperson for Ukraine’s Air Forces, Yurii Ihnat, told The Associated Press that another missile crossed the airspace of Romania, a NATO member country. Romania’s defense ministry denied that, however, saying the closest the missile came to Romania’s airspace was approximately 35 kilometers (20 miles).

            High-voltage infrastructure facilities were hit in the eastern, western and southern regions, Ukraine’s energy company, Ukrenergo, said, resulting in power outages in some areas. It was the 14th round of massive strikes on the country’s power supply, the company said. The last one occurred on Jan. 26 as Moscow seeks to demoralize Ukrainians by leaving them without heat and water in the bitter winter.

            Zaporizhzhia City Council Secretary Anatolii Kurtiev said the city had been hit 17 times in one hour, which he said made it the most intense period of attacks since the beginning of the full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

            Ukraine’s Air Force shot down 10 Russian missiles over Kyiv, according to the Kyiv City Administration. The fragments of one missile damaged two cars, a house and electricity wires. No casualties were reported.

            The Ukraine Air Force said Russia launched S-300 anti-aircraft guided missiles on the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia provinces. Those missiles cannot be destroyed in mid-air by air defenses but they have a relatively short range so the Russians have used them for attacks on areas not far from Russian-controlled territory. 

            The Khmelnytskyi province in Western Ukraine was also attacked with Shahed drones, according to regional Gov. Serhii Hamalii.

            Russia has in the past used Iranian-made Shahed drones to strike at key Ukrainian infrastructure and sow fear among civilians, according to Western analysts. They are known as suicide drones because they nosedive into targets and explode on impact like a missile.

            Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraineKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia used strategic bombers, cruise missiles and killer drones in a wave of attacks across Ukraine early Friday, while Moscow's military push that Kyiv says has been brewing for days appeared to pick up pace in eastern areas ahead of the one-year anniversary of its invasion.Russian forces have launched 71 cruise missiles, 35 S-300 missiles and seven Shahed drones since late Thursday, Ukraine’s military chief, Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi said.Ukrainian forces downed 61 cruise missiles and five drones, he added.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has campaigned for more Western support against Russia's military ambitions, said: “This is terror that can and must be stopped.”Meanwhile, the Kremlin’s ground forces were focusing on Ukraine’s industrial east, especially the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces that make up the industrial Donbas region where recent fighting has been most intense, the Ukrainian military said. Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces there since 2014.Kremlin is striving to secure areas it illegally annexed last September — the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions — and where it claims its rule is welcomed, according to Kyiv officials.Moscow’s goals have narrowed since it launched its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24 2022, military analysts say. At that time, the capital, Kyiv, and the installation of a puppet government were among its targets, but numerous battlefield setbacks, including yielding Donbas areas it had initially captured, have embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin.The Kremin is currently concentrating its efforts on gaining full control of the Donbas, Kyiv claims, and is pushing at key points on several fronts, though Russian progress is reportedly slow.In the Donetsk region, local Ukrainian officials reported that the Russian military deployed additional troops and launched offensive operations. “There is a daily escalation and Russian attacks are becoming active throughout the region,” Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said.In Luhansk province, the Russian army is trying to punch through Ukrainian defenses, according to regional Gov. Serhii Haidai.“The situation is deteriorating, the enemy is constantly attacking, the Russians are bringing in a large amount of heavy equipment and aircraft,” Haidai said.There has been little change in battlefield positions for weeks amid freezing winter conditions.Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-appointed head of the Donetsk region, said that Russian forces had secured positions on the southern outskirts of Vuhledar.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806258,German businesses committed to Taiwan despite weak economic outlook,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — German businesses remain committed to staying in Taiwan, despite a relatively weak economic outlook for 2023.Alexander Hirschle, Taiwan and Philippines Asia-Pacific Director of Germany Trade & Invest, said Taiwan businesses should “fasten their seatbelts” for at least the first half of 2023, in contrast with strong growth results in 2022. Hirschle made the comments at the German Trade Office's (GTO) annual presentation of their economic outlook and business confidence survey, released on Thursday (Feb. 9).Hirschle said he predicts the Taiwan economy will experience a relative dip in growth in 2023, but long-term prospects remain healthy. Weak U.S. and Chinese demand for Taiwan’s exports, low consumer confidence, and Taiwan’s aging population will all impact Taiwan’s economic performance, he said.Hirschle said China is the “glimpse of hope” for the Taiwan economy in 2023, as an improvement in the Chinese economy would increase demand for Taiwan’s exports. “Economic activity seems to be picking up there, some GDP forecasts for China expect 6% GDP growth, double of last year,” he said.“The bottom line is that the stagnation of exports is quite probably and realistic, (but) maybe there might be small growth if China were to really pick up rapidly and the U.S. stabilized soon,” Hirschle said.He also said that there are positive signs coming out of the U.S., but that changes won’t come soon enough to influence Taiwan’s economic performance in 2023.“It seems clear that an easing of interest rates in the U.S. will happen at the end of the year, or in 2024, and this will be too late to influence the demand for exports made in Taiwan positively,” Hirschle said.Hirschle made his presentation following the results of the GTO survey, presented to a group of businesspeople and industry leaders by Executive Director of the GTO Axel Limberg on Thursday night. According to the survey, despite Hirschle’s somewhat gloomy prediction for 2023, German business confidence in Taiwan remains steady.Director of Taiwan and the Philippines Asia-Pacific Germany Trade & Invest Alexander Hirschle speaking at the release of the GTO 2023/2023 Business Confidence Survey on Thursday (Feb. 9). (German Trade Office in Taipei photo)Limberg said the vast majority of German companies operating in Taiwan are healthy and profitable, and that 2022 was a successful year for German businesses. “Even though 53.4% were negatively impacted during the pandemic, only a minor proportion of 5.6% damage. 20% were even able to benefit from Taiwan’s special economic conditions,” Limberg said.Limberg said that macroeconomic challenges such as disrupted supply chains caused German businesses’ revenues to decrease slightly, and had a negative impact on business sentiment. He said that this was not only true for Taiwan, but that supply chain issues affected the global economy.Limberg said that only 25% of German companies expect a further improvement of the economic situation in Taiwan. “This is a substantial change compared to last year when more than 60% of companies believed there would be an improvement,” he said.Despite this, the survey also showed that 97% of German companies currently doing business in Taiwan plan to stay, and 93% said they would start the year again.Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) attended the event for the third year running, and expressed her thanks to German businesses at a time of increasing cross-strait tensions. She commented that the industries of Taiwan and Germany are “highly complementary.”She added the Ministry of Economic Affairs has five priorities going forward. “My ministry will work hard to grow Taiwan’s economy … which includes enhancing global competitiveness of industry, supporting SMEs, and the service sector, strengthening our infrastructure, and promoting investment in Taiwan,” she said.She also said that investments from German companies, like semiconductor firm Merck’s mega site in Kaohsiung help Taiwan maintain its leading edge in the semiconductor industry.Merck Group Taiwan’s Managing Director John Lee also spoke at the event, and was more optimistic about the prospects for Taiwan’s economy. “We are hoping that (in the fourth quarter) there will be some kind of upswing,” Lee said.He also said that innovations in Taiwan’s two main products, semiconductors and screen technology, were helping to improve sustainability. He added his company is confident it can reduce a highly carbon emitting chemical used in the semiconductor manufacturing process by 90%. Also, innovations in areas such as electronically dimmable “smart windows” are helping Taiwan to reduce and use energy more efficiently.",2023/02/10,737,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806266,South Korea lifts visa restrictions on Chinese travelers,"South Korea has decided to resume issuing short-term visas to travelers from China after noting the improved COVID-19 situation in China.Following an anti-virus meeting on Friday, the government decided to normalize short-term visa applications at its consulates in China from Saturday.Testing requirements were maintained but officials said that those steps could later be relaxed depending on the developments of the virus.The move marks the end of a long COVID related restriction that had sparked tensions with Beijing.In December, China abruptly ended its stringent ""zero-COVID"" policy,  leading to a wave of infections.This raised the prospect of millions of Chinese travelers making their way abroad for the first time in three years.In January, while China battled a surge of COVID infection cases, Seoul stopped issuing most short-term visas.Beijing called the move ""discriminatory"" and retaliated by  halting short-term visas for South Korean travelers.This raised business concerns as South Korea depends heavily on exports to China.Seoul defended their curbs saying that the spread of the virus in China was creating concern aver the possible emergence of new variants.It also accused the Chinese authorities of not being transparent with their COVID data.South Korea's Vice Interior Minister Kim Sung-ho, who is in charge of disaster and safety management, said the move to lift restrictions came after the number of infections among Chinese arrivals dropped significantly.When the curbs were first introduced in January, 20% of Chinese travelers to South Korea had tested positive.Last week only 1.4% of Chinese travelers tested positive on arrival.Other restrictions, including testing requirements continue to remain in place.Travelers from China have to produce a negative test before departure and undergo a PCR test upon arrival in South Korea.Those who test positive are to stay quarantined for a week.ns/kb (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/02/10,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806272,Sharma’s 9th test hundred gives India advantage on Day 2,"NAGPUR, India (AP) — Rohit Sharma scored his first test century as India's captain to give his side the advantage over Australia on day two of the first test on Friday.

            Sharma’s 120 was his ninth test hundred overall as India reached 321-7 at stumps in its first innings. The hosts lead Australia by 144 runs after the visitors were bundled out for 177.

            Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel added 81 runs for the eighth wicket to further press home India’s advantage. Jadeja was unbeaten on 66 runs, while Patel was batting on 52 not out.











            Off-spinner Todd Murphy finished the day with 5-82 in his debut test.

            India went to lunch at 151-3 but Murphy dismissed Virat Kohli (12) off the first ball after the restart as he was caught behind. Nathan Lyon provided a helping hand and bowled Suryakumar Yadav for eight runs to put India on 168-5, before Sharma managed to rebuild the innings with Jadeja.

            The duo put on 61 runs off 130 balls, with Sharma reaching his hundred off 171 balls.

            India went past 200 in 70.1 overs, and went to the tea break at 226-5.

            Sharma then fell to the second ball after tea, bowled off Pat Cummins, having faced 212 deliveries and hit 15 fours and two sixes.

            Murphy then reached his five-wicket milestone by trapping debutant Srikar Bharat (8) lbw.

            Jadeja and Patel, however, defied the Australian bowling for the remainder of the final session with a stand that lasted 185 balls in total. Jadeja reached his half-century off 114 balls, while Patel got to 50 off 94 balls.

            The four-match series could determine which teams qualify for the World Test Championship final in June, with Australia and India currently in first and second spots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806294,Tubelis' double-double leads No. 4 Arizona past Cal 85-62,"BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — Azuolas Tubelis had 23 points, 14 rebounds and four steals to lead No. 4 Arizona to an 85-62 win over California on Thursday night.

            Tubelis, the conference’s player of the week, recorded his Pac-12-leading 11th double-double of the season. He also leads the conference in scoring and rebounding.

            “There’s no secret, Zu is one of the best players in the country,"" Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said. ""He’s having a first-team All-American type year.”











            Pelle Larsson added 16 points to help the Wildcats (22-3, 11-3 Pac-12) to their seventh win in a row and 13th straight over Cal. Oumar Ballo had 14 points and nine rebounds, and Cedric Henderson Jr. chipped in 11 and eight boards.

            “I thought Pelle and Ced played with tremendous energy and really impacted the game in a lot of areas,"" Lloyd said.

            Added Henderson: “We want to win a championship. That’s what our goal is. So we can’t ever come out and be lackluster against anybody.”

            Sam Alajiki scored 12 points to lead the Bears (3-21, 2-11), who dropped their eighth in a row. Lars Thiemann added 10 points and eight rebounds.

            Arizona started the game on an 18-3 run and built a 44-32 lead at the half. The Wildcats outrebounded Cal 46-30, including 15-5 on the offensive glass, resulting in a 27-3 edge in second-chance points.

            “We always want to get off to a good start,"" Lloyd said. “I want to enter those games throwing haymakers. We’re not trying to feel our way into these games. I was really happy that our guys came out and played with good effort and good energy early.”

            After missing their first seven field goal attempts, the Bears managed to break the 50-point barrier for the first time in five games.

            “I thought that we competed for significant segments in the game,” Cal coach Mark Fox said. “We just dug such a big hole.”

            Both teams struggled at the line, with Arizona going 6 of 17 and Cal making 5 of 10.

            BIG PICTURE

            Arizona: The Wildcats used their size and athleticism to control play against the last-place Bears. Although it was a road game, the Wildcats had a sizable contingent of fans in the crowd, with several “U of A!” chants audible throughout the game. “It’s actually amazing,” Henderson said. “I mean, you’re on the road. You’re at a place that’s not near home and you have just as many fans as the home team does sometimes, and it’s just like wow. It’s a different atmosphere. I love it.” ... Arizona improved to 19-0 when scoring at least 70 points and 20-0 when leading at halftime.

            California: The Bears lost their 21st game of the season, just four from setting a school record. Cal’s three wins this year are tied for the fewest in the country. ... Former Cal coach Lou Campanelli was honored with a moment of silence before the game. Campanelli died Jan. 31 at the age of 84. He coached the Bears from 1985-93, leading them to the NCAA Tournament in 1990.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806296,IMF delays $6B bailout for cash-strapped Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — The International Monetary Fund delayed a $6 billion bailout for cash-strapped Pakistan over its failure to meet the terms of a previous deal, officials said Friday, as the country struggled with a worsening economic crisis and a deadly wave of violence. 

            Pakistani officials said progress had been made toward reviving the bailout. A critical part of the loan, $1.1 billion, has been on hold since December as officials reviewed the country's compliance with a 2019 agreement.

            The stall reflects Pakistan's struggle for economic stability after summertime floods killed 1,739 people, destroyed 2 million homes and caused $30 billion in damage. The impoverished country also has been hit by a wave of violence, including a mosque bombing last month in Peshawar that killed 101 people. 











            Analysts say the revival of the IMF’s bailout will help Pakistan because a release of the next installment of loans could encourage other international financial institutions to help the Islamic nation.

            Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif blames his predecessor, Imran Khan, now the opposition leader, for violating the terms of the 2019 agreement. Khan was ousted through a no-confidence vote in the parliament in April. 

            Pakistan wants to avoid defaulting, but it's struggling under depleting foreign exchange reserves, which have fallen to below $3 billion. Analysts say that's enough only to pay for imports for the next two weeks.

            The IMF said in a statement that “virtual discussions will continue in the coming days"" to make progress on the deal.

            The fund has given new instructions to Pakistan to raise and collect taxes, as well as slash subsidies without burdening poor people, government officials said. 

            Sharif last week warned that Pakistan would have difficulty complying with the IMF’s conditions.

            On Friday, Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan will impose additional taxes of 170 billion rupees and slash subsidies to meet the deal's terms.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806297,"Japan's Honda boosts profit despite chips crunch, COVID","TOKYO (AP) — Honda reported a 27% jump in its October-December profit, despite headwinds like shortages of computer chips and rising costs of raw materials. 

            Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co.'s profit in the last quarter totaled 244.6 billion yen ($1.9 billion), up from 192.9 billion yen the year before. 

            Quarterly sales rose 20% to 4.4 trillion yen ($33.5 billion), as Honda sold more motorcycles around the world, compared to a year ago, while vehicle sales were little changed.











            By region, Honda sold more vehicles in Japan and the U.S., but sales declined in China and other parts of Asia. Motorcycle sales grew across all major markets, including Japan, North America and the rest of Asia, especially Indonesia, India and Vietnam. 

            Like other automakers, including Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp., Honda is stepping up in the push to offer more electric vehicles, as concerns grow about the environment and climate change. 

            The maker of the Accord sedan, Asimo robot and Gold Wing motorcycles has promised to launch 30 EV models globally by 2030. 

            Honda is promising a range of models, from tiny vans to muscular sportscars. It’s especially aggressive in model offerings in China, where Honda is a strong brand. 

            The company is also going electric in motorcycles, introducing such products in Europe and China before a global rollout. 

            Honda was hurt by the shortage of computer chips and by pandemic-related disruptions in China, Eiji Fujimura, who oversees accounting at Honda, told reporters.

            The war in Ukraine and other developments that have sent raw material costs and energy costs higher have also battered the bottom line of the world’s automakers.

            But Honda was helped by favorable currency fluctuations, expecting that to add 269 billion yen ($2 billion) to its operating profit for the full fiscal year through March. 

            A weak yen boosts the earnings of Japanese exporters like Honda when translating overseas revenue into yen. The U.S. dollar was trading at about 115 yen a year ago. It rose as high as 150 yen over the past year and is trading at about 130 yen lately. 

            Honda stuck to its full year profit forecast at 725 billion yen ($5.5 billion), an improvement from 707 billion profit the previous fiscal year. It lowered its vehicle sales forecast to 3.85 million vehicles from an earlier 4.1 million. Honda sold 4.07 million vehicles the previous fiscal year.

            Honda raised its motorcycles sales forecast for the fiscal year to 18.7 million, better than an earlier projection for 18.43 million motorcycles, and the 17 million motorcycles sold the previous fiscal year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806299,UK economy avoids decline but cost of living pains many,"LONDON (AP) — The small notice pinned to a wall at Union Chapel in north London is a sign of despair for charity workers dealing with the fallout from Britain’s cost-of-living crisis.

            The showers, it says, are reserved for the homeless. In other words, those who still have a roof over their heads but can’t afford to heat water for bathing are in essence asked to refrain.

            Amanuel Woldesus, who runs the Margins Project charity based at the church for people in crisis, is frustrated that he's being forced to ration a service this way.











            “We are the sixth-richest country in the world, and who is making these decisions? Me! Not the government,"" he said with a mixture of anger and incredulity. “It’s just completely wrong.’’

            The pressures are likely to get worse as Britain faces a prolonged economic slowdown triggered by soaring food and energy prices and compounded by tax increases and higher interest rates that authorities have unleashed as they battle the crisis.

            That gloomy outlook was underscored Friday when the Office for National Statistics said the British economy stagnated in the final three months of last year. Monthly estimates suggest that economic activity slowed further at the end of the year, with gross domestic product shrinking 0.5% in December.

            While Britain avoided a second consecutive quarter of declining economic output — one definition of a recession — the data offered little relief for hard-pressed families and businesses. The rising cost of living has driven months of strikes by nurses, ambulance workers, train drivers and other public-sector employees seeking higher pay.

            Middle-class families will see their disposable incomes fall by as much as 13%, or 4,000 pounds ($4,840), over the next financial year, according to analysis by the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. About 25% of households won’t be able to pay their food and energy bills out of their take-home income, up from 20% last year, the independent think tank estimates.

            “The U.K. will likely avoid a protracted recession in 2023, but GDP growth is set to remain close to zero,” the institute said. “However, with the cost-of-living crisis having a lasting effect on households, for at least 7 million it will certainly feel like a recession.”

            For people across the U.K., that means turning down the heat and skipping showers to save money on gas and electricity bills after energy prices soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 

            It also means constantly hunting for bargains or resorting to food banks after food prices jumped 16.9% last year.

            Carlton Peters, 57, a chef for the Margins Project’s twice-a-week free lunch program, said he now buys all of his own food in the reduced-price section of the supermarket and has cut out butter because it is too expensive. 

            The government isn’t doing enough to address the crisis because politicians don’t understand what average people are going through, Peters said.

            “They don’t know what it’s like to live with your fixed income and you have to spend it and shuffle it around with all your bits and pieces,” he said. “And when something goes up, they don’t complain. We complain. We say the price of milk has gone up by 20% and eggs 40%. That can’t be right.”

            The government says its policies, including a cap on gas and electricity prices that is designed to limit average household energy bills to 2,500 pounds ($3,027) a year, have reduced the severity of Britain’s economic downturn. 

            While a recession is often defined as an extended period of economic decline, experts disagree on exactly how to determine when a recession begins. 

            The U.S. and European Union have independent bodies that look at a wide range of indicators, including unemployment, consumer and business spending, before deciding whether their economies are in recession. Britain does not.

            That left commentators anxiously awaiting the fourth-quarter report to see whether Britain had met the technical definition of a recession, often described as two consecutive quarters of declining output. The U.K. economy shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter.

            On Friday, Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt focused on the fact that GDP expanded 4% for all of 2022, more than any other Group of Seven advanced economy. But that growth occurred in the early part of the year, before inflation spiked.

            “The fact that the U.K. was the fastest-growing economy in the G-7 last year, as well as avoiding a recession, shows our economy is more resilient than many people feared,” he said. “However, we are not out the woods yet, particularly when it comes to inflation.""

            Regardless of the technicalities, the global economic slowdown is hitting Britain harder than other major economies.

            Inflation in the U.K. remains at levels last seen in the early 1980s. Consumer prices rose 10.5% in December from a year earlier after peaking at 11.1% in October. By contrast, U.S. inflation slowed to 6.5% in December.

            Britain also is facing a drop in trade with the European Union as a result of its departure from the bloc and increasing taxes for consumers and businesses as the government tries to balance the budget and reduce debt.

            More troubling for economic forecasters is an increase in the number of people aged 50 to 65 who are leaving the workforce prematurely, reducing productivity.

            All of that is reducing consumer spending and business investment. 

            Britain’s economy is likely to shrink 0.6% this year, the only advanced nation expected to decline, the International Monetary Fund said last month. 

            The Bank of England expects the slowdown to last throughout 2024, even though it says the recession will be shallower than previously forecast. The central bank has raised interest rates 10 times since December 2021 in an effort to slow inflation.

            At Union Chapel, it pains Woldesus to watch the struggle of families unfold before him every day. The free meals he serves on Mondays and Wednesdays may be the only real food his guests get each week.

            “The situation is so dire,'' he said. “I can see it moving in front of me.''LONDON (AP) — The small notice pinned to a wall at Union Chapel in north London is a sign of despair for charity workers dealing with the fallout from Britain’s cost-of-living crisis.The showers, it says, are reserved for the homeless.

About 25% of households won’t be able to pay their food and energy bills out of their take-home income, up from 20% last year, the independent think tank estimates.“The U.K. will likely avoid a protracted recession in 2023, but GDP growth is set to remain close to zero,” the institute said. “However, with the cost-of-living crisis having a lasting effect on households, for at least 7 million it will certainly feel like a recession.”For people across the U.K., that means turning down the heat and skipping showers to save money on gas and electricity bills after energy prices soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.It also means constantly hunting for bargains or resorting to food banks after food prices jumped 16.9% last year.Carlton Peters, 57, a chef for the Margins Project’s twice-a-week free lunch program, said he now buys all of his own food in the reduced-price section of the supermarket and has cut out butter because it is too expensive.The government isn’t doing enough to address the crisis because politicians don’t understand what average people are going through, Peters said.“They don’t know what it’s like to live with your fixed income and you have to spend it and shuffle it around with all your bits and pieces,” he said. “And when something goes up, they don’t complain. We complain. We say the price of milk has gone up by 20% and eggs 40%. That can’t be right.”The government says its policies, including a cap on gas and electricity prices that is designed to limit average household energy bills to 2,500 pounds ($3,027) a year, have reduced the severity of Britain’s economic downturn.While a recession is often defined as an extended period of economic decline, experts disagree on exactly how to determine when a recession begins.The U.S. and European Union have independent bodies that look at a wide range of indicators, including unemployment, consumer and business spending, before deciding whether their economies are in recession. Britain does not.That left commentators anxiously awaiting the fourth-quarter report to see whether Britain had met the technical definition of a recession, often described as two consecutive quarters of declining output. The U.K. economy shrank by 0.2% in the third quarter.On Friday, Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt focused on the fact that GDP expanded 4% for all of 2022, more than any other Group of Seven advanced economy. But that growth occurred in the early part of the year, before inflation spiked.“The fact that the U.K. was the fastest-growing economy in the G-7 last year, as well as avoiding a recession, shows our economy is more resilient than many people feared,” he said. “However, we are not out the woods yet, particularly when it comes to inflation.""Regardless of the technicalities, the global economic slowdown is hitting Britain harder than other major economies.Inflation in the U.K. remains at levels last seen in the early 1980s. Consumer prices rose 10.5% in December from a year earlier after peaking at 11.1% in October. By contrast, U.S. inflation slowed to 6.5% in December.Britain also is facing a drop in trade with the European Union as a result of its departure from the bloc and increasing taxes for consumers and businesses as the government tries to balance the budget and reduce debt.More troubling for economic forecasters is an increase in the number of people aged 50 to 65 who are leaving the workforce prematurely, reducing productivity.All of that is reducing consumer spending and business investment.Britain’s economy is likely to shrink 0.6% this year, the only advanced nation expected to decline, the International Monetary Fund said last month.The Bank of England expects the slowdown to last throughout 2024, even though it says the recession will be shallower than previously forecast. The central bank has raised interest rates 10 times since December 2021 in an effort to slow inflation.At Union Chapel, it pains Woldesus to watch the struggle of families unfold before him every day.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806300,Dance like a Rockette: College students take unique class,"BOSTON (AP) — Rhapsody Stiggers has been dancing since she was 2, but the 20-year-old college junior has never taken a dance class quite as challenging as the one she's in now.

            She is one of 38 students at the Boston Conservatory at Berklee enrolled in the first for-credit college dance class taught by the Radio City Rockettes, the precision dance team famous for its annual high-kicking “Christmas Spectacular,"" seen by more than 69 million people since 1933.

            The class, taught by a current Rockette, focuses on their meticulously precise technique, based on tap, ballet and jazz, in which the dancers move and kick in perfect synchronicity. The course also teaches strength training, choreography and lessons that can be applied to pretty much any dance genre.











            “What’s unique about this class is the level of technicality,"" said Stiggers, originally from St. Paul, Minnesota. She said she's skilled in ballet, modern, jazz, salsa, West African and improvisation, but “no other style of dance really emphasizes the precision of every single body part.""

            ""Like the Rockettes, we have to know exactly where our eye is, or where they’re pointing, or where the fingers are pointing, or how extended they are. So in that sense it is more difficult than other styles that I have done in the past,"" she said.

            It's one of the most popular dance classes this semester at the performing arts school founded in 1867. Slots filled up fast and though enrollment was originally capped at 30, there were 38 students ultimately allowed in, said Mila Thigpen, chair of dance at the conservatory.

            Their instructor is Amarisa LeBar, who has been a Rockette for about five years. LeBar, 25, of Iselin, New Jersey, started teaching at her mother's dance studio at 16, but finds sharing the Rockettes' style with college students definitely more intense.

            “Teaching on a Rockette level is completely different and is a lot more difficult to do because we really tune into the perfection of our movement,” LeBar said.

            The students also get a sense of the teamwork Rockettes develop while rehearsing six hours per day, six days a week.

            “So to be a Rockette, first off you have to have a love of wanting to work together as a team,"" said Julie Branam, director and choreographer of the “Christmas Spectacular.” She started as a dancer 36 years ago.

            “Sometimes it can be very tedious,"" Branam said. ""We’re checking what 36 people do in that line over and over again, to say ‘Is you're head at the same angle? Is you arm at the same height?' So it’s the willingness of wanting to work as one to make the effort of the 36 look beautiful.”

            The college-level class is an extension of the Rockettes' dancer development program, which includes invitation-only summer training for promising dancers. The partnership is a natural, Thigpen said.

            “We have very similar core values,"" she said. “Both the Rockettes and the Boston Conservatory at Berklee have a very long history, and as much as we have to celebrate in our history, we also are both thinking about how we evolve and push both dance education and the profession of dance.""

            Stiggers has been so inspired that she may audition for the Rockettes someday.

            “It’s a just fun thing to strive for,"" she said. “If I don’t apply or get in, it’s still useful knowledge that I've learned that can carry on into the rest of my career.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806301,Wall Street’s tough week eases at the end as stocks drift,"NEW YORK (AP) — The toughest week for Wall Street in nearly two months came to a quiet end on Friday, as stock indexes drifted to a mixed finish. 

            The S&P 500 rose 0.2%, but it still ended the week with a drop of 1.1%, which was its worst since December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 169 points, or 0.5%, while the Nasdaq composite fell 0.6%. 

            Stocks have been struggling since rallying in January on hopes that the economy could avoid a severe recession and that cooling inflation could get the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates. Worries have worsened recently that a still-strong jobs market could push upward on inflation and keep rates at a higher-for-longer level, much as the Fed has been warning.











            Higher rates can drive down inflation, but they also raise the risk of a recession and drag down investment prices. And central banks around the world are intent on tightening the screws by raising rates further, even if at a slower pace than before.

            “For most central banks the risk is that they have tightened too little, not too much,” economists led by Ethan Harris wrote in a BofA Global Research report.

            “The ultimate gauge of success here is not avoiding a recession, but getting inflation on a path back to target,” Harris wrote.

            Investors will get more updates on inflation next week when the government gives its latest monthly updates on prices at both the wholesale and consumer levels.

            The worries about rates mean much of Wall Street’s action has been in the bond market, where yields have climbed on expectations for a firmer Fed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.73% from 3.66% late Thursday. 

            The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.50% from 4.48%. It was at 4.08% just over a week ago and is near its highest level since November.

            Companies in recent weeks have also been delivering a mixed set of earnings reports for the end of 2022. 

            Lyft tumbled 36.4% following its latest report. The ride-hailing company gave a forecast for revenue in the first three months of 2023 that fell short of analysts’ expectations.

            Given worries about still-high inflation and a slowing economy eating into corporate profits, analysts have been cutting their forecasts for upcoming earnings for companies. So far this year, analysts have cut their expectations for S&P 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings by 4.5%, according to strategists at Credit Suisse. That’s a deeper cut than average. 

            News Corp. fell 9.4% after the owner of The Wall Street Journal and other media reported weaker quarterly results than expected. It also said it will cut 5% of its workforce in 2023 as it contends with higher interest rates and inflation. 

            Expedia lost 8.6% after reporting weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected.

            On the winning side of Wall Street were energy stocks, which rose with the price of crude oil. Valero Energy gained 6.1%, and Marathon Oil climbed 6.2%. 

            Oil prices rose after Russia said it will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day next month. Western countries had capped the price of Russia's crude over its invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude, the international standard, rose $1.89 to $86.39 per barrel. 

            Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.66 to $79.72 per barrel. 

            Sharp rises in energy prices are one of the two big risks that Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, sees ahead for the market. That would send inflation higher and push the Fed to raise rates even higher than the forecasts Wall Street has just recalibrated to this past week. 

            The other big risk he sees is if growth in workers' wages stays too high, which the Fed could also see as pushing upward on inflation and potentially causing a reacceleration. 

            “The Fed is more concerned with inflation staying down,” Ma said. “The market just wants it to come down. Once it comes down, the narrative is going to change: Will it stay down and allow the Fed to make a ‘dovish pivot’"" by talking about rate cuts “or will it reaccelerate and cause the Fed to be on a longer-term inflation fighting mission?”

            In the meantime, he said, “The best we can hope for is the Fed not raising rates too high and just being patient, letting them remain at that level for a while to see how things play out.”

            All told, the S&P 500 rose 8.96 points to 4,090.46 Friday. The Dow gained 169.39 to 33,869.27, while the Nasdaq fell 71.46 to 11,718.12.

It comprised 36 people and arrived in Taiwan the day after the quake.This marked a budding bond between the two countries, which has developed and continued until this day.Turkish rescuers were some of the first to arrive in Taiwan following the major earthquake in September 1999. (CNA image)On Monday (Feb. 6), after several strong earthquakes struck Turkey, Taiwan’s National Fire Agency immediately made preparations to send a search and rescue team. That evening, the first search and rescue team consisting of 40 people and three dogs boarded a flight bound for Turkey.On Tuesday (Feb. 7), Taiwan sent a second team of 90 rescuers and two dogs. Turkish media A Haber reported that Taiwan’s search and rescue team arrived with the message, “We are here as a thank you for 1999.”Taiwan dispatched a first team of 40 rescuers to Turkey hours after the earthquakes struck. (National Fire Agency photo)As of 2 p.m. on Friday (Feb. 10), the Taiwan rescue team had saved two people from the rubble.In addition to sending rescuers, members of the public in Taiwan donated NT$83.53 million (US$2.76 million) to the relief aid drive started  by the Ministry of Health and Welfare within two days. The fundraising program will continue until at least March 6, according to an earlier report.NPresident Tsai Ing-wen (second from right) gets updates from Taiwan rescue team leader Huang Po-tsun.

We rushed to help … We learned search and rescue thanks to Turkish teams,” he said.A Taiwanese rescuer in Turkey told a TR Haber reporter during an interview at a search and rescue base that people in Taiwan still remember the help they received from Turkey, which is why they want to give back. The video was posted to Twitter with an introduction that read, “Taiwan is one of the countries rushing to help Turkey. The team's arrival in Turkey is actually a 24-year-old story of loyalty.”ÖZEL| Türkiye’ye yardıma koşan ülkelerden biri Tayvan. Ekibin Türkiye’ye geliş öyküsü aslında 24 yıllık bir vefa öyküsü.

            PHOENIX (AP) — Patrick Mahomes won the voting for the AP NFL Most Valuable Player award. 

            Mahomes, who also won in 2018, easily outdistanced Jalen Hurts, receiving 48 of 50 first-place votes from a nationwide panel of media members who regularly cover the league. Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) face Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles (16-3) in the Super Bowl on Sunday.











            Brian Daboll won AP Coach of the Year after leading the New York Giants to their first playoff appearance in six years. Daboll received 16 first-place votes and 123 total points to outpace 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan, who got 12 votes for first and 100 points. 

            Other awards announced: DeMeco Ryans, who spent the past two seasons as the defensive coordinator of the 49ers, was named AP Assistant Coach of the Year. He's now the head coach of the Texans. Nick Bosa won the AP Defensive Player of the Year award. Jets cornerback Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner won the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year award, and teammate and wide receiver Garrett Wilson won the AP Offensive Rookie of the year award. 

            Minnesota wide receiver Justin Jefferson ran away with the AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Seattle quarterback Geno Smith was the AP Comeback Player of the Year. Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott was the Walter Payton Man of the Year.

            PHOENIX (AP) — Cleveland Browns six-time All-Pro offensive lineman Joe Thomas joined New York Jets lockdown cornerback Darrelle Revis as inductees into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on their first try. 

            Thomas and Revis joined a new class of Hall of Famers that also includes return finalists DeMarcus Ware, Zach Thomas and Ronde Barber. Senior candidates Joe Klecko, Chuck Howley and Ken Riley, along with coaching candidate Don Coryell also got voted into the Hall and will be inducted in Canton, Ohio, this summer.

            PHOENIX (AP) — The first responders who saved Damar Hamlin’s life were recognized with a tribute video at “NFL Honors” before being invited onto the stage. The man they saved was right behind them.

            Hamlin made his second appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week Thursday night, paying tribute to those who had a hand in giving him a second chance at life.

            The Buffalo Bills safety received the NFLPA’s Alan Page Community Award on Wednesday, a little more than a month after Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.

            BALTIMORE (AP) — Ten retired NFL players are accusing the league of lies, bad faith and flagrant violations of federal law in denying disability benefits in a potential class-action lawsuit filed in Baltimore.

            The men said they left the game with lingering physical or cognitive injuries that make their daily lives difficult if not excruciating. They also said they are not alone. The new lawsuit was filed in federal court in Baltimore, and names as defendants both NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL’s Disability Board. The suit comes as league officials gather in Phoenix for the Super Bowl on Sunday. 

            Willis McGahee, Eric Smith, Jason Alford, Daniel Loper, Michael McKenzie, Jamize Olaware, Alex Parsons, Charles Sims, Joey Thomas and Lance Zeno were the players in the lawsuit.

            JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre filed lawsuits in Mississippi, accusing the state auditor and two national sportscasters of defaming him in public discussions about the misspending of welfare money that was supposed to help some of the poorest people in one of the poorest states in the nation.

            The lawsuit against Auditor Shad White says the Republican “has carried out an outrageous media campaign of malicious and false accusations against Brett Favre — the Hall of Fame quarterback and native son of Mississippi — in a brazen attempt to leverage the media attention generated by Favre’s celebrity to further his own political career.” 

            In a separate lawsuit against former NFL player Shannon Sharpe, Favre said Sharpe made “egregiously false” statements about him on the Fox Sports talk show “Skip and Shannon: Undisputed,” including that Favre “stole money from people that really needed money.” And in another lawsuit against retired NFL player Pat McAfee, Favre said McAfee had used “outrageous falsehoods” that included calling Favre a “thief” who was “stealing from poor people in Mississippi.”

            PRO BASKETBALL

            First it was Kyrie Irving to Dallas. Then came Kevin Durant to Phoenix. The breakup in Brooklyn is rebuilding some contenders in the West.

            Trade deadline day in the NBA featured plenty of moves, with the Suns making the biggest as they chase the first championship in franchise history. They acquired Durant by sending Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson, first-round picks in 2023, 2025, 2027 and 2029, and a first-round pick swap in 2028 to the Nets, who also sent T.J. Warren back to his original team in Phoenix.

            Jae Crowder, who didn’t play this season in Phoenix, was moved to Milwaukee in the four-team trade. The Bucks sent Jordan Nwora, George Hill, Serge Ibaka and three future second-round picks to the Indiana Pacers.

            A day earlier, the Lakers agreed to send Russell Westbrook to Utah as part of a three-way deal including Minnesota that brought D’Angelo Russell back to Los Angeles.

            Trying to stay in it, defending champion Golden State reacquired Gary Payton II but dealt 2020 No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman in a four-team trade with Detroit, Portland and Atlanta.

            COLLEGE FOOTBALL

            AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas and Oklahoma are heading to the Southeastern Conference in 2024, a year earlier than originally planned, after Big 12 officials cleared the way for the storied programs to exit their league.

            Texas and Oklahoma will leave behind the $50 million each school would have received over the next two seasons under the Big 12′s media contracts. Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormak said the league would only agree to an early departure “if it was in our best interest.”

            BYU, Central Florida, Cincinnati and Houston are joining the Big 12 prior to the 2023 football season, giving the league a temporary membership of 14 schools. The agreement must still be approved the Texas and Oklahoma boards of regents, but that is considered a formality.

            BASEBALL

            PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — About $1 billion of Major League Baseball’s revenue is at risk if a cable television company fails to make payments for local broadcasting rights to 14 teams, and the sport is preparing to take over telecasts.

            “I think you should assume that if Diamond doesn’t broadcast, we’ll be in a position to step in,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday after an owners’ meeting. “Our goal would be to make games available not only within the traditional cable bundle but on the digital side, as well.”

            Sinclair acquired 21 regional sports networks in 2019 from The Walt Disney Co., which had taken them over as part of its purchase of 21st Century Fox. Sinclair also holds rights to 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL franchises, and teams fear in an era of cord-cutting they may not get payments from Diamond Sports Group, the Sinclair Broadcast Group subsidiary operating the networks under the name Bally Sports.

            On other major topic, Manfred said he views the Athletics’ search for a new ballpark as “Oakland and/or Las Vegas.”

            GOLF

            The U.S. Open has added the NCAA champion and Latin America Amateur champions to the list of exempt players, along with making slight tweaks to categories for players who don’t have to qualify.

            Some of the changes were due to golf coming fully out of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for qualifying to be held in England and Japan for international players. The U.S. Open is June 15-18 at Los Angeles Country Club.

            Players who have signed on with Saudi-funded LIV Golf are still exempt from qualifying, which was expected.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806323,Turkey's lax policing of building codes known before quake,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey has for years tempted fate by not enforcing modern construction codes while allowing — and in some cases, encouraging — a real estate boom in earthquake-prone areas, experts say.

            The lax enforcement, which experts in geology and engineering have long warned about, is gaining renewed scrutiny in the aftermath of this week's devastating earthquakes, which flattened thousands of buildings and killed more than 23,000 people across Turkey and Syria.

            “This is a disaster caused by shoddy construction, not by an earthquake,” said David Alexander, a professor of emergency planning at University College London.











            It is common knowledge that many buildings in the areas pummeled by this week’s two massive earthquakes were built with inferior materials and methods, and often did not comply with government standards, said Eyup Muhcu, president of the Chamber of Architects of Turkey. 

            He said that includes many old buildings, but also apartments erected in recent years — nearly two decades after the country brought its building codes up to modern standards. “The building stock in the area was weak and not sturdy, despite the reality of earthquakes,” Muhcu said.

            The problem was largely ignored, experts said, because addressing it would be expensive, unpopular and restrain a key engine of the country's economic growth.

            To be sure, the back-to-back earthquakes that demolished or damaged at least 12,000 buildings were extremely powerful — their force magnified by the fact that they occurred at shallow depths. The first 7.8 magnitude quake occurred at 4:17 a.m., making it even more difficult for people to escape their buildings as the earth shook violently. And President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has acknowledged “shortcomings” in the country's response.

            But experts said there is a mountain of evidence — and rubble — pointing to a harsh reality about what made the quakes so deadly: Even though Turkey has, on paper, construction codes that meet current earthquake-engineering standards, they are too rarely enforced, explaining why thousands of buildings crumbled.

            In a country crisscrossed by geological fault lines, people are on edge about when and where the next earthquake might hit — particularly in Istanbul, a city of more than 15 million that is vulnerable to quakes.

            Since the disaster, Erdogan's minister of justice said it will investigate the destroyed buildings. “Those who have been negligent, at fault and responsible for the destruction following the earthquake will answer to justice,” Bekir Bozdag said Thursday.

            But several experts said any serious investigation into the root of weak enforcement of building codes must include a hard look at the policies of Erdogan, as well as regional and local officials, who oversaw — and promoted — a construction boom that helped drive economic growth.

            Shortly before Turkey's last presidential and parliamentary election in 2018, the government unveiled a sweeping program to grant amnesty to companies and individuals responsible for certain violations of the country's building codes. By paying a fine, violators could avoid having to bring their buildings up to code. Such amnesties have been used by previous governments ahead of elections as well. 

            As part of that amnesty program, the government agency responsible for enforcing building codes acknowledged that more than half of all buildings in Turkey — accounting for some 13 million apartments— were not in compliance with current standards.

            The types of violations cited in that report by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization were wide-ranging, including homes built without permits, buildings that added extra floors or expanded balconies without authorization, and the existence of so-called squatter homes inhabited by low-income families.

            The report did not specify how many buildings were in violation of codes related to earthquake-proofing or basic structural integrity, but the reality was clear.

            “Construction amnesty doesn’t mean the building is sturdy,” the current head of the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization, Murat Kurum, said in 2019. 

            In 2021, the Chamber of Geological Engineers of Turkey published a series of reports raising red flags about existing buildings and new construction taking place in areas leveled by this week's quakes, including Kahramanmaras, Hatay and Osmaniye. The Chamber urged the government to conduct studies to ensure that buildings were up to code and built on safe locations.

            A year earlier, the Chamber issued a report that directly called out policies of “slum amnesty, construction amnesty” as dangerous and warned that “indifference to disaster safety culture"" would lead to preventable deaths.

            Since 1999, when two powerful earthquakes hit northwest Turkey, near Istanbul — the stronger one killing some 18,000 people — building codes have been tightened and a process of urban renewal has been underway.

            But the upgrades aren't happening fast enough, especially in poorer cities.

            Builders commonly use lower quality materials, hire fewer professionals to oversee projects and don't adhere to various regulations as a way of keeping costs down, according to Muhcu, president of the country's Chamber of Architects.

            He said the Turkish government’s so-called “construction peace” introduced before the 2018 general elections as a way to secure votes has, in effect, legalized unsafe buildings. 

            “We are paying for it with thousands of deaths, the destruction of thousands of buildings, economic losses,” Muhcu said.

            Even new apartment buildings advertised as safe were ravaged by the quake. 

            In Hatay province, where casualties were highest and an airport runway and two public hospitals were destroyed, survivor Bestami Coskuner said he saw many new buildings, even “flashy” new ones had collapsed. 

            In Antakya, a historic city in Hatay, a 12-story building with 250 units that was completed in 2012 or 2013 collapsed, leaving an untold number dead, or still trapped alive. The Ronesans Rezidans was considered one of the “luxury” buildings in the area and was advertised as “a life project that is high quality” on Facebook with a pool, gym, beauty center and security. 

            On Friday, a contractor who oversaw the construction of that building was detained at Istanbul Airport before boarding a flight out of the country, Turkey’s official Anadolu news agency reported.

            Another destroyed building in Antakya is the Guclu Bahce, which began construction in 2017 and opened with much fanfare in 2019 in a ceremony attended by Hatay’s mayor and other local officials, according to fact-checking website Dogrulukpayi. 

            In Malatya, the brand-new Asur apartments — billed as earthquake-proof in advertisements — sustained damage in the first quake, but residents escaped unharmed. Some residents who returned to the building to collect belongings managed a second lucky escape when the second strong temblor hit, causing the building to slide toward one side, according to video shown on TikTok and verified by fact-checking website Teyit. 

            The devastation across Turkey comes at a sensitive time for President Erdogan, who faces tough parliamentary and presidential elections in May amid an economic downturn and high inflation. 

            Erdogan regularly touts the country's construction boom over the past two decades, including new airports, roads, bridges and hospitals, as proof of his success during more than two decades in power.

            On his tour of the devastation Wednesday and Thursday, Erdogan pledged to rebuild destroyed homes within the year.

            “We know how to do this business,"" he said. “We are a government that has proved itself on these issues. We will.”

            “(China) firmly supports Cambodia in safeguarding national sovereignty and security, firmly supports Cambodia in steadily advancing major domestic political agendas and economic and social development, and resolutely opposes external forces interfering in Cambodia’s internal affairs,"" Xi was quoted as telling Hun Sen by China's official Xinhua News Agency.

            China will also encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Cambodia, help in the construction of the Sihanoukville economic zone in Cambodia's southwest on the Gulf of Thailand, and support building transportation infrastructure, Xi said.











            Hun Sen was quoted as thanking China for providing COVID-19 vaccines and said Cambodia “firmly supports China in safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests"" and “firmly opposes any external forces interfering in China’s internal affairs on issues related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet.""

            Cambodia is a key Chinese diplomatic partner, helping dampen criticism of Beijing within the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, several of whose members are engaged in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.

            The meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guest House comes in the middle of Hun Sen’s three-day visit. He was to meet later with outgoing Premier Li Keqiang, after which the leaders were to oversee the signing of a raft of agreements.

            Hun Sen took power in 1985 and with strong Chinese backing has eliminated all democratic threats to his rule, muzzling the press and locking up or exiling opponents and critics. 

            In return, China has gained an outsized role in Cambodian politics and the economy, as seen in the numerous Chinese-funded projects, hotels and casinos dotting the landscape.

            China's state banks have also financed airports, roads and other infrastructure built with Chinese loans. More than 40% of Cambodia’s $10 billion in foreign debt is owed to China, although Cambodia has not asked Beijing to restructure that burden, unlike other countries such as Sri Lanka, Zambia and Ethiopia, which have taken out massive Chinese loans.

            Despite its small size, Cambodia has become an important partner for China, which was the top backer of the communist Khmer Rouge regime in the 1970s whose radical policies are blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million people.

            In June, China and Cambodia broke ground on a naval port expansion project that has raised concerns from the U.S. and others that it could give Beijing a strategically important military outpost on the Gulf of Thailand.

            Hun Sen in 2019 reportedly granted China the right to set up a military base at the Ream Naval Base. He has long denied that, saying Cambodia’s Constitution prohibits foreign military facilities.BEIJING (AP) — Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen received multiple assurances of Chinese economic and political support during a meeting Friday in Beijing with Chinese President Xi Jinping.“(China) firmly supports Cambodia in safeguarding national sovereignty and security, firmly supports Cambodia in steadily advancing major domestic political agendas and economic and social development, and resolutely opposes external forces interfering in Cambodia’s internal affairs,"" Xi was quoted as telling Hun Sen by China's official Xinhua News Agency.China will also encourage more Chinese enterprises to invest in Cambodia, help in the construction of the Sihanoukville economic zone in Cambodia's southwest on the Gulf of Thailand, and support building transportation infrastructure, Xi said.Hun Sen was quoted as thanking China for providing COVID-19 vaccines and said Cambodia “firmly supports China in safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests"" and “firmly opposes any external forces interfering in China’s internal affairs on issues related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet.""Cambodia is a key Chinese diplomatic partner, helping dampen criticism of Beijing within the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, several of whose members are engaged in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.The meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guest House comes in the middle of Hun Sen’s three-day visit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806380,Battle of former diplomats in Cyprus' presidential election,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A former foreign minister who campaigned as a unifier unconstrained by antiquated ideological and party lines will take on a veteran diplomat with broad voter appeal in Sunday's runoff for the presidency of ethnically divided Cyprus.

            As opinion polls consistently indicated in the run-up to the Feb. 5 first round, former minister Nikos Christodoulides, 49, came out on top with 32% of the vote.

            Andreas Mavroyiannis, 66, clinched second place with a surprisingly strong 29.6%, some 3.5 percentage points above Averof Neophytou, leader of the country’s largest party, Democratic Rally (DISY).











            The failure of Neophytou, 66, to reach the runoff shocked supporters, cast his future as DISY head into doubt and threatened a deep rift within the center-right party.

            A long-time DISY member, Christodoulides has been labelled an “apostate” over his decision run against Neophytou for the presidency, with many party cadres pledging never to vote for him.

            Conversely, Mavroyiannis’ backing by DISY’s rival, the communist-rooted AKEL party, has turned off many party faithful who fear he'll give AKEL a foothold in government.

            Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis met with Neophytou to seek DISY’s formal support in the runoff, hoping to tap a huge pool of votes. But after a tumultuous executive committee meeting Tuesday, DISY decided not to formally back either candidate, telling members to vote as they saw fit. 

            The outcome of the first round was a stinging blow to DISY, which effectively formed the government through the decade-long tenure of outgoing president and former DISY leader Nicos Anastasiades.

            The new president will face the tough challenge of trying to revive stalemated peace talks with breakaway Turkish Cypriots, who declared independence nearly a decade after the 1974 Turkish invasion that followed a coup aiming at union with Greece. Reunification has confounded politicians for over nearly half a century of negotiations, despite progress on the shape of an overall deal.

            The situation has become much more complicated following the 2017 collapse of talks at a Swiss resort that many believed had come tantalizingly close to a breakthrough. Turkey — the only country to recognize the minority Turkish Cypriots' independence — has since turned its back on a United Nations-backed arrangement for a federated Cyprus. It advocates instead a two-state deal, which the U.N., the European Union, the U.S. and other countries have rejected.

            Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis were key insiders during the failed 2017 talks, as government spokesman and chief negotiator, respectively. Both have faulted Turkey's insistence on maintaining a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in a reunified Cyprus as the main reason for the unravelling of negotiations.

            Christodoulides has said he draws the line at those two Turkish demands, while Mavroyiannis has softened his stance to woo leftist voters who believe more could have been done to reach a deal in Switzerland.

            Both candidates have also advocated tight fiscal discipline without endangering the country’s social safety net, amid intense public concern over soaring inflation.

            Mavroyiannis has fended off suggestions that he would shape economic policies according to the directives of his main backer, communist-rooted AKEL, which is blamed for the profligate spending that brought Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago during the presidency of its former, late leader Dimitris Christofias.

            Refocused attention on newly discovered natural gas deposits off Cyprus’ south coast as Europe grapples with an energy crunch has figured prominently in the campaigning. Leveraging that energy potential to nudge the peace process forward has been in play for years. Mavroyiannis has floated the possibility of supplying some of that gas to Turkish Cypriots and Turkey to reignite peace talks.

            Concern over migration prompted pledges from both candidates to expedite asylum applications and curb the flow of migrants who arrive in the north, cross a U.N.-controlled buffer zone and seek asylum in the richer EU-member south. Tiny Cyprus is among the top EU countries per capita in asylum applications.NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A former foreign minister who campaigned as a unifier unconstrained by antiquated ideological and party lines will take on a veteran diplomat with broad voter appeal in Sunday's runoff for the presidency of ethnically divided Cyprus.As opinion polls consistently indicated in the run-up to the Feb. 5 first round, former minister Nikos Christodoulides, 49, came out on top with 32% of the vote.Andreas Mavroyiannis, 66, clinched second place with a surprisingly strong 29.6%, some 3.5 percentage points above Averof Neophytou, leader of the country’s largest party, Democratic Rally (DISY).The failure of Neophytou, 66, to reach the runoff shocked supporters, cast his future as DISY head into doubt and threatened a deep rift within the center-right party.A long-time DISY member, Christodoulides has been labelled an “apostate” over his decision run against Neophytou for the presidency, with many party cadres pledging never to vote for him.Conversely, Mavroyiannis’ backing by DISY’s rival, the communist-rooted AKEL party, has turned off many party faithful who fear he'll give AKEL a foothold in government.Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis met with Neophytou to seek DISY’s formal support in the runoff, hoping to tap a huge pool of votes.

Turkey — the only country to recognize the minority Turkish Cypriots' independence — has since turned its back on a United Nations-backed arrangement for a federated Cyprus. It advocates instead a two-state deal, which the U.N., the European Union, the U.S. and other countries have rejected.Both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis were key insiders during the failed 2017 talks, as government spokesman and chief negotiator, respectively. Both have faulted Turkey's insistence on maintaining a permanent troop presence and military intervention rights in a reunified Cyprus as the main reason for the unravelling of negotiations.Christodoulides has said he draws the line at those two Turkish demands, while Mavroyiannis has softened his stance to woo leftist voters who believe more could have been done to reach a deal in Switzerland.Both candidates have also advocated tight fiscal discipline without endangering the country’s social safety net, amid intense public concern over soaring inflation.Mavroyiannis has fended off suggestions that he would shape economic policies according to the directives of his main backer, communist-rooted AKEL, which is blamed for the profligate spending that brought Cyprus to the brink of bankruptcy a decade ago during the presidency of its former, late leader Dimitris Christofias.Refocused attention on newly discovered natural gas deposits off Cyprus’ south coast as Europe grapples with an energy crunch has figured prominently in the campaigning. Leveraging that energy potential to nudge the peace process forward has been in play for years. Mavroyiannis has floated the possibility of supplying some of that gas to Turkish Cypriots and Turkey to reignite peace talks.Concern over migration prompted pledges from both candidates to expedite asylum applications and curb the flow of migrants who arrive in the north, cross a U.N.-controlled buffer zone and seek asylum in the richer EU-member south. Tiny Cyprus is among the top EU countries per capita in asylum applications.",2023/02/10,,World

Beijing retaliated by halting short-term visas for South Korean travellers.Kim Sung-ho, South Korea's vice interior minister in charge of disaster and safety management, said the government had decided to restart the visa issuance after the number of infections among Chinese arrivals dropped significantly, and new strains of the virus have not emerged.South Korea's prime minister, Han Duck-soo, last week hinted at lifting restrictions before the end of February if China's COVID situation became ""manageable"".Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the lifting of visa restrictions was ""a step in the right direction"".""China will actively consider the resumption of short-term visas for South Korean citizens on a reciprocal basis. We hope that the Republic of Korea will work with China to create more convenience for the normal flow of people between the two sides,"" she said at a regular briefing.",2023/02/10,126,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806382,Italy bristles over Zelenskiy dinner snub in Paris,"RUSSELS, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticised France and Germany on Thursday after she was not invited to a dinner in Paris with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, adding to friction between the European Union allies.French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Zelenskiy on Wednesday evening ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.But unlike last year, when the then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi worked hand-in-hand with Macron and Scholz on Ukraine, Meloni was left out in the cold.Speaking to reporters as she arrived at the Brussels summit, Meloni, who took office last October, said she thought the snub was ""inappropriate"".""I think our strength in this fight is unity,"" she added.She later met Zelenskiy on the sidelines of the EU meeting.Asked about her comments, Macron said he thought Wednesday's dinner had been fitting.""As you know, Germany and France have had a special role on the Ukraine question for eight years,"" he told reporters, referring to joint mediation by the two countries that tried, and failed, to prevent conflict between Russia and Ukraine.However, things were different when Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, was prime minister. Draghi travelled with Macron and Scholz to Kyiv by train last June and played a leading role with them in shaping EU opposition to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.Meloni has pledged to maintain the same pro-Ukraine stance, despite the misgivings of some of her coalition allies, telling reporters on Thursday that providing help to Kyiv was the best way to bring about peace.Underscoring her willingness to support Kyiv, Italy and France finalised technical talks last week for the joint delivery of a SAMP/T-MAMBA air defence system to Ukraine in spring of this year.However, Meloni's brand of nationalist politics has put her at odds with both Macron and Scholz on an array of other issues and the close ties that Draghi forged with Paris and Berlin seem a distant memory.Paris last November accused Meloni's new government of breaking a bond of trust and breaching international laws by refusing to take in migrants saved by a charity rescue ship. The boat eventually docked in France instead.Earlier this week, French and German ministers flew to Washington together to discuss contested U.S. subsidies with their U.S. counterparts, excluding Italy, which is the second-largest manufacturer in the European Union after Germany.",2023/02/10,613,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806392,South Africa invokes disaster law to tackle energy crisis,"CAPE TOWN, Feb 9 (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday declared a national ""state of disaster"" over his country's crippling power shortages, saying they posed an existential threat to the economy and social fabric.The electricity crunch has been years in the making, a product of delays in building new coal-fired power stations, corruption in coal-supply contracts, criminal sabotage and failures to ease up regulation to enable private providers to swiftly bring renewable energy on tap.""We are in the grip of a profound energy crisis,"" Ramaphosa said in his annual State of the Nation Address to parliament.""The crisis has progressively evolved to affect every part of society. We must act to lessen the impact of the crisis on farmers, on small businesses, on our water infrastructure and our transport network.""State electricity utility Eskom is implementing the worst rolling blackouts on record, leaving households in the dark, disrupting manufacturing and hurting businesses of all sizes.The power cuts are expected to reduce economic growth in Africa's most industrialised nation to just 0.3% this year.Declaring a national state of disaster gives the government additional powers to respond to a crisis, including by permitting emergency procurement procedures with fewer bureaucratic delays and less oversight.The legislation was used to enable health authorities to respond more swiftly to the COVID-19 pandemic, but some analysts doubt it will help the government expand power supply much quicker.Eskom said it would study the details of the declaration before commenting.Brighton Hlupego, a street trader outside Cape Town City Hall where Ramaphosa delivered his speech, said the biggest problems facing South Africans were poverty, unemployment and electricity.""To some extent he gave some solutions to the problems, but these won't be solved easily,"" said Hlupego, who bought mobile data to listen to the speech with friends. ""The state of disaster is a good thing but we don't want to see them (politicians) put the money in their pockets.""The biggest opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, said it would challenge the ""state of disaster"" declaration in court, alleging Ramaphosa's party issued nonsensical regulations and abused procurement processes during the pandemic.Ramaphosa also said on Thursday that the government was working on a mechanism for targeted basic income support for the most vulnerable, within fiscal constraints.He started his speech about 45 minutes late after opposition lawmakers, mainly from the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party, disrupted proceedings and tried to barge onto the stage.",2023/02/10,131,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806417,Volkanovski moves up and sizes up Makhachev ahead of UFC 284,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — The taunts from UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev about a supposed lack of size aren’t likely to unsettle Alexander Volkanovski.

            He’s worked as a concreter, he’s played the rugged game of rugby league and he grew up in the working-class city of Wollongong, south of Sydney. He can defend himself.

            “That’s been happening forever ... even on the footy field,” Volkanovski said of the taunts coming from his 31-year-old Russian rival. But, “No one’s ever just overpowered me.”











            At 5-feet 6-inches, (1.68 meters) featherweight titleholder Volkanovski will give up four inches in height and 15 pounds in weight to Makhachev (23 wins, 1 loss) when he moves up a division for the lightweight title fight, the main event of UFC 284 on Sunday in Perth, capital of Western Australia state.

            With the status of best pound-for-pound fighter on the line, Volkanovski (25 wins, 1 loss) will have a sold-out 13,000 crowd right behind him at an expected febrile RAC Arena. But even with that, Volkanovski is the underdog against the formidable wrestling and grappling prowess of Makhachev. 

            “He doesn’t take unnecessary risks. He doesn’t overcommit,” Volkanovski said of Makhachev, who has 11 submission victories in his 23 career wins. 

            “He will fight on the back foot and wait for the right time to shoot. His distance game isn’t too bad. He’s calculated, brilliant at the basics. He’s a great fighter.”

            The straight-shooting Makhachev insists that his superior size will lead to a one-sided bout and defense of his lightweight belt.

            “It’s another division. I’m going to beat him,"" he said. “I want to knock him out. I know I’m the best MMA fighter because I have all the skills - striking, wrestling, grappling.”

            But the 34-year-old Volkanovski, whose power and striking has fueled his rise in mixed martial arts, scoffed at his opponent’s confident prediction. 

            “Knockout? That’s an unnecessary risk. He won’t be doing that,” said Volkanovski, who has gorged on extra calories in a bid to gain weight.

            “If he thinks I’m just going to be a weak little featherweight, then he’s in for a rude shock.""

            MMA in Australia is starting to emerge from a niche base, its growing popularity obvious by the hundreds of fans who turned out for public workouts from the fighters ahead of the first UFC event staged in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            Among the other bouts on the card, Josh Emmett will be taking on Yair Rodriguez for the featherweight interim title belt and Parker Porter is against New Zealander Justin Tafa.

            Volkanovski has become a very recognizable name in Australia, where he's the embodiment of the underdog who doggedly climbs the ranks.

            “I don’t think I was ever athletically gifted ... I’ve always been strong but that’s it,” he said. “Look where I’m at right now with the right mindset and work ethic. I’m showing people what can be done.”

            In this cauldron, though, there's little room for modest talk, even for Volkanovski, who is on a 22-fight winning streak and is known as ‘The Great’ — a nod to Alexander the Great.

            “I’m chasing to be one of the greatest or the greatest. ‘Alexander the Great’ is good but we’re going for ‘Alexander the Greatest’,” he said. ""People have counted me out but I’m going to shock the world on Sunday and I can’t wait to do it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806418,'We couldn't let go': War tears young Ukrainian family apart,"BRASOV, Romania (AP) — University student Vlada Yushchenko was still in her teens and nearly three months pregnant when she hugged her husband at the border, turned away and walked into Moldova.

            Now she's in Romania, one of the millions of Ukrainians forced to flee Russia's invasion. Her baby, Daniel, was born there eight months ago and still hasn't met his father Yaroslav, who is 21 and, like most men of fighting age, prohibited from leaving Ukraine.

            The young family's forced separation is an all-too-common story among the estimated 110,000 Ukrainian refugees in Romania — nearly all of them women and children.











            “Nobody expected the war was coming and that we weren’t going to be together,” said Yushchenko, who has settled for now in the central Romanian city of Brasov where she gave birth and shares a two-room apartment with Daniel, her mother, and her terminally ill grandmother.

            “For a long time we couldn’t let each other go,” said Yushchenko, 19, recalling the couple's separation at the border. “We really didn’t want this, but at the same time we understood that we have to do this for mine and the baby’s health and to be safe.”

            As the war drags into its second year, the lack of physical contact between the baby and his father, a computer programming student in Kyiv, rankles. Still, their smartphones allow the family a sense of connection.

            “Sometimes we burst out in tears (but) we are very happy when we see each other on video,” Yushchenko said. “I called (Yaroslav) and sent a photo as soon as I was able to"" the day Daniel was born, she added. ""It was very emotional, he was very happy, it was unforgettable.”

            But even that virtual link isn't always there.

            In recent months, Russian strikes have targeted critical energy infrastructure across large swathes of Ukraine, which has at times made communication difficult. Yaroslav tries to ease her concerns, Yushchenko said, by warning her of potential outages and telling her not to panic during moments of silence.

            Still, seeing footage of the war play out in Ukraine, and knowing her husband is there, only adds to her worries. 

            “It’s very hard to watch the news and see all the misery, the missile strikes, the deaths,” said Yushchenko, who between taking care of the baby continues her mathematics and physics studies remotely at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. “I pray every day that everything will be alright … in the city where (Yaroslav) lives and in general.”

            Her faith, among other things, is helping her through the ordeal. 

            When Daniel was six months old she decided to get him baptized at a local Orthodox church, by a priest who lives in their apartment block and waived the customary fee for the ceremony. They attend Sunday service whenever they can, Yushchenko said. 

            In her day-to-day life, she often takes “very long walks, sometimes all day"" with Daniel around Brasov, a picturesque heritage city nestled in the arching Carpathian mountains. She also sees other Ukrainian mothers living locally who she says she can talk to about babies and motherhood. 

            Since the war started, more than eight million Ukrainians have fled to other European countries, in the greatest exodus of refugees the continent has seen since World War II. 

            More than 4,000 have registered with Brasov's Migrant Integration Center, according to Astrid Hamberger, founder of the nongovernmental organization that has helped many of them, including Yushchenko's family, find homes, medical care and social assistance.

            “I feel safe here ... we receive a lot of help, which I’m very grateful for,” said Yushchenko, who hopes Ukraine wins the war so they can go home and finally be together as a family — and Daniel can meet his father.

            “It will be an unforgettable meeting, our child is our happiness,” she said.

            When asked what she prays for at the church in Brasov, Yushchenko doesn't hesitate to answer. 

            “I pray for the health of my family and friends and for a peaceful sky in our country,"" she said, “and ask for the strength to bear all this.”

Temperatures remain below freezing across the large region, and many people have no place to shelter. The Turkish government has distributed millions of hot meals, as well as tents and blankets, but is still struggling to reach many people in need.

            ___











            UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations has pledged a $25 million grant for people in earthquake-stricken areas of Syria. That’s in addition to a $25 million grant announced earlier this week for emergency operations in both Turkey and Syria.

            U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said Friday the new grant from the U.N. emergency fund would help meet the urgent needs of hundreds of thousands of Syrians. He said humanitarian conditions in the country were at their worst since the conflict began in 2011, with dwindling resources, a cholera outbreak and harsh winter conditions.

            U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said around 130 urban search-and-rescue teams from around the world are working in Turkey, and another 57 teams are on their way.

            In response to Syrian critics who say the U.N. isn’t doing enough to help find victims, the spokesperson said the U.N. does not have its own search-and-rescue teams. Instead, it has a coordinating role through its disaster assessment teams.

            A U.N. disaster assessment team is in Syria and deploying to government-controlled Aleppo, Homs and Latakia, Dujarric said. A second U.N. aid convoy entered Syria’s rebel-held enclave on Friday from Turkey, bringing shelter and non-food items.

            The U.N. World Food Program has delivered food aid to 115,000 people in Turkey and Syria in the first four days since the earthquake struck, and the U.N. World Health Organization delivered 72 metric tons of trauma and emergency surgery supplies to both countries, he said.

            LATAKIA, Syria — Syria’s state news agency SANA says paramedics have succeeded in pulling a mother and her two adult children from under the rubble of a building in the coastal town of Jableh.

            SANA says the three survivors are Duha Nurallah, 60, her son Ibrahim Zakariya, 22, and her daughter Rawiya 24.

            The three were immediately rushed away in ambulances late Friday, the fifth day after the earthquake that hit Turkey and northern Syria, killing more than 23,000 people.

            Although experts say trapped people can live for a week or more, the chances of finding survivors are dimming. The rescues Friday in Syria and Turkey have provided fleeting moments of joy and relief amid the misery gripping the shattered region, where morgues and cemeteries are overwhelmed.

            ___

            NICOSIA, Cyprus - Funeral services have been held in the breakaway north of ethnically divided Cyprus for some of the 10 people whose bodies were repatriated from the earthquake-devasted Turkish city of Adiyaman.

            Turkish Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar said the bodies of seven children who were members of their school’s volleyball team, two teachers and a parent were brought back Friday after being pulled out of the rubble of the collapsed Isias Hotel.

            Tatar expressed “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the families and friends of the deceased.

            A group of 39 people, including members of the girls and boys volleyball teams, were staying in the hotel when it collapsed Feb. 6. Search efforts are continuing to try to locate all of them.

            Turkish Cypriot authorities have already sent a team of rescuers including 17 riot police and 10 firefighters to the Kahramanmaraş area. Another 200 rescue workers and eight vehicles are expected to arrive later to Turkey.

            ___

            GENEVA — The U.N. refugee agency estimates as many as 5.3 million people may have been left homeless in Syria because of the earthquake.

            Sivanka Dhanapala, the country representative in Syria for UNHCR, told reporters Friday that the agency is focusing on shelter and relief items such as tents, plastic sheeting, thermal blankets, sleeping mats and winter clothing for people in need.

            Even before the Feb. 6 temblor, around 6.8 million people had been displaced within Syria because of the war that erupted in 2011 — some of those driven from their homes multiple times.

            Dhanapala says some supplies had been delivered from government-controlled areas to the rebel-held northwest of Syria prior to the quake, and those “pre-positioned” supplies have already been distributed from warehouses.

            UNHCR hopes an agreement with the Damascus government will pave the way for faster, more regular access to the northwest. 

            ___

            DAMASCUS, Syria — The Syrian government has decided to allow earthquake aid to reach all parts of the country, including areas held by insurgent groups in the northwest.

            Syrian state TV reported that the government announced during a meeting Friday that all aid deliveries would be made under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent to guarantee that they reach people in need.

            The government also decided to set up a national fund to help areas hit by Monday’s magnitude 7.8 earthquake.

            ___

            JERUSALEM — The Israeli military says its aid mission to Turkey has recovered the body of Antakya’s Jewish community leader and that of his wife. 

            It took members of “The Olive Branches” team 48 hours to locate and recover the bodies of Saul and Fortuna Cenudioğlu, the military said. 

            The couple were trapped under the rubble of their demolished house. They were buried afterward.

            ___

            BEIRUT — A Syrian opposition official says more than 700 Syrians who died in Turkey in this week’s earthquake have been brought home for burial through a border crossing with Syria.

            Mazen Alloush, an official on the Syrian side of the border, told The Associated Press on Friday that about 720 more bodies have been brought back home for burial since Monday.

            Turkey is home to some 3.6 million Syrian refugees who fled the civil war in their country that broke out 12 years ago.

            ___

            ADIYAMAN, Turkey - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has described the powerful earthquake that ravaged parts of southeast Turkey as “one of the greatest disasters our nation has faced in its history.”

            Touring the province of Adiyaman on Friday, Erdogan said search-and-rescue efforts would continue until no one is left trapped beneath the rubble.

            He renewed a promise to rebuild the area within the year, and also said the government would subsidize rents for one year for people unwilling to stay in tents.

            The president, who faces tough elections in May, again acknowledged a slow government response in the initial stages of the quake. He said the fact that many first responders were caught up in the disaster was one of the reasons for the slow start.

            Addressing reports of looting in the region, Erdogan said a state of emergency declared in the 10 affected province would allow authorities to prevent such incidents.

            ___

            ALEPPO, Syria -- Syrian President Bashar Assad has accused western countries of politicizing Syria’s humanitarian crisis following the Feb. 6 earthquake.

            Assad spoke briefly to reporters Friday in the demolished Masharqa neighborhood of Aleppo during his first visit to the quake zone following the 7.8-magnitude temblor.

            He said: “The West has no humanitarianism, therefore politicizing the situation in Syria is something they would naturally do.”

            The devastating damage to Aleppo, Syria’s second and largest city, compounds the woes of the war-scarred city that faced years of bombardment in the 12-year conflict, much of it by Assad’s forces and those of his ally, Russia.

            During his visit to Aleppo on Friday, Assad visited Aleppo University Hospital and then met with rescuers in Masharqua, where paramedics on Thursday removed the bodies of 44 people and seven others alive from one building. 

            World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s head of emergencies, were also arriving in Aleppo on Friday to help coordinate and support the delivery of aid. 

            ___

            BAB AL-HAWA, Syria — The United Nations says the first earthquake-related aid convoy of 14 trucks has crossed from Turkey into rebel-held northwestern Syria. 

            The road to the Bab al-Hawa border crossing was obstructed for days following the quake due to road damage and debris from collapsed buildings. 

            The U.N. International Organization for Migration said in a statement that Friday's convoy carried “essential relief items.” 

            A first convoy of six trucks into Syria’s rebel-held enclave had crossed the border on Thursday, but those trucks carried aid that had already been scheduled to be sent before the devastating quake.

            The United Nations is not authorized to deliver aid into Syria through other border crossings under a U.N. Security Council resolution.

            ___

            The Kurdistan Workers’ Party has declared a cease-fire in its conflict with Turkey to facilitate rescue operations following the devastating earthquake.

            According to a spokesperson for the group, Zagros Hiwa, the cease-fire comes on the orders of PKK leader Cemil Bayik “to allow rescue operations and reduce pain of affected people in disaster zone.” Hiwa added Friday that it is an “open cease-fire” but “depends also on Turkey’s response,” meaning “if they attack us, we will respond.” 

            The Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, has waged an armed insurgency against Turkey since 1984 with the aim of establishing a Kurdish state in southeast Turkey, which has since morphed into a campaign for autonomy. The conflict between militants and state forces has killed tens of thousands of people.Emergency crews made a series of dramatic rescues in Turkey on Friday, pulling several people from the rubble four days after a catastrophic 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed more than 23,000 in Turkey and Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806443,Porter leads women's Vic Open after course record 64,"BARWON HEADS, Australia (AP) — Cassie Porter fired a course record 9-under par 64 on Friday to take a five-shot lead halfway through the women’s Vic Open at 13th Beach Golf Links.

            The 20-year-old Porter had eagles on the par-4 5th and the par-5 18th on the Creek Course in the second round to move to 15 under after opening with a 66, overshadowing her playing partners and former No. 1-ranked Karrie Webb and Jiyai Shin.

            Pavarisa Yoktuan of Thailand, who was tied with Porter after the first round, was in second spot at 10 under after a 68 in the second round. 











            She was one shot ahead of Holly Clyburn and Emma Talley, while Shin was in fifth spot at 7 under.

            The women’s and men's Vic Opens are being played concurrently on the 36-hole layout at Barwon Heads, near Geelong in Australia’s Victoria state.

            New Zealander Michael Hendry had 10 birdies in a 10-under 62 on Friday to take a two-shot lead at 18-under after two rounds in the men’s tournament.

            First-round leader Ryan Ruffels was still in contention for the lead until the par-5 18th, where he twice hit into the penalty area and made a quadruple bogey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806510,Russia announces cut to oil output over Western price caps,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia announced Friday that will cut oil production by 500,000 barrels per day next month after Western countries capped the price of its crude over its action in Ukraine.

            “As of today, we fully sell all our crude output, but as we stated before, we will not sell oil to those who directly or indirectly adhere to the ‘price ceiling,’” Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies. 

            “In connection with that, Russia will voluntarily cut production by 500,000 barrels a day. It will help restore market-style relations,” he said.











            Analysts have said one possible Russian response to the cap would be to slash production to try to raise oil prices, which could eventually flow through to higher gasoline prices at the pump as less oil makes it to the global market.

            International benchmark Brent crude traded 1.5% higher Friday at $85.75 per barrel. 

            The Group of Seven major democracies have imposed a $60-per-barrel price cap on Russian oil shipped to non-Western countries. The goal is to keep oil flowing to the world to prevent price spikes that were seen last year, while limiting Russia's financial gains that can be used to pay for its campaign against Ukraine. 

            The cap is enforced by barring Western companies that largely control shipping and insurance services from moving oil priced above the limit. 

            Russia has said it will not sell oil to countries observing the cap, a moot point because Russian oil has been trading below the price ceiling recently. However, the cap, an accompanying European Union embargo on most Russian oil and lower demand for crude have meant that customers in India, Turkey and China have been able to push for substantial discounts on Russian oil.

            The impact of a cut of 500,000 barrels per day is an open question as a slowing global economy reduces the thirst for oil. 

            The OPEC+ alliance of oil producers, which includes Russia, tried to boost oil prices with an October announcement that it would cut production by 2 million barrels per day, only to see prices fall below $80 per barrel by December.

            Asked if Russia consulted OPEC+ members about Moscow's new production cut, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “there had been conversations with some members of the OPEC+” before the move was announced. He didn’t offer any details.

            But Novak insisted in a statement later that Moscow made the move without consulting anyone.

            “It’s a voluntary cut; there have been no consultations with anyone regarding it,” the deputy prime minister said, according to the Russian media.

            The new reduction could be “an early sign that Russia might try to weaponize oil supplies after last year's failed attempt to weaponize natural gas,” said Simone Tagliapietra, an energy policy expert at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. 

            But that could be difficult to accomplish because it's easier to find alternative supplies of oil, traded through tankers that crisscross the globe, than to replace natural gas, which before the war mostly came to Europe by pipeline. 

            Russian exporter Gazprom has cut off most supplies of natural gas to Europe, citing technical issues and refusal by some customers to pay in Russian currency. European officials call it retaliation for supporting Ukraine. 

            
                Europe did suffer from resulting high natural gas prices but has managed to replace much of the lost Russian supply from other sources including shipborne liquefied gas from the U.S. and Qatar. Natural gas prices have since come down from all-time highs last summer but are still three times higher than before Russia massed troops on the Ukraine border.

She wrote that Huang was the leader of the first rescue team that arrived in Turkey, hours after major earthquakes struck.The Japan Taiwan Exchange Association, responding to Tsai’s post, wrote: “We wonder if anyone noticed that the leader of the rescue team Taiwan sent to Turkey for rescue missions this time, Huang Po-tsun, is the same Taiwanese rescue team leader that came to Japan during the March 11, 2011 disasters following the earthquake in eastern Japan.” It added that its staff members were moved to tears at the sight of Huang.The revelation quickly went viral in Taiwan, and Huang, who heard that he had been recognized, recorded a video to comment on the issue.

Technology Scouting Service Market",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806547,Berlin gears up to repeat botched elections,"Berlin goes to the polls for an unprecedented repeat election on Sunday, with what many think is the credibility of Germany's democratic institutions on the line.Authorities in the German capital have been under extra scrutiny since last November, when the state's Constitutional Court annulled the state and municipal elections held on September 26, 2021, and handed down a damning verdict on a badly mishandled election day: Delays forced people to stand in line for many hours, as some ballot stations ran out of ballot papers and hastily photocopied more, other ballots had the wrong candidates listed on them, some stations had to close temporarily, while others remained open longer than they should have – making it possible to vote even after first results had been published. Meanwhile, the city's marathon held on the same day hampered attempts to resupply them.Altogether, the court concluded, votes for around 60% of the seats in Berlin's state parliament were affected by the problems, and though no wrongdoing was alleged, it was, as many politicians have admitted since, deeply embarrassing. Never before has an election in Germany been botched so badly that it would have to be repeated.Nor are all the legal issues resolved: The federal Constitutional Court last week dismissed a bid to stop Sunday's election repeat, but it also deferred making a final decision — opening the possibility that this new election could be annulled too.And there is still a question dangling over the federal election, which took place on the same day. The federal parliament, the Bundestag, decided last year that the election would have to be repeated in 431 of Berlin's 2,256 polling stations. But it's unclear when that will happen, since the decision is subject to yet another appeal in the federal Constitutional Court.Politically, the election fiasco is proving particularly disastrous for Berlin's Social Democrat Mayor Franziska Giffey, who now finds herself trailing in the polls to the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Berlin's election organizers have a tight schedule to stick to. The court set a 90-day deadline for the new election, which is a challenge. ""Normally we'd have a year to organize an election,"" says the man shouldering the pressure: Stephan Bröchler, a professor of political administration who became Berlin's new election director in October 2022, having spent nine months on the commission investigating the original election disasters.""It sounds banal, but one of my first jobs was to make sure we had enough paper so that we can print the ballots,"" he told DW. ""And we've increased the number of voting booths. There will be at least three voting booths at each polling station; in 2021 it was two.""Bröchler says they're planning for four minutes' voting time per voter this time, a minute more than in 2021. This might prove to be crucial since one of the reasons for the long lines on the last election day was the fact that many voters were taking more than five minutes to sift through the various ballots. ""That was a big problem,"" said Bröchler.Partly to boost turnout, German authorities often schedule elections for several levels of government on the same day, and four separate votes took place in Berlin on September 26, 2021: The federal election, the state election, the municipal elections, and a referendum on expropriating major housing companies.That meant voters were handed no fewer than six ballot papers, as two of those votes — the federal and state election — comprise a mixed electoral system (one vote for the direct candidate and one for the overall party). Luckily for Bröchler, the court decided that only two of the votes have to be re-run (for now): The state and the municipal elections, meaning voters only have three ballot papers to rifle through in February.Marie Jünemann, of the NGO Mehr Demokratie (""More Democracy"") welcomed Bröchler's appointment and his work so far. ""For us the much bigger question is why no one is taking political responsibility,"" said Jünemann. ""Of course, the previous election director stepped down, but there were no consequences for those in political responsibility at the time, such as in the Interior Ministry.""At least Bröchler should have enough resources this time round. Mayor Franziska Giffey issued a special €39 million ($42.5 million) fund to ensure a hitch-free election this time. Some of this money is being spent on recruiting a small army of volunteers to ensure each ballot station is properly staffed: Instead of between 7 and 9 volunteers per station, there will be up to 14.They are tasked with checking voter IDs and registration, handing out ballots, make sure the votes are placed in sealed envelopes in a sealed box, which is opened at 6pm after polling has ended and then manually counted by a team of volunteers inside the polling station.The city is also stumping up more cash to encourage volunteers: Instead of €60 ($64) for the day's work as was previously offered, they are to be paid €240, plus an extra €25 if they attend a training seminar. ""I mentioned it to my students at the university and they all signed up straight away!"" said Bröchler.As things stand, Bröchler has enough on his plate, and there have been more organizational snafus: An informational flyer printed in early January had the wrong election date on it, then a couple of weeks later, 49 voters who had applied for postal votes received two sets of ballot papers.And in the district of Neukölln a candidate for the Free Democrats was re-listed on 1,700 postal ballots papers, even though he had moved out of the city since 2021, and so was ineligible to stand. ""We had over 4,000 names of candidates to check, and after the 18 hours that the people here were working, that annoying mistake happened,"" said Bröchler.The election director has made a point of being open about these issues. ""I've been going public more and more,"" he said. ""To explain what we're doing, why we take which decisions, and to proactively explain where mistakes have happened.""Jünemann says Bröchler's handling of these mistakes has given her some confidence. ""He's betting on maximum transparency — that's good,"" she said.One of Bröchler's most headline-catching decisions was to invite international observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to check on his work so far, and decide whether a team should be sent to Berlin on election day. ""So much went wrong at the '21 election, and so much trust was lost, I thought it would be good to bring in an additional quality control,"" Bröchler said.After a three-day visit, the OSCE released a short report concluding that it had a ""high level of confidence"" in the Berlin authorities and had decided not to send observers to the election in Berlin after all. ""That was disappointing for us,"" said Jünemann. ""I think an observation would've helped to really disperse all doubts.""Regardless of that, Bröchler has promised that observers from the European Council would come to Berlin on election day. Eliminating public doubt has become as important as making sure the election runs smoothly. At least this time, there will be no international marathon in the way.Edited by Rina Goldenberg",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806548,Cyprus: Diplomats battle it out for Greek Cypriot presidency,"Voters in Cyprus will go to the polls on Sunday to elect their eighth president since becoming an independent republic almost 64 years ago. They will be choosing between two Foreign Ministry diplomats who are going head-to-head in the second round of the presidential election.Former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides emerged as the center-right candidate, despite his failure to gain the support of the ruling right-wing Democratic Rally (DISY) of which he was once a member.Christodoulides faces off against career diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis, who is backed by the leftist Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL).In the first round of the elections, Christodoulides received 32% of the vote, and Mavroyiannis 29.6%, leaving the candidate of the ruling DISY, Averof Neophytou, trailing in third.Nikos Christodoulides is one of the closest associates of the outgoing President Nikos Anastasiades and a former career diplomat at the Foreign Ministry. He was appointed government spokesman in 2014 and foreign minister in 2018. His decision to run for president — ignoring the internal procedures of his then party, DISY — was viewed by fellow members and officials as a divisive act that ultimately led to his expulsion from the party.After breaking ranks with DISY, Christodoulides positioned himself as an independent candidate. He has the backing of three parties, the Democratic Party (DIKO), the Movement for Social Democracy (EDEK) and the Democratic Alignment (DIPA) and several public figures on the Cypriot right. His widespread popularity remains his biggest asset.During his election campaign, Christodoulides' profile as a consensual, moderate politician took a blow when his political opponents claimed he was partly responsible for the deadlock in what is known as the ""Cyprus problem"" during his time as minister of foreign affairs.Cyprus has been divided since 1974, following Turkish military intervention after a Greek-backed coup. Numerous United Nations attempts at mediation between the Greek Cypriot Republic of Cyprus in the south and the breakaway Turkish Cypriot north have failed to overcome the division. Ever since Greek Cypriots overwhelmingly voted against the Annan Plan (named after the then UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan) — a UN proposal to unite the island by establishing a bizonal, bicommunal federation — the situation has been at an impasse.Christodoulides' credibility in this respect was shaken by the fact that he has the backing of parties that are traditionally tough on talks to solve the decades-old division of the island and are opposed to a bizonal, bicommunal federation (BBF).The second candidate in the runoff, Andreas Mavroyiannis, also a career diplomat, has been a close associate of several presidents of the Republic of Cyprus. He served as the negotiator for the Greek Cypriot side in the Cyprus talks under the presidency of Nikos Anastasiades and was Cyprus' Permanent Representative in the UN during a difficult period for the country after the rejection of the Annan Plan.His wealth of experience at international level lends credibility to his candidacy in that many feel he could breathe new life into the negotiations on the Cyprus problem and achieve a compromise between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot sides.Although he has the backing of the leftist AKEL, Mavroyiannis refuses to declare himself a supporter of any particular political ideology. His critics are quick to point to the fact that AKEL was the party in power at the start of the 2008 economic crisis.Mavroyiannis has dismissed this criticism, saying that he intends to govern Cyprus based on the values of a free market economy.In the runup to the second round of the election, Greek Cypriot voters are polarized in two ways: On the one hand, there is the ideological rift between the left and the right and on the other, the rift between those who support a bizonal, bicommunal federation as a solution to the Cyprus problem and those who oppose it.Given his popularity and the fact that he is a close associate of the outgoing president and former member of the ruling DISY, Nikos Christodoulides would seem on paper to be the candidate most likely to attract votes from the right wing of the electorate.However, the fact that his candidacy divided the right-wing vote in the first round and meant that DISY leader Averof Neofytou did not make it into the runoff, created ill-will within the party. In addition, the fact that Christodoulides is supported by parties opposed to the BBF solution means that some DISY voters are having second thoughts about his candidacy. As a result, many expect a considerable shift in support to Mavroyiannis.Indeed, after a long, stormy meeting on Tuesday, the ruling DISY party announced that it intended to serve in opposition for the next five years and urged its members to vote as their conscience dictates, effectively refusing to back former member Christodoulides.Edited by: Rüdiger Rossig and Aingeal Flanagan",2023/02/10,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806549,Ukraine updates: Moldova says Russian missiles crossed its airspace,"Moldova said a Russian missile had violated its airspace on Friday morning and summoned the Russian ambassador to make a formal protest.The country's foreign ministry said Moscow's ambassador would be summoned ""to indicate to the Russian side the unacceptable violation of our airspace by a Russian missile that today flew over the sovereign territory of the Republic of Moldova.""The foreign ministry of the country, wedged between Ukraine and Romania, added that ""the Russian side continues its war of aggression against Ukraine and the missile attacks against our neighboring country affects directly and negatively our country.""Ukraine's top general, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, had earlier said two Russian Kaliber missiles had crossed into Romanian and Moldovan airspace before entering Ukraine, he said.Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said the missiles had been launched from the Black Sea and had entered Moldovan airspace. They then flew into Romanian airspace, before entering Ukraine.However, the defense ministry of NATO member Romania said the missile flew some 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) northeast of its border.""The Romanian Air Force's surveillance system detected on Friday an air target, most likely a cruise missile launched from a Russian ship in the Black Sea near the Crimean Peninsula,"" the ministry said in a statement.""The closest the target trajectory got to Romania's airspace was recorded by the radar at roughly 35 kilometers northeast of the border.""A pro-Russian breakaway regime has ruled part of Moldova's territory, Transnistria, since the early 1990s after a separatist conflict. Moldova's intelligence service on Thursday warned that Russia was acting to destabilize the country, which was formerly part of the Soviet Union.The Ukrainska Pravda online newspaper quoted a Ukrainian air force spokesperson saying separately that Ukraine had the ability to shoot down the missiles. However, it did not do so for fear of endangering civilians in foreign countries.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Friday, February 10.Officials warned of possible missile strikes from Russian forces on Friday, urging citizens to take cover as air raid sirens sounded across the country. Several cities reported already being targeted.""There is a big threat of the missile attack. I want to stress again — do not ignore the air alert sirens,"" said the head of Kyiv city military administration, Serhiy Popko.The alarm was raised after warnings that Russia had launched Tu-95 strategic bombers. There were reports that other planes had been launched from Belarus.""Enemy aviation is in the air and ships which can carry Kaliber missiles are in the sea. The enemy launched the missiles. The air alert will be long,"" said Maksym Marchenko, governor of the southern region of Odesa. ""Please do not ignore the air alert sirens, and go to the shelters.""The Kyiv Independent said that several explosions have been reported in the Dnipropetrovsk region and that seven more missiles have been fired at the Kryvyi Rih area, according to Oleksandr Vilkul, head of that city's military administration.This is part of ""Russia's latest massive missile attack in Ukraine, using cruise missiles launched both from the air and from the sea,"" according to the governor of the Mykolaiv region, Viitaliy Kim, who said that some 20 missiles were launched in the first wave of attacks.The warnings came after Moscow's military struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and launched multiple strikes on energy infrastructure in Zaporizhzhia in the early hours of Friday.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says any decision on supplying fighter jets to Ukraine must come from the NATO defensive alliance.""There would have to be a decision on the part of NATO, and Poland will eventually decide what to do when there is an unequivocal decision that fighter jets can be transferred to Ukraine,"" Morawiecki told a press conference in Brussels.The UK Ministry of Defense says Russian forces appear to have made tactical gains this week in two key sectors — but abandoned a large number of armored vehicles in one incident.The ministry's daily report said Wagner Group forces on the northern outskirts of the Donbas city of Bakhmut have pushed two to three kilometers (about a mile-and-a-half) further west, controlling countryside near the main route to the city. It added that Russian forces are increasingly dominating the northern approaches to Bakhmut.To the south, Russian units have made advances around the western edge of the town of Vuhledar, where they re-launched offensive operations in late January 2023.However, London says Russian units have likely suffered particularly heavy casualties around Vuhledar where inexperienced units have been committed.It added that Russian troops likely fled and abandoned at least 30 mostly intact armored vehicles in a single incident after a failed assault.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met his counterpart in Poland, Andrzej Duda, the office of the Polish president said on Friday on Twitter.The meeting, in the southwestern logistic hub of Rzeszow, took place at the end of Zelenskyy's whirlwind tour of Europe, taking in London, Paris and Brussels.""The President of Ukraine reported on his recent diplomatic activity in Brussels and other European capitals; the talks also focused on security in the region,"" it said.
The office said the pair discussed the current situation at the front and the need for further joint actions for military support.On his tour, Zelenskyy continued to push for more Western military aid came as evidence mounted of an anticipated offensive by Russia as the war enters a second year.At least 17 missiles hit the city of Zaporizhzhia within a single hour on Friday, the city's acting mayor Anatolii Kurtiev said.Kurtiev said the missiles targeted energy infrastructure.The Zaporizhzhia region is home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, which was shut down due to threats posed by Russian attacks.Russian strikes also knocked out power supplies in parts of Kharkiv, Ukraine's
second city.Authorities were still trying to establish information on the scale of the destruction and any casualties. Mayor Ihor Terekhov said there may be disruptions to heating and the electricity and water supply.French President Emmanuel Macron is considering stripping Vladimir Putin of his French Legion of Honor medal after bestowing the same honor on Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday, which symbolized France's ""immense"" recognition of Ukraine's valor.Late French President Jacques Chirac awarded Putin the medal in 2006. Some French activists and lawmakers have called on Macron to revoke the honor because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.On Friday, Macron said such a decision ""has serious meaning, and it should be taken at the right moment.""He noted that he has previously rescinded the honor from certain individuals, such as in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to address a meeting of some 30 sports ministers on Friday to discuss the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.The International Olympic Committee is working on a plan to allow athletes who haven't actively supported the war to participate under a neutral flag, but Zelenskyy previously said any such banner would still be ""stained with blood.""Zelenskyy's push for a total ban has met some support from the likes of Poland and the United Kingdom, among others.""We must make clear there are consequences to this illegal invasion,"" said British Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer, who is chairing the meeting.""We cannot allow Russian athletes to line up alongside Team GB (the British Olympic team) and everyone else on the world stage.""The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has also called for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be barred from the 2024 Olympics in her city if the war is still going on by then.After Western powers agreed to send main battle tanks to Ukraine as part of a ""tank coalition,"" Ukraine is now asking for fighter jets. DW looks at Zelenskyy's lastest requests during his recent trip to three European capitals.Several European nations have supported a Ukrainian proposal to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes from next year's Olympic Games in Paris.

""Thank you, everyone.''He had been forced to drink his own urine, ""I was able to survive that way,'' he said.In the Samandag district of Hatay province, a 10-year-old boy was saved with his mother, and in the same area, a seven-year-old girl named Asya Donmez was rescued after 95 hours and taken to hospital.Turkish state broadcaster TRT reported about 8,000 people had been rescued from the rubble in Turkey so far.In Syria, some 3,000 volunteers are searching for survivors.""Tears of joy and cheers for life. With each case of rescue, we rise again motivated,"" the rescue organization tweeted late Thursday.Turkey's Disaster and Management Authority (AFAD) said more than 1,509 aftershocks had been recorded since Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake.Nations across the globe had sent search and rescue teams, doctors, field hospitals and aid materials to quake-hit regions.The Foreign Ministry said 95 countries have offered help, and nearly 7,000 rescue personnel had been sent to assist.But the chances of finding survivors in the freezing temperatures are dimming after what Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as the ""disaster of the century.""Here are other updates on the aftermath of the deadly earthquake on Friday, February 10:Germany delivered 50 tonnes of relief to Turkey on Thursday, and another three plane loads were headed to quake-stricken areas on Friday.This will ""continue over the next few days,"" Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius said during a visit with German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser to the Wunstorf air base.Another plane loaded with ""winter clothing, blankets, food, and hygiene items, which are most urgently needed on the ground,"" also took off from Frankfurt on Friday, Lufthansa Cargo said.The aid was collected by Turkish communities living in Germany and Lufthansa Cargo employees.The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said that 14 trucks carrying humanitarian aid had crossed into northern Syria from Turkey.""These convoys are carrying electric heaters, tents, blankets, and other items to assist these people who have been displaced as a result of this catastrophic earthquake,"" said spokesperson Paul Dillon, adding that the aid was bound for Idlib.The aid includes blankets, mattresses, tents, shelter materials, basic relief items, and solar lamps for at least 5,000 people.Friday's convoy follows a day after the first UN aid convoy arrived in opposition-held northwest Syria on Thursday.The World Food Programme (WFP) has called  for the opening of more border crossings from Turkey to northwest Syria.The UN's food agency is running out of stock in the opposition-held area.""Northwest Syria, where 90% of the population depends on humanitarian assistance, is a big concern.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806556,Cricket: WPL means T20 World Cup is start of new era,"""You talk about glass ceilings, and I think the Women's Premier League is going to be the next big stage.""The words of New Zealand captain Sophie Devine as the T20 World Cup begins in South Africa, are a reminder of the lingering impact of those nine surreal days in early January 2023 when the face of women's cricket changed forever.The Women's Indian Premier League (WPL), India's domestic, franchise-based, 20-over cricket tournament, saw the linear and digital rights bought by Viacom 18 for just over €108 million ($116.7 million) for the first five seasons. This instantly made the WPL the second-most expensive sports league in the world after the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and the second-biggest T20 domestic league across the world after the men's edition of the tournament, the Indian Premier League (IPL).Given that the IPL was formed in 2008, the arrival of the women's equivalent 15 years later is a reminder of how hard women's cricket has had to work against claims the product is not good enough and cannot generate as much as a men's model so should not expect an equal amount of investment.Indeed in 2018, then-India captain Mithali Raj, one of the most individually decorated players in the women's game, was worried a series of non-competitive, low-scoring matches would taint the product and pour further scorn on women's cricket.However, in the five years since Raj's comments, women's cricket has exploded. India made the final of the 2020 T20 World Cup in Australia, and although they lost the game they did so in front of over 85,000 spectators in Melbourne.Viacom 18's investment of approximately €808,000 ($866,000) per game is a wager on the potential of the women's game. The decision is changing the game for players across the world.West Indies all-rounder Hayley Matthews praised India's governing body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BBCI), for the work they are doing for women's cricket worldwide.""It is quite clear at the moment that the BCCI and the Women's IPL has set some pretty big standards for the women's game,"" Matthews told DW. ""Women's cricket has been growing so fast and the boys are starting to realize that you can make a huge investment in the women's game if you want to watch it grow.""In October last year, it was the BCCI who announced in a landmark decision, that women cricketers would be paid the same international match fee as their male counterparts.""This will change a lot, not only for the players that will play in the competition but hopefully it creates some pressure on other countries to really step up with their renumeration for players in the international game as well,"" Matthews said.International contracts remain limited for those outside of Australia, England and India but the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA) announced in early February that since 2020 opportunities to earn a living from playing international cricket as a woman have grown by 75%.New Zealand fast bowler Lea Tahuhu, who made her debut aged 21 in 2011, has seen the sport she played for passion and very little money turn into a sustainable career choice.The 30-year-old believes the WPL has catapulted the sport into a new league by offering players the ability to earn more across three weeks than they can playing for their country over an entire year.""It will change the way the women's game is going,"" Tahuhu told DW. ""With this amount of money, it is going to have a reach throughout the world and it is going to elevate the women's game even more.""The more players that are going to get paid will mean they are going to be able to put time into training in between ICC sanctioned tournaments. It is going to drive the skill up of the women's game and that's what we want to see.""Many of the players competing at the T20 World Cup in South Africa will likely have half an eye on the inaugural WPL player action that is due to take place not long after the tournament starts.That won't be the case for the 15 Pakistan players though. Since the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, heightened political relations between India and Pakistan have largely stopped the countries competing against each other outside of official ICC tournaments and the Asia Cup. With many male Pakistan players routinely overlooked since the inaugural 2008 IPL, player agents stopped the women from registering for the WPL auction for fear of the same treatment.While the predicament for the Pakistan players cannot be overlooked, the arrival of the WPL remains a groundbreaking moment for female cricketers across the globe. And so when the first ball is bowled at the famed Newlands Cricket Ground under the backdrop of Table Mountain this February, it won't just be the T20 World Cup that is starting but also a completely new era for women's cricket.Edited by: Jonathan Harding",2023/02/10,,

It is not the time to shake hands with Russian athletes. It's not ethical,"" said Gunta Vaicule, a Latvian sprinter and Chairwoman of the Athletes' Commission of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK).The 27-year old is currently preparing for the Games in Paris next year, but the discussion about Russian and Belarusian athletes potentially competing in the world's biggest sporting event makes Vaicule's blood run cold.As a result of the war in Ukraine, athletes from Russia and Belarus have been banned from international competitions. With a few exceptions, such as tennis, this also applies to those competing as neutral athletes. Ukraine threatened an Olympic boycott, but wants to avoid it if Russian and Belarusian athletes can be prevented from competing at the 2024 Games in the French capital.Vaicule, who competed at the 2014 Games in Rio de Janeiro, is not only concerned with her own thoughts on the matter. She sees IOC President Thomas Bach's plan as having a much broader political dimension to the detriment of her country, which borders with Russia and Belarus, and the entire Baltic region.""After February 24 [2022], we Latvians don't feel as safe. We remember what happened to us under the Soviet Union. And I have to do everything in my power to make sure something like that doesn't happen again. I can't stop the war machine, but I have to somehow influence it,"" she said.The highest circles in the Latvian government support Vaicule's views. ""To allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in the next Olympic Games is immoral and wrong,"" emphasized Edgars Rinkevics, Latvia's foreign minister.Should Russia continue their war against Ukraine, it must be isolated. ""Like all tyrannies, Russia uses sport for political purposes. The IOC should not be complicit in Russian propaganda efforts,"" said Rinkevics.In a detailed statement — signed by Zorzs Tikmers, president of the Latvian Olympic Committee (NOC) — the Latvian Olympic Committee also left no doubt about their stance: ""The position of the Latvian Olympic Committee was, is and remains unchanged and fundamental — as long as there is a war in Ukraine, the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in the Olympic Games, regardless of the flag, is not acceptable.""Denmark's culture minister, Jakob Engel-Schmidt, shares the same view. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has even threatened to withdraw her country from the 2024 Games. ""The participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes is simply wrong. So a boycott is a next step,"" she said.Meanwhile, the IOC said the threat of boycotts were contrary to the foundations of the Olympic Movement and the principles they stand for.""A boycott is a violation of the Olympic Charter, which requires all NOCs to participate in the Games of the Olympics by sending athletes,"" read the statement.The path to the Games for Russian and Belarusian athletes could be open, even if only under a neutral flag. A decision has yet to be made though.However, the IOC did say that neutral athletes would have to prove they had ""no identification with their country and NOCs."" How the athletes are to prove their neutrality is still unclear, but criteria for this are being worked out. The IOC also cited that in consultation with federations and athlete representatives a ""large majority of participants"" were in favor of such a move.""If we could identify neutral athletes — that could be a solution. If you could show me a Russian athlete who hasn't received money or support from the Russian government since the beginning of the war and condemns their crimes — then we could consider competing with them,"" said sprinter Vaicule.""The truth is though, that Russia and Belarus use their athletes to build their propaganda machine that fuels the war in Ukraine. They are the weapons of their government.""Like Latvia, sports federations in Northern Europe are opposed to the possible return of athletes from Russia and Belarus.""The situation with the war in Ukraine hasn't changed,"" wrote the National Olympic Committee, the Paralympic Committee and the sports federations of the nordic countries in a joint letter at the end of January 2023 to the IOC. The leaders of the federations of in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden as well as Aland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands all signed the letter.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has also stepped into the debate, telling French media in early February that athletes should be banned ""while war continues.""The political resistance is big. And Poland, which has direct borders with Belarus and Ukraine, cannot imagine a clash of the respective athletes in Paris either.""We want the Olympics to be held without Russians and Belarusians, but not without Poles, Ukrainians or Latvians,"" Kamil Bortniczuk, Poland's sports minister, told Polish radio station RMF FM, referring to a possible boycott of the Paris Olympics. ""The Russian team has never been neutral and never will be. If the IOC thinks it will be different this time, it is naive.""For Russia, sports is part of the propaganda machine.""That's what we're pointing to in our informal discussions,"" said Bortniczuk, who apparently can think of other, more rigorous options. ""I think the ultimatum is the hardest card we have. So we will pull it if there is no other option. I think we still have so much time that we should give the IOC a chance to self-reflect.""On Friday, 40 European sports ministers are due to meet in London, where the IOC request will be discussed.""I think we will emphasize very strongly in the statement we deliver after the meeting (on Friday) that participation would be a victory for the Russians,"" Bortniczuk said. And that should be prevented in any case.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/09,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806560,"Biden, Lula focus on democracy, climate during visit","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met at the White House on Friday and reflected on how their nations were tested in their respective battles to preserve democracy, with the U.S. president declaring that democracy ultimately “prevailed” over the far-right mobs that stormed their governments’ halls of power in an attempt to overturn election victories.

            Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in a fraught 2020 race, securing victory with thin margins in several battleground states. In Brazil’s recent election, its tightest since its return to democracy over three decades ago, Lula, the leftist leader of the Workers' Party, squeaked out a win against right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who earned the nickname “Trump of the Tropics” and was an outspoken admirer of the former U.S. president. 

            Both Trump and Bolsonaro sowed doubts about the vote, without presenting evidence, but their claims nevertheless resonated with their most die-hard supporters. In the U.S. Capitol, Trump supporters staged the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection seeking to prevent Biden's win from being certified. Last month, thousands of rioters stormed the Brazilian capital aiming to oust the newly-inaugurated Lula. 











            “Both our nations’ strong democracies have been tested of late ... very much tested,” Biden said at the start of their Oval Office meeting. “But both in the United States and Brazil, democracy prevailed.” 

            Lula said that he was moving to restore Brazil on the world stage after Bolsonaro's term.

            “Brazil marginalized itself for four years,” Lula said. “His world started and ended with fake news.”

            Biden joked that Lula’s complaint “sounds familiar,” an apparent knock on Trump.

            Both Biden and Lula sought to spotlight that Brazil’s democracy remains resilient and that relations between the Americas’ two biggest democracies are back on track.

            The leaders also discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, insecurity in Haiti, migration and climate change, including efforts to stem deforestation of the Amazon, according to the White House. 

            During his 2020 run for the White House, Biden proposed working with global partners to create a $20 billion fund that would encourage Brazil to change its approach to the Amazon, and there was speculation that the U.S. administration would use the visit to announce a major contribution. But following the meeting, the leaders said in joint statement that the Biden administration only “announced its intent to work with Congress to provide funds for programs to protect and conserve the Brazilian Amazon, including initial support for the Amazon Fund.”

            The Amazon Fund is the most important international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, raising donations for efforts to prevent, monitor and combat deforestation and promote sustainability. 

            The fund has mostly been financed by Norway, and has received a total $1.29 billion. In 2019, Bolsonaro dissolved the steering committee that selects sustainable projects to finance. He argued the rainforest is a domestic affair. In response, Germany and Norway froze their donations. After Lula took office, Germany’s government announced a fresh donation.

            Climate was a prominent topic in two recent phone calls between the leaders since Lula's October victory, according to the White House.

            After their meeting Friday, reporters asked Lula whether the U.S. would join the initiative. Lula responded that he believes so and that its participation is necessary.

            “I didn’t specifically discuss an Amazon Fund. I discussed the need for rich countries to assume the responsibility of financing all the countries that have forests,” he said, specifically noting Brazil then listing its South American neighbors. 

            But Lula’s biggest objective going into the visit was securing ringing support for the legitimacy of his presidency as unease continues at home. It remains unclear how the animus Bolsonaro generated will be channeled going forward, and some opposition lawmakers allied with the former president are already calling for Lula’s impeachment. Lula sacked the army’s commander, with the defense minister citing “a fracture in the level of trust” in the force’s top levels. 

            “You have the environment and other stuff, but Lula sitting down with Biden is an exercise in coup-proofing Brazil’s democracy,” said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank. “There is still genuine concern in the Brazilian government about the armed forces, and the biggest partner in containing the armed forces is the United States.” 

            Bolsonaro, who is facing several investigations in Brazil, traveled to Florida during the final days of his presidency and has remained there since. He applied late last month for a six-month tourist visa to extend his U.S. stay. A group of Democratic lawmakers urged Biden to expel the former president on the grounds that the U.S. shouldn’t provide safe harbor to would-be authoritarians.

            The White House and State Department have declined to comment on Bolsonaro’s visa status, citing privacy concerns.

            Analysts have noted that Bolsonaro’s absence from Brazil is a welcome change for Lula, and he told CNN earlier Friday that he didn't plan to discuss the former president with Biden.

            Lula also met with several lawmakers, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and union officials before his meeting with Biden.

            “It is enormously important for the future of this planet that we stop the deforestation of the Amazon,"" Sanders said after his meeting. ""Bolsonaro encouraged that in a terrible way. Lula has turned that around, but Brazil is going to need help globally. The issue of the Amazon is not just a Brazilian issue. It’s a global issue.”

            Ukraine marked a divergence between the Lula and Biden. Lula previously said the country was as much to blame for the war as Russia, though he more recently clarified that he thought Russia was wrong to invade. 

            Lula has declined to provide Ukraine with munitions, and he told reporters Friday night that he had proposed to Biden the creation of a group of nations to negotiate peace.

            “I am convinced that we need to find a way out to put an end to this war,” he said. ""The first thing is ending the war, then negotiating what will happen."" 

            Asked about Lula's proposal, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said it is up to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to determine “if and when negotiations are appropriate, and certainly under what circumstances.”

            Biller reported from Rio de JaneiroWASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva met at the White House on Friday and reflected on how their nations were tested in their respective battles to preserve democracy, with the U.S. president declaring that democracy ultimately “prevailed” over the far-right mobs that stormed their governments’ halls of power in an attempt to overturn election victories.Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in a fraught 2020 race, securing victory with thin margins in several battleground states. In Brazil’s recent election, its tightest since its return to democracy over three decades ago, Lula, the leftist leader of the Workers' Party, squeaked out a win against right-wing incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who earned the nickname “Trump of the Tropics” and was an outspoken admirer of the former U.S. president.Both Trump and Bolsonaro sowed doubts about the vote, without presenting evidence, but their claims nevertheless resonated with their most die-hard supporters. In the U.S. Capitol, Trump supporters staged the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection seeking to prevent Biden's win from being certified. Last month, thousands of rioters stormed the Brazilian capital aiming to oust the newly-inaugurated Lula.“Both our nations’ strong democracies have been tested of late ... very much tested,” Biden said at the start of their Oval Office meeting. “But both in the United States and Brazil, democracy prevailed.”Lula said that he was moving to restore Brazil on the world stage after Bolsonaro's term.“Brazil marginalized itself for four years,” Lula said. “His world started and ended with fake news.”Biden joked that Lula’s complaint “sounds familiar,” an apparent knock on Trump.Both Biden and Lula sought to spotlight that Brazil’s democracy remains resilient and that relations between the Americas’ two biggest democracies are back on track.The leaders also discussed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, insecurity in Haiti, migration and climate change, including efforts to stem deforestation of the Amazon, according to the White House.During his 2020 run for the White House, Biden proposed working with global partners to create a $20 billion fund that would encourage Brazil to change its approach to the Amazon, and there was speculation that the U.S. administration would use the visit to announce a major contribution.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806578,Russian court sentences ex-governor to 22 years for murder,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Friday sentenced a former regional governor to 22 years in prison after finding him guilty of murder in a case that triggered massive protests two years ago. 

            Sergei Furgal was convicted of ordering the killing of two business competitors in 2004-2005, before he became the governor of Russia’s far eastern Khabarovsk region, and involvement in the botched attempt to kill another businessman.

            Three other people convicted of involvement in the murders alongside Furgal were handed prison terms ranging from 9 1/2 to 21 years.











            Speaking at his trial, Furgal, 52, insisted on his innocence and denounced the charges against him, saying they were fabricated by rivals “intoxicated by power and money that can destroy anyone.”

            “Aren't you ashamed of delivering that sentence?” Furgal told the judge after hearing the sentence on Friday.

            Earlier this week, he also directly addressed members of the jury, saying they should be ashamed of declaring him guilty on what he described as unfounded charges. 

            Furgal's lawyer, Boris Kozhemyakin, said he would appear the verdict.

            “He considers this sentence absolutely illegal, he never was part of any (criminal) groups, he had nothing to do with incriminating acts,” Kozhemyakin told reporters.

            Furgal, a former businessman, was elected Khabarovsk governor in 2018. He was fired shortly after his arrest in July 2020 and has remained in custody since then.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806579,Corruption endangers world's shrinking fisheries,"WASHINGTON (AP) — As Indonesia’s fisheries minister, Edhy Prabowo was tasked with protecting one of his country’s most precious resources: baby lobsters so tiny one can fit on the tip of a finger.

            The waters off the nation’s many islands and archipelagos had once teemed with lobster. But overfishing in recent decades decimated the crustacean’s population, so much so that fishermen turned to catching the hatchlings. They scooped them up by the thousand and shipped them to Vietnamese lobster farms, where the babies are raised to adulthood and sold mostly to dealers in China to meet its enormous demand for seafood.

            Concerned that such harvesting was harming lobster populations, Indonesia’s fishing ministry in 2016 prohibited the export of the tiny crustaceans. Shortly after taking office, Prabowo lifted the ban. Court documents show that just a month later, in June of 2020, the minister accepted a $77,000 bribe from a seafood supplier to grant it a permit to sell the hatchlings abroad.











            The money kept flowing. In his short stint as minister, Prabowo accepted bribes of nearly $2 million. He was arrested in 2020 by Indonesian authorities, having used the graft to purchase 26 road bikes, Old Navy children’s clothes, Louis Vuitton bags, Rolex watches and two luxury pens. Prabowo, 50, was sentenced to five years in prison for corruption. His attorney declined to comment.

            Prabowo’s case is not an outlier. It's emblematic of the corruption plaguing dozens of coastal developing countries that are key in managing some of the world’s most threatened fishing grounds, according to experts and a review of criminal case files and media reports by the AP.

            At least 45 government officials have been accused of corruption in the past two decades, the AP found. The allegations range from high-ranking officials like Prabowo accepting large payments from fishing companies to obtain lucrative contracts to low-level civil servants accepting a few thousand dollars to ignore fishermen bringing illegal catch ashore.

            “Fisheries corruption can have devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and local communities that may depend on them,” said Ben Freitas, the manager of ocean policy at the World Wildlife Fund, based in Washington.

            “Countries with weak governments that lack oversight and accountability are more susceptible to corruption risk. And that is where fisheries corruption plays a pernicious role in overfishing. It can lead to the over-exploitation of resources. It is a global problem.”

            The situation is most critical in areas managed by developing nations because many industrialized countries have already overfished their own waters, forcing them to dispatch fleets of trawlers across the globe to meet growing seafood demand. People worldwide consume twice as much seafood as they did five decades ago, according to United Nations estimates, and 35% of stocks are considered overfished, up from 10%.

            Many coastal developing countries depend on fish for millions of jobs and to meet the dietary needs of their populations. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime warned in a 2019 report that failing to tackle corruption will lead to “significant financial, environmental and societal damages.""

            Such corruption, the report added, “negatively affects developing countries in particular.”

            Those wishing to conceal their operations or pay bribes to get around restrictions have found fishing to be a welcoming industry.

            Companies have little trouble changing the name or flag state of a fishing boat, and it’s common practice to register vessels under shell companies in Liberia or the Marshall Islands. Scofflaw ships are known to turn off their location tracking devices, offload illegally caught fish to other boats, or “launder” it by mixing it with their standard catch.

            “The lack of accountability, I think, is even greater in the fisheries sector than it is in other environmental-related activities,” said Juhani Grossmann, a program leader at the Basel Institute on Governance, which is working on anti-corruption efforts with Indonesia's Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries.

            At least with illicit lumber operations, Grossmann said, “you don’t have a different shell corporation for every single truck.""

            The AP review found that most cases of corruption and graft were low-level schemes, like one in India in which prosecutors last year alleged two fisheries officers extorted $1,100 to approve subsidies for a fish farm. Another involved fishermen reportedly bribing Malaysian officers with at least $11,000 for every boat they agreed not to report.

            Some are much larger and involve global financial institutions. In 2021, the Swiss bank Credit Suisse admitted to fraudulently financing a massive loan to Mozambique to expand its tuna fishing fleet. A contractor handling the loan paid kickbacks of $150 million to Mozambican government officials.

            Stephen Akester, a fisheries management adviser who has worked in Africa and South Asia for four decades, said there is a long history of foreign companies — particularly from China — forging corrupt relationships with fisheries officials.

            “They exploited the weakness of these governments for whom any kind of revenue was big money, even small dollars,” he said. “And that still continues today.”

            In Gambia, a small West African nation nestled along Senegal’s coast, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries and Water Resources, Bamba Banja, was charged in 2021 with accepting a bribe from a Chinese company to free a vessel detained for illegal fishing.

            According to charging documents, an employee of Golden Lead Company Limited told Gambian authorities that he and another shareholder in 2018 gave Banja 100,000 Gambian dalasi, or about $1,600, to release the ship. The case is ongoing; Banja’s lawyer told the AP that the fisheries secretary denies any wrongdoing.

            Authorities in Namibia allege an Icelandic seafood company paid roughly $6 million in bribes to Namibian officials to be permitted to fish in the country’s waters. The so-called “ Fishrot ” scandal first came to light four years ago; Namibia’s former fisheries minister and justice minister are still on trial and have been banned by the State Department from entering the U.S.

            The Icelandic company Samherji has denied committing crimes. In a 2021 statement, it said there had been “a lot of chaos” in its Namibian operations and many expenses weren’t formally documented.

            Corruption is not limited to developing countries. A top European fisheries official in 2019 was linked to a criminal network that sought to launder illegally caught bluefin tuna that arrived in Spain from Italy and Malta via French ports.

            The director of Malta’s fisheries, Andreina Fenech Farrugia, remains suspended as investigators with the Spanish Civil Guard probe whether she helped the criminal syndicate bypass European Union tuna quotas. According to a transcript of a phone call intercepted by police and published by the newspaper El Confidencial, the fisheries director was heard telling a tuna magnate, “You have to pay me.”

            Spanish authorities declined to comment on the case. Malta’s Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Animal Rights said that Fenech Farrugia was on unpaid leave. She has not been charged with a crime and could not be reached for comment.

            The cases reviewed by AP likely represent a small fraction of the corruption that takes place daily as hauls of seafood are transported and sold around the world.

            Most cases go undetected, said Adam Graycar, a professor of public policy at the University of Adelaide who has spent much of his career studying corruption.

            “You have inspectors colluding with fishing boat owners,"" he said. “Nobody’s going to tell you what’s happening or give you any data.”

            In Ghana, for instance, the fishing ministry has been unmarked by any major corruption scandal. Yet the Environmental Justice Foundation, which has investigated abuses in the fishing sector for two decades, issued a report last year documenting how the West African nation has become ensnared in “a culture of corruption in which bribery and intimidation pervades all levels of fisheries management.”

            “The environmental and social injustices resulting from the current status quo are myriad, with fishing communities disproportionately bearing the burden of a broken system,” the group concluded.

            Kyei Kwadwo Yamoah advocates for better fisheries management in Ghana as convenor of the Fisheries Alliance. In reviewing infractions reported by observers on fishing vessels for a World Bank project in 2016, Yamoah found wide, unexplained gaps in enforcement. The government had penalized some companies, he said, but others were granted a renewed fishing license without question.

            “There was no clarity as to why these vessels were not even booked or sanctioned, while there was a clear case of a breach of law,” Yamoah said.

            Overfishing and illegal fishing have pushed Ghana's fish stocks to near collapse, prompting presidential action and putting the livelihoods and the health of millions of Ghanaians at risk.

            The situation, Yamoah said, is growing dire: Some days fishermen spend all day on the water and come back with nothing.

A contractor handling the loan paid kickbacks of $150 million to Mozambican government officials.Stephen Akester, a fisheries management adviser who has worked in Africa and South Asia for four decades, said there is a long history of foreign companies — particularly from China — forging corrupt relationships with fisheries officials.“They exploited the weakness of these governments for whom any kind of revenue was big money, even small dollars,” he said. “And that still continues today.”In Gambia, a small West African nation nestled along Senegal’s coast, the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries and Water Resources, Bamba Banja, was charged in 2021 with accepting a bribe from a Chinese company to free a vessel detained for illegal fishing.According to charging documents, an employee of Golden Lead Company Limited told Gambian authorities that he and another shareholder in 2018 gave Banja 100,000 Gambian dalasi, or about $1,600, to release the ship. The case is ongoing; Banja’s lawyer told the AP that the fisheries secretary denies any wrongdoing.Authorities in Namibia allege an Icelandic seafood company paid roughly $6 million in bribes to Namibian officials to be permitted to fish in the country’s waters. The so-called “ Fishrot ” scandal first came to light four years ago; Namibia’s former fisheries minister and justice minister are still on trial and have been banned by the State Department from entering the U.S.The Icelandic company Samherji has denied committing crimes. In a 2021 statement, it said there had been “a lot of chaos” in its Namibian operations and many expenses weren’t formally documented.Corruption is not limited to developing countries. A top European fisheries official in 2019 was linked to a criminal network that sought to launder illegally caught bluefin tuna that arrived in Spain from Italy and Malta via French ports.The director of Malta’s fisheries, Andreina Fenech Farrugia, remains suspended as investigators with the Spanish Civil Guard probe whether she helped the criminal syndicate bypass European Union tuna quotas. According to a transcript of a phone call intercepted by police and published by the newspaper El Confidencial, the fisheries director was heard telling a tuna magnate, “You have to pay me.”Spanish authorities declined to comment on the case. Malta’s Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Animal Rights said that Fenech Farrugia was on unpaid leave. She has not been charged with a crime and could not be reached for comment.The cases reviewed by AP likely represent a small fraction of the corruption that takes place daily as hauls of seafood are transported and sold around the world.Most cases go undetected, said Adam Graycar, a professor of public policy at the University of Adelaide who has spent much of his career studying corruption.“You have inspectors colluding with fishing boat owners,"" he said. “Nobody’s going to tell you what’s happening or give you any data.”In Ghana, for instance, the fishing ministry has been unmarked by any major corruption scandal. Yet the Environmental Justice Foundation, which has investigated abuses in the fishing sector for two decades, issued a report last year documenting how the West African nation has become ensnared in “a culture of corruption in which bribery and intimidation pervades all levels of fisheries management.”“The environmental and social injustices resulting from the current status quo are myriad, with fishing communities disproportionately bearing the burden of a broken system,” the group concluded.Kyei Kwadwo Yamoah advocates for better fisheries management in Ghana as convenor of the Fisheries Alliance. In reviewing infractions reported by observers on fishing vessels for a World Bank project in 2016, Yamoah found wide, unexplained gaps in enforcement. The government had penalized some companies, he said, but others were granted a renewed fishing license without question.“There was no clarity as to why these vessels were not even booked or sanctioned, while there was a clear case of a breach of law,” Yamoah said.Overfishing and illegal fishing have pushed Ghana's fish stocks to near collapse, prompting presidential action and putting the livelihoods and the health of millions of Ghanaians at risk.The situation, Yamoah said, is growing dire: Some days fishermen spend all day on the water and come back with nothing.___Associated Press reporters Colleen Barry in Milan, Ciarán Giles in Madrid, Joshua Goodman in Miami, Abdoulie John in Gambia, Sheikh Saaliq in New Delhi, and Edna Tarigan and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta contributed to this report.___Follow the reporters on Twitter: @FuTingBJ, @GraceEkpu and @helenwieffering.Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org or https://www.ap.org/tips/.",2023/02/10,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806580,"Durant, Irving trades signal end of an empty era for Nets","NEW YORK (AP) — James Harden arrived in Brooklyn and predicted his partnership with Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would be “ scary hours.”

            It was over in a New York minute.

            Not just that trio, but an entire era in Brooklyn.











            It ended so quickly, in fact, that when Harden returns to Brooklyn on Saturday for the first time in the regular season, barely a year after he was traded to Philadelphia, he won't find either Durant or Irving waiting.

            Now they're gone. Three superstars came, and one by one asked to be traded. 

            “So it didn’t work,” general manager Sean Marks said. “Some of that is through things we can control and that we can’t control.”

            Durant was the last to leave, traded to Phoenix on Thursday. Irving was dealt to Dallas just days earlier.

            Those two friends had decided to come to Brooklyn together in 2019. Harden joined them early in the 2020-21 season after a trade.

            Durant and Harden had combined for seven scoring titles. All three were perennial All-Stars. The Nets were favored to finally win the championship they've been chasing since joining the NBA.

            “We had James and we were supposed to be this super team,"" Irving said. ""We played very limited time together and there were a lot of injuries and things that took place. I would have liked to see that work for the long term, but there are no mistakes, no coincidences.”

            Nor was there anything close to a championship. 

            There were illness and injuries, so sometimes they just couldn't play.

            In Irving's case, sometimes he just wouldn't.

            The bottom line is Durant, Irving and Harden played just 16 games together, winning one playoff series.

            “We’ve had a lot of frustration here with not being able to get that group on the court consistently and seeing what it really looks like,” Marks said. “I think that’s one of the biggest frustrations, where we really didn’t see them and what they could look like.”

            It looked awesome at its peak. The Nets rolled past Boston in five games in the first round of the 2021 playoffs and overpowered Milwaukee in the first two games of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

            But Harden strained his hamstring early in that series and Irving sprained his ankle in Game 4. The Bucks would rally and win the series with an overtime victory in Game 7 in Brooklyn and go on to win the championship.

            The Nets figured to be favorites again in 2021-22, but the season was derailed right from the preseason when Irving refused to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. That meant he was ineligible to play in home games and the Nets at first said he wouldn't play at all until he could play in all their games.

            Eventually, they brought him back in January to play on the road, but by then Harden had become disillusioned. He asked out and the Nets sent him to the 76ers in a deal that brought back Ben Simmons on Feb. 10, 2022.

            After they were swept in the first round by Boston, Durant asked to be traded, frustrated in part by the Nets' 5-16 record while he was sidelined by a sprained knee ligament. Around the same time, the Nets were refusing to give Irving a contract extension, having grown to question his reliability and forcing him to opt into the final year of his deal.

            Durant eventually withdrew that, but they couldn't convince him to stay once Irving asked to be traded last week and the Nets quickly accommodated the point guard. Marks didn't want to say if Durant's desire to leave was due to Irving's departure.

            “I don’t want to speak for the guys that are no longer here and why they left,” Marks said.

            The Nets still have a chance to be a playoff team. They are 33-22, fifth in the East, having gotten as high as second after ripping off an 18-2 stretch earlier this season when Durant and Irving enjoyed perhaps their best run together.

            Mikal Bridges and Cam Johnson from Phoenix, and Spencer Dinwiddie and Dorian Finney-Smith from Dallas all should fit well with the Nets' style of play under Jacque Vaughn and strengthen the team defensively. The draft picks they acquired along with them will provide options to shape the roster.

            But it almost always takes having superstars on the roster to win an NBA title. The Nets had three. 

            “For the last couple of years, we have been a team that you could have said if things go right — health, whatever, consistency, continuity on the court — they have a chance to win a championship, you know, purely from talent,” Marks said. 

            Those days, and now Durant and Irving, are gone.

            “They’re taking their talents elsewhere,” Marks said, “and like all other basketball fans, we’ll be watching from afar. But our focus now is the guys in the locker room.”

Awards to recognise father-friendly workplaces               Organised by the Centre for Fathering (CFF), DADs for Life and MUMs for Life, the Great Companies for Dads Awards is Singapore's first award to recognise outstanding organisations with policies and practices that support fathers and help them thrive at home as they do at the workplace. It is organised in partnership with Families for Life and in support of Made For Families. Into its second edition this year, the awards was launched in 2021 by President Halimah and recipients were selected based on the following criteria:               Demonstration of innovative policies on parental and paternity leave that go beyond stipulated legislation;                 Demonstration of policies benefitting Dads such as shared parenting initiatives, flexible work arrangements and Dads support networks and resources; and                 Adoption of Centre for Fathering, DADs for Life and Families for Life initiatives and programmes such as Eat With Your Family Day and parenting workshops.                   Employers play an important role               “Employers play a critical role in supporting families as better work-life integration for employees leads to happier and stronger families. Relationships are one of the most important things to humans. By giving employees quality time to spend with people that matters the most to them, employers are creating a ripple effect that makes employees more motivated to work for the companies. This benefits the company through increased productivity, greater staff engagement and lower turnover. The Great Companies for Dads Awards motivate organisations to continually help their employees, especially Dads, achieve balance between work and family,” said Speaker of Parliament Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, who is also the patron for CFF, DADs for Life and MUMs for Life.             Mr Bryan Tan, CEO of CFF, DADs for Life and MUMs for Life, added, “It’s very encouraging to see these organisations putting in place exemplary human resource policies and workplace practices, that supersede all required stipulations. Parents, specifically Dads, are very well supported at these companies. Many fathers there can become more involved and engaged with their children, which brings benefits to the children’s well-being and marital relationships, thereby strengthening families. This would set Singapore up to be known to the world as being Made For Families!”             Mr Ishak Ismail, Families for Life Council Chairman, said “I am heartened that organisations are embracing a family-friendly culture and doing more to support their employees. Juggling work and family demands can be challenging for parents, and we need a whole-of-society effort to strengthen our families and build a stronger society. I hope that the awards will motivate more companies to implement family-friendly policies and practices at the workplace so we can forge a more inclusive and caring Singapore where families can thrive.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806586,Boeing says Taiwan aviation market will keep growing in 2023,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwan aviation market will continue to grow in 2023, with travel throughout Asia leading the way, according to a Boeing executive on Friday (Feb. 10).

            Speaking at press conference in Taipei, Managing Director of Marketing David Schulte said flights to and from Taiwan have continued to grow steadily over the past couple of years and have reached 75% of pre-pandemic levels. Schulte said that looking at schedules for the rest of the year, Taiwanese airlines are adding a lot of growth to the market.

            He noted a 340% jump in flights from Taiwan to the rest of Asia this year, a 240% growth in flights to North America, and a 250% growth in flights to Europe. With Beijing lifting its border restrictions, Boeing sees air traffic between Taiwan and China recovering to 31% of pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter.

            Meanwhile, global air travel has recovered to 75% compared to 2019 levels, with North America leading the way at 92%, followed by 90% in Latin America, 89% in the Middle East, and 87% in Europe, while Asia and Oceania are at 57%. For the Asia-Pacific region, Schulte said the company expects air traffic to recover to 2019 levels in 2024/2025.











            Boeing said Northeast Asia (Taiwan, Japan, and S. Korea) will need 1,345 new airplanes by 2041, with 55% of these planes being single-aisle and 41% being widebody aircraft. Schulte pointed out that most of these aircraft deliveries will be for replacements.

            Throughout the pandemic, Boeing realized the need for dedicated freighters, especially for the Northeast Asia region, Schulte said. As the world exits the pandemic, Boeing still sees the need for dedicated freighters, but as passenger traffic recovers there will be more lower-hold belly capacity returning to the cargo market.

            Over the next 20 years, Boeing said the Asia Pacific region will account for 38% of freighter deliveries, followed by North America at 32%, Europe at 16%, and the Middle East and Africa at 9%.

            Back in 2018, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) had originally been tapped to provide chips to Flex Logic that were to be used by Boeing. However, it ended up losing the deal to Global Foundries over security concerns and tensions between the U.S. and China, according to EE Times.

            When asked by Taiwan News if Boeing would look to source chips from TSMC’s upcoming Phoenix fabs, the company said it could not say for sure now. It would continue to evaluate its suppliers to stabilize the supply chain.

            Schulte wrapped up by saying that while Asia lags global trends in air travel recovery, it expects the market to continue to rebound throughout 2023.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Taiwan aviation market will continue to grow in 2023, with travel throughout Asia leading the way, according to a Boeing executive on Friday (Feb. 10).Speaking at press conference in Taipei, Managing Director of Marketing David Schulte said flights to and from Taiwan have continued to grow steadily over the past couple of years and have reached 75% of pre-pandemic levels.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806596,EU lawmaker held for questioning in corruption scandal,"BRUSSELS (AP) — A EU lawmaker linked to a corruption scandal that rocked the bloc's Parliament in December was detained for questioning as police conducted further raids, Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said Friday.

            The office said police searched a banking safe in the city of Liege belonging to Belgian lawmaker Marc Tarabella. Offices in the town hall of Anthisnes, where Tarabella serves as mayor, were also raided.

            The European Union’s parliament earlier this month removed Tarabella's protective immunity to ensure he could be questioned by investigators. The assembly voted overwhelmingly to lift his parliamentary protection as well as that of another lawmaker, Italian Andrea Cozzolino. 











            Both men have said through their lawyers that they were willing to cooperate with Belgian authorities.

            The prosecutor's office said Taraballa was detained for questioning, adding that it was now up to the investigating judge to decide whether he would be heard within the next hours.

            Tarabella has denied any links to the scandal, in which Qatari and Moroccan officials are suspected of offering bribes to influence decisions at the European Parliament. Qatar and Morocco have also vehemently denied involvement, but the assembly has suspended work on all Qatar-related files.

            According to the report compiled to lift Taraballa’s immunity, a Belgian investigation showed that he “may have been involved in acts of corruption connected with interference by one or more foreign states aimed at influencing the debates and decisions taken in the European Parliament.”

            It said that “testimony against him suggests that such payments were made to him on several occasions, amounting to a total of between” 120,000 and 140,000 euros ($132,00 and $154,000).

            The scandal came to light in early December after authorities launched a series of raids across Brussels, and in Italy, seizing hundreds of thousands of euros.

            Four people were charged with corruption, money laundering and membership in a criminal organization. They are Greek lawmaker Eva Kaili, who was an assembly vice president until the charges came to light; her partner and parliamentary assistant Francesco Giorgi; former Italian lawmaker Pier Antonio Panzeri; and the head of a charity group, Niccolo Figa-Talamanca.

            Panzeri has since reached an agreement with Belgian prosecutors to act as an informant. He has promised to reveal the names of those involved and how money might have been moved around, in exchange for a lighter sentence.BRUSSELS (AP) — A EU lawmaker linked to a corruption scandal that rocked the bloc's Parliament in December was detained for questioning as police conducted further raids, Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said Friday.The office said police searched a banking safe in the city of Liege belonging to Belgian lawmaker Marc Tarabella.

Qatar and Morocco have also vehemently denied involvement, but the assembly has suspended work on all Qatar-related files.According to the report compiled to lift Taraballa’s immunity, a Belgian investigation showed that he “may have been involved in acts of corruption connected with interference by one or more foreign states aimed at influencing the debates and decisions taken in the European Parliament.”It said that “testimony against him suggests that such payments were made to him on several occasions, amounting to a total of between” 120,000 and 140,000 euros ($132,00 and $154,000).The scandal came to light in early December after authorities launched a series of raids across Brussels, and in Italy, seizing hundreds of thousands of euros.Four people were charged with corruption, money laundering and membership in a criminal organization. They are Greek lawmaker Eva Kaili, who was an assembly vice president until the charges came to light; her partner and parliamentary assistant Francesco Giorgi; former Italian lawmaker Pier Antonio Panzeri; and the head of a charity group, Niccolo Figa-Talamanca.Panzeri has since reached an agreement with Belgian prosecutors to act as an informant. He has promised to reveal the names of those involved and how money might have been moved around, in exchange for a lighter sentence.",2023/02/10,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806598,Pro-Western Recean set to succeed Moldova's PM who resigned,"CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Moldova’s president tapped her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Recean, to succeed Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita who unexpectedly resigned Friday, 18 months into a tenure sorely tested by the war in neighboring Ukraine.

            President Maia Sandu told a news conference that members of Gavrilita's ruling Party of Action and Solidarity, or PAS, accepted her choice of Recean as the new prime minister.

            Recean, 48, who served as interior minister between 2012-2015, will have 15 days to form a new government to present to Parliament for a confidence vote. PAS has a majority in Parliament.











            “I know that we need unity and a lot of work to get through the difficult period we are facing. The difficulties of 2022 postponed some of our plans, but they did not stop us,” President Sandu said, adding that in 2023 she wants to focus on revamping key areas such as Moldova’s economy and justice sector.

            Since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly a year ago, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought to forge closer ties with its Western partners. Last June, it was granted European Union candidate status, the same day as Ukraine.

            Recean said he would “proceed immediately” with setting up a new government and that his main focus will be to introduce “order and discipline” in Moldova’s institutions, breathe new life into the economy and ensure peace and stability.

            Following her resignation, Gavrilita, a 41-year-old economist appointed prime minister in August 2021, told a news conference that her government “would have been able to move forward more and faster” had it garnered the same support and trust domestically as it did from other European countries.

            Gavrilita’s premiership was marked by a long string of problems. These include an acute energy crisis after Moscow dramatically reduced supplies to Moldova and skyrocketing inflation in the wake of the war in Ukraine. Compounding that has been missiles from the war that have traversed its skies and missile debris that has been discovered on its territory.

            She also said that no one expected her government “would have to manage so many crises caused by Russian aggression in Ukraine.”

            “I took over the government with an anti-corruption, pro-development and pro-European mandate at a time when corruption schemes had captured all the institutions and the oligarchs felt untouchable,” Gavrilita said. “We were immediately faced with energy blackmail, and those who did this hoped that we would give in.”

            “The bet of the enemies of our country was that we would act like previous governments, who gave up energy interests, who betrayed the national interest in exchange for short-term benefits,” she added.

            On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed another missile briefly crossed the country’s skies from the war next door, State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that “Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova, which often involve weaponizing corruption to further its goals.”

            Sandu thanked Gavrilita on Friday for her “enormous sacrifice and efforts to lead the country in a time of so many crises.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806599,Super Bowl ads keep it light by using nostalgia and stars,"NEW YORK (AP) — Super Bowl ads are more than just breaks between gameplay during the biggest sporting event of the year: They offer a glimpse of the country’s zeitgeist, along with how major industries are faring. 

            This year, crypto ads and automakers are advertising less since those industries are facing problems. Major food brands like M&Ms, tech companies like Google, streaming services including Peacock and more alcohol brands have jumped in to take their place.

            When Super Bowl LVII kicks off Sunday night with the Kansas City Chiefs taking on the Philadelphia Eagles in Glendale, Arizona, big marketers will be battling it out during the Fox broadcast as well.











            Their prize? The chance to capture the attention of more than 100 million viewers expected to tune in for the big game. This price of entry is steep: Some advertisers are paying more than $7 million for a 30-second spot, and that doesn't include the cost of making the ad itself.

            This year, viewers can expect stars galore, light humor and catchy songs. For the most part, advertisers are steering away from somber messages or outrageous humor that might have worked to capture attention in decades past, but not now, when the country is still emerging from the pandemic, facing economic uncertainty, and the war continues in Ukraine.

            “This year is a ‘don’t worry be happy’ year,” said Kelly O’Keefe, CEO of Brand Federation. ""You name it, we've had it all and its put us in almost depressed situation. This year people are over it and advertisers are responding really well —there are traditional brands, traditional humor and its going to feel like just a big old group hug.”

            WHO'S STARRING?

            Stars are commonplace in Super Bowl ads, but over the past few years ads have been more and more stuffed with celebrities. This year is no exception. 

            Popular celebrities offer goodwill to a brand and help it stand out from the 50-plus or so advertisers during the big game. But with so many stars in ads, it can be harder stand out in a crowded field.

            “If you use celebrity in a smart way, it's huge,” said Rich Weinstein, a professor at VCU Brandcenter. ""But with all of these celebrities, are people going to remember who each celebrity is attached to?"" 

            Big names making a splash this year: Melissa McCarthy sings a jingle for Booking.com, Miles Teller dances to hold music for Bud Light and Adam Driver makes multiples of himself for Squarespace. Avocados From Mexico enlists Anna Faris for one of the few slightly risque ads this year, that envisions a present where everyone is naked — including the Statue of Liberty. And tennis star Serena Williams stars in two ads: one for Michelob Ultra and one for Remy Martin. It's the second year in a row she has had a presence in more than one ad: Last year, in addition to a Michelob Ultra ad, she starred in an ad for smart home-gym maker Tonal. Even hip hop mogul P. Diddy appears in an ad, in which he tries to make a hit for Uber One.

            One unusual star this year: Jesus. A group of Christian donors is paying top dollar for two ads that promote the “He Gets Us” religious message.

            WHICH ADS ARE THROWBACKS?

            Another tactic that advertisers use to win over viewers is recreating beloved movies and TV shows. This year, online shopping site Rakuten is making a splash by enlisting Alicia Silverstone and Elisa Donovan to recreate a scene from 90s rom-com “Clueless.” Popcorners, a snack brand from Frito-Lay, brought back “Breaking Bad,” which first aired in 2008, with stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.

            Other advertisers trying to capitalize on favorite content from years past: T-Mobile's ad shows John Travolta singing a T-Mobile home internet-themed version of “Summer Nights” from “Grease” with “Scrubs” stars Donald Faison and Zach Braff. And finally, Michelob Ultra evoked “Caddyshack” by setting its ad at the Bushwood Country Club that's in the movie.

            The nostalgia fits the mood of the times, Weinstein said. 

            “Consumers are looking for a good laugh and to feel comfortable,"" Weinstein said. ”It's less about living in the problems the world faces today and more about leaning into nostalgia and having fun.""

            DO STUNTS WORK?

            Some first-time advertisers have decided to lean into stunts and gimmicks to make their first foray into the big game stand out. The most notable is Fan Duel, which hired four-time All-Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski to try to make a field goal live during an ad in the third quarter. If he makes it, anyone who places a Super Bowl bet of $5 or more on FanDuel will win a share of $10 million in free bets. 

            A blockchain-based gaming company, Limit Break, plans to run a QR code during the first commercial break of the game and will give away non-fungible tokens to people who scan it. And for its first national Super Bowl ad, Molson Coors asked people to bet on aspects of its commercial, like whether it will feature Miller Lite or Coors Light.

            Kim Whitler, a professor at the Darden School of business, said stunts don't always translate to positive sales results or brand recognition for brands.

            “People want to do stunts because stunts get attention,” she said. “But at the end of the day, the ad has to communicate something that's unique or better about the brand.”

            WHICH ADS WILL BE GAME-TIME SURPRISES?

            While many advertisers have released ads ahead of the game, there are always some surprises. Dunkin' Donuts is running an ad that reportedly will star Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, although the brand hasn't confirmed that. Stellantis, which owns car brands Jeep and Ram, will run two undisclosed ads. And M&Ms has kept its advertising under wraps after declaring that its candy spokescharacters were on pause — they're likely to make an appearance during the game, however.NEW YORK (AP) — Super Bowl ads are more than just breaks between gameplay during the biggest sporting event of the year: They offer a glimpse of the country’s zeitgeist, along with how major industries are faring.This year, crypto ads and automakers are advertising less since those industries are facing problems.

Firstly, the aging population in Canada is driving demand for home healthcare services, as older individuals are seeking care in the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, the Canadian government is supportive of home healthcare and provides funding for these services, further fueling growth. Furthermore, advances in technology are enabling more effective and efficient delivery of care in the home setting.However, there are also some challenges facing the Canadian home healthcare market.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806640,Dutch-owned grid operator mulls sale to German government,"BERLIN (AP) — A state-owned Dutch company that is Germany's biggest electricity grid operator said Friday that it plans to hold talks on selling its entire German business to the government in Berlin, which welcomed the announcement.

            TenneT, which is one of four transmission network operators in Germany, pointed to the need to find a “structural solution” to funding needs for its German business as the grid is bolstered to handle the transition to renewable energy, which it put at about 15 billion euros ($16.1 billion). 

            TenneT operates electricity grids across a large swath of Germany, from the North Sea coast to Bavaria in the south. Those transmission lines are crucial for Germany’s plans to completely shift its power production from fossil fuels to renewable energy by 2045 at the latest.











            At present, some of the electricity generated by wind farms in the north of the country can’t be dispatched to consumers in the south due to lack of transmission capacity.

            The German government said at the end of November that it was considering taking a stake in TenneT. It already has a minority stake in rival grid operator 50 Hertz, via the state-owned KfW investment bank.

            In a statement Friday, TenneT said it “intends to engage in discussions with the German government, to explore the possibility of a full sale of TenneT’s German activities on acceptable terms.”

            The company, which also operates the Netherlands' grid, said it “acknowledges that both the Dutch and German government prefer to fund, control and own their national electricity grid.”

            In Berlin, Economy Ministry spokeswoman Beate Baron welcomed the move but wouldn't give details of a possible deal, citing ongoing talks with the Dutch government.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806641,Ethiopia's social media blocked amid church split tensions,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Widespread tensions caused by a rift within Ethiopia's Orthodox Christian church have resulted in the suspension of access to social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook and Telegram.

            The internet observatory NetBlocks confirmed social media platforms had been “restricted in Ethiopia amid anti-government protests” as of Thursday evening.

            The church, which recently denounced a splinter group in the country’s largest region as “illegal,” has accused Ethiopia’s government of interfering in its affairs. It has threatened to go forward with a rally on Sunday despite a government warning. Social media users were calling on church followers to take part.











            The division within the church, followed by the majority of Ethiopia’s more than 110 million people, came after church members in Oromia declared a new synod on Jan. 22, claiming a need to exercise their faith in local languages. The church ex-communicated several church officials who participated in the split.

            Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has urged church members to solve their differences and said the government will not get involved. But many followers of the church are accusing the prime minister, an ethnic Oromo and a Protestant, of undermining the church and siding with the breakaway synod.

            On Friday, the church said talks were ongoing between Abiy and the church patriarch over the controversy that has engulfed many parts of the country.

            Earlier in the week, several dozen cities and towns, mostly in Oromia and the outskirts of the capital, Addis Ababa, saw sometimes violent rallies.

            On Friday, the government-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said at least eight people were killed by security forces in Shaashamane in the Oromia region on Saturday. It said many people were arrested.

            The government in a statement Thursday accused unnamed groups of aiming to “shake the government using armed violence.” It said the government has begun “bringing to justice (those) who are taking part in the movement.”NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Widespread tensions caused by a rift within Ethiopia's Orthodox Christian church have resulted in the suspension of access to social media platforms including TikTok, Facebook and Telegram.The internet observatory NetBlocks confirmed social media platforms had been “restricted in Ethiopia amid anti-government protests” as of Thursday evening.The church, which recently denounced a splinter group in the country’s largest region as “illegal,” has accused Ethiopia’s government of interfering in its affairs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806642,"Israeli police: 2 killed, 5 wounded in Jerusalem car-ramming","JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian plowed a car into a crowded bus stop in east Jerusalem on Friday, killing two people, including a 6-year-old, and injuring five others before being shot and killed, Israeli police and medics said, the latest escalation as violence grips the contested capital.

            The car-ramming took place in Ramot, a Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem. Tensions have soared in the Israeli-annexed eastern half of the city, following a Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue on Jan. 27 that killed seven people in the deadliest attack in Jerusalem in over a decade. 

            The Israeli rescue service identified the two killed as a six-year-old boy and a man in his 20s. It said medics were treating five injured, including an eight-year-old child in critical condition undergoing CPR. Others, ages ranging from 10 to 40, were in moderate to serious condition. They had been waiting at the bus stop before the car came crashing to a stop, police said.











            “It was a shocking scene,” said paramedic Lishai Shemesh who happened to be driving by at the time of the attack. “I was in the car with my wife and children and noticed a car driving fast into the bus stop and crushing the people who were waiting there.""

            An off-duty detective shot and killed the suspected attacker at the scene, police added, describing him as a Palestinian in his 30s from east Jerusalem. Palestinian media identified him as 32-year-old Hussein Qaraqa.

            Speaking from the scene of the suspected attack, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, ordered police to set up checkpoints around the driver's neighborhood of Issawiya to “check every vehicle.""

            “I wanted to to create a full blockade (on the area), but there is a judicial question around it,” he added.

            Israel’s largely ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, expressed shock and offered condolences to the families of the victims. “Our hearts are pained by the terrible news,” he said.

            The Islamic militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the rampage but did not immediately claim responsibility. Footage from the scene showed police and paramedics swarming a mangled blue Mazda that had slammed into the bus stop. Bodies lay strewn along the way. 

            As an immediate measure, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant imposed financial sanctions on 87 Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem, seizing millions of dollars from people involved in violence against Israel who receive payments from the Palestinian Authority, as well as their families.

            The PA payments to prisoners' families have been a central issue in Israel’s punitive measures against the Palestinians in recent months. The new Israeli government decided to recently to deduct the sums the PA had paid to prisoners from tax revenue Israel transfers to the cash-strapped PA.

            The Palestinian Authority says these payments as a necessary social welfare while Israel says the so-called Martyrs’ Fund incentivizes violence.

            Meanwhile, the United States condemned the attack in Jerusalem. “ The deliberate targeting of innocent civilians is repugnant and unconscionable,” a statement by the State Department said.

            Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as a capital of their future state.

            Hostilities have increased in east Jerusalem and the West Bank since Israel stepped up raids in the occupied territory last spring, following a series of deadly Palestinian attacks within Israel. 

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those territories since 2004, according to leading Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Last year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.

            So far this year, 43 Palestinians have been killed, according to a count by The Associated Press — 10 of them in a gunfight last month during an army raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank.

            Israel's new far-right government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, had accused the previous government of inaction in the face of a deadly wave of Palestinian assaults last year, stirring questions about its stance toward the Palestinians at this time of heightened tension.

            Netanyahu's office said he dispatched more police forces to the area and directed them to arrest those in the driver's ""circle."" He and Ben-Gvir called for the immediate sealing of the assailant's home ahead of its planned demolition. 

            Israel defends such home demolitions of Palestinian attackers' family homes as a deterrent meant to prevent future attacks. But human rights groups criticize the practice as collective punishment, prohibited by international law, leaving relatives homeless who had nothing to do with the attack. 

            The new government has announced its intention to accelerate the decades-old policy of home demolitions, sealing the family homes of two attackers in east Jerusalem following a pair of shootings last month. 

            Officials have also escalated the demolitions of Palestinian homes built without hard-to-get Israeli building permits in the city's east, where some 200,000 Israelis live in Jewish neighborhoods that most of the world consider to be in occupied territory. 

            In the area of Wadi Qaddum earlier on Friday, Palestinians held midday prayers in protest outside an apartment building housing 100 residents that is slated to be razed. Netanyahu's office has reportedly delayed the demolition. Heavily armed police burst into the area as men gathered in prayer, confiscating Palestinian flags and firing tear gas to disperse the demonstration.JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian plowed a car into a crowded bus stop in east Jerusalem on Friday, killing two people, including a 6-year-old, and injuring five others before being shot and killed, Israeli police and medics said, the latest escalation as violence grips the contested capital.The car-ramming took place in Ramot, a Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem. Tensions have soared in the Israeli-annexed eastern half of the city, following a Palestinian shooting attack outside a synagogue on Jan. 27 that killed seven people in the deadliest attack in Jerusalem in over a decade.The Israeli rescue service identified the two killed as a six-year-old boy and a man in his 20s. It said medics were treating five injured, including an eight-year-old child in critical condition undergoing CPR. Others, ages ranging from 10 to 40, were in moderate to serious condition. They had been waiting at the bus stop before the car came crashing to a stop, police said.“It was a shocking scene,” said paramedic Lishai Shemesh who happened to be driving by at the time of the attack. “I was in the car with my wife and children and noticed a car driving fast into the bus stop and crushing the people who were waiting there.""An off-duty detective shot and killed the suspected attacker at the scene, police added, describing him as a Palestinian in his 30s from east Jerusalem. Palestinian media identified him as 32-year-old Hussein Qaraqa.Speaking from the scene of the suspected attack, Israel’s hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, ordered police to set up checkpoints around the driver's neighborhood of Issawiya to “check every vehicle.""“I wanted to to create a full blockade (on the area), but there is a judicial question around it,” he added.Israel’s largely ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, expressed shock and offered condolences to the families of the victims. “Our hearts are pained by the terrible news,” he said.The Islamic militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, praised the rampage but did not immediately claim responsibility. Footage from the scene showed police and paramedics swarming a mangled blue Mazda that had slammed into the bus stop. Bodies lay strewn along the way.As an immediate measure, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant imposed financial sanctions on 87 Palestinian residents of east Jerusalem, seizing millions of dollars from people involved in violence against Israel who receive payments from the Palestinian Authority, as well as their families.The PA payments to prisoners' families have been a central issue in Israel’s punitive measures against the Palestinians in recent months.

            Karla Morales Mateo, 25, drove the vehicle onto a sidewalk and dropped her two daughters, ages 4 and 2, out of the vehicle, then drove through the southwestern portion of the iron fence about 6:40 p.m. Thursday, according to a statement from Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806654,Liverpool team 'incredibly fresh' after Klopp gives days off,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp could have forced his players to run extra wind sprints or sit through more film sessions in the wake of another loss.

            Instead, he gave them a couple of days off.

            “On Sunday after we spoke about everything I thought 100% it makes sense if we don’t see each other for two days, and it was helpful,” Klopp said Friday.











            The 3-0 loss at Wolverhampton last Saturday left Liverpool in 10th place and still in search of its first Premier League win in 2023. Liverpool has one draw and three losses in its last four league games.

            “In Germany this question would have come much earlier — how can you give them two days off when you are in the situation you are in,” the German manager said.

            The schedule also was favorable for time off — Liverpool doesn't play Everton until Monday night.

            “I left on Sunday in an average mood, and came back with a good mood,” Klopp said. “I worked through (the break). I had a lot of phone calls and stuff like this, but anyway I was in a much better mood, a completely different mood to be honest, and that’s why it’s very helpful.”

            Players “all look incredibly fresh"" this week in training, he added.

            Midfielder Thiago Alcantara, however, looks doubtful for the Merseyside derby at Anfield because of a hip problem.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806656,Japan's earthquake recovery offers hard lessons for Turkey,"TOKYO (AP) — Mountains of rubble and twisted metal. Death on an unimaginable scale. Grief. Rage. Relief at having survived. 

            What's left behind after a natural disaster so powerful that it rends the foundations of a society? What lingers over a decade later, even as the rest of the world moves on? 

            Similarities between the calamity unfolding this week in Turkey and Syria and the triple disaster that hit northern Japan in 2011 may offer a glimpse of what the region could face in the years ahead. They're linked by the sheer enormity of the collective psychological trauma, of the loss of life and of the material destruction. 











            The combined toll of Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake rose past 23,000 deaths on Friday as authorities announced the discovery of new bodies. That has already eclipsed the more than 18,400 who died in the disaster in Japan.

            That magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m., March 11, 2011. Not long after, cameras along the Japanese coast captured the wall of water that hit the Tohoku region. The quake was one of the biggest on record, and the tsunami it caused washed away cars, homes, office buildings and thousands of people, and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.

            Huge boats were dropped miles away from the ocean in the towering jumbled debris of what had once been cities, cars toppled on their sides like playthings among the ruined streets and obliterated buildings.

            Many wondered if the area would ever return to what it was before.

            A big lesson from Japan is that a disaster of this size doesn't ever really have a conclusion — a lesson Turkey itself knows well from a 1999 earthquake in the country's northwest that killed some 18,000 people. Despite speeches about rebuilding, the Tohoku quake has left a deep gash in the national consciousness and the landscapes of people's lives. 

            Take the death toll.

            Deaths directly attributable to the quake in Turkey will level off in coming weeks, but it's unlikely to be the end. 

            Japan, for instance, has recognized thousands of other people who died later from stress-related heart attacks, or because of poor living conditions.

            And despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent in Japan on reconstruction, some things won't ever come back — including a sense of place.

            Before the quake, Tohoku was filled with small cities and villages, surrounded by farms, the ports filled with fleets of fishing boats. It’s one of the wildest, most beautiful coastlines in Japan.

            Today, while the wreckage of the quake and tsunami has largely been removed and many roads and buildings rebuilt, there are still large areas of empty space, places where buildings haven’t been erected, farms haven’t been replanted. Businesses have spent years trying to reconstruct decimated customer bases.

            Just as workers once did in Japan, an army of rescuers in Turkey and Syria are digging through obliterated buildings, picking through twisted metal, pulverized concrete and exposed wires for survivors.

            What comes next won't be easy.

            In Japan, there was initially a palpable pride in the country's ability to endure disaster. People stood calmly in long orderly lines for food and water. They posted notices on message boards in destroyed towns with descriptions of loved ones in the hopes that rescue workers would find them.

            After what locals called the Great East Japan Earthquake, the dead in Tohoku were left by piles of rubble, neatly wrapped in taped-up blankets, waiting to be taken away by workers still combing through the detritus for anyone left alive.

            The long haul of rebuilding has challenged this resolve. The work has been uneven and, at times, painfully slow, hampered by government incompetence, petty squabbling and bureaucratic wrangling. Nearly half a million people were displaced in Japan. Tens of thousands still haven’t returned home.

            The issue has seeped into politics, especially as the debate continues about how to handle the aftermath of catastrophic meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Years later, a fear of radiation permeates, and some areas of northern Japan have placed radiation counters in parks and other public areas. Officials and experts are still undecided how to remove the highly radioactive melted fuel debris in the reactor. 

            There’s already been criticism that the Turkish government has failed to enforce modern construction codes for years, even as it allowed a real estate boom in earthquake-prone areas, and that it has been slow to respond to the disaster.

            The years since 2011 have seen another failure, one officials in Japan have acknowledged: an inability to help those traumatized by what they experienced.

            Some 2,500 people are unaccounted for across Tohoku, and people are still searching for their loved ones' remains. One man got a diving license and has gone on weekly dives for years trying to find evidence of his wife.

            People still occasionally unearth victims’ photo albums, clothes and other belongings.

            Perhaps the most telling connection, however, is the sharp empathy shared by those who have survived a cataclysmic disaster, and the gratitude at seeing strangers help ease their suffering. 

            A group of about 30 rescue workers from Turkey were in the hard-hit town of Shichigahama for about six months in 2011 for search and rescue operations.

            Shichigahama locals have not forgotten. They have now started a donation campaign for Turkey. One man said this week that he wept as he watched the scenes in Turkey, remembering his town's ordeal 12 years ago.

            “They bravely walked through the debris to help find victims and return their bodies to their families,” Mayor Kaoru Terasawa told reporters of the Turkish aid workers who came to Japan. “We are still so thankful to them, and we want to do something to return the favor and show our gratitude.”

Death on an unimaginable scale. Grief. Rage. Relief at having survived.What's left behind after a natural disaster so powerful that it rends the foundations of a society? What lingers over a decade later, even as the rest of the world moves on?Similarities between the calamity unfolding this week in Turkey and Syria and the triple disaster that hit northern Japan in 2011 may offer a glimpse of what the region could face in the years ahead. They're linked by the sheer enormity of the collective psychological trauma, of the loss of life and of the material destruction.The combined toll of Monday’s 7.8 magnitude earthquake rose past 23,000 deaths on Friday as authorities announced the discovery of new bodies. That has already eclipsed the more than 18,400 who died in the disaster in Japan.That magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck at 2:46 p.m., March 11, 2011. Not long after, cameras along the Japanese coast captured the wall of water that hit the Tohoku region. The quake was one of the biggest on record, and the tsunami it caused washed away cars, homes, office buildings and thousands of people, and caused a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.Huge boats were dropped miles away from the ocean in the towering jumbled debris of what had once been cities, cars toppled on their sides like playthings among the ruined streets and obliterated buildings.Many wondered if the area would ever return to what it was before.A big lesson from Japan is that a disaster of this size doesn't ever really have a conclusion — a lesson Turkey itself knows well from a 1999 earthquake in the country's northwest that killed some 18,000 people. Despite speeches about rebuilding, the Tohoku quake has left a deep gash in the national consciousness and the landscapes of people's lives.Take the death toll.Deaths directly attributable to the quake in Turkey will level off in coming weeks, but it's unlikely to be the end.Japan, for instance, has recognized thousands of other people who died later from stress-related heart attacks, or because of poor living conditions.And despite hundreds of billions of dollars spent in Japan on reconstruction, some things won't ever come back — including a sense of place.Before the quake, Tohoku was filled with small cities and villages, surrounded by farms, the ports filled with fleets of fishing boats. It’s one of the wildest, most beautiful coastlines in Japan.Today, while the wreckage of the quake and tsunami has largely been removed and many roads and buildings rebuilt, there are still large areas of empty space, places where buildings haven’t been erected, farms haven’t been replanted. Businesses have spent years trying to reconstruct decimated customer bases.Just as workers once did in Japan, an army of rescuers in Turkey and Syria are digging through obliterated buildings, picking through twisted metal, pulverized concrete and exposed wires for survivors.What comes next won't be easy.In Japan, there was initially a palpable pride in the country's ability to endure disaster. People stood calmly in long orderly lines for food and water. They posted notices on message boards in destroyed towns with descriptions of loved ones in the hopes that rescue workers would find them.After what locals called the Great East Japan Earthquake, the dead in Tohoku were left by piles of rubble, neatly wrapped in taped-up blankets, waiting to be taken away by workers still combing through the detritus for anyone left alive.The long haul of rebuilding has challenged this resolve. The work has been uneven and, at times, painfully slow, hampered by government incompetence, petty squabbling and bureaucratic wrangling. Nearly half a million people were displaced in Japan. Tens of thousands still haven’t returned home.The issue has seeped into politics, especially as the debate continues about how to handle the aftermath of catastrophic meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. Years later, a fear of radiation permeates, and some areas of northern Japan have placed radiation counters in parks and other public areas. Officials and experts are still undecided how to remove the highly radioactive melted fuel debris in the reactor.There’s already been criticism that the Turkish government has failed to enforce modern construction codes for years, even as it allowed a real estate boom in earthquake-prone areas, and that it has been slow to respond to the disaster.The years since 2011 have seen another failure, one officials in Japan have acknowledged: an inability to help those traumatized by what they experienced.Some 2,500 people are unaccounted for across Tohoku, and people are still searching for their loved ones' remains. One man got a diving license and has gone on weekly dives for years trying to find evidence of his wife.People still occasionally unearth victims’ photo albums, clothes and other belongings.Perhaps the most telling connection, however, is the sharp empathy shared by those who have survived a cataclysmic disaster, and the gratitude at seeing strangers help ease their suffering.A group of about 30 rescue workers from Turkey were in the hard-hit town of Shichigahama for about six months in 2011 for search and rescue operations.Shichigahama locals have not forgotten. They have now started a donation campaign for Turkey. One man said this week that he wept as he watched the scenes in Turkey, remembering his town's ordeal 12 years ago.“They bravely walked through the debris to help find victims and return their bodies to their families,” Mayor Kaoru Terasawa told reporters of the Turkish aid workers who came to Japan. “We are still so thankful to them, and we want to do something to return the favor and show our gratitude.”___AP reporter Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this story.___Foster Klug, AP's news director for Japan, the Koreas, Australia and the South Pacific, reported from Tohoku after the 2011 quake, and has covered Japan since 2005.",2023/02/11,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806672,More homeowners tap equity juiced by soaring prices,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Homeowners are increasingly tapping their equity, taking advantage of big gains following years of soaring housing prices.

            Some 333,537 home equity loans were taken out by homeowners in the third quarter last year, according to data from TransUnion. 

            That's about a 47% increase from the same quarter in 2021, the most home equity loans on records going back to 2010, the credit bureau said. 











            Banks also granted some 405,646 home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, to borrowers in the third quarter, up 41% from a year earlier, TransUnion said.

            “HELOCs and home equity loans continue to grow at unprecedented levels as homeowners increasingly take advantage of the record levels of tappable home equity they have built in their homes,"" said Joe Mellman, mortgage business leader at TransUnion. 

            The change is part of a broader uptick in the use of credit as higher prices for food, gas and other necessities squeezes household budgets.

            Credit card balances climbed to a record-high $931 billion in the last three months of 2022, a nearly 19% increase from a year earlier, TransUnion said. Unsecured personal loan balances reached a record $222 billion.

            Homeowners use the equity available to them mainly to consolidate debt, finance home improvement projects and pay for big-ticket purchases.

            Years of rising home values have made home equity a tempting option. Tappable homeowner equity jumped 18% in the third quarter from a year earlier to an all-time high of $20.2 trillion, TransUnion said.

            In 2021 and 2022, when mortgage rates were near historic lows, many homeowners drew upon their big home equity gains via cash-out refinancing. But that all changed last year.

            A sharp rise in mortgage rates knocked the housing market into a nearly yearlong slump in 2022. As rates on a 30-year home loan soared to the highest level since 2008, home sales cratered and demand for mortgage refinancing slowed to a crawl.

            By the end of the third quarter, refinancing was down 84% from a year earlier to a record-low, TransUnion said.

            “This overall demand to tap home equity has been around for a few years now, it’s just shifting from cash-out refi into HELOCs and (home equity loans),"" Mellman said.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Homeowners are increasingly tapping their equity, taking advantage of big gains following years of soaring housing prices.Some 333,537 home equity loans were taken out by homeowners in the third quarter last year, according to data from TransUnion.That's about a 47% increase from the same quarter in 2021, the most home equity loans on records going back to 2010, the credit bureau said.Banks also granted some 405,646 home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, to borrowers in the third quarter, up 41% from a year earlier, TransUnion said.“HELOCs and home equity loans continue to grow at unprecedented levels as homeowners increasingly take advantage of the record levels of tappable home equity they have built in their homes,"" said Joe Mellman, mortgage business leader at TransUnion.The change is part of a broader uptick in the use of credit as higher prices for food, gas and other necessities squeezes household budgets.Credit card balances climbed to a record-high $931 billion in the last three months of 2022, a nearly 19% increase from a year earlier, TransUnion said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806676,Messi to be available for Champions League game with Bayern,"PARIS (AP) — Lionel Messi will be available for the Champions League game against Bayern Munich on Tuesday despite being left out of the squad for this weekend's French league match at Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain coach Christophe Galtier said Friday.

            Messi strained his hamstring in the 2-1 loss to Marseille on Wednesday in the French Cup.

            “Leo won’t be available for the Monaco game tomorrow,” Galtier said. “He will resume training on Monday, the day before the game against Bayern Munich. So you can leave the term ‘doubtful’ aside.”











            PSG leads the French league by eight points, but injuries to key players are coming at a critical moment of the season.

            France striker Kylian Mbappe tore a muscle in his left thigh against Montpellier on Feb. 1 and will miss the Monaco and Bayern Munich games. Brazil striker Neymar missed two French league games this month because of a groin problem before returning for the French Cup.

            PSG was undefeated in all competitions from August to December but the team lost to Lens and Rennes in the league last month before getting knocked out by Marseille in the French Cup.

            “We know the importance of Leo in our game,” Galtier said. “Because of his absence, we will maybe have to play differently to have a more solid and more compact team.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4806678,Malaysian leader wants tougher ASEAN pressure on Myanmar,"BANGKOK (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday issued a strong call for fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to take new measures to pressure the government of military-ruled Myanmar to end what he called “atrocities” against its own people.

            Anwar, on a two-day official visit to Thailand, said in a speech to the Malaysian-Thai Chamber of Commerce that ASEAN members “have to be courageous enough to try and resolve” the crisis in Myanmar, which some U.N. experts have described as a civil war triggered by the army’s seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

            Security forces have killed thousands of civilians and army sweeps through the countryside have displaced more than 1 million people from their homes. In 2017, a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Muslin Rohingya minority drove more than 740,000 to flee across the border to Bangladesh, where they remain in refugee camps.











            Anwar said Myanmar has “every right"" to have its own domestic policies and priorities. “But no country in these times should ever continue with discriminatory policies, marginalization of their people or intimidating, or worse, perpetrating violence against your own people,” he said.

            ASEAN “will have to promote, suggest new mechanisms to make sure that these atrocities committed, perpetrated against their own people must end,"" Anwar said. The regional grouping ""should be courageous enough to try and resolve this” because it should not tolerate such abuses and because the crisis drives large numbers of refugees to seek safety in other countries in the region, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.

            “It would be ideal if we have a strong consensus, and give a strong message to the Myanmar regime,” Anwar said. 

            After the army’s takeover, ASEAN came up with a five-point plan to try to help restore peace in Myanmar. It calls for the immediate cessation of violence, a dialogue among all parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all sides. The military government initially agreed to it, but has since stymied efforts at its implementation.

            ASEAN responded by refusing to let Myanmar's military leaders attend the group’s main meetings, but that has failed to win their cooperation.

            Western nations have implemented stronger actions in response to the crisis than has ASEAN, including political and economic sanctions against the generals and their cronies.BANGKOK (AP) — Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Friday issued a strong call for fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to take new measures to pressure the government of military-ruled Myanmar to end what he called “atrocities” against its own people.Anwar, on a two-day official visit to Thailand, said in a speech to the Malaysian-Thai Chamber of Commerce that ASEAN members “have to be courageous enough to try and resolve” the crisis in Myanmar, which some U.N. experts have described as a civil war triggered by the army’s seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.Security forces have killed thousands of civilians and army sweeps through the countryside have displaced more than 1 million people from their homes.
