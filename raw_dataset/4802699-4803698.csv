https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802713,Southern Thailand jungle resort awaits Taiwanese tourists’ discovery,"KRABI (Taiwan News) — The Lunar New Year holidays proved Thailand to be one of international tourists’ top destinations, though Phuket’s neighboring Krabi remains underexplored by Taiwanese travelers.A 20-minute drive and 20-minute boat ride from Krabi International Airport, nestled between three beaches and looming limestone cliffs, is Rayavadee, an award-winning resort covered in dense foliage. Despite its history spanning nearly three decades, the luxurious resort shows no sign of age, and blends with its surrounding natural environment so flawlessly that two species of monkeys can be seen swinging and jumping through tree branches above its buildings.Rayavadee’s concern for sustainability is apparent in its thriving gardens. During the resort’s development, most of the trees within its range were kept while paths were built around them, which is why they are all winding and can get confusing at times.Patrons must take a speedboat to reach Rayavadee after getting to Krabi. (Taiwan News, Stephanie Chiang photo)Though trees grow freely at the resort, when they die or grow into positions that cause safety concerns and must be cut down, Rayavadee plants another in their place.With 101 accommodation units, four restaurants, a public pool, a spa, an activity center, and a fitness center, Rayavadee is so big that one of the first sights that greet patrons upon entering its lobby is a map of the resort. The accommodation units consist of two-story, circular “pavilions” that come with or without pools, as well as larger “villas” that include multiple buildings.Walking in Rayavadee feels like walking in a jungle.

(Taiwan News, Stephanie Chiang photo)The Family Villa, though categorized as a villa, includes a pavilion that is linked to a one-story building serving as the master bedroom and bathroom via a long hallway. A large garden surrounds the connected buildings and a 12 by three-meter swimming pool.On the first floor of the pavilion is a cozy living room, next to which is a staircase that leads to the second-floor bedroom and bathroom that sleeps from two to four people. The master bedroom, newly renovated, is spacious and bright, with French casement doors that open directly to the swimming pool.The Family Villa consists of a pavilion and a one-story building housing the master bedroom and bathroom, connected by a corridor.

(Taiwan News, Stephanie Chiang photo)The Raitalay Villa gets its name from its location, tucked away in a quiet corner on Raitalay Beach. The private deck with a pool overlooks the Andaman Sea and leads to two buildings, one of which houses the living room, small dining room, and a pantry while the other contains two adjoining bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms.Meanwhile, the Rayavadee Villa is situated on Phra Nang Beach, making it a great spot to view the sun setting above emerald waters and behind Happy Island. Aside from a full living room, dining room, pantry, two bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, this villa comes with extensive gardens, a sauna, beachside pool, and jacuzzi.The master bedroom and bathroom are equally spacious and provide patrons with a full view of the Phra Nang Beach. The second bedroom, though not as big as the master, comes with a Japanese-style outdoor bathtub.The Raitalay Villa comes with a deck overlooking the beach.

The venue is set against a limestone cliff on Phra Nang Beach, and the restaurant offers a European-style a la carte menu during the day and set menus during evenings.Raya Dining is where breakfast, a mix of buffet and all-you-can-eat a la carte, and Rayavadee’s weekly complimentary afternoon tea, are served, with both indoor and outdoor seating available. The choice of dishes blends Thai and Western styles.Other dining options at Rayavadee include Krua Phranang, a Thai restaurant also set by Phra Nang Beach, and Raitalay Terrace, which is located at the resort’s Raitalay Beach entrance and offers international dishes.Patrons enjoy the view of Phra Nang Beach and Happy Island while dining at The Grotto.

The programs are operated by the resort itself, and patrons do not have to worry about arranging for their own transportation or tour guides.Apart from Thailand’s beloved tropical islands that require longer boat rides to see, there are also attractions reachable by foot from Rayavadee. The Big Bat Cave, for example, is just to the side of Phra Nang Beach, requiring just a bit of climbing to reach an opening that grants a breathtaking view of the jungle, beach, sea, and island below.The view from the Big Bat Cave.

            Coonrod had a 7.82 ERA in 12 appearances covering 12 2/3 innings last year for the National League champions. The right-hander is 7-5 with a 5.27 ERA and five saves in 105 games over four major league seasons with San Francisco and Philadelphia. He has struck out 95 and walked 44 in 97 1/3 innings.

            The 30-year-old Coonrod was designated for assignment by the Phillies last week when they signed free agent infielder Josh Harrison.











            To make room on the 40-man roster, outfielder Khalil Lee was designated for assignment by the Mets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802727,"Amid soaring crime, Memphis cops lowered the bar for hiring","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Beyond the beating, kicking, cursing and pepper spraying, the video of Tyre Nichols’ deadly arrest at the hands of young Memphis police officers is just as notable for what's missing — any experienced supervisors showing up to stop them.

            That points to a dangerous confluence of trends that Memphis’ police chief acknowledged have dogged the department as the city became one of the nation’s murder hotspots: a chronic shortage of officers, especially supervisors, increasing numbers of police quitting and a struggle to bring in qualified recruits. 

            Former Memphis police recruiters told The Associated Press of a growing desperation to fill hundreds of slots in recent years that drove the department to increase incentives and lower its standards. 











            “They would allow just pretty much anybody to be a police officer because they just want these numbers,” said Alvin Davis, a former lieutenant in charge of recruiting before he retired last year out of frustration. “They’re not ready for it.""

            The department offered new recruits $15,000 signing bonuses and $10,000 relocation allowances while phasing out requirements to have either college credits, military service or previous police work. All that's now required is two years' work experience — any work experience. The department also sought state waivers to hire applicants with criminal records. And the police academy even dropped timing requirements on physical fitness drills and removed running entirely because too many people were failing.

            “I asked them what made you want to be the police and they’ll be honest — they'll tell you it’s strictly about the money,” Davis said, adding that many recruits would ask the minimum time they would actually have to serve to keep the bonus money. “It’s not a career for them like it was to us. It’s just a job.”

            Another former patrol officer-turned-recruiter who recently left the department told the AP that in addition to drawing from other law enforcement agencies and college campuses, recruits were increasingly coming from jobs at the McDonald’s and Dunkin’ drive-thrus.

            In one case, a stripper with an arrest record submitted an application. And even though she didn’t get hired, it reinforced the message that “anyone can get this job. You could have any type of experience and be the police.”

            “There were red flags,” said the former recruiter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel and hiring. “But we’re so far down the pyramid nobody really hears the little person."" 

            Many young officers, before ever walking a beat with more experienced colleagues, found themselves thrust into specialized units like the now-disbanded SCORPION high-crime strike force involved in Nichols’ arrest. Their lack of experience was shocking to veterans, who said some young officers who transfer back to patrol don’t even know how to write a traffic ticket or respond to a domestic call. 

            “They don’t know a felony from a misdemeanor,” Davis said. “They don’t even know right from wrong yet.”

            Memphis police did not respond to requests for comment about their hiring standards. But police Director Cerelyn Davis, who took over in June 2021, has said supervision of less experienced officers is an urgent need, noting her department is investigating why a supervisor failed to respond to Nichols’ arrest despite a policy that requires a ranking officer to go to the scene when pepper spray or a stun gun is used.

            “If that had happened, somebody could have been there to intercept what happened,” Davis told the AP in an interview last month.

            “Culture eats policy for lunch in police departments,” she added. “If you don’t have the checks and balances you will have problems.” 

            Davis told city council members Tuesday that she intends to bring in an outside vendor to help fill 125 new supervisor slots, which would improve the ratio of supervisors to officers from the current 1-to-10 to about 1-to-8, closer to what is considered the ideal ratio of at least 1-to-7.

            “While those 125 don’t satisfy the ratio, this is a start,” Davis said. “It’s not just the officer that has to be held accountable. It’s everybody in the chain up to the chief of police.""

            Of the five SCORPION team officers now charged with second-degree murder in Nichols’ Jan. 7 beating, two had only a couple of years on the force and none had more than six years’ experience.

            One of the officers, Emmitt Martin III, 30, a former tight end on the Bethel University football team, appeared to have had at least one arrest, according to files from the Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission, a state oversight agency. But the date and details of the case were blacked out.

            The section for arrests in the agency’s file for another officer, Demetrius Haley, 30, who worked at a Shelby County Corrections facility before joining the force, was also redacted from the state records. Haley was sued for allegedly beating an inmate there, which he denied, and the case was dismissed because papers had not been properly served.

            “If you lower standards, you can predict that you’re going to have problems because we’re recruiting from the human race,” said Ronal Serpas, the former head of the police in Nashville and New Orleans and the Washington State Patrol. “There’s such a small number of people who want to do this and an infinitesimally smaller number of people we actually want doing this.”

            Memphis, in many ways, stands as a microcosm of the myriad crises facing American policing. Departments from Seattle to New Orleans are struggling to fill their ranks with qualified officers amid a national movement of mounting scrutiny and calls for reform in the wake of the 2020 killing of George Floyd.

            Davis' aim after taking office was to increase staff from 2,100 to 2,500, close to the size of the force a decade ago. Instead, the police ranks have dropped to 1,939 officers — like the city, majority Black — even as the population has increased and the number of homicides topped 300 in each of the past two years.

            A big part of the reason for the dwindling ranks is that more than 1,350 officers either resigned or retired over the past decade — more than 300 in the last two years alone. 

            Michael Williams, former head of the Memphis Police Association, the officers' union, said strict supervision is essential, especially for the specialized teams like SCORPION.

            “Why would you have an elite task force that you know is designed for aggressive policing and you don’t cover your bases? They may have to shoot someone. They may have to kick someone’s door down. They may have to physically restrain someone,” Williams said. “You should have experienced people around to restrain them and keep them from going down a dark path.”

            Longtime observers of the Memphis police say this is not the first moment of reckoning for a department with a history of civil rights abuses. 

            After the 2015 death of Darrius Stewart, a 19-year-old Black man fatally shot by a white police officer, activists and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, called on the U.S. Justice Department to conduct a “pattern or practice” investigation of civil rights violations in the department. Such inquiries often result in sweeping reforms, including staffing and training overhauls. 

            Carlos Moore, an attorney for Stewart's family, warned the Justice Department at the time of a deadly trend that preceded Stewart's death. “There have been over 24 suspicious killings of civilians by officers of the Memphis Police Department since 2009,"" he wrote in a 2015 letter obtained by AP, “and not one officer has been indicted for killing unarmed, largely Black young men.” 

            The Justice Department decided not to open such an inquiry for reasons it didn't explain at the time, and it declined to comment this week. 

            “The Department of Justice missed a golden opportunity to properly investigate the Memphis Police Department,” Moore said in an interview. “It was just as corrupt then as it is now.” 

            Thaddeus Johnson, a former Memphis police officer who is now a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University, said the missed chance for federal intervention allowed the problems of the department — soaring crime, community distrust and chronic understaffing — to fester until they exploded. 

            “A deadly brew came together,"" he said. “But that same mixture is in many other places, too, where the bubble just hasn’t burst yet.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802728,Missouri man who killed 4 executed despite innocence claims,"BONNE TERRE, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri man convicted of killing his live-in girlfriend and her three young children was executed Tuesday despite his claims that he was in another state when the killings occurred.

            Raheem Taylor, 58, was the third Missouri inmate put to death since November at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It was the nation’s fifth execution this year, following a previous execution in Missouri, two in Texas and one in Oklahoma. All were by lethal injection.

            Taylor kicked his feet as the 5 grams of pentobarbital were administered, then took five or six deep breaths before all movement stopped. In a final statement, Taylor said Muslims don’t die but “live eternally in the hearts of our family and friends.”











            “Death is not your enemy, it is your destiny. Look forward to meeting it. Peace!” he wrote in the statement.

            Taylor, who previously went by the first name Leonard, long maintained that he was in California when Angela Rowe, her 10-year-old daughter Alexus Conley, 6-year-old daughter AcQreya Conley, and 5-year-old son Tyrese Conley were killed in 2004. His supporters included the national NAACP, nearly three dozen civil rights and religious groups and the Midwest Innocence Project.

            But Taylor’s innocence claims were turned aside time and again. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, a Democrat, last week declined Taylor’s request for a hearing before a judge, stating the “facts are not there to support a credible case of innocence.”

            Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to grant clemency on Monday, the same day the Missouri Supreme Court denied a stay request. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.

            Gerauan Rowe, Angela Rowe’s sister, said after the execution that moving on remains difficult, more than 18 years after she lost her sister, nieces and nephew.

            “I’m at a point in my life right now — I’m OK but I’m not,” she said. “But I know justice was served. It’s kind of hard trying to move forward, but I think I can do it.”

            There was no question that Taylor was not in Missouri when the bodies were found. What isn’t known for certain is when the family was killed.

            Taylor and Angela Rowe lived with the children at a home in the St. Louis suburb of Jennings. Taylor boarded a flight to California on Nov. 26, 2004.

            On Dec. 3, 2004, police were sent to the home in Jennings after worried relatives said they hadn’t heard from Rowe. Officers found the bodies of Rowe and her children. All four had been shot.

            The initial finding by a medical examiner was that the killings likely happened within a few days of the discovery of the bodies — when Taylor was in California. But at Taylor’s trial, Medical Examiner Phillip Burch said the killings could have happened two or three weeks before the discovery of the bodies.

            Taylor’s attorney, Kent Gipson, said that several people, including relatives of Rowe and a neighbor, saw Rowe alive in the days after Taylor left St. Louis. Meanwhile, Taylor’s daughter in California, Deja Taylor, claimed in a court filing that she and her father called Angela Rowe and one of the children during his visit. The court filing said Deja Taylor’s mother and sister corroborated her story.

            Bob McCulloch, who was St. Louis County’s elected prosecutor at the time of the killings, said Taylor’s claim of innocence was “nonsense,” and the alibis provided by his daughter and her relatives were “completely made up.”

            McCulloch told The Associated Press that evidence suggested Rowe and the kids were killed on the night of Nov. 22 or on Nov. 23, at a time when Taylor was still in St. Louis. He noted that Rowe typically made around 70 outgoing calls or texts each day. Starting Nov. 23, she made none.

            Meanwhile, DNA from Rowe’s blood was found on Taylor’s glasses when he was arrested, a relative taking him to the airport saw Taylor toss a gun into the sewer, and Taylor’s brother told police that Taylor admitted to the crime, McCulloch said. Authorities believe Taylor shot Rowe during a violent argument, then killed the children because they were witnesses.

            All three recent Missouri executions involved cases out of St. Louis County. Kevin Johnson was executed in November for killing a police officer in 2005. Amber McLaughlin was put to death Jan. 3 for killing a woman in 2003. It was believed to be the first execution of a transgender woman in the U.S.BONNE TERRE, Mo.

All were by lethal injection.Taylor kicked his feet as the 5 grams of pentobarbital were administered, then took five or six deep breaths before all movement stopped. In a final statement, Taylor said Muslims don’t die but “live eternally in the hearts of our family and friends.”“Death is not your enemy, it is your destiny. Look forward to meeting it. Peace!” he wrote in the statement.Taylor, who previously went by the first name Leonard, long maintained that he was in California when Angela Rowe, her 10-year-old daughter Alexus Conley, 6-year-old daughter AcQreya Conley, and 5-year-old son Tyrese Conley were killed in 2004. His supporters included the national NAACP, nearly three dozen civil rights and religious groups and the Midwest Innocence Project.But Taylor’s innocence claims were turned aside time and again. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell, a Democrat, last week declined Taylor’s request for a hearing before a judge, stating the “facts are not there to support a credible case of innocence.”Republican Gov. Mike Parson declined to grant clemency on Monday, the same day the Missouri Supreme Court denied a stay request. Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to intervene.Gerauan Rowe, Angela Rowe’s sister, said after the execution that moving on remains difficult, more than 18 years after she lost her sister, nieces and nephew.“I’m at a point in my life right now — I’m OK but I’m not,” she said. “But I know justice was served. It’s kind of hard trying to move forward, but I think I can do it.”There was no question that Taylor was not in Missouri when the bodies were found. What isn’t known for certain is when the family was killed.Taylor and Angela Rowe lived with the children at a home in the St. Louis suburb of Jennings. Taylor boarded a flight to California on Nov. 26, 2004.On Dec. 3, 2004, police were sent to the home in Jennings after worried relatives said they hadn’t heard from Rowe. Officers found the bodies of Rowe and her children. All four had been shot.The initial finding by a medical examiner was that the killings likely happened within a few days of the discovery of the bodies — when Taylor was in California. But at Taylor’s trial, Medical Examiner Phillip Burch said the killings could have happened two or three weeks before the discovery of the bodies.Taylor’s attorney, Kent Gipson, said that several people, including relatives of Rowe and a neighbor, saw Rowe alive in the days after Taylor left St. Louis. Meanwhile, Taylor’s daughter in California, Deja Taylor, claimed in a court filing that she and her father called Angela Rowe and one of the children during his visit. The court filing said Deja Taylor’s mother and sister corroborated her story.Bob McCulloch, who was St. Louis County’s elected prosecutor at the time of the killings, said Taylor’s claim of innocence was “nonsense,” and the alibis provided by his daughter and her relatives were “completely made up.”McCulloch told The Associated Press that evidence suggested Rowe and the kids were killed on the night of Nov. 22 or on Nov. 23, at a time when Taylor was still in St. Louis. He noted that Rowe typically made around 70 outgoing calls or texts each day. Starting Nov. 23, she made none.Meanwhile, DNA from Rowe’s blood was found on Taylor’s glasses when he was arrested, a relative taking him to the airport saw Taylor toss a gun into the sewer, and Taylor’s brother told police that Taylor admitted to the crime, McCulloch said. Authorities believe Taylor shot Rowe during a violent argument, then killed the children because they were witnesses.All three recent Missouri executions involved cases out of St. Louis County. Kevin Johnson was executed in November for killing a police officer in 2005. Amber McLaughlin was put to death Jan. 3 for killing a woman in 2003. It was believed to be the first execution of a transgender woman in the U.S.",2023/2/8,,World

            The FIFA Women’s World Cup will be played in Australia and New Zealand in July and August and so soccer has taken priority in booking New Zealand stadiums during the months in which the Southern Hemisphere-based Rugby Championship will be played.

            Even Auckland’s Eden Park, which is regarded as the headquarters of New Zealand Rugby, will be unavailable to the All Blacks, the famous men's national team in New Zealand's national sport.











            Instead, their July 15 Rugby Championship match against South Africa will be played at Mt. Smart Stadium, home of the New Zealand Warriors rugby league club.

            The All Blacks’ second Bledisloe Cup test against Australia's Wallabies will be played at Dunedin’s indoor stadium on Aug. 5. Dunedin will only host group matches at the women’s World Cup and that stage will be over before the rugby test is played.

            FIFA's strict rules around stadium usage before soccer World Cup matches means Eden Park, which hosted the 1987 and 2011 Rugby World Cup finals, can’t be used for the All Blacks' test against South Africa's world champion Springboks.

            The All Blacks and Springboks also will meet at Twickenham in England on Aug. 25 in a truncated Rugby Championship.

Foxconn responded today (Feb. 7) that it will handle all matters according to the law, and that it will not rule out further legal action to protect itself from any false statements being made.Foxconn head-hunted Wei more than two years ago to serve as its Chief Technology Officer as the company began exploring electric vehicle development. Wei claims that executives attempted to coerce him to voluntarily resign in September last year, a move that would have allowed the company to avoid paying Wei a large severance payment.Wei claims that Foxconn and its current chairman Young Liu (劉揚偉) tried to force him out through various location and role reassignments that Wei was not asked about before their implementation.On Sept. 29, the company's HR department presented Wei with a ""resignation letter agreement,"" asking him to sign. When he refused, security relieved him of his entry card and denied him access to the office, according to Wei.Wei also said that when he raised the issue with Foxconn HR, they said the move was lawful as he was working on a contract employee agreement, rather than on a regular employment agreement, which Wei disputes.",2023/2/7,2972,Business

North Korea is widely expected to stage a massive military parade to mark the occasion.Kim's statement at the meeting also alludes to the recent developments in the Korean Peninsula, with the reclusive kingdom objecting to the expanding military drills between the United States and South Korea.Last week, North Korea threatened to counter US military moves with the ""most overwhelming nuclear force."" This followed news that the US is planning to deploy more advanced military assets like bombers and aircraft carriers to the region.Pyongyang criticized the military exercises, stating that they have reached a critical limit and pose a threat of transforming the peninsula into a ""huge war arsenal and a more critical war zone.""Last year, North Korea conducted a record number of military tests firing more than 70 ballistic missiles. These comprised of nuclear-capable weapons with the ability to hit targets in South Korea or reach the mainland of the US.Meanwhile, a United Nations report stated that North Korea stole more cryptocurrency assets than ever in 2022. It also accused the cyber criminals linked to the hermit kingdom of targeting the networks of foreign aerospace and defense companies.It has been alleged that North Korea uses cyberattacks to fund its nuclear and missile programs.The report tabled to a UN Security Council committee stated that North Korean-linked hackers stole crypto assets worth $630 million (€586.8 million) to $1 billion.North Korea has previously denied allegations of hacking or other cyberattacks.The monitors said most cyber attacks were carried out by groups such as Kimsuky, Lazarus Group and Andariel, and controlled by North Korea's primary intelligence bureau — the Reconnaissance General Bureau.Another North Korean-linked group known as HOlyGhOst was reported to have ""extorted ransoms from small- and medium-sized companies in several countries by distributing ransomware in a widespread, financially motivated campaign.""The report also mentioned that Pyongyang continued producing nuclear fissile materials at its facilities, lending credence to the US assertion that North Korea is gearing up to carry out a seventh nuclear test.ss/wd (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/2/7,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802759,Homegrown blueberries hailed as a Taiwan miracle,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan now has its own blueberries thanks to a six-year effort lauded by local officials as an agricultural wonder.While Taiwan boasts a great variety of fruits, blueberries are mostly imported from countries like Peru, Chile and the U.S. Quality of the fruit is an issue due to the decline in freshness from lengthy shipping and the fact it often comes in the top three among imported fruits failing pesticide inspections, wrote FoodNext.The concerns can now be addressed after a collaboration between Taiwan Blueberry, a local farming company, and National Taiwan University (NTU), bore fruit.The Mandarin name of the company “山丘藍,” literally means “hill blue,” as it managed to cultivate the fruit at the foothills of Alishan, a mountain range in central Taiwan, with the expertise of a team led by Li Kuo-tan (李國譚), a professor at NTU’s Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture. According to Li, the team spent over 15 years developing the technique to grow the delicate fruit as three factors—blueberry variety, soil, and weather—are all important.Years of effort have paid off. A sprawling 30-hectare farm down the hills of Chiayi’s Alishan and along the Bazhang River can now mass produce the berry, harvested between December and May.The “Made in Taiwan” blueberries are touted as freshly picked and juicy. No further processing is involved when they are harvested and packaged, said the company. The product is now available via online orders or at 7-Eleven stores across the country.Taiwan has seen a surge in demand for blueberries. It imported more than 2,000 tons of the fruit in 2021, up from 330 tons in 2011, per the Council of Agriculture.(Facebook, Taiwan Blueberry photos)",2023/2/7,3668,Business

            “Taiwan is a significant economic actor here in East Asia,” Karna said, adding that the nation’s semiconductor production is ""highly appreciated.”

            The lawmaker said Finland is also eager to collaborate with Taiwan in science, technology, research, education, and culture. The two countries “can contribute a lot to international development and to the welfare of our people and the global community,” he said.

            Karna, who is leading a delegation in Taiwan, described his visit as “an excellent opportunity” to understand Taiwan’s economic strengths and security developments in the Taiwan Strait.











            Finland supports Taiwan’s participation in international organizations, Karna said. Taiwan’s inclusion is beneficial for the health, security, and well-being of Taiwanese and those in the region.

            Given the geopolitics of today, “it is of utmost importance to rely on stable values of peace and democracy which guide our work and cooperation,” Karna said. He pointed out that Taiwan and Finland both cherish freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and equality.

            Karna stressed that the two nations must, ""together, condemn China’s aggression towards Taiwan.” “Taiwan has the right to decide its own future,” he said.

            Tsai said she believes bilateral industrial cooperation “will grow even stronger.”

            She called on the global democratic community to work closely to defend regional prosperity, supply chain security, and freedom and democracy, as authoritarianism continues to expand.

            The president also hoped that Taiwan and Finland could also “take further steps to deepen exchanges, share experience, and strengthen democratic resilience” to improve the well-being of both peoples.

            Over the course of their five-day trip, the delegation is meeting with top officials to discuss issues of regional security and bilateral exchange. The group will also visit Hsinchu Science Park, as well as a cultural site in the southern city of Kaohsiung.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802810,UK energy giant BP's profits double to $27.7 billion,"LONDON (AP) — British energy firm BP reported record annual earnings Tuesday, fueling demands that the U.K. government boost taxes for companies benefiting from the high price of oil and natural gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            London-based BP said underlying replacement cost profit, which excludes one-time items and fluctuations in the value of inventories, jumped to $27.7 billion in 2022 from $12.8 billion a year earlier. That beat the $26.8 billion BP earned in 2008, when tensions in Iran and Nigeria pushed world oil prices to a record of more than $147 a barrel.

            BP also increased its quarterly dividend by 10% and announced plans to buy back an additional $2.75 billion of stock from shareholders.











            But the good news for BP shareholders is likely to be tempered by the public fallout, particularly in its home country. High oil and gas prices have hit Britain hard, with double-digit inflation fueling a wave of public-sector strikes, soaring food bank use and demands that politicians expand a tax on the windfall profits of energy companies to help pay for public services.

            Ed Miliband, the opposition Labour Party’s spokesman on climate issues, called on the U.K. government to bring forward a “proper” windfall tax on energy companies.

            “It’s yet another day of enormous profits at an energy giant, the windfalls of war, coming out of the pockets of the British people,″ Miliband said. 

            Similar censure was directed at London-based Shell last week, when it said annual earnings doubled to a record $39.9 billion last year.

            Bumper profits for energy companies worldwide have sparked demands that the fossil fuel industry do more to offset high energy bills even as they cut climate-damaging carbon emissions. U.S.-based Exxon Mobil posted record earnings of $55.7 billion last week. 

            Last year, Britain approved a 25% windfall tax on earnings from oil and gas produced in the U.K., with the levy increasing to 35% in 2023. Opposition leaders have criticized the government for allowing energy companies to reduce the tax by investing in the U.K.

            BP said it took a charge of more than $1.8 billion last year to cover the new U.K. tax.

            The company also took charges of $25.5 billion as the result of its decision to exit its investments in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.

            After including one-time items and fluctuations in the value of inventories, BP posted a net loss of $2.49 billion for 2022, compared with net income of $7.57 billion the previous year.

            BP on Tuesday said it would boost investment in renewable energy, hydrogen and electric vehicle charging as well as its oil and gas businesses, plowing an additional $8 billion into the two segments through 2030. 

            The investments will push oil and gas production to about 2 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2030. While the new target is 25% lower than in 2019, BP previously planned to cut production by 40%.

            “We will prioritize projects where we can deliver quickly, at low cost, using our existing infrastructure, allowing us to minimize additional emissions and maximize both value and our contribution to energy security and affordability,” chief executive Bernard Looney said in a statement.

            
                Energy prices soared after the invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude, a benchmark for global oil prices, averaged $101.32 a barrel last year, 43% higher than in 2021. The average wholesale price of natural gas in Britain jumped 76%. 

            
                Prices have dropped in recent months, with Brent crude averaging $88.87 in the fourth quarter.

            “The question becomes, what will they do with record profits and operating cash flow? Governments are already questioning record profits from other peer global energy companies,'' said Gianna Bern, an oil expert and professor of finance at the Mendoza College of business at the University of Notre Dame. “In an environment of record inflation and gas prices for the consumer, global energy companies will be compelled to reassess the cost and availability of energy for all.''

            Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at environmental advocacy nonprofit Global Witness, said BP’s profits were made “on the back of three global crises’’ — the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and climate breakdown. 

            “For those struggling, these mammoth profits will be a bitter pill to swallow,’’ Harrison said. “There are no two ways about it — BP is richer because we’re poorer.’’LONDON (AP) — British energy firm BP reported record annual earnings Tuesday, fueling demands that the U.K. government boost taxes for companies benefiting from the high price of oil and natural gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.London-based BP said underlying replacement cost profit, which excludes one-time items and fluctuations in the value of inventories, jumped to $27.7 billion in 2022 from $12.8 billion a year earlier.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802811,Japan's SoftBank logs $5.9B loss as tech investments tumble,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese investor SoftBank Group reported Tuesday that it sank into a deep loss for the October-December quarter, slammed by the global plunge in technology shares. 

            SoftBank Group Corp. racked up a 783 billion yen ($5.9 billion) loss for the fiscal third quarter, a reversal from the 29 billion yen profit recorded the same period a year ago. 

            SoftBank invests in hundreds of companies, including mobile carrier SoftBank, web services provider Yahoo, vehicle-for-hire company Didi and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. It also runs the Vision Fund that includes other global investors.











            SoftBank Group recorded nearly 512 billion yen ($3.9 billion) in losses on investments during the quarter, as prices of its shareholdings and funds nose-dived, it said. 

            Various uncertainties have slammed Japanese companies recently, such as soaring material costs and rising interest rates. Tensions such as the war in Ukraine have also added to what tends to work as negatives for SoftBank’s sprawling portfolio of investments. 

            Quarterly sales edged up 6% on year to 1.69 trillion yen ($12.8 billion). 

            Over the last year, Tokyo-based SoftBank Group raised money using Alibaba shares and selling shares in European telecommunications company T-Mobile, while exiting or partially exiting companies like Uber, according to the company. 

            Earlier this month, group company Z Holdings decided to merge the messaging app company Line and Yahoo Japan, a move aimed at boosting synergies and better focusing on products. Besides those two companies, Z Holdings also owns PayPay, a major Japanese mobile payment system. 

            SoftBank’s charismatic founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son has often managed to put a positive spin on his vision, even in the most challenging times. 

            He has said putting your money on artificial intelligence, massive data and robotics will pay off as paving the way for future innovation. He was one of the first believers in the internet business, long before the idea caught on in Japan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802812,Wikipedia again up and running as Pakistan lifts ban on site,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan lifted its ban on Wikipedia services before dawn Tuesday, after the country’s media regulator blocked the site last week for not removing purportedly blasphemous content, claiming it hurts the sentiments of Muslims.

            Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif ordered the unblocking late on Monday, according to a government statement. The site was blocked on Friday by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, after a deadline expired that Pakistan gave to Wikipedia to remove the controversial content. 

            The ban drew criticism and many condemned Islamabad’s action, saying it was a blow to digital rights and deprived the public of the right to seek knowledge.











            As anger grew, Pakistan's Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said on Monday that Sharif's five-member committee had looked into the matter and ordered Wikipedia services be restored immediately.

            The government has not provided any explanation or details about the content it deemed anti-Islam, and the media regulator never explained what content was purportedly hurting Muslim sentiments in Pakistan.

            Under Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws, anyone found guilty of insulting Islam or its figures can be sentenced to death, although the country has yet to carry out capital punishment for blasphemy. 

            But even allegations of the offense are often enough to provoke mob violence and even deadly attacks. International and domestic rights groups say that accusations of blasphemy have often been used to intimidate religious minorities and settle personal scores.

            The Wikimedia Foundation welcomed the lifting of the ban. Its statement said the lifting of the ban “means that the people of Pakistan can continue to benefit from and participate"" in the growth of a global movement “to spread and share knowledge that is verified, reliable and free.""

            In the past, Pakistan briefly banned TikTok twice for uploading immoral content. Also, in 2008, Pakistan banned YouTube over videos depicting the Prophet Muhammad, drawing angry nationwide protests as Muslims consider any physical depiction of the prophet blasphemous.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan lifted its ban on Wikipedia services before dawn Tuesday, after the country’s media regulator blocked the site last week for not removing purportedly blasphemous content, claiming it hurts the sentiments of Muslims.Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif ordered the unblocking late on Monday, according to a government statement.

            The two parties held 2+2 meetings in Aug. and Dec. 2021, but they were all held via videoconference. This is the first physical meeting that is likely to be held in Taiwan.

            In December, Japan released new national security strategy and defense planning reports. Most notable of the new changes was the authorization of “counterstrike capability,” which points to the ability to strike another nation’s missile launching infrastructure. Additionally, the documents labeled China’s military threat as “unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge in ensuring the peace and security of Japan and the peace and stability of the international community.”TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The ruling parties of Taiwan and Japan are set to hold a foreign affairs and defense 2+2 meeting later this month, marking the third dialogue between the two political parties in the past two years.The meeting is expected to be held on Feb. 23, during which Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party and Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party will discuss how to deepen cooperation between the two nations in the field of security, as China increases military pressure on Taiwan.The two parties held 2+2 meetings in Aug. and Dec. 2021, but they were all held via videoconference.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802874,DPP ex-chair to visit Taiwan's outlying Kinmen to promote non-militarization,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After penning an open letter urging the government to withdraw troops from Kinmen and Matsu, former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chair Shih Ming-te (施明德) announced his plan to visit Kinmen to promote his plan.Liberty Times reported that on Monday (Feb. 6), eight Kinmen County councilors formed the “Cross-Party Administration Counseling Alliance” and the “Nonpartisan Alliance” during a press conference. One of the two alliances’ main goals was to advocate for the establishment of the Kinmen “permanent non-military zone” as an attempt to avert the possibility of cross-strait conflict.Shih responded to the news during an interview with CNA, saying he had immediately contacted Hung Hung-pin (洪鴻斌) one of the councilors. Hung reportedly expressed his hope that the Kinmen County Council will be able to invite him over for a visit.In December last year, Shih compared keeping Kinmen and Matsu armed to “burying a fuse right under the enemy’s feet.” He wrote, “Kinmen and Matsu are positioned in the range of the enemy’s traditional artillery, and once a war begins, they would be rendered helpless. Taiwan will not be able to save Kinmen and Matsu, and Kinmen and Matsu will not be able to protect Taiwan.”He urged Taiwan’s government to “remove the fuse” by withdrawing all troops stationed in the two outlying counties and establishing non-military and peaceful zones there instead. He said the move would be “an act of wisdom” and “a small step towards peaceful stability across the strait.”According to Shih, troops stationed on Kinmen have been reduced from nearly 100,000 to just 3,000 and, on Matsu, from 20,000 to 2,000. Those remaining troops in the two counties can do little to defend against Chinese invasion and their presence “only stokes the enemy’s desire to invade.”",2023/2/7,1116,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802901,Crypto criminals caught in New Taipei but funds still missing,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Police arrested two suspects late on Feb. 5 alleged to be involved in a crypto crime involving the Tether stablecoin (USDT) which they absconded during an in-person transaction at Kahsiung’s Zuoying High Speed Rail Station.The original crime involved two suspects who received a crypto transfer and then ran off without paying or completing the transaction on Jan. 30. According to the police, the victim, a 31-year-old woman surnamed Feng (馮), met a man surnamed Hsu (許) who told her he would exchange cash for crypto in a transfer worth a market value of NT$9 million (US$270,000), according to the Liberty Times report.After Feng transferred the crypto into a virtual wallet owned by Hsu, he pretended not to receive it, and told Feng he needed to visit a nearby bathroom in the railway station when he in fact fled the scene by taxi. When he failed to return, Feng knew something was amiss and contacted the police. More details about this encounter are here.After the railway police station received the report, a special investigative team was formed which reviewed hundreds of monitors to analyze surveillance footage, ultimately identifying 23-year-old Hsu and his accomplice, a 22-year-old male surnamed Luo (羅).On Feb. 5, the two were apprehended in New Taipei City’s Zhonghe District. The suspects claimed innocence, stating that they were simply acting on orders to collect the crypto from the victim.The police discovered the NT$9 million in crypto assets had already been transferred abroad by a suspected criminal group. Police believe the suspects they apprehended are simply “mules” employed by a larger fraud group.The case continues to be investigated in greater depth. After a hearing on the evening of Feb. 6, the two were transferred to the Qiaotou District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the Money Laundering Control Act.The railway police reminds the public that crypto can be kept in a cold wallet with a private key password to reduce the risk of fraud. Should an incident occur, it should be reported to the police as soon as possible to facilitate tracking the flow of crypto funds.",2023/2/7,2118,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802928,Former Chelsea forward Atsu rescued after Turkey earthquake,"Former Chelsea and Newcastle forward Christian Atsu was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building following the deadly earthquake that struck Turkey, the Ghana Football Association said in a Twitter post Tuesday.

            On Thursday, Atsu's club and agent said his well-being and whereabouts were unknown.

            The Ghana international plays for Turkish club Hatayspor. A club spokesman on Monday told Turkish media that Atsu was thought to be in a building that was brought down by the 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks that struck southeastern Turkey and neighboring Syria.











            Atsu's whereabouts and condition were unconfirmed overnight until the Ghana FA posted an update on its official Twitter site on Tuesday saying: “We’ve received some positive news that Christian Atsu has been successfully rescued.”

            The 31-year-old Atsu joined Hatayspor, which is based in the southern city of Antakya, last year.

            The quake hit early Monday and was centered in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras. It was felt as far away as Cairo in Egypt. Multiple aftershocks caused more destruction.

            Later Tuesday, second-division club Yeni Malatyaspor confirmed that 28-year-old goalkeeper Ahmet Eyup Turkaslan died following the earthquake.

            More than 6,000 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone and rescuers are racing to find survivors in freezing temperatures. Officials say as many as 1,500 buildings were destroyed in the Hatay province, just southwest of the earthquake’s epicenter and where the Hatayspor club is based.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802929,Japan games maker Nintendo's profit slips amid chips crunch,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese video game maker Nintendo recorded a slight drop in in profit in April to December as it maintained strong sales of its Switch console games.

            Nintendo Co.’s net profit in the first nine months of the fiscal year through March was 346 billion yen ($2.6 billion), down 5.8% from 367 billion yen in the same period of the previous year. 

            Nintendo, the Kyoto-based maker of Pokemon and Super Mario video games, did not provide a breakdown of quarterly numbers. 











            Among the games selling well were “Splatoon 3,” a paint-shooting game, “Pokemon Scarlet and Violet” and “Nintendo Switch Sports.”

            Nintendo sold fewer machines compared to a year earlier, partly because a shortage in computer chips, a critical part for the console, due to disruptions from the pandemic crimped production, the company said. 

            Nintendo lowered its full fiscal year profit forecast to 370 billion yen ($2.8 billion), from the 400 billion yen ($3 billion) it had projected in November. Previous fiscal year profit was 477.7 billion yen. 

            This fiscal year’s nine-month sales totaled nearly 1.3 trillion yen ($10 billion), down 1.9% from a year earlier. 

            Nintendo earlier was more bullish about its performance because an increase in people staying home during the pandemic boosted its sales. 

            That advantage is likely wearing off now that pandemic restrictions have eased and people increasingly are traveling and working outside their homes both in Japan and the rest of the world.

            Nintendo expects to sell 18 million Switch consoles in the current fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of 21 million Switch machines that was cut to 19 million machines late last year. 

            Cumulative Switch sales around the world have topped 122 million machines.

            Japanese exporters like Nintendo have gotten a boost in profits from the yen's weakness against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies. That lifts the value of their overseas earnings when converted into yen. 

            The U.S. dollar is now trading at about 130 yen after rising to about 150 Japanese yen a few months ago.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802930,Nets' Irving drama makes other East contenders look stable,"Blake Griffin is no stranger to trade drama. He was dealt from the Clippers to the Pistons in 2018, and last season he was playing for the Brooklyn Nets when they sent James Harden to Philadelphia in a February blockbuster.

            These days, Griffin is with the Boston Celtics, who seem awfully stable when compared with those Nets.

            “It's a tough time of year, but as far as this team goes, we're in a pretty good spot,” Griffin said after Boston's win at Detroit on Monday night. “This team is very focused.”











            In the aftermath of another Brooklyn bombshell — the Nets broke up their remaining All-Star duo of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving by trading Irving to Dallas — the other top teams in the Eastern Conference can feel pretty content with their situations. Boston has the best record in the NBA and a team that reached the Finals a season ago. Milwaukee has the league's longest current winning streak at eight games.

            Even the 76ers, who haven't always been a picture of tranquility in recent years, have won nine of 11 and are third in the conference, just three games behind the Celtics.

            The Nets had a stretch of 16 wins in 17 games from late November to early January, but Irving's recent trade request — and the fulfillment of it — now leave Brooklyn a very uncertain threat in the East. Cleveland jumped ahead of the Nets on Monday night and into fourth place in the conference.

            “I don’t think (the trade) affects Boston, Milwaukee — they’re still at the top,” Detroit coach Dwane Casey said before facing the Celtics. “It could affect Brooklyn. ... It’s interesting for the league and it just lets you know that anything can happen.”

            Griffin said he was a little surprised the deal came together so quickly.

            “I think Dallas has been wanting to get him for a little bit. Now probably feel like the West is kind of open right now and (the Mavericks are) trying to go for it,"" he said. ""It’s good for both sides. Kyrie wanted out and didn’t want to be there and you know, hopefully both sides are happy.”

            As for why Brooklyn's star-studded team — which at one point included Durant, Irving and Harden — didn't reach its potential, there are a number of explanations.

            “Health is one of them,"" Griffin said. ""Those guys played like 16 games together or something. And, don’t think the pieces were utilized the right way.”

            The Celtics recovered from a recent three-game losing streak and have won three of four. They're trying to hold off Milwaukee atop the East. The Bucks are a game back.

            “We’re very confident,"" Milwaukee big man Brook Lopez said. ""We’re just trying to play together and keep getting better.""

            The Bucks and Celtics have made deep runs into the postseason the past two years. Philadelphia hasn't reached the Finals since 2001.

            The 76ers showed they might have that potential this season when Joel Embiid scored 47 points in a win over Denver late last month. Coach Doc Rivers understands it's important to go into the postseason rested and ready.

            “The March schedule is tough, more because of the travel and the back-to-backs than the opponent,"" he said. ""The opponents are all tough, we don’t care about that. That’s going to be an interesting month for us on what we’re going to do as far as playing guys, resting guys.”

            The Celtics, Bucks and 76ers might make some moves of their own before Thursday’s trade deadline, but they’re unlikely to shake up their rosters the way Brooklyn did. The Nets had a dissatisfied star and decided to part with him. Boston, Milwaukee and Philadelphia, on the other hand, can deal from positions of strength.

            “You know there’s a lot going on in the NBA. It’s exciting, fun for everyone to watch and listen and all that stuff,” Lopez said. ""But obviously we’re really good at just staying focused, keeping our head grounded and focusing on what’s next.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802931,Lower turnout in renewed protests over French pension reform,"PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of French marched in a third round of protests Tuesday against planned pension reforms, while new nationwide strikes disrupted public transport and schools, as well as power, oil and gas supplies. Turnout at the demonstrations was lower than on previous occasions.

            Train passengers were expected to face more delays Wednesday, with two rail unions calling to extend their strike by 24 hours.

            The protests came a day after French lawmakers began debating a pension bill that would raise the minimum retirement from 62 to 64. The bill is the flagship legislation of President Emmanuel Macron's second term. 











            Over 750,000 people marched in Paris, the cities of Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Nantes and elsewhere, according to the Interior Ministry. That’s fewer than on the last protest, on Jan. 31. The nearly 60,000 protesters in the French capital marched from the Opera area across the city carrying placards reading “Save Your Pension” and “Tax Billionaires, Not Grandmas.” The strike disruptions were also milder than on Jan. 31.

            France’s current pension system “is a democratic achievement in the sense that it is a French specialty that other countries envy,” said one protester, media worker Anissa Saudemont, 29.

            “I feel that with high inflation, unemployment, the war in Ukraine and climate change, the government should focus on something else,” she added. 

            Much of the Paris march was peaceful, but there were flashes of unrest; police said officers detained 17 people for “throwing projectiles” and alleged vandalism. 

            French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne defended the government plan Tuesday but suggested there was room for adjustments.

            “I’m convinced there are points of agreement to be found. I’m convinced that we can improve this text together. It will be through debate, confronting ideas and, of course, respect,” she said, noting graffiti that appeared on the meeting place of the National Assembly, including a door marked with “60.” 

            If nothing is done, Borne said, taxes and social charges will increase, along with unemployment and lower purchasing power. That would would cost retirees with modest pensions and “all those who worked all their lives, and certainly not the big bosses,"" she said.

            “Voila, your alternative project,” Borne said.

            Last week, an estimated 1.27 million people demonstrated, according to authorities, more than in the first big protest day on Jan. 19. More demonstrations, called by France's eight main unions, are planned for Saturday. 

            Rail operator SNCF said train services were severely disrupted Tuesday across the country, including on its high-speed network. International lines to Britain and Switzerland were affected. The Paris metro was also disrupted.

            Saad Kadiui, 37, a consulting cabinet chief who had to go through a disrupted Paris train station Tuesday, said he did not support the “wearisome” strikes. “There are other ways to protest the pension reform,” he said.

            Kadiui said he supported the principle of the pension reform but wanted the bill to be improved in parliament. “I think that for some jobs, 64 is too late,” he said.

            Train travel in France is set to remain disrupted into Wednesday. The CGT-Cheminots and SUD-Rail unions on Tuesday evening extended their members' walkout by a day. SNCF said the action would lead to delays or cancellations in up to a third of high-speed trains.

            Workers in oil refineries have said they also plan to continue their strike action into Wednesday.

            Power producer EDF said the protest movement led to temporarily reduced electricity supplies Tuesday, without causing blackouts. More than half of the workforce was on strike at the TotalEnergies refineries, according to the company. 

            The Education Ministry said close to 13% of teachers were on strike, a decrease compared to last week's protest day. A third of French regions were on scheduled school breaks.

            Macron vowed to go ahead with the changes, despite opinion polls showing growing opposition. The bill would gradually increase the minimum retirement age to 64 by 2030 and accelerate a planned measure providing that people must have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension.

            The changes are designed to keep the pension system financially afloat. France’s aging population is expected to plunge the system into deficit in the coming decade.

            The parliamentary debates at the National Assembly and the Senate are expected to last several weeks.

            Opposition lawmakers have proposed more than 20,000 amendments to the bill debated on Monday, mostly by the left-wing Nupes coalition.

            Philippe Martinez, secretary general of the powerful CGT union, called on the government and lawmakers to “listen to the people.” Speaking on French radio network RTL, he denounced Macron’s attitude as “playing with fire.”

            Macron wants to show that “he is able to pass a reform, no matter what public opinion says, what the citizens think,” Martinez asserted.

            Rancor over the pension plan went beyond parliament's raucous debate. The speaker of the lower house, the National Assembly, reported that the bill had triggered anonymous voicemails, graffiti and a threatening letter to the head of the chamber's Social Affairs Committee.

            “That’s enough,” Yael Braun-Pivet tweeted. “These acts are an attack on our democratic life. ... We won’t tolerate it.”

            Several lawmakers from the far-right National Rally party received voicemails during Monday's debate saying that loved ones were hospitalized, in an apparent ploy to make them leave the assembly. 

            Party leader Marine Le Pen filed a complaint via a letter sent to the Paris prosecutor.

            AP journalists Sylvie Corbet, Oleg Cetinic and Elaine Ganley in Paris contributed.PARIS (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of French marched in a third round of protests Tuesday against planned pension reforms, while new nationwide strikes disrupted public transport and schools, as well as power, oil and gas supplies. Turnout at the demonstrations was lower than on previous occasions.Train passengers were expected to face more delays Wednesday, with two rail unions calling to extend their strike by 24 hours.The protests came a day after French lawmakers began debating a pension bill that would raise the minimum retirement from 62 to 64. The bill is the flagship legislation of President Emmanuel Macron's second term.Over 750,000 people marched in Paris, the cities of Nice, Marseille, Toulouse, Nantes and elsewhere, according to the Interior Ministry. That’s fewer than on the last protest, on Jan. 31. The nearly 60,000 protesters in the French capital marched from the Opera area across the city carrying placards reading “Save Your Pension” and “Tax Billionaires, Not Grandmas.” The strike disruptions were also milder than on Jan. 31.France’s current pension system “is a democratic achievement in the sense that it is a French specialty that other countries envy,” said one protester, media worker Anissa Saudemont, 29.“I feel that with high inflation, unemployment, the war in Ukraine and climate change, the government should focus on something else,” she added.Much of the Paris march was peaceful, but there were flashes of unrest; police said officers detained 17 people for “throwing projectiles” and alleged vandalism.French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne defended the government plan Tuesday but suggested there was room for adjustments.“I’m convinced there are points of agreement to be found. I’m convinced that we can improve this text together. It will be through debate, confronting ideas and, of course, respect,” she said, noting graffiti that appeared on the meeting place of the National Assembly, including a door marked with “60.”If nothing is done, Borne said, taxes and social charges will increase, along with unemployment and lower purchasing power.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802932,Denmark's defense minister takes sick leave after checkup,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s defense minister has taken a leave of absence for an undetermined period of time after he felt unwell and went to a Copenhagen hospital for a medical checkup last week.

            The 49-year-old Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, who is also deputy prime minister, heads the Liberals that are part of the NATO member’s governing three-party coalition.

            He wrote on his Facebook page on Feb. 1 that he had “dizziness and headache” and went to a hospital “just to be safe.” After being examined, he said he “there is nothing serious to report and I am feeling well again.”











            But he posted on Monday evening that he “was pulling the plug” and “will be back when I’m ready” after taking advice from his doctor.

            “I have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending a signal that it’s time to take a break,” Ellemann-Jensen wrote on Facebook.

            A senior member of the Liberals, Troels Lund Poulsen, will take over the defense ministry temporarily until Ellemann-Jensen can return. Another senior party member, Stephanie Lose, will assume the leadership of the Liberals in Ellemann-Jensen's absence.

            His sick leave will not affect the work of the government, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said.

            “I am very, very sad on his behalf,” she said. “The government is continuing its work.”

            On Dec. 15 — after 42 days of talks following the Nov. 1 general election — Frederiksen presented a three-party majority coalition that crosses the left-right divide. It includes the center-right Liberals, the center-left Social Democrats and the centrist Moderates party headed by former Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who is now Denmark's foreign minister.

            It was the first time in 44 years that such a centrist government had been formed, bringing an end to the two blocs that have opposed each other for decades.

            The three parties control 89 seats in the 179-seat parliament and are also supported by the four lawmakers representing the semi-independent Danish territories of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands.

            On Jan. 30, Ellemann-Jensen traveled with Frederiksen and Løkke Rasmussen on a one-day trip to Ukraine to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s defense minister has taken a leave of absence for an undetermined period of time after he felt unwell and went to a Copenhagen hospital for a medical checkup last week.The 49-year-old Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, who is also deputy prime minister, heads the Liberals that are part of the NATO member’s governing three-party coalition.He wrote on his Facebook page on Feb. 1 that he had “dizziness and headache” and went to a hospital “just to be safe.” After being examined, he said he “there is nothing serious to report and I am feeling well again.”But he posted on Monday evening that he “was pulling the plug” and “will be back when I’m ready” after taking advice from his doctor.“I have been unusually busy for a long time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802933,"NC State back in Top 25, latest gain in Keatts' overhaul","Kevin Keatts believed he could change North Carolina State's trajectory. He's being proven right with the 22nd-ranked Wolfpack back in the AP Top 25.

            
                N.C. State cracked the rankings for the first time in four years Monday entering Tuesday's trip to No. 8 Virginia. That's one of six ranked-vs-ranked games this week on the Top 25 schedule, and it marks the start of a three-game road swing for the Wolfpack.

            “We are trying to be the best version of ourselves,"" Keatts told The Associated Press. ""After every game, we talk about how we can improve from game to game. But it's not one of those motivational things where we've said, 'Hey, you've got to get to the Top 25.' 











            “We've said, ‘Let’s just keep winning and if you keep winning, we'll see what happens.'”

            N.C. State (19-5, 9-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) has won eight of nine, including home wins against then-ranked Duke and No. 19 Miami.

            The surge started with the return of sophomore NBA prospect Terquavion Smith (18.5 points per game) to the perimeter, but transfer-portal additions in point guard Jarkel Joiner (16.2 points) and soft-touch big man D.J. Burns Jr. (12.1) have been critical. There was also a coaching-staff overhaul.

            “I looked at everything from top to bottom,” Keatts said, “starting with myself.”

            It all came after bumpy years that put his long-term future at N.C. State in question.

            The Wolfpack made the NCAA Tournament in his first year (2018), but fell on the wrong side of the bubble in 2019. They were positioned to return in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out the event. Then i njuries to key players followed for two years, with last season's young team posting his first losing record.

            There was also the federal corruption investigation into college basketball, ensnaring N.C. State among several programs. That case hung over the entirety of Keatts' tenure — becoming public in 2017 roughly six months after he was hired — before finally reaching resolution in December 2021.

            Keatts' team entered the week a game out of the ACC lead. And Monday marked the first time since December 1982 that N.C. State is ranked while nearby powers Duke and North Carolina are not.

            The Wolfpack could get a boost with the return of La Salle transfer wing Jack Clark, who is day-to-day with a core-muscle injury that has sidelined him since late December. It's unclear when or even if they'll get back Utah transfer post Dusan Mahorcic, who dislocated his kneecap in December.

            Still, Keatts said he's grateful for the support from school leadership on the changes. Now it's time to see what's ahead.

            “My satisfaction is to be able to see (the players) get some recognition for all their hard work on the court,” Keatts said of the ranking, “and that it's paying off for them.”

            NEXT UP FOR NO. 1

            Purdue held the No. 1 spot despite losing at No. 18 Indiana over the weekend. The Boilermakers (22-2, 11-2 Big Ten) host Iowa on Thursday before visiting Northwestern on Sunday.

            Also in the Big Ten, the Hoosiers host No. 24 Rutgers on Tuesday.

            IN THE BIG EAST

            No. 21 Connecticut has a demanding week.

            The Huskies (18-6, 7-6) host No. 10 Marquette on Tuesday, then visit No. 23 Creighton — which was ranked as high as No. 7 early this season — on Saturday.

            UConn started 14-0 before losing six of eight, though the Huskies are coming off wins against DePaul and Georgetown. 

            IN THE BIG 12

            No. 17 TCU has its own doubleheader against ranked conference teams. The Horned Frogs (17-6, 6-4) visit No. 12 Kansas State on Tuesday, then return home Saturday to host No. 14 Baylor.

            TCU has lost five of nine dating to early January.

            WATCH LIST

            Florida Atlantic led the vote-getters among unranked teams.

            The Owls (22-2, 12-1 Conference USA) saw the end of their 20-game winning streak last week at UAB, knocking Dusty May's squad out of the poll. Florida Atlantic hosts Rice and Louisiana Tech later this week.

            Next up is Duke, which entered the week with two road games against ranked teams. But the Blue Devils (17-7, 8-5 ACC) lost badly at Miami on Monday night fresh off an emotional rivalry win against UNC, and next visit Virginia on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802953,"Sub-Saharan Africa is 'new epicenter' of extremism, says UN","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The new global epicenter of violent Islamic extremism is sub-Saharan Africa where people are increasingly joining because of economic factors and less for religious ones, says a new report by the U.N.'s international development agency.

            A significant increase of 92% of new recruits to extremist groups are joining for better livelihoods compared to the motivations of those interviewed in a previous report released in 2017, according to the UNDP report released on Tuesday.

            Many Africans' lives have been badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, high inflation, and climate change, said the report.











            There has been a 57% decrease in the number of people joining extremist groups for religious reasons, it said. 

            Nearly 2,200 people were interviewed for the report in eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Sudan. More than 1,000 interviewees are former members of violent extremist groups, both voluntary and forced recruits, said the report.

            At least 4,155 attacks across Africa were documented since in 2017, said the report. In these attacks, 18,417 deaths were recorded in the continent with Somalia accounting for the largest number of fatalities.

            The Somali government is currently carrying out what has been described as the most significant offensive against the al-Shabab extremist group in more than a decade.

            Those interviewed were drawn from various extremist groups across the continent including Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabab in Somalia, which pledges allegiance to al-Qaida, and in West Africa Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, or JNIM, which is allied to the Islamic State group.

            “Sub-Saharan Africa has become the new global epicenter of violent extremism with 48% of global terrorism deaths in 2021,"" UNDP administrator Achim Steiner said in a press briefing ahead of the report's launch. 

            This surge in extremism in Africa “not only adversely impacts lives, security, and peace, but also threatens to reverse hard-won development gains for generations to come,” he said.

            Military campaigns to stamp out extremism are not proving to be successful, said Steiner.

            “Security-driven counter-terrorism responses are often costly and minimally effective, yet investments in preventive approaches to violent extremism are woefully inadequate,” he said. ""The social contract between states and citizens must be reinvigorated to tackle root causes of violent extremism.” 

            About 71% of those who joined extremist groups were influenced by human rights abuses by state security forces, such as the killings or arrests of family members, said the report.

            Security forces in some sub-Saharan countries have been accused of brutality and extrajudicial killings and weak judicial systems give victims little hope for justice, it said. 

            Nigeria's Boko Haram and its offshoot, the Islamic State in West Africa Province, have grown in influence by using money to entice impoverished communities, Hassan Chibok, a community leader in Nigeria’s Borno state where the conflict is concentrated told The Associated Press in a separate interview. 

            Those who left the extremist groups cited unmet expectations, particularly the lack of sustained financial benefits, and an absence of trust in extremist leaders as their main reasons for quitting. 

            “Research shows that those who decide to disengage from violent extremism are less likely to rejoin and recruit others,"" said the report.

            “This is why it’s so important to invest in incentives that enable disengagement,” said Nirina Kiplagat, a UNDP specialist in preventing violent extremism in Africa. ""Local communities play a pivotal role in supporting sustainable pathways out of violent extremism, along with national governments' amnesty programs.” 

            The UNDP report recommends better basic services including child welfare, education, and quality livelihoods to prevent people from voluntarily joining extremist groups. It also urged the creation of more exit opportunities and investment in rehabilitation and community-based reintegration services.

            Since Steve Borthwick replaced Jones as head coach, members of the Australian's backroom staff — Matt Proudfoot, Brett Hodgson, Martin Gleeson — have left one by one and Cockerill is the last to go.

            Cockerill, a former England front-row forward, was interim coach following Jones' departure and the arrival of Borthwick. He will continue as forwards coach throughout the Six Nations, England said on Tuesday, before joining Montpellier to take up the same role.











            “Having coached and played in France previously, my family and I always had aspirations to return,"" Cockerill said. ""This opportunity presented itself some time ago and it was too hard to turn down personally and professionally.

            “It is disappointing not to work with Steve and the wider team beyond the Six Nations. I had hoped to be able stay for the Rugby World Cup, but the timings weren’t meant to be.""

            England's Rugby Football Union announced later Tuesday that Richard Wigglesworth and Aled Walters will join the coaching set-up from Leicester Tigers at the end of the domestic season.

            Wigglesworth, who will be assistant coach, played 33 times for England and represented the country at the Rugby World Cups in 2011 and 2015.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802956,2 pilots walk away from Boeing 737 tanker crash in Australia,"PERTH, Australia (AP) — Two pilots walked away with minor injuries after a Boeing 737 jet converted for firefighting crashed in Australia, officials said Tuesday.

            The twin-engine tanker owned by Canadian-based Coulson Aviation crashed in Fitzgerald River National Park in southern Western Australia state while fighting wildfires late Monday.

            Both pilots received only minor injuries even though the plane was engulfed in flames and smoke upon impact, Emergency Services Minister Stephen Dawson said.











            “It’s nothing short of miraculous that they were able to walk away from that plane,” Dawson told reporters.

            The men, believed to be Canadian citizens, were released from a hospital on Tuesday, Australian Associated Press reported.

            Three American aviators died when a C-130 Hercules tanker, a four-propeller plane also owned by Coulson Aviation, crashed in the east coast state of New South Wales while fighting wildfires in January 2020.

            The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the nation’s crash investigator, said Monday's crash was the first serious accident involving a Boeing 737 in Australia.

            The plane crashed shortly after dumping its load of water with additives in turbulent conditions. Coulson Aviation is sending executives to Sydney.

            Crash investigator Angus Mitchell said it was too early to suggest any link between the two Coulson Aviation crashes or wider implications for Boeing 737 passenger aircraft.

            “This is fairly common that air tankers are converted from other uses,” Mitchell said.

            “In terms of a large aircraft like this coming down, it’s generally never one thing that goes wrong, it’s quite often a succession of things,” Mitchell added.

            The plane had taken off from an airport 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802987,Super Bowl gambling surging as states legalize it? You bet,"ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — As legal sports gambling proliferates, the number of Americans betting on the Super Bowl and the total amount they’re wagering is surging — although most of the action is still off the books.

            An estimated 1 in 5 American adults will make some sort of bet, laying out a whopping $16 billion, or twice as much as last year, according to an industry trade group. 

            Even as legal gambling has spread to two-thirds of U.S. states, independent analysts say only about $1 billion of the total being wagered on Sunday's game will happen through casinos, racetracks or companies such as FanDuel and DraftKings, whose ads have become ubiquitous during sporting events.











            The vast majority of people, in other words, are still betting with friends and family, participating in office pools or taking their chances with a bookie.

            More than 50 million American adults are expected to bet on the national championship game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs, according to the American Gaming Association, whose estimates are based on a nationwide online survey of 2,199 adults. That's an increase of 61% from last year.

            Experts in addiction say aggressive advertising is contributing to a rise in problem gambling.

            “As sports betting expands, the risk of gambling problems expands,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.

            Thirty-three states, plus Washington, D.C., now offer legal sports betting, and more than half of all American adults live in one of those markets.

            “Every year, the Super Bowl serves to highlight the benefits of legal sports betting,"" said Bill Miller, the gambling association’s president and CEO. ""Bettors are transitioning to the protections of the regulated market ... and legal operators are driving needed tax revenue to states across the country.”

            But legal sports betting still represents just a small piece of the pie.

            Eilers & Krejcik Gaming Research, an independent analytics firm in California, estimates that just over $1 billion of this year's Super Bowl bets will be made legally. The leading states are: Nevada ($155 million); New York ($111 million); Pennsylvania ($91 million); Ohio ($85 million) and New Jersey ($84 million.) 

            The research firm estimates 10% to 15% of that total would be wagered live after the game begins. Another 15% to 20% would come in the form of same-game parlays, or a combination of bets involving the same game, such as betting on the winner, the total points scored and how many passing yards Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will accumulate.

            As legal sports betting grows, so too has concern about its effect on people with gambling problems.

            The National Council on Problem Gambling has conducted nationwide surveys since 2018, when New Jersey won a U.S. Supreme Court case clearing the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting. They ask questions like, “Do you ever borrow money to gamble?”

            Between 2018 and 2021, the number of people whose answers indicated they were at risk of a gambling problem increased by 30%, said Whyte, the council's executive director.

            He added that the Super Bowl presents an opportunity to see how well responsible gambling messaging and campaigns by sports books and professional sports leagues are working. 

            On Tuesday, New Jersey gambling regulators unveiled new requirements for sports books to analyze the data they collect about their customers to look for evidence of problem gambling, and to take various steps to intervene with these customers when warranted.

            “It is no coincidence that our announcement comes just a week ahead of one of the biggest days in sports wagering, serving as a reminder of how devastating a gambling addiction can be,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said. 

            As of Tuesday, the Eagles were 1.5-point favorites over the Chiefs on FanDuel, the official odds provider to The Associated Press. Bettors are evenly split on who will win the game, according to the gaming industry association.

(AP) — As legal sports gambling proliferates, the number of Americans betting on the Super Bowl and the total amount they’re wagering is surging — although most of the action is still off the books.An estimated 1 in 5 American adults will make some sort of bet, laying out a whopping $16 billion, or twice as much as last year, according to an industry trade group.Even as legal gambling has spread to two-thirds of U.S. states, independent analysts say only about $1 billion of the total being wagered on Sunday's game will happen through casinos, racetracks or companies such as FanDuel and DraftKings, whose ads have become ubiquitous during sporting events.The vast majority of people, in other words, are still betting with friends and family, participating in office pools or taking their chances with a bookie.More than 50 million American adults are expected to bet on the national championship game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs, according to the American Gaming Association, whose estimates are based on a nationwide online survey of 2,199 adults. That's an increase of 61% from last year.Experts in addiction say aggressive advertising is contributing to a rise in problem gambling.“As sports betting expands, the risk of gambling problems expands,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling.Thirty-three states, plus Washington, D.C., now offer legal sports betting, and more than half of all American adults live in one of those markets.“Every year, the Super Bowl serves to highlight the benefits of legal sports betting,"" said Bill Miller, the gambling association’s president and CEO. ""Bettors are transitioning to the protections of the regulated market ... and legal operators are driving needed tax revenue to states across the country.”But legal sports betting still represents just a small piece of the pie.Eilers & Krejcik Gaming Research, an independent analytics firm in California, estimates that just over $1 billion of this year's Super Bowl bets will be made legally. The leading states are: Nevada ($155 million); New York ($111 million); Pennsylvania ($91 million); Ohio ($85 million) and New Jersey ($84 million.)The research firm estimates 10% to 15% of that total would be wagered live after the game begins. Another 15% to 20% would come in the form of same-game parlays, or a combination of bets involving the same game, such as betting on the winner, the total points scored and how many passing yards Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will accumulate.As legal sports betting grows, so too has concern about its effect on people with gambling problems.The National Council on Problem Gambling has conducted nationwide surveys since 2018, when New Jersey won a U.S. Supreme Court case clearing the way for all 50 states to offer legal sports betting. They ask questions like, “Do you ever borrow money to gamble?”Between 2018 and 2021, the number of people whose answers indicated they were at risk of a gambling problem increased by 30%, said Whyte, the council's executive director.He added that the Super Bowl presents an opportunity to see how well responsible gambling messaging and campaigns by sports books and professional sports leagues are working.On Tuesday, New Jersey gambling regulators unveiled new requirements for sports books to analyze the data they collect about their customers to look for evidence of problem gambling, and to take various steps to intervene with these customers when warranted.“It is no coincidence that our announcement comes just a week ahead of one of the biggest days in sports wagering, serving as a reminder of how devastating a gambling addiction can be,"" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said.As of Tuesday, the Eagles were 1.5-point favorites over the Chiefs on FanDuel, the official odds provider to The Associated Press. Bettors are evenly split on who will win the game, according to the gaming industry association.___Follow Wayne Parry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802988,Court says South Korea responsible for Vietnam War massacre,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court on Tuesday ordered the government to pay 30 million won ($24,000) to a Vietnamese woman who survived a gunshot wound but lost several relatives when South Korean marines rampaged through her village during the Vietnam War in 1968.

            In awarding the compensation to 62-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the government’s argument that it was unclear whether South Korean troops were responsible for the slaughter in the village of Phong Nhi in central Vietnam. 

            The court also rejected the government’s argument that civilian killings were unavoidable because the South Korean troops were dealing with Viet Cong guerrillas who often blended with villagers, according to Thanh’s lawyer, Lim Jae-sung. The government’s lawyers were also unsuccessful in invoking a statute of limitations. 











            The ruling marks the first time a South Korean court has found the government responsible for mass killings of Vietnamese civilians during the war and could potentially open the way for similar lawsuits. Then ruled by anti-communist military leaders, South Korea sent more than 320,000 troops to Vietnam, the largest foreign contingent fighting alongside U.S. troops. 

            South Korea’s Justice Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a query whether the government will appeal. 

            The government has never officially acknowledged responsibility for civilian massacres linked to South Korean soldiers in Vietnam, which some experts say were possibly responsible for thousands of deaths. Those atrocities haven’t meaningfully impacted official relations with Vietnam, whose growing economy benefits from South Korean investment.

            According to U.S. military documents and survivors, more than 70 people were killed and around 20 others injured when South Korean marines allegedly fired at unarmed civilians as they swept through Phong Nhi and the nearby village of Phong Nhut on Feb. 12, 1968. The action came after least one South Korean soldier got struck and injured by nearby enemy fire. 

            Thanh, then 7 years old, was treated for gunshot wounds in her stomach while five of her family members died, including her mother, sister and brother. 

            According to U.S. military investigation records, U.S. Marines and South Vietnamese militia provided medical treatment to villagers who fled as South Korean soldiers continued to shoot inside the villages. 

            U.S. Marines later entered the villages and found piles of bodies in different areas, many burned or buried in ash. One U.S. soldier took photos which were used as evidence during Thanh’s trial. 

            Thanh filed the lawsuit against the South Korean government in 2020 and testified at the Seoul court last August. The trial also included the testimonies of other Vietnamese villagers and South Korean war veterans such as Ryu Jin-seong, a member of the marine unit linked to the attacks in Phong Nhi and Phong Nhut. He provided a first-hand account of how the South Korean soldiers shot at unarmed civilians, many of them children and women. 

            Thanh, who awaited the ruling in Vietnam, said she was “overjoyed” by her court victory.

            “I think that the souls (of those who died in Phong Nhi) were always with me and supported me,” she said in a video message translated by her legal team. “I am overjoyed because I think that the souls can now rest easy.”

            The South Korean government had argued there was no conclusive evidence that South Korean troops were responsible for the killings, even suggesting that the aggressors may have been Viet Cong fighters disguised in South Korean uniforms who were attempting psychological warfare.

            The government also insisted that even if South Korean soldiers were involved, their aggressive response was defensible because they were facing constant threats from Viet Cong guerrillas who often hid among villagers and actively recruited young women.

            Thanh’s lawyers pushed back at the claim, saying there was no way to justify the killings when South Korean veterans have consistently said they didn’t face any meaningful resistance or aggression from the villagers, who were rounded up and shot from close range.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A South Korean court on Tuesday ordered the government to pay 30 million won ($24,000) to a Vietnamese woman who survived a gunshot wound but lost several relatives when South Korean marines rampaged through her village during the Vietnam War in 1968.In awarding the compensation to 62-year-old Nguyen Thi Thanh, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the government’s argument that it was unclear whether South Korean troops were responsible for the slaughter in the village of Phong Nhi in central Vietnam.The court also rejected the government’s argument that civilian killings were unavoidable because the South Korean troops were dealing with Viet Cong guerrillas who often blended with villagers, according to Thanh’s lawyer, Lim Jae-sung.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802989,Separatist rebels take New Zealand pilot hostage in Papua,"JAYAPURA, Indonesia (AP) — Separatist rebels set fire to a small plane carrying six people after it landed at a remote airport in Indonesia's restive Papua province and took its pilot, a New Zealand citizen, hostage early Tuesday, police and rebels said.

            Rebel spokesperson Sebby Sambom said independence fighters from the West Papua Liberation Army, the military wing of the Free Papua Organization, stormed the plane shortly after it landed in Paro in Nduga, a mountainous district.

            Sambom said the fighters, led by group commander Egianus Kogeya, set fire to the plane and seized its pilot, Philip Mark Mehrtens, as part of their struggle for independence. He said all five passengers, including a young child, were released because they are indigenous Papuans.











            “We have taken the pilot hostage and we are bringing him out,” Sambom said in a statement. ""We will never release the pilot we are holding hostage unless Indonesia recognizes and frees Papua from Indonesian colonialism.”

            New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said Wednesday that New Zealand's embassy in Jakarta was leading his nation's response to the case, but he couldn't say much more.

            “Consular support is being provided to the family,"" Hipkins said. “You’ll be familiar with the fact that in these kinds of cases, we keep our public comments to a bare minimum.”

            Hipkins was referring to a policy of avoiding any discussion that could further endanger hostages or detainees during diplomatic efforts to secure their release.

            Sambom said the pilot is alive but did not provide his location. He said the pilot is being held because New Zealand, along with Australia and the United States, cooperate militarily with Indonesia. 

            “New Zealand, Australia and America must be held accountable for what they have done, helping the Indonesian military to kill and genocide indigenous Papuans in the past 60 years,” Sambom said.

            Conflicts between indigenous Papuans and Indonesian security forces are common in the impoverished Papua region, a former Dutch colony in the western part of New Guinea that is ethnically and culturally distinct from much of Indonesia. Papua was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969 after a U.N.-sponsored ballot that was widely seen as a sham. Since then, a low-level insurgency has simmered in the mineral-rich region, which is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua.

            Ahead of Tuesday’s attack, police received information from the local administration in Nduga on Saturday that 15 construction workers who were building a health center in Paro village had been captured by rebels and allegedly taken hostage along with the pilot, said Papua police chief Mathius D. Fakhiri.

            “We are trying to coordinate with the involvement of community leaders. Hopefully we can negotiate to release those who are being held hostage,” Fakhiri said, adding that authorities “are now trying to communicate” with the rebels.

            Amnesty International condemned the attacks on civilians and public facilities in Papua and urged the rebels to release the pilot and other hostages.

            “The plane arson attack and taking hostages are once again evidence of the repetition of violence in the Papua region and civilians are again the victims,” said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia. “We call for a review of the security approach that has been chosen by the state so far.”

            Papua police spokesperson Ignatius Benny Ady Prabowo said soldiers and police were searching for the pilot and passengers.

            The plane, operated by Indonesian aviation company Susi Air, was carrying about 450 kilograms (990 pounds) of supplies from an airport in Timika, a mining town in neighboring Mimika district.

            Conflict in the region has spiked in the past year, with dozens of rebels, security forces and civilians killed.

            Last July, gunmen believed to be separatist rebels killed 10 traders who came from other Indonesian islands and an indigenous Papuan. Sambom later claimed responsibility for the killing, accusing the victims of being spies for the Indonesian government.

            Last March, rebel gunmen killed eight technicians repairing a remote telecommunications tower. In December 2018, at least 31 construction workers and a soldier were killed in one of the worst attacks in the province.

            Flying is the only practical way of accessing many areas in the mountainous and jungle-clad easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802990,"Germany, Denmark, Netherlands pledge Ukraine Leopard 1 tanks","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands announced Tuesday that they plan to provide Ukraine with at least 100 refurbished Leopard 1 battle tanks in the coming months, a pledge that comes as Kyiv anticipates a new Russian offensive around the anniversary of its invasion.

            The announcement followed Germany agreeing last month to allow deliveries of the more modern German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.

            In a joint statement, the defense ministers of Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands said the shipment of the older Leopard 1 tanks was part of an effort “to support Ukraine in their endeavor to withstand Russian aggression.”











            ”(It) will significantly enhance Ukraine’s military potential for the restoration of their violated territorial integrity,” they said, adding that the delivery would occur “within the coming months” and include logistical support and training.

            Ukrainian officials say they expect Russian forces to make a new drive in eastern and southern Ukraine, as the Kremlin strives to secure territory it illegally annexed in late September and where it claims its rule is welcomed.

            The anticipated Russian push may seek to recapture territory Moscow lost in a late summer counteroffensive. Battlefield setbacks in Ukraine have embarrassed the Kremlin, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is keen to cement public support for the war.

            Some Western military analysts were skeptical, however, of Russia’s ability to mount a large new offensive in coming weeks, particularly in time for the Feb. 24 anniversary, that might alter the course of the war. Ukraine and Russia are both still training their new troops and amassing weapons.

            News agency dpa quoted Germany's defense minister, Boris Pistorius, as saying during a visit to Kyiv on Tuesday that the first 20-25 Leopard 1 tanks would reach Ukraine this summer.

            Pistorius’ office said German authorities have authorized the export of up to 178 Leopard 1 A5 tanks to Ukraine, but noted that the actual number sent would depend on the refurbishments required.

            The three countries that made the pledge said Belgium has also shown interest in participating in the initiative.

            The Leopard 1, manufactured between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s, was the first battle tank built for West Germany’s Bundeswehr. The German military hasn’t had any of the tanks since 2003.

            Germany last month agreed to send 14 newer Leopard 2 A6 tanks from its military’s current stocks. The country’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday that the first Leopard 2s could arrive in Ukraine by the end of March. The first Ukrainian soldiers to be trained on the tanks departed for Germany this week.

            Several other European countries have equipped their armies with Leopard 2s, and Germany’s move following weeks of mounting pressure meant that those nations could also give some of their stocks to Ukraine.

            In some of the latest fighting in Ukraine, local authorities reported Tuesday that Russian shelling damaged a hospital and apartment buildings.

            The shelling in the northeastern town of Vovchansk caused multiple fires late Monday, including at the two-story municipal hospital, the regional State Emergency Service said in an online statement.

            Emergency crews evacuated eight civilians from the site before putting out the blaze, which caused no casualties, authorities said.

            Vovchansk is in the Kharkiv region, which was occupied by Russia after its full-scale invasion began on Feb. 24 and subsequently retaken by Ukraine in the course of its counteroffensive. 

            Russian forces are “regrouping” as they attempt to break Ukrainian lines in five areas in the country’s east and northeast, the Ukrainian military reported Tuesday.

            The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Moscow was focusing its efforts near the towns of Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the eastern Donetsk province, as well as Kupiansk in Kharkiv province.

            In the Donetsk region, Russian forces also kept up their shelling of Vuhledar, a mining town that has become one of Moscow’s key targets, the Ukrainian presidential office said. Five apartment buildings were destroyed in the town, the office said, which had a prewar population of 14,000. 

            Donetsk province has seen a marked influx of Russian troops in the past few days, according to Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko.

            “The transfer of Russian army units goes on day and night. (Russian) shelling intensifies, pressure from the Russians intensifies each day,” Kyrylenko said on Ukrainian television.

            Russia is also preparing for a major offensive in Luhansk province, which is directly north of Donetsk, Gov. Serhii Haidai said in televised remarks.

            The number of Russian attacks in the province increased “dramatically” on Monday and overnight, he said. 

            “The occupiers are looking for weak points and have brought a lot of equipment and thousands of troops to the front line,” Haidai said.

            About 60,000 households in Marhanets were left without water after Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant cut the power supply to a local pumping station, authorities reported.

            Mykola Lukashuk, who heads the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council, accused Russian forces of firing on towns and villages neighboring the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, with heavy artillery and multiple rocket-launchers overnight.

            The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an assessment Tuesday that Russia is “requiring undermanned, inexperienced units to achieve unrealistic objectives due to political and professional pressure.”

            “Russian leaders will likely continue to demand sweeping advances,” it added. “It remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks.”

            Michael Kofman, an American military analyst and director of Russia Studies at the CAN research organization in Arlington, Virginia, tweeted on Monday it was unclear how big an offensive Russia is able to mount.

            He added, “but I suspect it may prove underwhelming, focused largely on the Donbas.”

            Michael Clarke, visiting professor of war studies at King’s College London, said he would be “amazed, I mean, truly amazed, if (the Russians) are in any shape to launch a strategic offensive on the 24th.”

            He acknowledged Moscow has been scaling up its troop deployment in Ukraine and said Russia could also launch local offensives or major air attacks. But he recalled that Russian commanders are still smarting from their failed attempt early in the war to take Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian government.

            He said that “military planners in Russia will be aware that when they start this new offensive, they’ve got to get it right.

            “After the fiasco of the first (offensive), it would be better to leave it and go late than go early and make a mess of it again,” Clarke told The Associated Press.

            Meanwhile, the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday appointed national police chief Ihor Klymenko as the country’s new interior minister. Klymenko had served as acting interior minister since the Jan. 18 death of his predecessor, Denys Monastyrskyi, in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv..

            The Ministry of Internal Affairs controls the police and border forces, National Guard, and emergency response service.

            Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, also appointed Vasyl Malyuk to lead Ukraine’s main security agency.

Serhii Haidai said in televised remarks.The number of Russian attacks in the province increased “dramatically” on Monday and overnight, he said.“The occupiers are looking for weak points and have brought a lot of equipment and thousands of troops to the front line,” Haidai said.About 60,000 households in Marhanets were left without water after Russian shelling near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant cut the power supply to a local pumping station, authorities reported.Mykola Lukashuk, who heads the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council, accused Russian forces of firing on towns and villages neighboring the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, with heavy artillery and multiple rocket-launchers overnight.The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an assessment Tuesday that Russia is “requiring undermanned, inexperienced units to achieve unrealistic objectives due to political and professional pressure.”“Russian leaders will likely continue to demand sweeping advances,” it added. “It remains unlikely that Russia can build up the forces needed to substantially affect the outcome of the war within the coming weeks.”Michael Kofman, an American military analyst and director of Russia Studies at the CAN research organization in Arlington, Virginia, tweeted on Monday it was unclear how big an offensive Russia is able to mount.He added, “but I suspect it may prove underwhelming, focused largely on the Donbas.”Michael Clarke, visiting professor of war studies at King’s College London, said he would be “amazed, I mean, truly amazed, if (the Russians) are in any shape to launch a strategic offensive on the 24th.”He acknowledged Moscow has been scaling up its troop deployment in Ukraine and said Russia could also launch local offensives or major air attacks. But he recalled that Russian commanders are still smarting from their failed attempt early in the war to take Kyiv and topple the Ukrainian government.He said that “military planners in Russia will be aware that when they start this new offensive, they’ve got to get it right.“After the fiasco of the first (offensive), it would be better to leave it and go late than go early and make a mess of it again,” Clarke told The Associated Press.Meanwhile, the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday appointed national police chief Ihor Klymenko as the country’s new interior minister. Klymenko had served as acting interior minister since the Jan. 18 death of his predecessor, Denys Monastyrskyi, in a helicopter crash on the outskirts of Kyiv..The Ministry of Internal Affairs controls the police and border forces, National Guard, and emergency response service.Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, also appointed Vasyl Malyuk to lead Ukraine’s main security agency.___Jordans reported from Berlin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4802991,China says will 'safeguard interests' over balloon shootdown,"BEIJING (AP) — China said Tuesday it will “resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests” over the shooting down of a suspected Chinese spy balloon by the United States, as relations between the two countries deteriorate further. 

            The balloon prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a highly-anticipated visit to Beijing this week that had offered slight hopes for an improvement in relations. 

            China claims it was a civilian balloon used for meteorological research but has refused to say to which government department or company it belongs. 











            Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Tuesday reiterated that the “unmanned airship” posed no threat and entered U.S. airspace accidentally. 

            Mao again criticized the U.S. for overreacting rather than adopting a “calm, professional"" manner, and for using force in bringing the balloon down Saturday in the Atlantic Ocean just off the U.S. coast. 

            Asked if China wanted the debris returned, she only reasserted that the balloon “belongs to China."" 

            “The balloon does not belong to the U.S. The Chinese government will continue to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,"" Mao said at a daily briefing without giving further details. 

            Beijing's attitude has hardened considerably following a surprisingly mild initial response on Friday, in which it described the balloon's presence as an accident and expressed “regret"" for the balloon having entered the U.S. 

            Subsequent statements have grown firmer, in the same tone used to confront the U.S. over issues from Taiwan to trade, technology restrictions and China's claim to the South China Sea. China says it lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, accusing Washington of having “obviously overreacted and seriously violated the spirit of international law and international practice."" 

            Recent developments have laid bare the extremely fragile nature of what many had hoped could be a manageable economic, political and military rivalry.

            U.S.-China tensions have stirred deep concern in Washington and among many of its allies. They worry that outright conflict could have a strong negative impact on the global economy, especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, on which China has largely sided with Moscow. 

            Balloons either suspected of or confirmed to be Chinese have been spotted over countries from Japan to Costa Rica. Taiwanese media have reported that mysterious white balloons had been spotted over the island at least three times in the past two years.

            That's especially concerning because China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary and routinely sends warships and military aircraft into the island's air defense identification zone and across the middle line of the Taiwan Strait dividing the sides.

            Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense has never explicitly linked the balloons to China. However, the recent furor over the Chinese balloon in the U.S. brought attention back to these mysterious sightings. 

            The size of the Chinese balloon in the U.S., as well as the equipment attached to it, had all drawn intense speculation as to its purpose. Along with Washington, most security experts dismissed Beijing's assertions that the balloon was intended for meteorological rather than spying purposes. 

            But it doesn't look like any weather balloon that Cheng Ming-dian, head of Taiwan’s Central Weather Bureau, has seen.

            “In the meteorology world, I haven’t found a person who has seen or heard of a weather balloon that looks like this,” Cheng said. 

            While China has in recent months moderated the abrasive tone of its diplomacy, it is “still pursuing those broader, long-term strategic agendas on the economic, tech and security fronts,"" said Collin Koh Swee Lean research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University.

            “In other words, if you cast the change in rhetoric aside, we’re in fact not seeing any real meaningful improvement in the extant China-U.S. relations, which will continue to be dominated by rivalry,"" Koh said. “And the latest spy balloon incident only looks set to broaden the schism.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803009,'People of Deutschland': Everyday racism in Germany,"When Patricia Yen Lyn Freimuth moved to a new apartment in Munich with her husband, she was asked if she was the new cleaning lady. In her essay in the book ""People of Deutschland,"" the PR expert with German and Chinese roots reports on the racist ""background noise"" that she and her sister keep experiencing as people of Asian descent in Germany.Germany sees itself as a liberal country, and is perceived in 2023 as much more cosmopolitan than before the turn of the millennium. Since the 2006 World Cup, it has often been said that ""Germany has become more colorful."" Given the rise in diversity in the media and in politics, observers might get the impression that racism is waning in the country.However, there is no reason to relax, according to the government's first annual report on racism, which was recently presented by Germany's integration and anti-racism commissioner, Reem Alabali-Radovan.According to the report, which focuses on the perspectives of the people actually affected, everyday racism in Germany manifests itself not only in physical acts of violence and verbal attacks. People who clearly have a migrant background also experience discrimination at school, in sports clubs, when looking for housing, at work or by the police.Released during Black History Month, ""People of Deutschland"" is a book that focuses on the personal experiences of people with a visible migration background.Among them are celebrities like the author and activist Düzen Tekkal, the TV presenter Mola Adebisi and Hans Sarpei, a former professional soccer player.Regular people, too, share their experiences of everyday racism — which can often be more harmful than ideology-driven racism, argues the editor, Martina Rink. ""Everyday racism comes with the paradox that it can come from anyone and everyone, even people who genuinely like you and don't notice when they hurt you,"" she says.Both Martina Rink, who has Persian roots and grew up in the UK and Germany, and co-editor and creative manager Simon Usifo, son of a Nigerian father and a French mother, contributed essays to ""People of Deutschland.""The 45 personal stories are complemented with photos by Berlin-based photographer Sammy Hart, who is known for his sensitive portraits.The book has stories on latent racism — micro aggression, which can be ""unconscious bias, prejudices and stereotypes,"" Usifo told DW. ""It ranges all the way to the other end of the spectrum, that is psychological and physical violence. Actually, everything is represented in the book.""The aim of the book, he said, is not to take militant action against racist people, but to educate readers about the fact that everyone has prejudices because ""we are socialized that way,"" and that you can also recognize racist patterns and actively change them.""Basically, it's like a muscle you have to exercise,"" Usifo argues. ""If you approach people and develop sensitivity because of these stories, then you can work on it.""Mola Adebisi, a German TV presenter and singer, describes in his entry how ""at the height of his success"" in the late 1990s, a detective came to see him one day in his office and told him that the record cover of a neo-Nazi band showed him alongside singers Farin Urlaub and Campino as a hanged man and that he was insulted in one of their songs.""Up to that point, I had had no experience with racism or xenophobia,"" Adebisi writes in the book, adding that he had seemingly lived his life naively and with a lot of luck. ""But then everything changed. Now I was accompanied by bodyguards at every gig; when I was on the road it was no longer about partying and being in a good mood, but level 3 police security. Now, I only entered my studio via the loading dock.""He writes he started listening very carefully to every word, even if something was said without a thought. ""I registered latent nationalism everywhere. On planes, I was always addressed in English. Supposed compliments were poisoned and saturated with racism: 'For a Black man, you sure look good.' If that's what being German feels like, I thought, it's damn hard to feel German.""In 2020, Serpil Temiz Unvar's son Ferhat was killed in a racially-motivated attack in the German town of Hanau. In school, he faced racist verbal violence from teachers, and had to repeat a class although he had just one really poor grade. He understood early on that it was a structural problem and later tried to create awareness surrounding it. He was 22 years old when he was killed.""Why was someone like the assassin allowed to have a gunin the first place?"" asks his mother in the book. ""There were so many clues that were not followed up. In my eyes, the assassin was allowed to legally practice killing our children for years thanks to his gun license.""""(...) The attack in Hanau was not only directed at my son, but at all migrants,"" Serpil Temiz Unvar says. ""I learned that we have to fight for ourselves, so I decided to speak up. On November 14, 2020 — on what would have been his birthday — I founded the Ferhat Unvar Education Initiative .""""I know what racism feels like and what it means, especially for single women,"" added Unvar. ""I know their fears. The school fights against them, even if they can't defend themselves.""In the name of the Ferhat Unvar education initiative, Serpil Temiz Unvar confronts the authorities, not only in Hanau, but all over Germany. ""I want to show how deeply rooted racism is in schools and offices,"" she writes, adding that she has experienced it herself, and her friends have similar stories to tell.""Ideological racism à la Ku Klux Klan"" is not the biggest problem in our society, says Usifo. ""The basic problem is that we have a majority society that partly doesn't experience racism itself and therefore completely underestimates how violent and how hurtful everyday life can be.""That is where ""People of Deutschland"" comes in. With the mix of people from different backgrounds and celebrities from the music, sports, art and fashion sector, he and Martina Rink hope to reach a wide range of people instead of ""just arguing into this bubble that's already convinced itself.""There is no fee for the authors. Rink and Usifo plan to donate the proceeds to Düzen Tekkal's German Dream independent education initiative, which works toward making sure that ""democracy, tolerance and pluralism are carried into the future.""Racism is a problem for society as a whole, and it needs to be faced by all people in Germany. ""In everyday life, we are all simply not immune, even if not driven by a negative intention, to unconsciously and reflexively think, act and communicate in a racist way,"" Rink wrote in the press booklet for ""People of Deutschland.""""It's not enough to not perceive ourselves as racist. We all need to actively confront racism,"" Usifo adds.This article was originally written in German. The interview with Simon Usifo was conducted by Yann Durand.",2023/2/7,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803010,How export bans boost Indonesia's industrial policy,"Berlin is looking to diversify its supply chains, under Germany's new strategy aimed at cutting its dependence on China and Russia, in particular, for pivotal supplies of raw materials. But with rising prices and market disruption, many resource-rich countries are reluctant to flaunt their wealth as they may have in the past. Instead, they're trying to make the best out of global developments tilting in their favor.Germany, like many other advanced economy in the West, used to turn cheap imports from developing countries into manufactured, state-of-the-art products that sold for many times their commodities' prices on global markets.China has already woken up to the flawed world trade pattern many years ago, gradually shedding its image as a cheap global workshop and replacing it with a thrust to higher-end products. Its Asian peer Indonesia is now following in Beijing's footsteps, as it seeks to shore up 20 years of unending growth with a manufacturing drive.The country's exports used to be ""dominated by commodities,"" which is one of the reasons why it hasn't fully developed as an emerging economy, Jan Rönnefeld, head of the German Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, told DW.Indonesian President Joko Widodo is now seeking to turn his country's economic fortunes around by making the commodities supplier a hub for manufacturing. His goal is to turn Indonesia into a fully fledged industrialized nation by 2045.The South Asian country is blessed with huge deposits of coal, tin, nickel, bauxite and copper. It is the world's largest exporter of thermal coal, palm oil and refined tin.Widodo already began changing Indonesia's export policy in 2014, when he introduced a ban on shipping some minerals abroad. Frank Malerius from Germany Trade & Invest (GTAI), a foreign trade promotion agency, says implementation of the ban has always been ""very spotty."" But the government is now tightening export rules, he told DW.Under regulation in effect since 2020, foreign buyers of Indonesian nickel, for example, must now invest in domestic smelters and process the raw material locally. Indonesia has the world's largest nickel reserves, and the metal is in high demand due to its usage in steel making and electric-vehicle batteries.In order to facilitate the new investment, Jakarta has relaxed the country's investment and labor laws, opening up large swaths of the economy to the possibility of foreign ownership.Frank Malerius said Widodo's policy resulted in ""exactly what the government hoped would happen,"" namely that more and more foreign companies have come to invest in Indonesia.According to data provided by the German state-run Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM), a total of $21.6 billion (€20.15 billion) in foreign direct investment had flown into Indonesia in the first half of 2022 alone — 40% more than in the same period in 2021. The boom was primarily driven by Chinese steelmakers, said Malerius, who'd been building ""smelters and steel mills"" and turning Indonesia into a steel exporting nation.About 5 years ago, Indonesia had no global market share in steel. Now, the country's exports are worth around $20 billion, making it one of the largest exporter in the world, said Malerius.Several overseas companies, like German carmaker Volkswagen and its American rivals Ford and Tesla, are considering entering the Indonesian manufacturing boom, which would especially secure the country's nickel wealth.""But it will be difficult for them to find supply chains in which the Chinese are not already involved in some way,"" said Malerius, adding that partnerships with the Chinese may be the only way forward for overseas investors.Despite a growing dependency on essential raw materials from Indonesia, the European Union has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against the country's nickel export ban and was proven right in a ruling in November last year. But Widodo is shunning the WTO decision.As if to add insult to injury, the Indonesian president announced only one month later at the G20 summit in Bali in December that he's planning to form a cartel for battery materials such as Nickel with other countries, similar to the OPEC oil cartel.German chemical company BASF, meanwhile, has teamed up with French mining company Eramet in January to build a nickel-cobalt plant in Indonesia to secure a steady stream of the metals. The deal worth about €2.4 billion ($2.57 billion) is said to be close to completion, with the new plant scheduled to start in 2026.Widodo is, however, not only clamping down on exports of nickel. Metals like copper, tin and bauxite are also in his focus, with a ban on exporting unprocessed bauxite coming into force already in June this year. The metal is essential in making aluminum for the car and aerospace industry, and Indonesia is one of the world's most important exporter of it. The country has also stopped exports of palm oil. It currently makes up 60% of the world market.Other onshoring projects of Widodo include a domestic rare-earths industry to meet the demand of clean tech industries he wants to settle in the country. Deposits of the raw materials are currently being mapped and a concept drawn up for their use, the government news agency Antara News reported recently.""Even though Indonesia is far away, there is potential for German companies in many areas,"" said Chamber of Commerce representative Jan Rönnfeld. The sheer magnitude of the country and its huge population of almost 300 million people — of which 100 million belong to the middle class — would ""provide potential in every area.""So far, the Chinese, the Japanese and the South Koreans have a head start in Indonesia, with German firms still being reluctant to invest. He believes though, that  there will ""certainly be more investment from Europe,"" despite Indonesia being ""not an easy market.""""But normally, it's about a relationship between risk and return in entrepreneurial decisions. And Indonesia offers the opportunity for relatively high returns due to just little competition in many sectors. In some sectors, 90% of the products are imported.""This article was originally published in German.",2023/2/7,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803013,China claims downed balloon as US recovers debris,"The quarrel between Washington and Beijing over the incursion of a Chinese balloon into United States airspace continued on Tuesday.The suspected surveillance balloon was shot down off the South Carolina coast on Saturday after a days-long journey across the US mainland.When asked on Tuesday whether Beijing had asked the US to return debris from the balloon, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it belonged to China.""What I can say is that this airship belongs to China and not the United States,"" the spokesperson, Mao Ning, told a regular news briefing. ""This balloon is not American. The Chinese government will continue to defend its legitimate rights and interests,"" she added.The US Coast Guard has imposed a temporary security zone in waters off South Carolina during the military's search for debris from the balloon.US President Joe Biden said the plan was always to shoot it down.""We made it clear to China what we're going to do,"" he said. ""They understand our position. We're not going to back off. We did the right thing, and it's not a question of weakening or strengthening - it's reality.""Beijing condemned the shooting down of the balloon as an ""obvious overreaction"" and urged Washington to show restraint.White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the balloon's flight over the United States had done nothing to improve already tense relations with China.He dismissed Beijing's contention it was for meteorological purposes.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a planned trip to Beijing over the weekend when news of the balloon became public.Kirby said Blinken would seek to reschedule his trip.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the US approach to relations with China would remain calm.""It's up to China to figure out what kind of relationship they want,"" she said.General Glen D. VanHerck, who oversees the US military's North American Aerospace Defense Command, said that at least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden's time as president, balloons have crossed American airspace.He added intelligence sources ""made us aware of those balloons"" after they had left US airspace.""""I will tell you that we did not detect those threats. And that's a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out."" VanHerck said.He said the downed balloon carried a payload that he would ""categorize... as a jet airliner type of size, maybe a regional jet.""He added debris from the balloon was spread on the waters over ""15 football fields by 15 football fields square.'' A US football field is 100 yards (91 m) long.US Senators would receive a classified briefing on the balloon situation on Tuesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office said.National security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the US was ""still piecing through'' which Chinese officials knew what about the balloon and would wait to speak publicly about China's intentions.China apologized to Costa Rica for a balloon that flew over its territory, the Central American country's government said late on Monday.According to Costa Rica's foreign ministry, China's Embassy in San Jose ""apologized for the incident"" while insisting the balloon was focused on scientific research, mainly weather studies.It wasn't immediately clear whether the aircraft was the same one that was spotted over Colombia on Friday.lo/es (AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/7,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803015,Scientists concerned spread of bird flu to mink signals growing threat to humans,"It started in October 2022, when several dead mink were discovered on a farm in Galicia in northwestern Spain. Veterinarians initially blamed the coronavirus. But tests revealed that the highly pathogenic avian flu virus H5N1 was the culprit.To stop the spread of the dangerous pathogen, more than 50,000 mink on the farm were killed.While farm workers themselves were not infected, the case remains a cause of concern for scientists.The spread of the virus from birds to other species is nothing new. The pathogen that causes bird flu, or avian influenza, has been found in raccoons, foxes and seals, though these remain isolated cases.While there have been some cases of H5N1 infecting humans, the World Health Organization has said there's no evidence of human-to-human transmission so far.When the disease has spread to humans and other mammals, it has been via direct contact with excrement from infected birds or their carcasses, according to Timm Harder, an avian influenza expert at the Friedrich Loeffler Institute's diagnostic virology department in Germany.But the mink outbreak appears to be a rare case where mammals are transmitting the disease to each other rather than through direct contact with an infected bird. This is something ""new,"" said Harder.Part of the problem is that mink are intensively farmed. They're kept in high numbers in confined spaces, which means infection spreads rapidly in the highly susceptible mammals, said Harder.Harder added that researchers have identified several pathogen mutations in the mink, one of which allows ""the virus to better reproduce in mammals.""Scientists are worried that the virus, which has led to the deaths of tens of millions of birds globally, could spread to more mink farms and become ""more transmissible.""""This is incredibly concerning,"" said Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London, in an interview with the scientific journal, Science. ""This is a clear mechanism for a H5 pandemic to start.""Of the 868 known cases of H5N1 infection in humans worldwide between January 2003 and November 2022, 457 were fatal, according to the WHO.However, because there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission, the risk of human infection from avian flu is low, said the WHO.Some highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have an increased potential to cause new zoonotic diseases — which are transmissible from animals to humans and vice versa.While Timm Harder said there are ""numerous hurdles for a more extensive adaptation to humans,"" he added the mutations seen in the virus that infected mink must be further studied and evaluated.Waterfowl have long played host to influenza viruses, but these early strains were low in pathogenicity, said Wolfgang Fiedler, an ornithologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior. The viruses weren't too contagious or damaging.But when these viruses that were harmless to wild birds spread to factory poultry farms — where thousands of animals were crammed tight — the disease spread rapidly and the virus could mutate, Fiedler explained.The result was the highly contagious virus strains H5N1 and H5N8, which likely originated on poultry farms in East Asia, according to the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds established by the UN.Farmed ducks likely become infected from wild birds. Ducks are ""kept together with pigs, for example,"" which aided the mutation process, noted Fiedler. Such animal husbandry methods ""make a virus like this insanely happy.""In fact, outbreaks of these highly pathogenic strains are typically associated with ""intensive domestic poultry production and associated trade and marketing systems ... via contaminated poultry, poultry products and inanimate objects,"" according to the UN's bird flu task force.The highly contagious H5N1 and H5N8 virus strains were in turn transmitted to wild birds via infected farmed birds, explained virologist Timm Harder. The viruses could then be transmitted over great distances during bird migrations.The ongoing avian flu outbreak is considered the largest observed in Europe to date, according to the European Food Safety Authority, an EU agency.Between October 2021 and September 2022, 50 million farm birds had to be culled in 37 countries.More than 3,800 highly pathogenic bird flu cases were counted in wild birds. Experts believe the number of unreported cases is probably much higher.Until recently, bird flu mainly occurred in fall and winter.""Now the virus is also circulating in wild birds during the summer months,"" confirmed Harder, noting that the animals breed closely in large colonies in the warmer months, providing ideal conditions for the spread of the virus.The avian influenza wave also reached South America for the first time in the fall. Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador and Colombia were among the countries affected. In Honduras, more than 240 dead pelicans were found in one week alone.Harder said he is concerned that the virus could spread from South America to Antarctica and endanger penguin populations. Apart from Antarctica, only Australia has escaped the virus.Despite the acute outbreak among birds, Harder sees one ray of hope in that the broad spread of the virus could promote immunity in wild birds. Antibodies have already been found in live animals.This article was adapted from German by Stuart Braun.",2023/2/7,,

To do this, they have begun supplying heavy offensive weapons (to Kyiv) and openly calling on Ukraine to seize our territories,"" Shoigu told a defense meeting.""Such steps draw NATO countries into the conflict and could see it escalate unpredictably,"" Shoigu added.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has repeatedly said the military alliance is not seeking a direct confrontation with Russia.During a visit to South Korea last week, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin was preparing for ""more war"" by acquiring weapons from countries, including North Korea.The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, said she was opposed to Russian athletes competing at the 2024 Olympic Games ""while Ukraine war continues.""Late last month, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) it was looking into ways to let athletes from Russia and Belarus compete in Paris next year despite international sanctions slapped over the invasion of Ukraine.The athletes could be free to compete under a neutral flag, the IOC said.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy however, said it would be tantamount to showing that ""terror is somehow acceptable.""Ukraine and several of its allies have threatened to boycott the Olympics if Russian and Belarusian athletes were allowed to take part.Russia's military has likely tried to resume significant offensive operations in Ukraine since early January of this year, with the intention of seizing Ukraine-held portions of Donetsk, a British Defence Intelligence update said on Tuesday.The assessment added that it was still doubtful that Russia would be able to amass the necessary troops in time to have a substantial impact on the outcome of the conflict.Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine's governor of the mainly Russian-occupied Luhansk province, said they are seeing more reserves and equipment being brought in.""They bring ammunition that is used differently than before — it is not round-the-clock shelling anymore. They are slowly starting to save, getting ready for a full-scale offensive,"" Haidai said.Meanwhile, Ukraine's spring offensive to recapture lost territories has been on hold awaiting the delivery of longer-range missiles and battle tanks from the West.lo,ss/es (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/7,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803017,"Ticket demand, anticipation grows as LeBron nears Kareem","Courtside seats 166 and 167 at the arena where the Los Angeles Lakers play their home games are pretty much as good as it gets. 

            The people occupying those chairs when LeBron James breaks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s NBA scoring record will have an up-close view, with their feet on the very hardwood where the history-making shot happens.

            History, in this case, comes with a cost.











            On Monday, those seats for Tuesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder could have been had for $75,000 — each. Total price for the two seats with Ticketmaster fees: $181,500. And there’s no guarantee James will even break the record Tuesday; in fact, at his current scoring pace, he would be just shy of the mark when the Thunder game ends.

            Which is why those same seats are even pricier Thursday for the Lakers’ next game against the Milwaukee Bucks — the two teams Abdul-Jabbar played for during his Hall of Fame career. For that game: $242,000, including the fees. But history suggests prices will come down; industry experts have long said extravagantly priced tickets rarely fetch the giant number listed.

            Don't be mistaken, though. The best seats will still cost plenty.

            “For the game on Thursday, we did sell a pair of tickets, courtside seats, for $24,000 a ticket, $48,000 total,” said Kyle Zorn, a brand manager at the online ticket marketplace TickPick. “I feel like people are betting on the storyline that he does it against Kareem’s former team, but he could easily score 36 points Tuesday and then the market for the game Thursday could completely crash.”

            Whenever the record falls — maybe Tuesday, maybe Thursday, and it’s doubtful the chase goes past that unless James isn’t playing for some reason — it will be an event.

            The NBA has already changed the national television schedule for Tuesday, rearranging things to get the Lakers-Thunder game into the second slot of the usual TNT doubleheader for that night — with Commissioner Adam Silver saying the league wanted to make sure it got as many eyeballs on the record-breaking moment as possible.

            The Lakers will be back on TNT against the Bucks on Thursday, plus have another national TV audience awaiting Saturday when they visit Golden State on ABC. Those were previously scheduled that way, no rearranging required.

            Silver said the NBA will pay tribute when James passes Abdul-Jabbar's total of 38,387 points, with likely a larger-scale celebration of the record at All-Star weekend in Salt Lake City later this month.

            “There’s no doubt we will stop that game and make sure we record for history, the ball, the basket, the uniform,” Silver said. “We’ll stop and make sure that we’ve done our jobs as the archivists of the NBA. At the same time, there’s that balance that they will be playing against a team that will very much want to win that night and not be distracted. Most likely we will do something in the moment.”

            Common sense will likely prevail there: If James gets the record with a minute to go in a close game, for example, the NBA probably won’t interrupt the proceedings with a lengthy stoppage. If it happens early, a brief halting of play wouldn’t be unprecedented.

            But for those who want to see it all happen in person, whether that’s from courtside seats or the upper levels of the arena, it’ll still cost a pretty penny.

            Speaking Monday, and with the market likely to fluctuate until game time, Zorn said the cheapest get-in-the-door price for Tuesday’s game was around $176 — about half what it was a week ago, with most people guessing the record falls against the Bucks — and $796 for Thursday’s game.

            “It’s weird how prices for the game on Tuesday have decreased so significantly, as if it’s like a guarantee that he’s breaking it on Thursday,” Zorn said.

            Many price points are likely out of reach for most fans. Then again, if there’s a Thunder fan in L.A. who really wants to see their team, they might just want to wait for March 24. The Thunder will be back that night.

            Cheapest ticket right now for that game — about $60.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803020,Japan shows tough new security moves during Philippines trip,"TOKYO (AP) — Growing worry over Chinese threats has led to a major Japanese boost in military spending, defense partnerships and aid packages, a concerted new effort to draw like-minded Asian nations into a stronger, unified front as Beijing seeks to establish regional dominance. 

            This security shift will be highlighted during a visit to Tokyo starting Wednesday of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines, a mutual U.S. ally that Japan has increasingly developed defense ties with in recent years. 

            Japan says the aggressive new policy is needed to confront China, but critics call it an attempt to use massive aid infusions to push Japanese security views on poorer countries. 











            Marcos' visit comes just days after he and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin agreed to allow U.S. troops access to four more bases in the Southeast Asian nation as they seek to deter China. 

            More U.S. troops stationed at Philippine military camps would allow Washington to keep in check China's territorial ambitions in the disputed South China Sea and against self-governing Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory that must be brought under its control, by force if necessary.

            
                Japan is looking to deepen cooperation with the Philippines and Washington, with a focus on a possible conflict over Taiwan. An existing partnership among Tokyo, Seoul and Washington primarily deals with North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats.

            During Marcos’ Tokyo visit, Japanese and Filipino defense officials expect to sign an agreement that would allow Japanese forces to provide more training and humanitarian and disaster assistance to the Philippines.

            ”This is a significant strategic reshuffling,” U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said last week, referring to U.S.-Japan-Philippine defense ties. It “would be a major contribution to the strategic alignment in the area from a deterrence standpoint.”

            Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government in December adopted key security and defense upgrades, including a counterstrike capability that breaks from the country’s self-defense-only postwar principle. Japan also plans to double its defense spending in five years.

            Under the new strategy, Japan will use its development assistance to support poorer nations as they strengthen their maritime safety and other security capabilities. It's meant to counter China’s growing regional influence.

            Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi calls it ""indispensable for Japan to not only fundamentally reinforce its own defense power but also to improve the deterrence capability of like-minded countries” and prevent one-sided changes to the status quo.

            For starters, the Foreign Ministry in April 2023 will get 2 billion yen ($15.2 million) to help strengthen national security of the “like-minded” countries. The money is primarily for Indo-Pacific militaries and separate from the 442 billion yen ($3.35 billion) in development money that the ministry says is not to fund weapons. 

            But Japan's development work is also seen as shifting focus on maritime and economic security and national interests.

            Kishida and Marcos are expected to issue a joint statement that includes Japan’s pledge to provide 600 billion yen ($4.5 billion) in development aid through 2024, most of it meant to speed up infrastructure, disaster prevention and information technology improvements.

            The assistance could include several Japanese patrol boats to help strengthen the Philippine coast guard against growing Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, according to Japanese and Philippine media.

            Japan has aggressively supported building up coast guards in Southeast Asia that are in conflict with China and has provided 12 patrol boats to the Philippines and nine to Vietnam. 

            The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have been locked in increasingly tense territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. The United States has been regarded as a crucial counterweight to China's militarization of island outposts and has pledged to come to the defense of the Philippines if its forces, ships or aircraft come under attack in the contested waters.

            The new Japanese Foreign Ministry budget is primarily for the militaries of developing nations in the Indo-Pacific region and is likely to be used to provide Japanese-made non-lethal equipment like radars, antennas, small patrol boats or infrastructure improvements, rather than advanced weapons. 

            Japan also wants to strengthen its feeble arms industry. The Defense Ministry has been virtually the only customer and export is limited to non-lethal weapons. The government wants to further ease restrictions on weapons and technology transfers.

            Military funding and traditional non-military development aid come from separate channels but are used like “wheels on both sides of a car,"" according to Masaki Inaba, co-chair of the Africa Japan Forum and an expert on foreign aid. 

            “Funding will be used to gain more friends, and based on how it would contribute to Japan’s own interests rather than development needs of the recipients,” Inaba said. 

            The shift could hurt the respect Japan has earned from the “global south” developing nations as a donor with pacifist principles, different from other advanced Western powers, when the country needs greater support from them, he said.

            Japan’s more security-focused aid policy could be also seen with wariness by China and the Koreas, experts say. 

            Japan, where arms sales were long restricted, has lagged behind in the Asian market, and the government hopes to cultivate customers by providing Japanese-made equipment, such as popular Mitsubishi radars. 

            Many Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, may be eager to balance their relationships with both Japan and China, while trying to get more from both, experts say, so Japan should be careful not to put them on the spot as they build ties. 

            Some in Japan have been critical. 

            “When defense equipment is directly provided to militaries of recipient countries, there will be a greater risk of inappropriate use than today. There is no guarantee that monitoring by the Foreign Ministry will function adequately,” the Weekly Toyo Keizai magazine said in a recent commentary.

            Associated Press writer Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.TOKYO (AP) — Growing worry over Chinese threats has led to a major Japanese boost in military spending, defense partnerships and aid packages, a concerted new effort to draw like-minded Asian nations into a stronger, unified front as Beijing seeks to establish regional dominance.This security shift will be highlighted during a visit to Tokyo starting Wednesday of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines, a mutual U.S. ally that Japan has increasingly developed defense ties with in recent years.Japan says the aggressive new policy is needed to confront China, but critics call it an attempt to use massive aid infusions to push Japanese security views on poorer countries.Marcos' visit comes just days after he and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin agreed to allow U.S. troops access to four more bases in the Southeast Asian nation as they seek to deter China.More U.S. troops stationed at Philippine military camps would allow Washington to keep in check China's territorial ambitions in the disputed South China Sea and against self-governing Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory that must be brought under its control, by force if necessary.Japan is looking to deepen cooperation with the Philippines and Washington, with a focus on a possible conflict over Taiwan. An existing partnership among Tokyo, Seoul and Washington primarily deals with North Korea’s missile and nuclear threats.During Marcos’ Tokyo visit, Japanese and Filipino defense officials expect to sign an agreement that would allow Japanese forces to provide more training and humanitarian and disaster assistance to the Philippines.”This is a significant strategic reshuffling,” U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said last week, referring to U.S.-Japan-Philippine defense ties. It “would be a major contribution to the strategic alignment in the area from a deterrence standpoint.”Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s government in December adopted key security and defense upgrades, including a counterstrike capability that breaks from the country’s self-defense-only postwar principle. Japan also plans to double its defense spending in five years.Under the new strategy, Japan will use its development assistance to support poorer nations as they strengthen their maritime safety and other security capabilities. It's meant to counter China’s growing regional influence.Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi calls it ""indispensable for Japan to not only fundamentally reinforce its own defense power but also to improve the deterrence capability of like-minded countries” and prevent one-sided changes to the status quo.For starters, the Foreign Ministry in April 2023 will get 2 billion yen ($15.2 million) to help strengthen national security of the “like-minded” countries. The money is primarily for Indo-Pacific militaries and separate from the 442 billion yen ($3.35 billion) in development money that the ministry says is not to fund weapons.But Japan's development work is also seen as shifting focus on maritime and economic security and national interests.Kishida and Marcos are expected to issue a joint statement that includes Japan’s pledge to provide 600 billion yen ($4.5 billion) in development aid through 2024, most of it meant to speed up infrastructure, disaster prevention and information technology improvements.The assistance could include several Japanese patrol boats to help strengthen the Philippine coast guard against growing Chinese naval activity in the South China Sea, according to Japanese and Philippine media.Japan has aggressively supported building up coast guards in Southeast Asia that are in conflict with China and has provided 12 patrol boats to the Philippines and nine to Vietnam.The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam, along with Taiwan, have been locked in increasingly tense territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea. The United States has been regarded as a crucial counterweight to China's militarization of island outposts and has pledged to come to the defense of the Philippines if its forces, ships or aircraft come under attack in the contested waters.The new Japanese Foreign Ministry budget is primarily for the militaries of developing nations in the Indo-Pacific region and is likely to be used to provide Japanese-made non-lethal equipment like radars, antennas, small patrol boats or infrastructure improvements, rather than advanced weapons.Japan also wants to strengthen its feeble arms industry. The Defense Ministry has been virtually the only customer and export is limited to non-lethal weapons. The government wants to further ease restrictions on weapons and technology transfers.Military funding and traditional non-military development aid come from separate channels but are used like “wheels on both sides of a car,"" according to Masaki Inaba, co-chair of the Africa Japan Forum and an expert on foreign aid.“Funding will be used to gain more friends, and based on how it would contribute to Japan’s own interests rather than development needs of the recipients,” Inaba said.The shift could hurt the respect Japan has earned from the “global south” developing nations as a donor with pacifist principles, different from other advanced Western powers, when the country needs greater support from them, he said.Japan’s more security-focused aid policy could be also seen with wariness by China and the Koreas, experts say.Japan, where arms sales were long restricted, has lagged behind in the Asian market, and the government hopes to cultivate customers by providing Japanese-made equipment, such as popular Mitsubishi radars.Many Southeast Asian nations, including the Philippines, may be eager to balance their relationships with both Japan and China, while trying to get more from both, experts say, so Japan should be careful not to put them on the spot as they build ties.Some in Japan have been critical.“When defense equipment is directly provided to militaries of recipient countries, there will be a greater risk of inappropriate use than today.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803035,Overnight rescue dig saves toddler trapped in Thai well,"BANGKOK (AP) — An overnight rescue operation successfully retrieved a 19-month-old girl from a dry artesian well shaft Tuesday — 18 hours after she fell into the hole at a cassava farm in northern Thailand.

            Rescuers clapped and cheered as the toddler, the daughter of migrant workers from Myanmar, was pulled out of the 15-meter (49-foot) -deep well shaft and placed on an a stretcher that carried her to a waiting ambulance.

            “Great job, guys. We did it!” exclaimed one rescuer as his colleagues in Tak province’s Phop Phra district wept and hugged each other.











            The child fell into the hole late Monday afternoon while her parents were working at the plantation.

            The deep pit, dug by the landowner to be an artesian well, had been left uncovered after it failed to strike groundwater, Phop Phra district chief Sanya Phetset told Thairath TV on Tuesday.

            The first rescuers to arrive at the scene shouted down the hole, and heard the child cry back, local media reported. A camera was then lowered into the hole to check the situation, and after that a tube was snaked into it to provide oxygen.

            Rescuers dug overnight alongside the pit, about 30 centimeters (12 inches) wide, using several backhoes and other excavation devices.

            “It seemed like an easy operation at first because it looked like loose dirt, but once we started digging we found rock, which made it difficult because excavators can’t dig through it,” Sanya said.

            He explained that the operation was delicate because the digging risked collapsing the sides of the well onto the child.

            The toddler was immediately sent to Phop Phra Hospital after being carried to safety.

            “She is safe now. She’s a bit tired but there’s nothing serious,” Sanya said.BANGKOK (AP) — An overnight rescue operation successfully retrieved a 19-month-old girl from a dry artesian well shaft Tuesday — 18 hours after she fell into the hole at a cassava farm in northern Thailand.Rescuers clapped and cheered as the toddler, the daughter of migrant workers from Myanmar, was pulled out of the 15-meter (49-foot) -deep well shaft and placed on an a stretcher that carried her to a waiting ambulance.“Great job, guys.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803036,Lebanese banks close doors to customers to protest ruling,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's battered commercial banks on Tuesday closed their doors to customers in protest of a recent court ruling that forced one of the country's largest banks to pay out two of its depositors their trapped savings in cash.

            The Association of Banks in Lebanon, which lobbies for the banks, released a statement calling the action an “open-ended strike"" and criticized the court ruling, claiming it was detrimental to all depositors, because the banks cannot afford to pay out everyone else’s savings in full.

            The demise of the banks is part of Lebanon's economic meltdown and unprecedented financial crisis that erupted in 2019 following years of corruption and mismanagement by the country's rulers. Over three quarters of Lebanon's population of 6 million has been plunged into poverty, and the Lebanese pound lost about 97% of its value against the dollar.











            In an effort to avoid folding amid the crisis, the banks imposed informal capital controls, restricting cash withdrawals from accounts. Also, people with accounts in dollars are allowed only to withdraw small sums in Lebanese pounds, at an exchange rate far lower than that of the black market or the exchange rate used for buying and selling most goods.

            This prompted some overseas depositors, locked out of their savings, to launch lawsuits to pressure banks to release their savings in full. In Lebanon, others opted to break into banks and forcefully take their own money, which led the banks to go on strike in September 2022 and close down amid security fears.

            Last week, Lebanon's Court of Cassation overturned the verdict in a 2022 case in favor of Fransabank, sued by two depositors demanding their money in cash. The ruling overturned the previous verdict, which allowed the bank to pay them with a check.

            Cashing that check however would enable the depositors to retrieve their funds at a significant loss. 

            It was the first legal decision of its kind since the crisis.

            The banks' association said Tuesday that “the crisis is not a crisis of one bank or even all the banks” but one that “affects the entire financial and banking system"", including Lebanon's central bank.

            It called on the government to implement reforms that the International Monetary Fund has made a condition for an economic recovery program — a capital controls law, lifting banking secrecy, and restructuring the country's commercial banks.

            
                The IMF has criticized Lebanon for its sluggish progress on the reforms since talks between the government and the IMF began in May 2020.

            At the same time, banks have refused attempts to make their shareholders assume responsibility for the crisis, and have insisted that the government and their own depositors share the biggest burden for the losses.BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's battered commercial banks on Tuesday closed their doors to customers in protest of a recent court ruling that forced one of the country's largest banks to pay out two of its depositors their trapped savings in cash.The Association of Banks in Lebanon, which lobbies for the banks, released a statement calling the action an “open-ended strike"" and criticized the court ruling, claiming it was detrimental to all depositors, because the banks cannot afford to pay out everyone else’s savings in full.The demise of the banks is part of Lebanon's economic meltdown and unprecedented financial crisis that erupted in 2019 following years of corruption and mismanagement by the country's rulers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803037,Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum hosts blockbuster Vermeer exhibition,"AMSTERDAM (AP) — Some art lovers make it a mission to visit and view as many works as possible by 17th-century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. 

            Starting Friday, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is making their lives a whole lot easier.

            A blockbuster exhibition at the Netherlands' national museum of art and history brings together 28 of Vermeer's paintings from seven countries around the world. Not bad considering only 37 paintings are generally ascribed to the artist who lived from 1632-1675 in the city of Delft.











            Never before have so many Vermeer works been put on show together in a single exhibition. Seven of the paintings haven't been in the Netherlands in more than two centuries.

            Rijksmuseum General Director Taco Dibbits believes the exhibition provides a chance for visitors to immerse themselves in the exquisite interior scenes for which Vermeer is best known including “Girl with a Pearl Earring” and “The Milkmaid,” but also early religious paintings and two cityscapes, both depicting his home town, Delft.

            Looking at the beguiling simplicity of “Mistress and Maid,” one of three paintings loaned for the show by New York’s The Frick Collection, Dibbits said it “radiates this tranquility, this ideal world.”

            Vermeer's use of light — often coming from a window situated on the left of the canvas — the bold colors and meticulous composition can be seen throughout the exhibition.

            “Vermeer has this quality of kind of everything is perfect. Everything falls in place,"" Dibbits said. ""There’s perfect happiness in his scenes. There’s tranquility, there’s intimacy.”

            Vermeer earned the nickname “The Sphinx of Delft” because so little was known about him — he left behind no letters or diaries and there are no known portraits of him. But recent research has begun to unravel the mysteries of the painter. Studies being carried out around the exhibition are further broadening knowledge about his work.

            “We’re really coming closer to Vermeer than we’ve ever been,” said Pieter Roelofs, the Rijksmuseum’s Head of Paintings and Sculpture. Recent research means that “we really understand more about his life, about his household, about his direct contacts, the people for whom he made these paintings, and what they mean,”

            In preparation for the exhibition, the museum has been taking an extremely close look at its own Vermeer paintings, which include iconic “The Milkmaid.” High-tech scans that peer through the surface of the work have revealed that Vermeer tweaked the background as he painted, apparently to ensure that the focus shone solely on the woman pouring milk. A jug holder – similar to a wall-mounted coat rack – that was originally in the background was painted over.

            Tracy Chevalier loved another of Vermeer's best-known works — “Girl with a Pearl Earring” — so much so that she wrote a novel about it that was in turn made into a film starring Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.

            Chevalier was at a preview of the exhibition on Monday taking in that painting and the other 27 on show in a suite of 10 galleries.

            “I think the curators really understood that for him, less is more. And I feel that way too; that you don’t need lots and lots of stuff. So this exhibition only has 28 paintings, but 28 is perfect because you have the space and the time to really take in each one.""

            “Girl with a Pearl Earring” only had to make a short trip from the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, and isn't sticking around until the end of the exhibition. She returns home after March 30.

            Other masterpieces have had a longer journey for the exhibition that has been some eight years in the making.

            ""Officer and Laughing Girl,"" “Mistress and Maid” and “Girl Interrupted at her Music” flew from the U.S. East Coast, leaving the Frick Collection while the New York museum undergoes restoration. That paved the way for more museums to loan paintings to the exhibition. More works come from The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Leiden Collection in New York. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, which, together with the Mauritshuis, staged the last major Vermeer retrospective in 1995-96, also sent paintings.

            In total, the 28 paintings come from 14 museums and private collections in seven countries.

            With such a comprehensive retrospective, the paintings that aren't in Amsterdam almost become almost as noteworthy as those that are. A few of the 17th-century works are so frail that they simply can't travel. One painting — “The Concert” — didn't make it to Amsterdam because it is among 13 artworks still missing after being stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990 in one of the world's most notorious art heists.

            The show in Amsterdam opens Friday and runs to June 4. It has already become the Rijksmuseum's most in-demand exhibition — Dibbits said the museum has so far sold nearly 200,000 tickets and has extended opening hours to accommodate more people.

            For art lovers who can't get to Amsterdam or snag a ticket, there is already a digital show available narrated by Stephen Fry.

            Online viewers can zoom in on minute details of ultra-high resolution photographs of some Vermeer paintings to see what makes his work stand out.

            “I think for Vermeer, light is color, and color is light ...,"" Roelofs said. ""And I think one of the things we will see is how how he really knows how to focus — and that makes him really exceptional.”AMSTERDAM (AP) — Some art lovers make it a mission to visit and view as many works as possible by 17th-century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer.Starting Friday, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam is making their lives a whole lot easier.A blockbuster exhibition at the Netherlands' national museum of art and history brings together 28 of Vermeer's paintings from seven countries around the world.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803060,Fired Marsch not given chance to see Leeds overhaul through,"Jesse Marsch must have thought he had more time at Leeds.

            After all, he had just been allowed to bring in a close friend and fellow American, Chris Armas, to work alongside him in the coaching staff.

            He had also just overseen an outlay of around $45 million in the January transfer window on two players — Maximilian Wöber and Georginio Rutter — as well as the loan signing of another U.S. international, Weston McKennie, to complement an increasingly American midfield.











            A structure of sorts was in place. Leeds, it appeared, was doubling down on an under-pressure manager who had heard the calls from frustrated fans for his dismissal and was determined to turn things around.

            On Monday, Marsch was gone.

            Effectively, he departs with Leeds in pretty much the same position as it was when he arrived: Battling against relegation heading into the final part of the season. 

            Having given Marsch almost a year to stamp his authority, the people in charge — majority owner Andrea Radrizzani and 49ers Enterprises, the investment arm of San Francisco 49ers in the NFL — seem to have decided nothing had really changed under the American.

            Like under his predecessor, the popular Marcelo Bielsa, Leeds remained too easy to play through and score against, even if the team conceded fewer under Marsch.

            Marsch's problem — and he knew it — was Leeds' inability to turn promising build-up play into goals. Indeed, what proved to be Marsch's final two league games in charge saw Leeds fail to score despite dominating a 0-0 home draw with Brentford on Jan. 22 and then squander a slew of first-half chances in a 1-0 loss at Nottingham Forest on Sunday.

            “We are struggling to turn performances into results,"" Marsch said after the Forest game. “We have been in this place for a while.”

            In the second half of the Forest game, the “Marsch out” chants returned in the away end and might have persuaded the ownership to act.

            Marsch wasn't helped by the fact that he inherited a squad of players so entrenched in Bielsa's unique way of playing — intense pressing, hard-running, man-to-man marking — after 3 1/2 years under the Argentine. Maybe it was harsh to give him just a year to implement his own philosophy, even if it didn't veer too much from Bielsa's, but the specter of relegation can spook people at the top of a club.

            Leeds is out of the bottom three only on goal difference and without a win in its past seven league games.

            Also working against Marsch was his main striker, Patrick Bamford, being out injured for much of the past year and the reorganization required following the offseason departures of star midfielders Raphinha and Kalvin Phillips to Barcelona and Manchester City, respectively.

            Marsch was the third American to coach a team in the Premier League after Bob Bradley, who lasted less than three months at Swansea in 2016, and David Wagner, who kept Huddersfield up in its first season back in the top-flight but was fired halfway through the next season (January 2019).

            Marsch will leave with the memory of some high-profile wins — the 2-1 against Liverpool at Anfield in October stands out, as does the 3-0 home mauling of Chelsea in August — and keeping Leeds in the Premier League after a 2-1 victory at Brentford on the final day of last season.

            “We have to build the roster and build the club in the right way,” Marsch said minutes after preserving the team's top-flight status. “We have to continue to rely on the mentality of the club and the players but develop more and more, football-wise.”

            He left without getting the chance to do that.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803061,Nigerian politician in UK court over organ-harvesting claims,"LONDON (AP) — A senior Nigerian politician was on trial in London on Tuesday for allegedly exploiting a street trader by transporting him to the U.K. to donate a kidney in exchange for thousands of pounds.

            Ike Ekweremadu, who was deputy president of the Nigerian Senate and a lawyer, was on trial along with his wife, Beatrice Ekweremadu, and their 25-year-old daughter Sonia at London's Central Criminal Court. They deny conspiring to arrange or facilitate the travel of the young man with a view to exploitation between August 2021 and May 2022.

            Prosecutors allege Ekweremadu and his family recruited a 21-year-old man at a Lagos street market to be a kidney donor for Sonia Ekweremadu in a private transplant operation at a London hospital. 











            Opening the trial on Monday, prosecutor Hugh Davies said Ike Ekweremadu and his wife were powerful figures in Nigerian society.

            He said the 21-year-old man believed he was being taken to London for work, and that under the agreement the man would be paid thousands of pounds.

            Kidney donations are lawful in the U.K. but it is a criminal offense to reward someone for doing so. 

            The donor was transported to London in February 2022, Davies said, adding that as part of the ruse the man was purported to be Sonia's cousin. 

            “The prosecution contends that (the donor) was subject to a high degree of control throughout and was dependent on what he was told for his understanding,” Davies told jurors.

            The organ transplant didn't go ahead and Sonia Ekweremadu remains on dialysis treatment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803073,Millennial Money: Should unmarried couples have one account?,"When a couple joins financial forces, it’s typically so they can accomplish a joint savings goal or contribute to shared expenses, such as those that come from living together.

            This is a typical step for married couples, but more unmarried couples are taking the plunge to combine households: The number of unmarried partners that live together nearly tripled between 1996 and 2017 from 6 million to 17 million, according to the most recent figures available from the U.S. Census. From living together to sharing other financial goals, unmarried couples may have questions about how they can manage their money together.

            One way to streamline shared expenses is to open a joint bank account, which can simplify the way you pay for things together. If you’re considering opening a joint bank account with your partner, you’ll want to think about the pros and cons of that option.











            BENEFITS OF USING A JOINT ACCOUNT

            Joint accounts can be useful for managing regular expenses as well as longer-term financial goals. Perhaps you and your partner want to make it easier to pay your rent and utility bills from one pot, or maybe you want to save for a vacation, wedding or house together. A joint account can be a useful place to start, as long as you lay ground rules together for how much you each plan to contribute, how you’re going to use the funds in the account and what you’ll do if your relationship ends.

            Taylor Kovar, a certified financial planner and CEO of TheMoneyCouple.com, says unmarried couples should be very careful about opening a joint account. There aren’t as many legal protections as there are for married couples, who have inherent legal co-ownership of assets that the couple acquired after they got married. He says that there’s safety in keeping your own accounts and then opening a separate joint account that you and your partner both contribute to.

            “There needs to be very transparent tracking for the account,” Kovar says. “Both people should be able to access the account at all times. You should both agree on what the account can and can’t be used for, so that way if an argument occurs, then you’ll both be clear on what went wrong.” 

            DRAWBACKS OF USING A JOINT ACCOUNT

            The primary drawback of a joint account is dealing with the dreaded question: What are we going to do with this account if we break up?

            Parting ways is hard enough, but when there are shared assets involved, it can be even harder. The simplest way to handle a joint account post-breakup, Kovar says, is simply to split the funds in half. But if one partner contributed more than the other — perhaps because that partner has a higher salary — then it may be a good idea to split it equitably based on the percentage that each partner contributed to the account.

            April Lee, the financial blogger behind HassleFreeSavings.com, is grateful that she and her former long-term partner never commingled their finances, especially when it came to the house that she purchased but that they both lived in. He consulted a lawyer to try to sue for ownership after they broke up, but in the end, he couldn’t prove that he had contributed financially toward the house.

            “He couldn’t show that one penny had gone toward joint assets,” Lee says. “Not having any joint finances saved my bacon.”

            SETTING UP A JOINT ACCOUNT

            If you decide to open a joint account with your partner, you’ll need to research accounts that can be co-owned. Once you’ve decided, check with the bank to see what documents and identification both of you will need to become joint owners of the new account.

            You also might want to ask your bank if there’s a way to set a withdrawal limit on the account, where if one person wants to withdraw beyond the set limit, the other partner has to approve it too.

            Once the joint account is set up, it can be used for whatever you and your partner have agreed on. Perhaps you’ll use the account for online bill pay to cover your shared costs, such as internet, streaming services or rent. Or maybe you’ve outlined how much you’ll each contribute toward a beach trip in Hawaii, and you’ll deposit funds into the account until you’re ready to book flights and a hotel.

            The decision of whether to open a joint account with your partner is deeply personal. If you choose not to, you have other options, such as giving money to each other to pay for joint expenses. This setup takes some extra steps but can help you keep your funds separate and protected. But if you’re ready for a joint bank account, the most important task is to make sure you and your partner are on the same page.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803075,Hundreds attend funeral of Pakistan's ex-President Musharraf,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf was buried Tuesday in his family's hometown, the southern port city of Karachi, a day after a special plane transported his body from the United Arab Emirates where he died on the weekend.

            About 2,500 mourners — including Musharraf's family and relatives, senior politicians and retired and serving military officials — attended the funeral at a military cemetery inside a high-security area in Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province. 

            Musharraf, who died at age 79, seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 by ousting the elected government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, whose younger brother Shahbaz Sharif is now the country's prime minister. 











            Amir Muqam, a senior leader from Sharif's party, attended the funeral. Musharraf's coffin was draped in the national flag in a sign of respect, though the ceremony was not a state funeral. 

            Gen. Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and former army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, also attended. 

            “Gen. Pervez Musharraf always put the interests of Pakistan first, and he even put his life at risk by waging a war against militancy,"" Moinuddin Haider, a retired army general, told reporters.

            Several politicians and government officials also paid glowing tributes to Musharraf. 

            During his tenure as president, Musharraf made Pakistan a key ally of Washington in the war on terror after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. That angered Pakistani and foreign militants who at least twice tried to assassinate him in the city of Rawalpindi in 2003, but he escaped unhurt.

            Musharraf lost his grip on power in 2008 when the party of former president Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistan People's Party, defeated his longtime political allies in parliamentary elections. Zardari later forced him to resign. The new government instigated a treason case against Musharraf — but allowed him to leave the country on bail to travel to Dubai in the UAE in 2016 for medical treatment while the proceedings were underway. 

            Musharraf remained in Dubai after being sentenced to death for treason at home in 2019, although the death penalty was later overturned by another court.

            However, Prime Minister Sharif's government last year said Musharraf would not be arrested if his family wanted to bring him back home. But Musharraf’s doctors and his family said adequate medical treatment for him was unavailable in Pakistan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803076,Nordic sports bodies urge IOC to ban Russian athletes,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — The five Olympic committees in the Nordic region on Tuesday urged the International Olympic Committee to ban Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials from “international sports participation” because of the war in Ukraine.

            The bodies from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway said they wanted to expressed their “steadfast support once again with the Ukrainian people and the demand for peace.”

            “We stand firm in our position,"" they said in a statement. “Now is not the right time to consider their return.”











            Last week, the three Baltic prime ministers called for a ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes and said an Olympic boycott was a possibility.

            They spoke a few days after the Latvian Olympic Committee threatened to boycott the Paris Games if Russian athletes are allowed and called on other countries to form a coalition to pressure international sports bodies. It was the first national Olympic body other than Ukraine to threaten to boycott rather than compete against Russians.

            Other national Olympic sports bodies, including the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, back the IOC’s efforts to find a path for Russians to compete.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803131,Germany appoints central bank IT chief to head cybersecurity,"BERLIN (AP) — The German government announced the appointment Tuesday of the European Central Bank's head of IT systems to lead the national cybersecurity agency, months after her predecessor was removed following reports of possible problematic ties to Russia.

            Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Claudia Plattner “brings the experience and expertise with her that we need for cybersecurity in these particularly challenging times.” She will take charge of the BSI agency on July 1, becoming the first woman in the role. 

            Faeser dismissed the BSI's previous head, Arne Schoenbohm, in October. He had been in charge of the agency since 2016.











            Schoenbohm co-founded a cybersecurity group a decade ago that brought together experts from public institutions and the private sector. German media reported that one of its members was a company founded by a former Russian intelligence agent. The group said last week that it had thrown out the company. 

            The Interior Ministry said in the fall that the allegations “damaged the necessary confidence of the public in the neutrality and impartiality” of Schoenbohm's management.

            Schoenbohm defended himself against the allegations. He has since taken up a new job as the head of another body overseen by the Interior Ministry, the Federal Academy of Public Administration.

            Plattner worked for German railway operator Deutsche Bahn's IT provider, DB Systel, before joining the ECB in July 2021. The Frankfurt-based central bank said it would announce a successor “in due course.”BERLIN (AP) — The German government announced the appointment Tuesday of the European Central Bank's head of IT systems to lead the national cybersecurity agency, months after her predecessor was removed following reports of possible problematic ties to Russia.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Claudia Plattner “brings the experience and expertise with her that we need for cybersecurity in these particularly challenging times.” She will take charge of the BSI agency on July 1, becoming the first woman in the role.Faeser dismissed the BSI's previous head, Arne Schoenbohm, in October.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803134,Ancelotti: Attacks on Vinícius a problem of Spanish soccer,"MADRID (AP) — The hate attacks against Vinícius Júnior are a problem of Spanish soccer and must be dealt with, his Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Tuesday.

            Vinícius, a Brazilian forward who is Black, has been subjected to hate attacks since he arrived in Spain in 2018. The most recent were on Sunday at a Spanish league game in Mallorca. Last month, his effigy hung off a bridge in Madrid before the derby against Atletico Madrid.

            “The question I ask is this: What does Vinicius have to defend himself against? What do his teammates have to defend themselves against?” Ancelotti said on Tuesday on the eve of Madrid’s debut at the Club World Cup in Morocco.











            “Is Vinícius the problem? It seems like the problem is Vinícius, but the problem is what happens around him. Period. 

            ""It is a problem of Spanish football. I am a part of Spanish football and I think it’s a problem that we have to solve. Because it seems that Vinicius is the culprit, but he is being the victim of something that I don’t understand.”

            Vinícius has been outspoken about the insults and often complained on social media of how he's been treated.

            He was also targeted because of his dances while celebrating goals, and recently his teammates called attention to the high number of fouls he was receiving in games. Last week, Valencia defender Gabriel Paulista was sent off after a vicious foul on Vinícius in a league game.

            “Vinícius is an incredible person, with great values,” teammate Federico Valverde said. ""He is different than most on the field, he enjoys soccer in his own way, in a happy way. I don’t think the rival fans are thinking about the person, they don’t realize that he could be the son of anyone who is in the stands. People need to be responsible for what they do, they shouldn’t take it out on a 22-year-old. You need to have respect.”

            Racism in Spanish soccer has attracted more attention recently but little has been done to punish anyone.

            The Spanish league investigated the attacks on Sunday at Mallorca after TV images showed someone calling him a monkey. Vinícius was also insulted after the match when he stopped to pose for photos and sign autographs for fans.

            The league said Tuesday it filed a complaint with the courts in Mallorca. It had filed similar legal complaints in cases involving racist insults against Vinícius five other times, with three of them being archived and two still being analyzed.

            Authorities have yet to find those responsible for hanging Vinícius’ effigy last month, and so far teams have not been punished for the racist insults inside their stadiums.

            The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.

            Mallorca defender Antonio Raíllo said last year that Vinícius was using the card of racism when accused of provoking opponents. Other players have complained of the Brazilian's attitude on the field as well.

            Madrid will face Egyptian club Al Ahly on Wednesday in the semifinals of the Club World Cup. Madrid has won the world club title a record seven times, including three times when the competition was called the Intercontinental Cup.

Madrid has won the world club title a record seven times, including three times when the competition was called the Intercontinental Cup.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803135,"UK leader Sunak shakes up govt to focus on business, energy","LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak shook up his government on Tuesday, moving ministers and merging departments in a bid to assert control amid ethics scandals and sniping from Conservative Party colleagues.

            Sunak appointed lawmaker Greg Hands to chair the governing party, which is demoralized by dismal opinion poll ratings and a year of turmoil. Sunak is Britain's third Conservative prime minister in less than a year.

            Hands, a former trade minister who has served in Parliament since 2005, replaces Nadhim Zahawi, who was fired by Sunak last month after failing to come clean about a multimillion-dollar tax dispute.











            As deputy party chair, Sunak installed Lee Anderson, an ex-coal miner turned combative legislator from the right wing of the Conservative Party who once said people use food banks because “they cannot cook properly” or make a budget.

            Sunak has vowed to restore order and integrity to government after three years of instability under predecessors Boris Johnson — brought down in summer 2022 by ethics scandals — and Liz Truss, who quit in October after six weeks in office when her tax-cutting economic plans sparked mayhem on the financial markets.

            But he faces opposition allegations that the government remains mired in scandal and sleaze. Ethics inquiries are also underway over claims Johnson secured a loan with the help of a Conservative donor who was later appointed chairman of the BBC, and into allegations that Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab bullied staff. Raab denies bullying.

            Sunak also rearranged the ministries responsible for business, energy, science and trade as part of his aim to boost the country’s sluggish economy and make the U.K. a science and technology superpower.

            Kemi Badenoch, formerly in charge of international trade, heads a new Department for Business and Trade. Former Business Secretary Grant Shapps becomes Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero.

            The government said the new energy department “has been tasked with securing our long-term energy supply, bringing down bills and halving inflation” after the cost-of-living crsis unleashed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            “I think we’ve seen over the last year in particular the impact that happens to people’s bills at home when energy policy doesn’t work properly, when we’re reliant on imported energy from hostile countries,” Sunak told reporters.

            “That’s why the creation today of a new department focused specifically on energy security and net zero is so important.”

            Opposition parties questioned the expense involved in setting up new ministries, citing an Institute for Government estimate of 15 million pounds ($18 million) per department in direct costs.

            Environmentalists expressed skepticism that the restoration of a department solely in charge of energy — abolished by a previous Conservative government in 2016 — would help Britain reduce its carbon emissions.

            “As climate disasters intensify, energy costs spiral and the world continues to sink under rising seas, without other fundamental reforms, re-establishing a department for energy will be as helpful as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic,” Doug Parr of Greenpeace U.K. said.

            In other moves, Lucy Frazer was appointed to secretary of state at the Department for Culture Media and Sport – formerly Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its digital responsibilities moved to the new Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, headed by Michelle Donelan. ___

            Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick, 48, admitted last month he was a serial rapist in what prosecutors described as one of the most shocking cases involving a serving police officer.

            Carrick, who joined the force in 2001, pleaded guilty to 49 offenses including 24 counts of rape and charges including assault, attempted rape and false imprisonment. His crimes took place between 2003 and 2020.











            During Tuesday's sentencing hearing, Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said the former officer “took monstrous advantage of women” behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness.

            “You brazenly raped and sexually assaulted a number of women, some very brutally, and you behaved as if you were untouchable. You were bold and at times relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you,"" the judge told Carrick.

            “For nearly two decades you were proved right but now a combination of those 12 women, by coming forward, and your police colleagues, by acting on their evidence, have exposed you and brought you low,"" she added.

            The judge said Carrick had attempted to kill himself while on remand in a London high-security prison.

            The Metropolitan Police has apologized to victims after it emerged that nine allegations of rape and other crimes were made against Carrick between 2000 and 2021. He was only suspended from the force after his arrest for a rape complaint in 2021.

            The case was the latest in a string of scandals to undermine public trust in the Metropolitan Police, the largest police force in Britain. Authorities have put heavy pressure on the police to reform its culture and standards after a series of allegations of misogyny and racism within its ranks.

            Home Secretary Suella Braverman, the top government official responsible for policing, said Tuesday that Carrick’s crimes were “a scar on our police.” An inquiry is ongoing into his behavior and decision-making processes around his vetting, she said.LONDON (AP) — A former London police officer was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison with a minimum term of 30 years for raping and sexually assaulting a dozen women over a 17-year period.Metropolitan Police officer David Carrick, 48, admitted last month he was a serial rapist in what prosecutors described as one of the most shocking cases involving a serving police officer.Carrick, who joined the force in 2001, pleaded guilty to 49 offenses including 24 counts of rape and charges including assault, attempted rape and false imprisonment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803149,Florida mass shooting suspect killed during police pursuit,"WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (AP) — A man suspected in a mass shooting in central Florida last month was fatally shot by a police officer following a long chase and a carjacking, authorities said.

            The car driven by Alex Greene, 21, eventually crashed into a business in Winter Haven. That's a short distance from Lakeland, where 11 people were injured in the Jan. 30 shooting, Lakeland Police Chief Sammy Taylor said.

            “We are very confident he was in fact involved; to what extent we don’t know yet,” Taylor said. 











            Taylor said detectives had hoped to bring Greene in on an outstanding burglary warrant to talk to him about the shooting on Jan. 30 in a neighborhood near downtown Lakeland, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Tampa.

            As investigators from the Lakeland Police Department, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted surveillance, Greene got into a pickup truck and started to drive away, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said during a news conference.

            Lakeland police went in pursuit along a heavily traveled road. 

            Police Capt. Eric Harper was driving an unmarked vehicle and tried to stop Greene “so that we don’t have this pursuit on a very busy road,"" Judd said.

            He did a successful pit maneuver, and Greene got out of the vehicle and started running into traffic.

            “Why he and the captain weren’t run over is just the grace of God, because traffic was all over the place,"" Judd said.

            When Greene realized he couldn't get away, he ran toward a restaurant where a woman was standing outside her car with the doors open, Judd said. The woman saw Greene, slammed the passenger door and tried to shut the driver's side door. 

            Greene pushed the woman away and got into the car, Judd said. Harper approached with his gun drawn, yelling commands for Greene to stop and show his hands, police said in a news release Tuesday. 

            “Captain Harper was also loudly identifying himself as a police officer,"" according to the release.

            “The suspect takes off in her car, drives toward Capt. Harper, who shoots six times,"" Judd said. The car continues down a road, weaves through flower beds and crashes into a building.""

            Law enforcement officials pulled Greene from the car and started performing CPR. He was taken to a hospital, where he was declared dead.

            “No one else was injured in the pursuit, which we are all grateful for,” Judd said.

            Greene had 10 previous felony charges dating back to 2013, including fleeing to elude law enforcement, battery on a law enforcement officer, possession of weapons and resisting arrest, Judd said. He had an outstanding warrant for burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary.

            During a search of the vehicle Greene was driving when he initially fled from officers, investigators found 28 grams (1 ounce) of cocaine, marijuana, a Glock .357 handgun and $2,813 in cash, according to a news release sent Tuesday. Greene was carrying another $5,833 in cash.

            An investigation into the shooting is being handled by the region's Deadly Incident Task Force. 

            Two people were critically injured in the Jan. 30 shooting, while the wounds of the other eight victims weren’t considered life-threatening. The victims were men ages 20 to 35, police said. 

            A vehicle drove through the neighborhood that afternoon, and suspects opened fire from all four car windows, police said. Officials did not provide details about any other suspects in the shooting.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803150,How Candid hopes diversity data will help aid racial equity,"Candid, the major philanthropy research group, is leading a coalition of funders and grantees that want to standardize the collection of demographic information to help enable donations to minority-led groups.

            Harnessing such data could help advance racial equity, said Candid's CEO, Ann Mei Chang, who is launching a nonprofit initiative to amass more such information.

            The initiative — dubbed Demographics via Candid, or DvC — hopes to create a straightforward survey that is as widely accessible as a philanthropy's 990 form for the Internal Revenue Service. If it succeeds, nonprofits would no longer have to provide specialized diversity information for each of its donors. And it would be easier for the philanthropic sector to measure how much money is going to minority-led groups.











            “Everybody talks about equity,” Chang said. “But if you don’t have any idea where you stand, you can’t track your progress.”

            Corporations and foundations pledged billions for racial equity after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020. But statistics show that philanthropic money flows unequally to white-led and minority-led organizations.

            A 2022 survey by the Nonprofit Finance Fund found that white-led nonprofits were more likely than minority-led groups to receive corporate donations. The donations to white-led nonprofits were also nearly twice as likely to be unrestricted gifts, allowing them to use the grants however they see fit rather than for specific programs.

            Last month, several major philanthropists — including Melinda Gates’ Pivotal Ventures, Rihanna’s Clara Lionel Foundation and the Ford and MacArthur foundations— issued an open letter seeking more donations for the Black Feminist Fund to correct the underfunding of groups that serve Black women and girls. The fund estimates that only about 0.5% of philanthropic donations go to those groups, even though Black women and girls make up about 7% of the American population.

            “Organizations that reflect their communities are far more likely to be successful,” Chang said. “They understand those communities in a way that outsiders can’t.”

            Candid's initiative has so far attracted 36 partners, from local donors like the Lehigh Valley Community Foundation to giants like the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.

            PEAK Grantmaking, a nonprofit that's dedicated to equitable donation practices, was eager to join the initiative, said Satonya Fair, its CEO. PEAK is promoting the survey to its network of 6,000 members and 500 organizations.

            “We’re excited to just be an amplifier for what makes sense and to change things that don’t,” Fair said. “Nonprofits already have a lot of work. Don’t make your process be the thing, instead of the core of their mission.”

            Kelly Brown, CEO of Viewpoint Consulting, which works with philanthropies, said she believes the initiative will fill an important need.

            “The data collection system in the social sector is super, super-fragmented,” said Brown, who is working on the initiative with Candid. “That makes it extremely difficult not only to engage with the data but also to learn from it and to understand it.”

            The initiative will ask donors to determine grants based on data collected on the standardized survey, even if it doesn't contain all the details the initiative would like. It will try to convince grantees, especially at small nonprofits, that filling out the survey is worth the time and effort.

            Starting next month, the Kalamazoo Community Foundation, another early partner in the DvC initiative, will require its grantees to fill out the standardized demographic survey and make it publicly available to receive funding, said Allie VanHeest, the foundation’s community investment officer.

            The Michigan-based foundation has been working with its 100-plus grantees since last year to prepare for the transition, offering workshops and support services to help collect the information. 

            “We are really prioritizing racial equity,” VanHeest said. “We hope for and dream of a future where race is not a predictor for quality of life and life outcomes. And we believe that racial equity can be advanced.”

            But to measure the foundation’s success as it works toward its goals, it will need deeper demographic information about the organizations it supports, VanHeest said, which is why it jumped at the chance to join Candid’s initiative.

            “We’re going to work towards it together,” she said.

            She added that in this initial year, her foundation would not immediately disqualify a grantee that had not collected the necessary demographic information.

            “We’re still in the learning process with this partnership with Candid,"" she said, ""and we recognize that our partners are as well.”

            Candid is inviting nonprofits to “ join the movement ” at a webinar set for Feb. 14, with hopes of persuading enough donors and grantees to use this survey to bring it widespread acceptance, Chang said. She said she hopes that government agencies will also adopt it as part of their grant applications. She plans to approach them after the initial phase is complete.

            “I think you can build momentum for this,” she said. “Our hope is really to work towards a common grant application and common grant reporting to reduce the burden on nonprofits so that they spend more of their precious resources on the important work that they’re doing.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803170,"Residents worry about going home, toxic gas from derailment","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Brittany Dailey stood outside her hotel watching black smoke darken the sky 10 miles to the west as crews burned toxic chemicals from tanker cars that derailed just down the street from her home.

            The faint smell of chlorine hung in the air Monday night while she wondered even if she'd want to return home — not knowing whether it’d be safe for her 8-year-old son and their Saint Bernard.

            “I'm scared to go back home,” she said the next day. “I’m eventually going to have to go back, but it makes me want to sell my house and move at this point.”











            Air monitoring so far had not detected dangerous levels of fumes in the Ohio and Pennsylvania communities near the derailment site, but residents living close to the wreckage still weren’t being allowed back, authorities said Tuesday.

            While the fire from the controlled release of the chemicals was no longer burning, authorities said they want to ensure the air is safe before lifting the evacuation order issued by the governors in Ohio and Pennsylvania who warned that the fumes could cause death or serious injury to those nearby. 

            “I want nothing more than to get my residents back home,” said East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabik. “Safety is paramount.” 

            James Justice of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said a network of air station monitors inside and outside the evacuation zone was collecting samples and that none of their readings found anything to be concerned about. “We want to make sure that’s not going to change,” he said.

            Authorities were still developing a plan that would allow them to know when residents could go home, he said. 

            National Guard members wearing protective gear would be deployed to take readings inside homes, basements and businesses, said Major General John Harris Jr.

            But all of that did little to reassure residents who were forced to leave after about 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash Friday night on the edge of East Palestine. 

            “I don’t think everything’s fine. They’ve been saying everything’s fine the whole time,"" said Dailey, who also runs a daycare inside the evacuated area of the village.

            Once she's allowed back, she plans on buying air purifiers and deep cleaning the rugs and curtains inside her home and business. “In my heart, I cannot allow kids to come back in that center before I can clean,” she said. 

            So far, no injuries have been reported from the derailment or the controlled release but some people have complained about smelling chlorine and smoke in the air and having headaches.

            Most, if not all, residents in the danger zone left well before officials decided on Monday that the safest way to prevent a more dangerous explosion would be to release and burn the the vinyl chloride inside five of the derailed tanker cars. 

            But officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I. 

            Seanna Shipley, who lives in the evacuation zone and fled to a hotel Sunday night with her boyfriend, their two dogs and a few clothes, said she hopes her home is tested before she returns.

            “Honestly, I don’t even know what to do about the air inside,” she said. “I'm definitely nervous about going back, but I have to. Once they say it's safe to go home, they’ll stop reimbursing people, so I'll have to go home.” 

            Those just outside the evacuation zone in East Palestine and in neighboring Beaver County, Pennsylvania, were urged to stay indoors as a precaution. Officials in neighboring counties said air samples did not show any worrisome levels of contaminates. 

            The site of the derailment is very close to the state line, and the evacuation area extended into a sparsely populated area of Pennsylvania. About half of the 4,800 residents of East Palestine had been warned to leave over the weekend before officials decided Monday to use the controlled release. 

            Forced evacuations began Sunday night after authorities became alarmed the rail cars could explode after a “drastic temperature change” was observed in one car.

            Federal investigators say a mechanical issue with a rail car axle caused the derailment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803171,How to watch President Biden's State of the Union address,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is set to deliver his second State of the Union address on Tuesday night. 

            The annual speech, delivered before a joint session of Congress, typically provides a president with his single largest audience of the year, usually in the tens of millions. An estimated 38.2 million TV viewers watched Biden’s first State of the Union address in 2022, according to Nielsen ratings.

            A key difference between this year's speech and last year's is that Biden now faces a divided Congress for the final two years of his term. Republicans took back control of the House from Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections, while Democrats continue to hold the Senate. 











            Here’s what you need to know about watching Biden's State of the Union address, scheduled for 9 p.m. EST.

            WHERE DO I WATCH OR LISTEN?

            Biden's speech will be broadcast by the major television networks and cable news TV channels. The Associated Press will livestream the speech at APNews.com. 

            The White House plans to stream the speech on its website, www.whitehouse.gov/live and make it available on its YouTube, Facebook and Twitter pages. 

            Live coverage will also be provided by C-SPAN, C-SPAN Radio and C-SPAN.org.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803172,Belgian police detain 25 in Chinese sex trafficking probe,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgian police detained 25 people Tuesday as part of a human trafficking probe targeting an alleged criminal organization suspected of sending Chinese women to Europe and forcing them into prostitution, the federal prosecutor's office said.

            Police raided 26 places across Belgium, discovering 20 alleged victims, and one suspect was detained in Spain, the office said, with raids also taking place in the Spanish cities of Alicante and Barcelona. 

            All the alleged victims are of Chinese origin, and three suspects are of Belgian nationality, with the others of Chinese origin. 











            According to prosecutors, Chinese sex workers are increasingly present in Belgium, particularly in Brussels.

            They said the criminal organization allegedly recruited women in China and transferred them to Europe where they were “sexually exploited"" and forced to surrender most of their earnings. 

            The alleged prostitution ring used online rental platforms, hotels or vacation homes and appointments could be made via websites specializing in sex advertisements, prosecutors said, adding that the victims were often moved from one place to another across the continent.

            “A significant proportion of the victims no longer had legal residence status, which increased their dependence on the criminal organization,"" the office said. “The criminal organization acquired large sums of money, which were transferred abroad through legal and illegal channels.""

            Some of the victims discovered Tuesday have been sheltered in a specialized reception center, prosecutors said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803174,"Myanmar, Russia sign pact on developing nuclear power","BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s military-led government, working with Russia’s state atomic energy company, has inaugurated a nuclear power information center as a step toward developing atomic power to fill energy shortages in the strife-torn Southeast Asian nation.

            Myanmar state media reported Tuesday that the head of the military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, met with Alexey Evgenievich Likhachev, director general of the Russian State Atomic Energy Corp., or Rosatom.

            Officials from the two sides met at the newly opened Nuclear Technology Information Center in Myanmar’s largest city, Yangon, on Monday, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said.











            Myanmar hopes to build and operate a reactor under a preliminary agreement between Myanmar and Rosatom that was signed in 2015, the newspaper said. The two sides signed memorandums of understanding in Moscow in July on nuclear energy, training and promotion of public understanding of atomic power.

            “Thanks to the cooperation of Rosatom, Myanmar will have to enhance the human resources related to the construction and running of a Small Modular Reactor in Myanmar and to produce qualified experts for respective sectors,” the newspaper quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying.

            “Both sides frankly exchanged views on the effective use of nuclear energy in health and agricultural sectors including electricity production and further cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy,” the newspaper said.

            The development is likely to ignite concerns that Myanmar’s military would like to develop a nuclear weapons capability. There were suspicions a decade ago that North Korea was supplying nuclear arms technology to Myanmar, but there was no definitive evidence.

            Russia maintains friendly relations with Myanmar, which is treated as a pariah state by many Western nations after its army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021 and violently suppressed opposition, killing thousands of civilians and leading to what some U.N. experts describe as civil war.

            The United States and other nations have imposed political and economic sanctions against the ruling generals, while Russia supplies the military with arms, including fighter aircraft that are sometimes used against civilians.

            “Everybody is optimistic that in the future there is going to be a game here in Spain at some point, at some time,” Silva told The Associated Press. “I couldn’t tell you any specifics, but obviously the Chicago Bears would love to be a team that plays here.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803176,Dog owners tout Xolos' loyalty and sacred underworld history,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mezcal is not your ordinary pet. Hundreds of years ago the Latin American Indigenous group, the Nahuas, believed that a hairless dog like him, a Xoloitzcuintle, was a sacred creature who could guide its deceased master through the underworld.

            Dozens gathered on a recent day at Antiguo Colegio de San Ildefonso in Mexico City for a meet-and-greet with Mezcal and three more “Xolos”, as these slender dogs are locally known. The canines were at the art and culture museum as part of an effort to raise awareness about responsible adoption of Xolo puppies and promoting the significance of the breed. 

            “Can I touch him?” asked a woman working security for the museum, as she nervously brought her hand closer to the dog’s head











            “Absolutely! He loves to be petted,” said Nemiliz Gutiérrez, who was taking care of him for the day. 

            Her sister and owner of Mezcal, Itzayani Gutiérrez, leads a project promoting the breed to the public. 

            By reviewing ancient codex and records written after the conquest in 1521, experts have determined the religious relevance of the dogs among Mesoamerican civilizations. That fact isn’t lost on the sisters. 

            “We are privileged because we have among us some precious jewels of history that are living cultural heritage,” said Itzayani, who also owns a playful Xolo named Pilón. 

            Experts found that the Nahuas believed these dogs represented the god, Xólotl, the twin brother of deity Quetzalcóatl. While the latter personified life and light, the former was an effigy of the underworld and death. The Xolo, thought to be a creature capable of moving through the darkness, was conceived as a guide for their owner’s soul after dying, wrote historian Mercedes de la Garza in an article published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 

            Burial sites found by archaeologists in central Mexico show the remains of men and dogs lying side by side, which suggests that Xolos may have been sacrificed during their masters’ funeral rites. It was thought to be a way the living could ensure that when the soul of their loved ones reached the river of the underworld, it could reunite with its dog, mount on his back and cross together. 

            In the Nahuatl language, “Xolo” means “monster”, and though some dislike the physical appearance of these dogs, many find them fascinating. Mezcal’s hairless skin is dark as a shadow. When touched, it feels soft and warm. His teeth are rarely visible, as Xolos don’t bark much. On the recent day, he posed for pictures like a movie star and leaned his head toward visitors wanting to pet him.

            Like his predecessors, Mezcal never loses sight of Gutiérrez, who constantly pats the loving dog. 

            “Xolos are loyal by nature,” said Gutiérrez. “If one is adopted by a family, it will choose a member to stick with.”

            The closeness between Xoloitzcuintles and their owners was also noted by the Nahuas, according to experts. To please the gods, some Xolos were sacrificed in order to spare their masters’ lives.

            The dogs were killed in those ceremonies by extracting their hearts. This fact distinguished them from any other animal offered in sacrifice, wrote De la Garza. 

            The dogs also are a part of modern-day culture in Mexico and beyond. At least a couple of Xoloitzcuintles can be seen in Frida Kahlo’s paintings. A few more appear in portraits where the artist posed with her husband, Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Their love for these pets was shared by friend and art collector Dolores Olmedo, whose home in Mexico City became a museum and until recently took care of a few Xolos that visitors could approach. 

            In 2016, the capital’s mayor gave the Xoloitzcuintle a cultural heritage designation, and a year later, a charming Xolo named Dante reached world fame after his appearance in animated film “Coco”, which portrayed the adventures of a Mexican boy through the underworld. 

            Back in San Ildefonso, the Gutiérrez sisters hope more people will come to appreciate the breed’s significance and help it thrive. Once thought by experts to be headed toward extinction, Xolos can be spotted in upper class Mexico City neighborhoods. Nemiliz Gutiérrez said some breeders sell the dogs for upwards of $3,500. 

            Not every Xolo is in demand though, especially the variety with fur. 

            “Almost nobody wants them,” said Gutiérrez, whose sister works to find caring homes for all Xolos regardless of their coats. Through that process, they enjoy sharing about the breed’s historic significance – when Xolos embodied an endless love believed to transcend death.

            The ban on 36-year-old Afridi starts from Sept. 12, when he was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board.

            The left-arm spinner failed to disclose to the PCB security and anti-corruption department an approach or invitation to engage in corrupt conduct.











            Afridi has 118 wickets in 36 first-class matches, and starred in the Pakistan Super League when he took eight wickets in five matches last year. He was picked in the Pakistan squad for a home Twenty20 series against Australia but didn't play.

'X' represents a whole world of products which connect to the OnePlus ecosystem to build a superior digital life. The launch of these latest products reinforces OnePlus's position as a pioneer in digital devices and technology.""   The OnePlus 11 5G   Combining extreme fast and smooth experience, effortless imaging and modern elegance design, the latest OnePlus 11 5G is definitely a well-rounded flagship.   Extreme Fast and Smooth Experience That Lasts    The OnePlus 11 5G provides an extreme fast and smooth experience through its powerful Snapdragon® 8 Gen 2 Mobile Platform, delivering increased CPU and GPU speeds, along with improved power efficiency. This mobile platform also supports Realtime Hardware-enabled Ray Tracing. To make users enjoy ray tracing technology on mobile, OnePlus will be offering a 3D dynamic live wallpaper named PhysRay Wallpaper for download onto the new OnePlus 11 5G. The OnePlus 11 5G also comes with up to 16GB LPDDR5X RAM memory and RAM-Vita technology to allow for as many as 44 applications active on the background. A 100W SUPERVOOC fast-charging system, coupled with a 5000 mAh dual-cell battery, prolong the battery lifespan and provide peace of mind during extended use. The OnePlus 11 5G takes only 25 minutes from 1% to 100% battery capacity courtesy of its 100W SUPERVOOC fast-charging function. In North America, the OnePlus 11 5G charges with 80W SUPERVOOC Endurance Edition that can take only 27 minutes from 1% to 100% battery capacity.   In addition, The OnePlus 11 5G is the first Snapdragon® 8 Gen 2 device to be approved as Snapdragon Spaces™ Ready. It is the entrance for developers to bring their XR ideas to life and to explore the full potential of headworn AR.   Excellence on Display and Audio   The OnePlus 11 5G invites users to see the world in its full vibrancy and color, thanks to its 6.7-inch 2K 120Hz Super Fluid AMOLED Display with LTPO 3.0. LTPO 3.0 is a self-developed technology that saves energy and adapts refresh rates according to the specific use, ensuring consistency and clarity regardless of the content.   The OnePlus 11 5G is one of the first Android smartphones to be transformed by Dolby Vision to elevate every mobile experience with stunning picture that brings your on-the-go entertainment to life.

A large portion of the population is not tech-savvy and cannot operate chatbots. A large portion of the world’s population is not able to access affordable Internet services and smartphones, which is a significant hindrance to the market.Global internet users are still concerned about data privacy and security, which will impact the market for healthcare chatbots. Other concerns, such as a lack of user-friendliness or limited use, are also growth-limiting factors. However technological advances will make these issues less prevalent.The coronavirus (COVID-19), an outbreak that has impacted the market for healthcare chatbots, is one of the key drivers. Because the virus is highly infectious, healthcare chatbots are being used by medical professionals around the world to monitor patients and provide hospital-based care. The chatbots can communicate information about COVID-19 to patients in various languages, making the screening process quicker and more efficient. The market is also being driven by the rising prevalence of chronic diseases and the increasing demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM).Private clinics have begun to use healthcare chatbots to triage patients and clerk them, which leads to substantial cost savings and improves patient care outcomes. They can also help hospitals free up resources to treat critical and existing patients. Many health companies are also focusing on digital healthcare solutions. There is an increase in hybrid chatbot usage. These bots allow patients to communicate with real doctors via text or live video. These chatbots can also provide mental health assistance and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, or a combination thereof. Through webcams, and microphones, they can also assist autistic people in improving their social skills.* March 2022: WhatsApp announces the launch of an AI-based chatbot to educate young Indian women.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803261,Archaeologists uncover rare 14th-century Spanish synagogue,"MADRID (AP) — Archaeologists in the southern Spanish town of Utrera confirmed on Tuesday they had uncovered a 14th-century synagogue hidden within a building that was later converted into a church, hospital and most recently a bar. 

            Archaeologist Miguel Ángel de Dios told journalists that “the first thing to confirm is the presence of the prayer room” following years of analysis of the building's walls and floor. 

            “The fundamental elements of the synagogue, such as the entrance hall,” he said, “or the perimeter benches that have emerged in this survey, now confirm that we are indeed in the prayer hall.”











            The only hint of the Jewish temple’s existence came from a priest and historian, Rodrigo Caro, who wrote in 1604 that a hospital now stood on a site where Jews used to pray. There are a tiny handful of medieval synagogues surviving in Spain, including in the cities of Toledo and Cordoba. 

            The Utrera synagogue was converted into a church in the 16th century, de Dios added, when all traces of its Jewish past were erased. His team now hopes to identify the pulpit and a bath used for rituals. 

            “We now have the scientific certainty that we are standing in a medieval synagogue,” Utrera mayor José María Villalobos said. “The state of conservation of the synagogue, being partial, is nevertheless exceptional,” he added. 

            Attracting tourists interested in Spain's Jewish past has become a key focus for towns with historic traces in recent years.

            In 1492, Spain's Catholic monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, decreed that Spain's 200,000-strong Jewish population convert to Christianity or be expelled. 

            Spain has attempted in recent years to make amends for what the government termed this “historic mistake.” In 2015, the Spanish government allowed the descendants of exiled Sephardic Jews to apply for Spanish citizenship, with 132,226 people doing so.MADRID (AP) — Archaeologists in the southern Spanish town of Utrera confirmed on Tuesday they had uncovered a 14th-century synagogue hidden within a building that was later converted into a church, hospital and most recently a bar.Archaeologist Miguel Ángel de Dios told journalists that “the first thing to confirm is the presence of the prayer room” following years of analysis of the building's walls and floor.“The fundamental elements of the synagogue, such as the entrance hall,” he said, “or the perimeter benches that have emerged in this survey, now confirm that we are indeed in the prayer hall.”The only hint of the Jewish temple’s existence came from a priest and historian, Rodrigo Caro, who wrote in 1604 that a hospital now stood on a site where Jews used to pray.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803262,"Milwaukee police officer fatally shot, shooting suspect dead","MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee police officer chased down a robbery suspect and was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire early Tuesday. The suspect also died from a gunshot wound, police said.

            Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said the suspect ignored officers' commands and fled on foot after they arrived at the robbery scene about 1:15 a.m. on the city's south side. One officer then caught up with the suspect and a struggle ensued. Both men fired their weapons. 

            The wounded officer, 37-year-old Peter Jerving, died at a hospital, he said. Jerving had four years of experience with the Milwaukee Police Department, the chief said. 











            The suspect, 19-year-old Terrell Thompson, died at the scene. The chief said it was not immediately clear if Thompson died from the shot fired by Jerving or a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Thompson was sentenced Monday to a year of probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor hit-and-run charge filed against him in July 2021, court records show.

            “Milwaukee, our hearts are heavy. Milwaukee Police Department hearts are heavy. My heart is heavy,"" Norman told a news conference. “The violence needs to stop!""

            He said the city and its police department are in mourning.

            “One of our finest, who put on that uniform, put on that badge, went into work last night has paid the ultimate sacrifice for protecting our community. Milwaukee, we need your prayers, we need your support.”

            The department's chaplain, George Papachristou, read a statement from Jerving's family at a Tuesday afternoon news conference.

            “It is with much sadness that we, the family of Officer Peter Jerving, announce his untimely death which took place in the line of duty,” the chaplain read. “Officer Peter Jerving loved and dedicated his life to serving the great people of our city. To his last breath, Peter fulfilled that goal. Milwaukee has lost one of its finest young officers.""

            Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, angry and frustrated, said earlier in the day that the entire community, not just police, must play an active role in trying to combat gun violence and making the city safe.

            “The men and women of the Milwaukee Police Department, it’s not just them — it’s up to all of us,” the mayor said. “Enough of this, enough of this. There’s no excuse for this. This officer should not be dead right now.”

            As in other communities across America, gun violence has been a problem for years in the city of 569,000. According to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel database, 224 people were killed in the city last year, 197 people in 2021 and 190 in 2020, about 90% of them shot to death. 

            The city saw fewer than 120 homicides each year from 2017 to 2019. Guns were still the weapon of choice, though, at around 80% each year.

            Milwaukee Common Council President Jose G. Perez said in a statement that the shooting happened just blocks from his home. 

            “In our city we have too many guns, too many who are willing to carry and use guns, and far too much violence affecting every neighborhood,” he said. “We can and we must do better.”MILWAUKEE (AP) — A Milwaukee police officer chased down a robbery suspect and was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire early Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803263,"Democrats win control of Pennsylvania House, end GOP rule","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Democrats won control of the Pennsylvania House in special elections Tuesday, wresting partial power from Republicans for the first time in a dozen years in the competitive swing state.

            Democrats won all three vacant Pittsburgh-area House seats to claim a slim edge over Republicans, finally securing a majority they first appeared to have won in last November’s General Election. Republicans still hold the Senate, creating a political division that could make it difficult for lawmakers to send priority bills to new Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro.

            The special elections capped several months of electoral drama.











            Republicans held a comfortable 113-90 House majority last year. But once-a-decade redistricting and strong performance in statewide races helped Democrats flip just enough seats in the fall election to win a 102-101 majority in the House. Or so it seemed. Three of those Democratic seats quickly became vacant, casting uncertainty over who actually controlled the chamber.

            Rep. Tony DeLuca died of cancer in October, shortly before winning reelection, Rep. Summer Lee resigned after also winning a congressional election and Rep. Austin Davis quit before being sworn in as lieutenant governor.

            That left Republicans with more people in the House than Democrats and led to a political impasse. The chamber elected Democratic Rep. Mark Rozzi as speaker as the new session began on Jan. 3, but only after Republican leaders and a few other GOP members joined with all Democrats on the vote. 

            The House has been frozen since Rozzi took over and has not passed internal operating rules, assigned members to committees or approved any legislation. Rozzi said last week he wants to retain the speakership when Democrats convene with their newly elected members.

            At a news conference in Pittsburgh late Tuesday the Democratic floor leader, Rep. Joanna McClinton, said the three Democratic candidates had been “tossed into the mixer really quickly” to compete in the special elections. 

            She noted Democrats have been in the House minority for 24 of the past 28 years.

            McClinton wants the speakership but said she did not want to “get ahead of the days to come” as the election results are fully tabulated the certified, asking people to “please stay tuned to see what the will of this body will be” when the House returns to voting session.

            A few minutes after McClinton was done speaking, the clerk’s office sent out an email with notice of House floor sessions to resume in two weeks.

            Democrats had been expected to win Tuesday’s special elections, because they had easily won the same seats last fall.

            DeLuca’s former seat was won by Democrat Joe McAndrew, 32, a business owner who is a former state House Democratic staffer and the former executive director of Allegheny County’s Democratic committee. Lee’s former seat was won by Abigail Salisbury, 40, a lawyer and Democratic member of the Swissvale Borough Council. Matthew Gergely, a Democrat who works for the McKeesport city government, was elected to succeed Davis.

            The special elections occurred only after the courts rejected an attempt by the House Republican floor leader, Rep. Bryan Cutler, to prevent two of the contests from being decided on Tuesday.

            When the newly elected lawmakers take office, the House may still be one member short of its full complement. That’s because Republican Rep. Lynda Schlegel Culver won a special election Jan. 31 to fill a vacant state Senate seat.HARRISBURG, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803264,Daly to enter Daytona 500 with Floyd Mayweather's team,"IndyCar driver Conor Daly will attempt to qualify for the Daytona 500 with the NASCAR team owned by Floyd Mayweather.

            The Money Team Racing raced its way into the Daytona 500 last year with driver Kaz Grala; Daly made his Cup Series debut for the team in October on The Roval at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

            “The Money Team Racing shocked the world by making the Daytona 500 last year and I believe in this team and know we will prepare a great car for this year’s race,"" Mayweather said Tuesday. ""Like a fighter who’s always ready to face the best, Conor has the courage to buckle into this beast without any practice and put that car into the field.











            ""Conor is like a hungry fighter and my kind of guy. I sure wouldn’t bet against him.”

            Daly will be among six drivers vying for four open spots in the 40-car field. Among those also trying to qualify for an open spot in the Feb. 19 season opener is seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson and action sports star Travis Pastrana, a close friend of Daly's.

            The announcement to enter Daly in the Daytona 500 came just eight days before Daytona International Speedway opens for race preparations. Daly said last week he was not hesitant to accept a late offer and TMT said it will enter Daly in at least six other Cup races this season.

            The effort will be funded by Bitnile.com, which is Daly and Ed Carpenter Racing's sponsor in IndyCar. 

            Bitnile executive chairman Todd Ault III said it would also sponsor Daly at Circuit of the Americas in Austin in March for the “Texas Two-Step,” in which Daly will run the IndyCar race at Texas Motor Speedway the next week. 

            Ault also said there would be a “Daly Double” at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August, when Daly runs both the IndyCar and Cup races on the same weekend on the road course.

            “Our next generation marketplace launches just 10 days after the Daytona 500 ... to help promote our marketplace, we asked Conor to run a number of NASCAR events this year in addition to our sponsorship of his full-time job in IndyCar,"" Ault said.

            The remaining Cup races Daly enters will be dependent on his schedule.

            “I am thrilled to be given the opportunity to attempt to run in the Daytona 500,” he said. “It is the most prestigious race in NASCAR and to have the chance to compete in it is truly an honor. I am also excited to be running the entire IndyCar Series season and select NASCAR Cup events.

            ""I am looking forward to the challenge and can’t wait to get behind the wheel of whatever BITNILE.COM race car, boat, dune buggy or vehicle they ask me to drive.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803265,Russian court upholds shutting top independent newspaper,"MOSCOW (AP) — A court in Moscow on Tuesday upheld an earlier verdict to revoke the license of a top independent newspaper that has been critical of the Kremlin for years, part of the authorities' relentless crackdown on dissent.

Viking, a Penguin Random House imprint, will release “My Name is Barbra” on Nov. 7.

            Her memoir, fitting for a superstar of the grandest ambitions, is listed at 1,040 pages.

            “The book is, like Barbra herself, frank, funny, opinionated, and charming,” according to the publisher. “She recounts her early struggles to become an actress, eventually turning to singing to earn a living; the recording of some of her acclaimed albums; the years of effort involved in making ‘Yentl’; her direction of ‘The Prince of Tides’; her friendships with figures ranging from Marlon Brando to Madeleine Albright; her political advocacy; and the fulfillment she’s found in her marriage to James Brolin.”











            “My Name Is Barbra” also is the title of a 1965 Streisand album and television special.

            Publishers have sought a Streisand memoir for decades, with the singer telling Jimmy Fallon in 2021 that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis asked her to write one in the early 1980s, when the former first lady was an editor at Doubleday. During an Associated Press interview in 2009, Streisand mentioned that she had been writing chapters about her life, in longhand. 

            “I go back and forth,” Streisand said at the time. “Do I really want to write about my life? Do I really want to relive my life? I’m not sure.”

            The memoir was first announced in 2015, and scheduled for two years later, although it didn’t have a title at the time. A reference to it on her web site, posted in 2015, was later pulled.

            Financial terms for the memoir were not disclosed. Streisand was represented by Robert Barnett, the Washington attorney whose other clients have ranged from Barack Obama to Elton John.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803279,Greece: asylum seekers moved back into refugee camps,"Rana is 20 years of age and lives in a refugee camp somewhere in mainland Greece. She doesn't want to give her real name or her exact location because she fears the negative impact it could have on her asylum application.Rana and her family fled Afghanistan in 2018 and travelled to Greece via Turkey. Her father has a heart condition, and her brother suffers from epilepsy, which means that the family of five is considered particularly vulnerable and was able to claim an apartment as part of the Emergency Support to Integration and Accommodation (ESTIA) program.This program, which is funded by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the European Union, was set up in 2015 to fund urban accommodation for the most vulnerable asylum seekers. The hope was that it would facilitate their integration into the host society.In December 2022, the Greek government phased out the ESTIA program, which meant that Rana and her family had to move back into a refugee camp.""I used to go to school in Greece with my sister,"" she told DW, her eyes repeatedly filling with tears. ""When we arrived at the camp, we were told that there was no space for us at the school there."" They were told that they could go to school in the next town. But the school was so far away from the camp that, with a heavy heart, they decided against it.The family had to leave behind the life it had built for itself in the city. ""When we arrived at the camp, our container was completely empty. There weren't even any mattresses,"" recalled Rana. The family slept on the floor for two days and then went back to their old apartment in the city to get the mattresses.That was two months ago. To this day, their names are not on the list of those entitled to get meals. ""They give us whatever is left over when everyone else in the camp has been given their food,"" said Rana. In the meantime, they have got their own cooker and can now prepare their own meals.The family's asylum application has already been rejected twice. But that was before the Taliban returned to power in Kabul in August 2021. Since then, there has been no more talk of Afghanistan being a safe country of origin.Now the family is waiting for the Greek authorities to review its application. Because both Brussels and Athens consider Turkey to be a safe third country, Rana is afraid that the family's asylum application will once again be rejected, and the family could be sent to Turkey.The endless wait and uncertainty are an immense psychological burden on migrants. The basic idea behind the ESTIA program was to create dignified living conditions within society in order to ease people's suffering. Initially, the intention was that about 20,000 places would be provided.In February 2022, the Greek government announced that ESTIA would be terminated by the end of the year. The Greek Migration Ministry says that at that time, 12,648 people were in apartments provided by ESTIA and that since then, many of them have been told whether they have been granted asylum or not.In response to an inquiry from DW, the ministry said that ultimately, less than 500 people had had to leave their apartments because nobody had been admitted to the program in recent months.Lawyer Christina Svana considers the termination of the ESTIA program a mistake and points to the fact that many asylum seekers are still in need. Svana works for FENIX, an NGO that helps refugees by providing them with legal assistance and advice.Since Athens announced it was winding down the ESTIA program, she has been inundated with calls from desperate clients: ""We've seen how tough the implementation of this decision was. In many cases, they only gave people one or two days' notice that they had to leave."" This, she says, was very difficult for the people involved because many of them had already settled in.Svana sees the termination of the ESTIA program as part of the government's policy of deterring asylum seekers: ""Ever since the government came to power in 2019, we have seen a dramatic decline in the benefits for or the rights of refugees. Enclosed centers have been built on the islands and walled camps that are under surveillance on the mainland."" She says that the Greek state is determined to keep refugees apart from the rest of society.Svana's colleague Ines Avelas, head of Advocacy and Strategy at FENIX, feels the termination of the ESTIA program is politically motivated.Avelas says that the head of the EU Task Force Migration Management in Brussels told FENIX in writing that the Greek authorities had decided to phase out the project because of the ""significant drop in arrivals and the reduced utilization of capacity in the reception centers."" Avelas points out that funding from the EU's Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) was guaranteed until 2027.""As far as we can tell,"" she said, ""the end of the program was a decision of the Greek government and there was no budgetary reason for it.""The Greek government rejects this claim. The Migration Ministry told DW that while the ESTIA program could be financed through the AMIF Fund, ""no further means had been made available.""In response to an inquiry from DW, the European Commission said that ""Ultimately it is a choice of Greece how to offer reception and how to use the funding put at its disposal within the legal base obligations of the EU Directives and Regulations.""The Migration Ministry said in a written statement that those affected by the phasing out of ESTIA had been given an alternative in residential facilities ""that are fully in line with international and European legal requirements"" and that these facilities offered residents ""safety, food and appropriate living conditions.""The ministry also said that the only people affected were those who were still in the asylum process. According to the ministry, ""most asylum seekers were notified of the outcome of their asylum application before the end of the program. In the event of a negative outcome, they were deported; in the event of a positive outcome, they were offered accommodation and financial assistance through the HELIOS integration program.""HELIOS is a program for people who have already been granted asylum in Greece. It is also funded by the EU. Lefteris Papagiannakis of the NGO Greek Council for Refugees, says that the HELIOS program is good in that it provides one year's support for those seeking a job and accommodation. ""The problem is that you have to have accommodation to get into the program in the first place,"" he said, adding that things get difficult when assistance ends after a year.Papagiannakis points out that many people who have been granted asylum have ended up on the streets or had to return to the refugee camps. He doubts that Greece is serious about integration: ""This government is hostile to refugees and migrants,"" he said.This article was originally published in German.",2023/2/7,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803280,Thailand: Rescuers save baby trapped down a well,"A 19-month-old girl was rescued from a dry well in northern Thailand on Tuesday, some 18 hours after she fell into the shaft while her parents were working at a plantation site.The overnight operation culminated in applause and cheers as the toddler, a daughter of migrant workers from Myanmar, was pulled out of the 15-meter (49-foot) hole by rescue workers and placed on a stretcher.""Great job, guys. We did it!"" said one rescuer as his colleagues in Tak province's Phop Phra district wept and hugged.The toddler was immediately sent to Phop Phra Hospital suffering from fatigue but ""nothing serious,"" Phop Phra district chief Sanya Phetset told Thairath TV.The girl's parents said they had taken her to work with them at a tapioca farm, leaving their daughter under a tree while they worked.But they raised the alarm after they were unable to find the child during their break and heard cries coming from the well.The deep pit, dug by the landowner, had been left uncovered after it failed to strike groundwater, according to Phetset.Rescue teams were forced to work through the night using a mechanical digger, while pumping oxygen into the well to allow the child to breathe.Authorities feared that the well could collapse if workers continued to use the digger. Out of caution, they used hand-held shovels to remove the final few meters of earth before the 18-hour ordeal for the child came to an end.In July 2018, rescue workers successfully brought out all the members of a local young football team from a cave in northern Thailand.The story had gripped the world before the risky operation involving a team of international divers and Thai Navy SEALs came to a successful conclusion.jsi/rt (AP, AFP)",2023/2/7,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803281,Earthquake in Turkey: What's going on with the aftershocks?,"Turkey and Syria can't catch a break. Since Monday's devastating quake, aftershocks have ripped through the region. Altogether some 5,000 people have been announced dead so far. The number is expected to rise because countless people are still trapped below the rubble — and because continued aftershocks will cause already-unstable buildings to collapse.Large earthquakes are almost always followed by small earthquakes called aftershocks. They are generally strongest in the 48 hours following the main quake and can last weeks and even years in some cases.Typically the magnitude of aftershocks starts around one degree less than the initial event — so, for example, if the quake has a magnitude of 7, seismologists might expect an aftershock of 6.""That's the average occurrence but it sometimes happens that it isn't like that at all,"" seismologist Roger Musson, an honorary research associate with the British Geological Survey, told DW. ""Sometimes you get an aftershock that's actually larger than the main shock. So as a seismologist, you always have to be prepared to be surprised by what the Earth throws at you.""In the Turkey-Syria border region, the aftershocks have been almost as strong as the initial quake.An earthquake is considered an aftershock and not an individual quake when it occurs between 1 and 2 fault lines away from a preceding earthquake. Generally aftershocks are the result of the Earth's tectonic plates trying to shift back into place along a fault line.More than 100 aftershock earthquakes have occurred since the initial earthquake in Turkey and Syria.According to Musson, aftershocks may not occur if the initial earthquake is very small. But in the case of larger earthquakes, they are a given.The 7.5-magnitude aftershock that occurred after Monday's 7.8-magnitude earthquake is significantly stronger than typical aftershocks.Musson, who also does research at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said that's because rather than occurring along a single fault, the initial earthquake can be better described as having occurred in the East Anatolian fault zone. This is like a large fault line with several minor fault lines congregating around it, he said.The main quake on Monday triggered what Musson called a ""swarm"" of earthquakes happening along new faults coming out of the main fault rather than the typical aftershock movement, which takes place along the same fault as the initial earthquake.This depends on the size of the initial earthquake. Although the more intense aftershocks will probably stop around two days after the initial quake, according to Musson, it's possible for the aftershocks to gradually decay, but not completely cease until a year after the main quake.Other research suggests that in some areas, like the New Madrid fault in the US state of Missouri, small aftershocks can continue for centuries after the initial shock.We'll have a better idea of the answer to this in a day or two. The activation of the fault where the 7.5 aftershock occurred could in turn produce aftershocks of its own, which means we aren't in the clear yet. Even when they're smaller in magnitude, aftershocks can still be devastating. A small tremor may be enough to lead an already half-demolished building to collapse, causing major destruction.""An aftershock will often do a disproportionate amount of damage relative to its size, just because the buildings are in a weakened state,"" said Musson. ""This is one reason why, after major earthquakes, civil defense authorities will go around and mark buildings which are in a damaged state and therefore unsafe, warning people not to get back into them.""Edited by: Julia Vergin",2023/2/7,,

She told Carrick he represented a ""grave danger to women"" which would ""last indefinitely.""Cheema-Grubb said Carrick ""took monstrous advantage of women"" behind a public appearance of propriety and trustworthiness.""You brazenly raped and sexually assaulted a number of women, some very brutally, and you behaved as if you were untouchable. You were bold and at times relentless, trusting that no victim would overcome her shame and fear to report you,"" the judge told Carrick.Carrick joined the Met in 2001 and his crimes took place between 2003 and 2020.He allegedly met some of his victims through online dating apps or on social occasions, using his position as a police officer to gain their trust, authorities said.Carrick often humiliated the women, including locking them naked in a small cupboard, urinating on them and whipping them.In statements read out by the prosecutor, his victims said they felt ""trapped""The case drew a wave of condemnation across Britain.""For nearly two decades, you were proved right but now a combination of those 12 women, by coming forward, and your police colleagues, by acting on their evidence, have exposed you and brought you low,"" she added.Some of his victims gave written statements to the court in which they said they no longer trusted the police.The Met, which dismissed Carrick last month, has previously apologised for failing to spot his pattern of abuse earlier.Assistant Commissioner Barbara Gray said in a statement on Sunday evening that she was ""truly sorry for the harm and devastation"" caused to Carrick's victims.lo/es (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/2/7,,

It is an opportunity for the country to strengthen its regulatory mechanisms to prevent future market failures,"" Tewari said.Adani has denied the fraud allegations, and described the report as ""not merely an unwarranted attack on any specific company but a calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.""However, investors up to this point have reacted to the report by selling off shares in Adani Group stock.Since the report was released on January 24, Adani's market value has dropped by more than $100 billion (€93.21 billion), prompting the group to abandon a $2.5 billion stock offering.There are seven India-listed companies bearing the Adani name, including firms in power transmission, green energy and port operation. The group also owns cement producers, airport operators, coal miners and a digital marketing company.Adani Group's financing via the LIC and the State Bank of India (SBI) has raised concerns over potential consequences for the institutions' financial stability and for the savings of millions of Indians.The LIC is an investor in five Adani companies with stakes ranging from 1% to 9%.""People thought their money is safe in public sector banks and institutions,"" said Ram Gopal Yadav, an MP from the Samajwadi Party.The BJP has not come out openly on the issue. Modi is widely perceived to be a close ally of Gautam Adani, whose business interests often align with the government's growth goals.Adani Group has been a major supporter of Modi's initiatives, such as ""Make in India"" and ""Digital India.""Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has downplayed the company's market plummet as a company-specific issue that does not pose a threat to macroeconomic stability.""There have been occasional blips in the market,"" Sitharaman said in an interview with the ""Times Now"" news channel.The outcome of the Adani controversy and its impact on Modi, as India holds nine state elections this year and the crucial general election in 2024, will depend crucially on whether the opposition parties will be able to keep the controversy alive on the public's mind.""This is all about state-business relations. Inappropriate deals widen inequalities and there should be regulatory mechanisms to inform if this state-business goes crony,"" Lekha Chakraborty, professor and chair at India's National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), told DW.The uproar also comes at a time when India holds this year's presidency of the G20 group of leading economies.""This case won't cast shadow on the G20 because it is a specific case of capital mobility and inappropriate use of offshore tax havens,"" added Chakraborty.Given the Modi government's strong base of support, and its prior success in navigating past controversies and political challenges, it is still uncertain if this current controversy will end up denting the BJP's image.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/7,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803285,China's Russia ties force Ukraine to rethink partnership,"China's increasingly closer relationship with Russia has raised doubts in Ukraine over its strategic partnership with Beijing, with Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Andriy Melnyk calling China's position ""less and less acceptable"" during a foreign policy panel discussion in Kyiv last month.Ukraine has maintained a strategic partnership with China since 2011, which has allowed trade and defense ties to flourish. China has been a major importer of Ukrainian grains and corn.Ukraine is also a major arms supplier to China. Beijing's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, is a refurbished Soviet vessel that was purchased from Ukraine.However, as Russia's war on Ukraine continues into a second year, there are discussions in Kyiv over reassessing the bilateral relationship with China.""For years, Ukraine perceived China only from the point of view of opportunity, but since the Russian invasion, Ukrainian experts have become much more critical towards China, and perceive how China could be a risk and challenge for Ukraine's national interest,"" said Yurii Poita, a Ukraine expert at the Institute for National Defense and Security Research (INDSR) in Taiwan.Although Beijing has not explicitly supported Russia's position on the war, it has worked on building stronger ties with Moscow as the EU and the United States work on isolating Russia.Following talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week, China's Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said Beijing wants to advance bilateral relations with Russia in 2023.Last week, Russian state media reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping was planning a visit to Moscow this spring.Although Beijing has said there is no exact date set for the trip, the Russian Foreign Ministry said a visit by Xi would be ""the central event in the bilateral agenda for 2023,"" according to Russia's state-run news agency Tass.Poita, the Ukraine expert, said that discussions in Kyiv on changing its relationship with Beijing has gradually spread from Ukrainian think tanks and media commentary to the Foreign Ministry.Deputy Foreign Minister Melnyk said during a panel in Kyiv last month that China's position on the ongoing war can no longer be viewed as ""neutral,"" which is the position that Beijing has tried to claim that it maintains. ""I'm not sure these relations can still be strategic,"" Melnyk said.Ukrainian lawmaker Kira Rudik told DW that China is helping Moscow to bypass some Western sanctions, while opening up markets to Russia.""No one remains neutral. It's either you support us or you are playing with people who want to destroy us. What we see from China right now is extremely unfortunate. Every country that's supporting Russia is basically supporting the fight. This is extremely painful,"" she said.Russia's invasion of its smaller neighbor has triggered speculation over parallels with China's belligerent stance on Taiwan, and the possibility of China carrying out a similar attack. Beijing considers Taiwan as part of Chinese territory and has vowed to ""reunite"" the island with the mainland, by using force if necessary.The war has also brought Taipei and Kyiv closer together. Over the past two months, Taiwan has signed several memorandums of understanding to help several cities in Ukraine to purchase power generation and heating equipment as Russia attacks critical infrastructure.Additionally, Taiwan has also expressed willingness to help Ukraine upgrade its digital infrastructure as part of postwar reconstruction efforts.""They donated $1 million (around €1 million) for generators and I think this is a very obvious stance that they are our ally,"" she said. ""These are the people who are supporting us and I think Ukraine should view Taiwan as a partner,"" said Ukrainian lawmaker Rudik.""A lot of people in Ukraine now know Taiwan cares enough about the war to send Ukraine money to buy generators so that Ukrainian people can survive one of the toughest winters in Ukraine's history,"" she added.Although Ukraine's reassessment of its relationship with China offers an opportunity for Kyiv to build closer ties with Taiwan, experts warn that Ukraine needs to be cautious.""In the anticipation of the next escalation phase, Ukraine doesn't need to antagonize China. If it starts openly befriending Taiwan in the next several months, this will certainly backfire and further lead China to support Russia,"" Velina Tchakarova, director of the Austrian Institute for European and Security Policy (AIES), told DW.Expert Poita said that Ukraine is aware it needs to avoid pushing China closer to Russia, so it is being very cautious.""Ukraine is very careful about building up its relationship with Taiwan, but there is still a strengthening perception among Ukrainian experts and the parliament that Ukraine needs to develop its relationship with Taiwan,"" he said.""If Ukraine doesn't see any pro-Ukrainian steps from Beijing, it shows Kyiv that China is not a strategic partner and it should draw some red lines around its cooperation with China,"" he added.Edited by: Wesley Rahn",2023/2/7,427,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803288,German court rejects Greenpeace lawsuit against automaker VW,"BERLIN (AP) — A German court on Tuesday rejected a lawsuit by environmental group Greenpeace aiming to force automaker Volkswagen to stop selling vehicles with combustion engines by 2030.

            The civil case echoes several other lawsuits brought by climate campaigners, including one against luxury car manufacturer BMW that was dismissed last week.

            The Braunschweig regional court ruled Tuesday that VW was acting within the law, German news agency dpa reported.











            The automaker welcomed the verdict, but Greenpeace said it would appeal.

            “Companies like Volkswagen which harm the climate have a responsibility to lower their CO2 emissions much faster and end their fossil business models,” the group said in a statement. “That's the only way to slow the climate crisis.”

            
                Scientists say greenhouse gas emissions such as those produced from burning fossil fuels need to be sharply reduced in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century.

            European Union lawmakers on Tuesday approved a deal cut in October to ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars and vans by 2035.

            The 27-nation bloc’s Council of member states still needs to provide final approval of the deal. Conservative politicians in Germany, which has a powerful auto lobby in VW, Mercedes and BMW, want exemptions for vehicles that burn synthetic fuels produced with renewable energy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803289,"First Phosphate Confirms Continued High Grade Phosphate Assays at Its Bégin-Lamarche Project in Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec","Saguenay, Canada -  Newsfile Corp. - February 7, 2023 - First Phosphate Corp. (""First Phosphate"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report that it has received remaining phosphate assay results for its Bégin-Lamarche project located in the region of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec. Highlights of the most recent surface sampling include:     Multiple high grade surface grab samples of up to 18.96% P2O5 (phosphate) and 6.81% TiO2 (titanium).     Current results from Target 1 contain rich and thick layers of phosphate rock that extend within the original strike zone. 70 surface sample results confirm the high grade nature of the phosphate discovery with 30% of assays grading over 10% P2O5.     Together with earlier surface sampling and magnetic surveying, a strike zone of 2.5 km by 400 m containing rich phosphate rock layers can be delineated within the Target 1 sector.     A new discovery was made on Target 3 where the results of 38 grab samples in a 30-60 m wide nelsonite produced multiple phosphate assays of over 10% P2O5. This target is located approximately 3,000 m to the south of Target 1. Magnetic surveying shows that Target 1 and Target 3 might be aligned and form part of an even further extended strike zone.     Sampling reveals another high grade phosphate area on Target 8 (Larouche) with up to 20.52% P2O5 and 9.10% TiO2. 6 of the 19 surface grab samples taken at Target 8 revealed assay results of over 10% P2O5.     Analysis of 43 trace elements, including U, Th, REE, As and Cd indicates very low concentrations of potentially deleterious elements.     Promising drill targets have been identified for the upcoming drill program.   ""Extended analysis of the Begin-Lamarche property continues to reveal some of the highest grade phosphate samples ever produced in the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec,"" explained First Phosphate President Peter Kent. ""Igneous anorthosite comprises only about 1% of total global phosphate reserves. These deposits have the potential to be highly desirable for the production of LFP battery material because they are devoid of high concentrations of deleterious elements.""   Results from the previously announced assays in the discovery area can be found at:   January 24, 2023:  https://firstphosphate.com/begin-lamarche-jan24-2023  September 14, 2022:  https://firstphosphate.com/begin-lamarche-sept14-2022   Figures representing details of the current assay results are found below:      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/153866_6d7d770cf422d90b_001full.jpg      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/153866_6d7d770cf422d90b_002full.jpg      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/153866_6d7d770cf422d90b_003full.jpg      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/153866_6d7d770cf422d90b_004full.jpg      To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:  https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8917/153866_6d7d770cf422d90b_007full.jpg   Neither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Market Regulator (as such term is defined in the CSE policies) has reviewed or accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news release.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803296,Russia pledges military support to Mali during Lavrov visit,"BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov pledged military support to Mali during his first visit to the West African nation Tuesday and dismissed criticism of Moscow's growing influence on the continent.

            Russia has delivered “very large supplies of aviation equipment” to Mali over the past few months which has ""significantly increased” the capability of local forces to fight extremists, Lavrov told journalists. 

            “We will now be planning additional steps in the field of education through military higher educational institutions and in the field of supplies of weapons and military equipment,” Lavrov said, refusing to go into specifics.











            Lavrov's trip to Bamako, Mali's capital, comes as Western countries express their concerns about alleged human rights abuses committed by Russian mercenaries working for the private military contractor Wagner Group.

            The Russian foreign minister made no mention of Wagner by name during a press conference, but criticized unnamed Western powers of “neo-colonial approaches and double standards.”

            “We see the reaction of the Western states on the evolution of our relations and we see with regret that it is again negative, a negative attitude of the West to the principles of parity and mutual respect,"" Lavrov said.

            Russia's presence in Mali has expanded as the role played by former colonizer France has diminished. After spending nine years helping Mali's army curb the spread of Islamic insurgents, France withdrew its forces last year after relations soured with the country's ruling junta.

            Col. Assimi Goita seized power in a 2020 coup and disappointed international partners when he failed to hold elections on the timeframe he originally agreed to. As French support waned, Goita enlisted help from Moscow.

            Mali’s foreign minister Abdoulaye Diop on Tuesday again defended the government’s cooperation with Russia, saying that collaboration with France “does not meet the objectives of Malians.”

            “We are not going to continue to justify our choice of partners,” Diop said. “This decision is a decision of the Malians and a decision that is taken with full responsibility. And Mali wants to work with Russia.”

            Independent human rights experts working with the U.N. have called for an investigation into possible abuses, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by government forces in Mali and the Wagner Group, which is owned by an oligarch with close ties to Russia’s president.

            The Pentagon has described the Wagner Group as a surrogate for the Russian Defense Ministry. The Kremlin denies any connection.

            Western officials say hundreds of fighters from the Wagner Group began working more than a year ago alongside Mali’s armed forces to try to stem a decade-long insurgency by Islamic extremists in the West African country. 

            Diplomats, analysts, and human rights groups say indiscriminate violence against civilians has grown since the mercenaries arrived, warning that extremists linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have only become stronger.

            However, Mali's foreign minister said Tuesday that it should be Malian authorities and not outsiders assessing the reports of human rights violations.

            “Human rights groups must stop being instruments used by those who want to destabilize Mali,” Diop said, adding that ”we are accused of human rights abuses often by disguised terrorists themselves.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803300,Shiffrin rules out racing downhill; super-G next at worlds,"MERIBEL, France (AP) — Mikaela Shiffrin has ruled out skiing the downhill at the world championships — keeping to her pre-announced schedule of four events.

            Shiffrin inspected the course before the opening downhill training session Tuesday just to take a look at the layout ahead of Wednesday’s super-G race. But she did not enter the training session.

            Then she performed a few runs of super-G training.











            Shiffrin straddled a gate in the slalom leg and was disqualified from the combined race Monday that opened the championships.

            After the super-G, she also plans to ski her preferred events of giant slalom and slalom at the end of next week. Shiffrin had left open a small possibility that she would race the downhill but now she has decided not to.

            World Cup downhill leader Sofia Goggia led the training session, placing 0.26 seconds ahead of Italian teammate Elena Curtoni and 0.44 ahead of two-time world champion Ilka Stuhec.

            “The time doesn’t reflect how it felt, because on the top part, which is full of bumps, I was a bit wide in a few areas. The same thing midway down. Clearly, it’s a course that needs to be dissected well. There needs to be the right mix of intensity and tactics,” Goggia said.

            “Fortunately there are two more training sessions before Saturday’s race, split up by the super-G,"" Goggia added. ""I’ve got a lot to study and visualize over these next few days.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803302,F1 driver Bottas relishes his leadership role at Alfa Romeo,"After taking a back-seat role at Mercedes for so long, Valtteri Bottas is relishing his position as Alfa Romeo leader.

            The Finnish driver is in his second season with the Formula One team after being replaced by George Russell at Mercedes. 

            “In this team I feel like my role has been very different to what I’ve ever had in Formula One,” Bottas said on Tuesday as Alfa Romeo unveiled its sleek black-and-red C43 car for 2023. “A bit more involvement, a bit more information going through me in a way.”











            That wasn't always the case at Mercedes, where Bottas often felt under pressure alongside F1 great Lewis Hamilton.

            His time ended after five seasons in which he won a modest 10 races and was second best to Hamilton — who won 50 in the same period on his way to a record-equaling seven world titles.

            Bottas had some high points. 

            He showed genuine pace in qualifying and competed strongly at times with Hamilton, but on race day it was evidently clear he was No. 2.

            Now the 33-year-old Bottas is helping to bring the best out of 23-year-old teammate Zhou Guanyu, who is also in his second season with Alfa Romeo.

            “I tried to give all my experience and technical knowledge I could from the past, and then that work continued throughout the whole of last year,"" Bottas said. “It’s a really open situation in the team and I love to know as much as I can, details for the new car, and the set-up direction we’ve gone.”

            Bottas finished 10th last season. 

            He scored 38 points from the first six races, including a best finish of fifth place at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, where he almost overtook Russell on the last lap for fourth spot.

            Rather than capitalizing on his season start, he endured a dismal run of 10 straight races without a point before finishing 10th in Mexico and ninth in Brazil near the end of the season and totaled 49 points.

            “We need to achieve more, it’s simple as that. We need to aim for better, aim for higher. The whole team, myself included,"" he said. ""How to get there, that’s the tricky bit.""

            But Bottas, who is celebrating a decade in F1 this year, is mentally ready.

            “I had a good break, which is important, because we go pretty much full gas until the end of the year,"" the former Williams driver said. “The mental reset and physical reset is important, so I’m full of energy and keen to go.”

            Preseason testing takes place in Bahrain from Feb. 23-25 and the season starts there on March 5.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803310,Manchester City's problems mount for manager Pep Guardiola,"MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Pep Guardiola had enough to worry about even before Manchester City became embroiled in probably the biggest Premier League scandal of all time.

            Off the field, City is facing accusations that the club breached a slew of financial regulations with its lavish spending. On it, Guardiola faces his own battle to defend the league title and keep his team's season on track.

            While City's position in the standings remains healthy enough, five points behind leader Arsenal in second place, Sunday's loss to Tottenham fed into a growing feeling that all is not right within the club. That was the case even before Monday's bombshell action by the Premier League.











            Indeed, there has been a sense of unease and uncertainty around the club for much of the season. Erling Haaland is increasingly becoming a point of scrutiny when trying to decipher what is going wrong at City.

            “Erling has been fantastic. No one says anything when he’s scoring goals and winning,"" City defender Kyle Walker said. ""All of sudden now when we don’t win and he doesn’t score, they say, ‘Is it the problem? Do we play better without him?’ I hear it all the time.""

            Walker has a point, but his comments also suggest doubts from outside the club are filtering through to the players.

            Haaland has been outstanding, scoring 31 goals in 27 games. Yet City has become more predictable as a result of having such a prominent target at center forward.

            In recent years, Guardiola has relied on goals from all over his team, making it more difficult for opposition defenses to close down areas of threat. While City's total of 53 goals after 21 games is identical to its record at the same point last season, it has picked up eight points fewer.

            Even with the addition of Haaland, City is finding it more difficult to win games — three less than at this stage last term.

            The problems, however, do not rest on Haaland's shoulders alone. He is, after all, producing remarkable numbers in front of goal. And Guardiola seems focused on other areas of his squad. Last month, he noted that a team that has won four of the last five league titles has lost its edge.

            “We are far away from the team we had in previous seasons,"" Guardiola said. “Do you think we are going to chase the gap to Arsenal the way we are playing? No way.”

            With a squad packed with world class players, Guardiola has the luxury of leaving out some of his biggest names in a bid to freshen things up.

            Phil Foden, one of the brightest young talents in Europe, has been a peripheral figure at times this season. Ruben Dias, voted player of the year in England and the best defender in the Champions League in 2021, has not started a league game since October or any for City since November. Joao Cancelo was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day after he was benched in recent weeks.

            Most peculiar of all, however, was the decision to bench Kevin De Bruyne against Tottenham.

            Guardiola is known for making unexpected calls, but to leave De Bruyne out of such an important game was a major statement that backfired as City lost 1-0 and missed out on the chance to cut Arsenal's lead to two points.

            Guardiola seems to be searching for ways to get a reaction out of his squad at a point in the campaign when there is still all to play for. The departure of Cancelo and benching of De Bruyne look like drastic attempts to make his point, but also raise questions about what he will try to do next.

            Guardiola is into his seventh year at City — he has never stayed at any club so long since becoming a coach. He may now have to oversee his most extensive squad rebuild since first taking over in 2016.

            That is for the future, though. Right now, City is still in contention to win three trophies.

            Solving the problems off the field, however, could be much more difficult.

No one says anything when he’s scoring goals and winning,"" City defender Kyle Walker said. ""All of sudden now when we don’t win and he doesn’t score, they say, ‘Is it the problem? Do we play better without him?’ I hear it all the time.""Walker has a point, but his comments also suggest doubts from outside the club are filtering through to the players.Haaland has been outstanding, scoring 31 goals in 27 games. Yet City has become more predictable as a result of having such a prominent target at center forward.In recent years, Guardiola has relied on goals from all over his team, making it more difficult for opposition defenses to close down areas of threat. While City's total of 53 goals after 21 games is identical to its record at the same point last season, it has picked up eight points fewer.Even with the addition of Haaland, City is finding it more difficult to win games — three less than at this stage last term.The problems, however, do not rest on Haaland's shoulders alone. He is, after all, producing remarkable numbers in front of goal. And Guardiola seems focused on other areas of his squad. Last month, he noted that a team that has won four of the last five league titles has lost its edge.“We are far away from the team we had in previous seasons,"" Guardiola said. “Do you think we are going to chase the gap to Arsenal the way we are playing? No way.”With a squad packed with world class players, Guardiola has the luxury of leaving out some of his biggest names in a bid to freshen things up.Phil Foden, one of the brightest young talents in Europe, has been a peripheral figure at times this season. Ruben Dias, voted player of the year in England and the best defender in the Champions League in 2021, has not started a league game since October or any for City since November. Joao Cancelo was loaned to Bayern Munich on transfer deadline day after he was benched in recent weeks.Most peculiar of all, however, was the decision to bench Kevin De Bruyne against Tottenham.Guardiola is known for making unexpected calls, but to leave De Bruyne out of such an important game was a major statement that backfired as City lost 1-0 and missed out on the chance to cut Arsenal's lead to two points.Guardiola seems to be searching for ways to get a reaction out of his squad at a point in the campaign when there is still all to play for. The departure of Cancelo and benching of De Bruyne look like drastic attempts to make his point, but also raise questions about what he will try to do next.Guardiola is into his seventh year at City — he has never stayed at any club so long since becoming a coach. He may now have to oversee his most extensive squad rebuild since first taking over in 2016.That is for the future, though. Right now, City is still in contention to win three trophies.Solving the problems off the field, however, could be much more difficult.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/7,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803313,Leipzig defender Willi Orbán readies for stem-cell donation,"LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) — Leipzig defender Willi Orbán could miss a key game in his team's Bundesliga title challenge because he is taking time out to make a potentially life-saving donation of stem cells to a cancer patient.

            Leipzig said Tuesday that the Hungary international has been on the German donor registry since 2017 and was recently identified as a match for a patient with blood cancer. He will donate cells Wednesday.

            Leipzig said Orbán has been taking injections since Saturday to boost his stem cell count and hasn't trained with the team since Sunday. He is considered doubtful for fourth-place Leipzig's Bundesliga game against second-place Union Berlin on Saturday.











            “Of course I was surprised when I received the info that I was a match. I without a doubt wanted to make the donation as soon as possible. I have the chance to potentially save another person’s life with very little effort. It was a no brainer. I hope my donation will help the recipient to recover from their illness,"" Orbán said in a statement.

He will donate cells Wednesday.Leipzig said Orbán has been taking injections since Saturday to boost his stem cell count and hasn't trained with the team since Sunday. He is considered doubtful for fourth-place Leipzig's Bundesliga game against second-place Union Berlin on Saturday.“Of course I was surprised when I received the info that I was a match. I without a doubt wanted to make the donation as soon as possible. I have the chance to potentially save another person’s life with very little effort. It was a no brainer. I hope my donation will help the recipient to recover from their illness,"" Orbán said in a statement.""I might of course miss the Union game but even with my sporting ambitions, football is of secondary importance.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803315,Court denies aid for Hiroshima A-bomb survivors' children,"TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese court on Tuesday rejected a damage suit filed by a group of children of Hiroshima atomic bombing survivors seeking government support for medical costs, saying the hereditary impact of radiation exposure is still unknown.

            A group of 28 plaintiffs whose parents suffered radiation exposure in the Aug. 6, 1945, U.S. atomic attack were demanding the central government include them in the medical support available to survivors.

            The Hiroshima District Court said the possibility of a hereditary effect from radiation cannot be denied, but there is no established scientific consensus and the government’s exclusion of the plaintiffs from medical support is not unconstitutional.











            The government has insisted there is no scientific evidence showing a hereditary effect from parents’ radiation exposure on their children.

            The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in 2017 seeking 100,000 yen ($760) each from the government in damages, saying their exclusion violated the constitutional right to equality.

            A similar lawsuit by their peers in Nagasaki was also rejected in December.

            The plaintiffs said they plan to appeal Tuesday's decision, which they called “unjust."" 

            “It was an extremely cold ruling,” plaintiff Taku Kakuda told reporters. “It was as if we were told to prove the radiation impact on humans with our bodies.”

            The atomic bombing of Hiroshima destroyed the city and killed 140,000 people. The United States dropped a second bomb three days later on Nagasaki, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and its nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.

            Many survivors of the bombings have lasting injuries and illnesses resulting from the explosions and radiation exposure and have faced discrimination in Japan.

            Their children, known as “hibaku nisei,” or second-generation survivors of atomic bombs, say they constantly worry about the possible hereditary effects of radiation from their parents’ exposure, and many have developed various forms of cancer and other health problems. They estimate their numbers at 300,000 to 500,000.

            Currently, only survivors and those with prenatal exposure who were certified can receive government medical support for their radiation illnesses and cancer checkups. The government started providing free medical checks for their children in 1979 but cancer examinations are not included.

            “We understand that the court acknowledged our argument,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said of Tuesday's ruling.TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese court on Tuesday rejected a damage suit filed by a group of children of Hiroshima atomic bombing survivors seeking government support for medical costs, saying the hereditary impact of radiation exposure is still unknown.A group of 28 plaintiffs whose parents suffered radiation exposure in the Aug. 6, 1945, U.S. atomic attack were demanding the central government include them in the medical support available to survivors.The Hiroshima District Court said the possibility of a hereditary effect from radiation cannot be denied, but there is no established scientific consensus and the government’s exclusion of the plaintiffs from medical support is not unconstitutional.The government has insisted there is no scientific evidence showing a hereditary effect from parents’ radiation exposure on their children.The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in 2017 seeking 100,000 yen ($760) each from the government in damages, saying their exclusion violated the constitutional right to equality.A similar lawsuit by their peers in Nagasaki was also rejected in December.The plaintiffs said they plan to appeal Tuesday's decision, which they called “unjust.""“It was an extremely cold ruling,” plaintiff Taku Kakuda told reporters. “It was as if we were told to prove the radiation impact on humans with our bodies.”The atomic bombing of Hiroshima destroyed the city and killed 140,000 people.

            Biden will use his State of the Union address Tuesday night to outline new steps to tackle illicit drugs, help veterans and cancer patients, and make mental health care more available, according to aides who previewed the details before the speech.

That includes using advanced technology to seize fentanyl at the border and working with commercial delivery companies to intercept packages, among other steps, he said. 

            Biden will ask Congress to reauthorize the National Cancer Act, which was enacted more than a half century ago, to help update U.S. cancer research and care systems.

            The president will address suicide among veterans by helping states and territories invest in community-based programs and expand educational resources. 

            In the area of mental health, particularly for children, Biden will again call on Congress to support banning online advertising targeted to young people and to improve data privacy and transparency across the board.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803329,"Mahomes, Hurts buoy Super Bowl teams amid QB injury spate","It matters that Patrick Mahomes is spectacularly talented, of course. Might matter just as much that he is almost always available for the Kansas City Chiefs. 

            Same goes for the Philadelphia Eagles and Jalen Hurts.

            Those are big reasons the Chiefs and Eagles will meet in the Super Bowl — with AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year finalists Mahomes and Hurts taking the snaps — on Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. Sure, the San Francisco 49ers nearly managed to make it all the way to the championship game with a last-pick-of-the-draft rookie bumped all the way up to starter from No. 3 on the depth chart because of injuries to others. But then Brock Purdy hurt his elbow in the NFC title game at Philadelphia, leaving the Niners to try to rely on journeyman Josh Johnson, until he got a concussion ... meaning Purdy needed to go back in ... despite being unable to throw. 











            “That,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said, “was kind of just hard to stomach.”

            This season revealed, like never before, a glaring amount of instability at quarterback in the NFL, whether because of injury — the reason for nearly half of all changes during the regular season, according to an AP analysis — or poor performance. A total of 68 QBs started at least one game, an average of more than two per team and a record for a non-strike year.

            What’s more: 13 clubs, another high, needed to use at least three starters at the most important position in this, or any, sport. Some even turned to four — with the Arizona Cardinals using that many starting quarterbacks in a span of just four weeks. 

            Quarterback shuffling can go a long way toward altering a team’s trajectory, as the Jets, Titans and Panthers found out on their way to missing the playoffs. The Dolphins made the postseason despite losing Tua Tagovailoa to a series of concussions, then had backup Teddy Bridgewater dislocate his pinky, leaving them with third-string rookie Skylar Thompson and his 18-for-45, two-interception performance in their wild-card elimination.

            “When you, as a defender, see a guy at quarterback who has not played a lot, you are going to lick your chops and you assume he's not going to be in rhythm and you assume he's not going to be ready to go,"" Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott said. “Our coach, Bill Walsh, basically said, ‘Hey, Ronnie, a team's only as good as the backup quarterback, because if the backup quarterback can't come in and do the things he needs to be able to do, a team is going to be in trouble.'""

            And keeping the starter upright is almost always needed for success.

            The top five regular-season teams in the AFC, including the Chiefs, had their No. 1 QB available for every regular-season game (and when Mahomes did leave a playoff game with a bad ankle, Chad Henne came in and delivered, leading a 98-yard TD drive in what turned out to be a seven-point victory). 

            In all, nine of the 14 participants in the postseason never had to turn to a backup QB to start.

            The Eagles came close: Hurts missed two games with a bad shoulder; Philadelphia went 0-2 with Gardner Minshew in his place. 

            Seems obvious: Having your preferred QB1 available week after week makes your offense more likely to succeed. And that makes your team more likely to win. 

            Consider that the passer rating for QBs slated to be starters was about 10 points higher than for replacements. Or look at the Jacksonville Jaguars and Trevor Lawrence: He stuck around for 17 games and closed with five wins in a row — three against the QB-troubled Jets or Titans — to earn a playoff spot.

            “It’s certainly key, just because everybody continues to gel. You get the chemistry together. The receivers know, ‘If I run this route on this step, the ball is going to be thrown to this point, just because we’ve done it a million times,’” Jaguars offensive coordinator Press Taylor said. “You can understand how (an injury absence) throws guys off.” 

            Backup quarterbacks generally get zero practice time with the rest of the first-team offense during the season, so when the top choice at that spot is removed, there can be growing pains. Purdy was an exception, of course, and there have been others.

            “Sometimes when a quarterback goes down,” Cowboys guard Zack Martin said, “there’s kind of a sense of panic in the locker room and on the team, like, ‘What are we going to do?’” 

            Some of the season’s dominant story lines involved sidelined QBs, from Miami’s Tagovailoa to Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson to the reigning Super Bowl champion Rams’ Matthew Stafford, or efforts via officiating to protect them, whether the outcry among defenders over roughing-the-passer calls or the 15-yard penalty on Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai for shoving an out-of-bounds Mahomes that helped KC get into position for the winning field goal in the AFC title game. 

            Lowering the number of quarterback injuries is “obviously a major priority for us,” said Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations. “It's critical that we examine ... where they’re coming from. Are they legal hits? Are they in the pocket? Out of the pocket?”

            Increased impatience when it comes to wins and losses accounts for some of the switching — the same sort of itchiness that leads to first-year coaches getting fired. 

            But it seems to always come back to injuries. 

            One potential cause: Rushing attempts by signal-callers reached a record high (2,309) and were also at their most per game, up 47% from 2012. That increases the opportunities to get hurt. Another: The 1,297 total sacks around the NFL were the third most ever and the average of 4.8 per game was the third-highest over the last nine years. (As an aside, Mahomes and Hurts might want to watch out on Super Sunday: The Eagles ranked No. 1, the Chiefs No. 2, in sacks.)

            It's certainly possible, or at least plausible, that whatever the NFL does to try to keep quarterbacks safe isn’t working — and, truly, can't work.

            “At this point, you’re hoping,” Lott said, “your quarterback can withstand the pounding.”

            The 49ers under Shanahan are Exhibit A: The team kept one quarterback healthy only once in his six seasons — in 2019, when they just so happened to reach the Super Bowl.

            They went through at least three starters in four of the last six seasons; this time, Trey Lance broke an ankle while running in Week 2 and Jimmy Garoppolo broke his foot on a sack in Week 13.

            “It’s awesome,” star tight end George Kittle said sarcastically. “It’s an experience. I just have a plethora of quarterbacks to choose from.”

            The rash of injuries for the 49ers and others raises the question of whether the league should bring back some form of the 1991-2010 rule that let teams have a third QB in uniform who would not count against the game-day roster limit and would be available in an emergency.

            “We were scared to death when that rule ended, but you kind of forget about it, since you just don’t see anyone have to go through it,” Shanahan said. “But then you get reminded of how quickly a football game is over once that happens.”

            The NFL’s Vincent said there have been “multiple discussions” about restoring the third quarterback rule, and the general manager advisory committee “is considering” putting it before the full membership.

            “What you don't want is Christian McCaffrey playing quarterback,"" Lott said, referring to the 49ers' do-everything running back. ""With all due respect — he's a hell of an athlete, but he needs to be where he is most effective, and that is running and catching the ball, not playing quarterback.”

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLIt matters that Patrick Mahomes is spectacularly talented, of course. Might matter just as much that he is almost always available for the Kansas City Chiefs.Same goes for the Philadelphia Eagles and Jalen Hurts.Those are big reasons the Chiefs and Eagles will meet in the Super Bowl — with AP NFL MVP and Offensive Player of the Year finalists Mahomes and Hurts taking the snaps — on Sunday in Glendale, Arizona. Sure, the San Francisco 49ers nearly managed to make it all the way to the championship game with a last-pick-of-the-draft rookie bumped all the way up to starter from No. 3 on the depth chart because of injuries to others. But then Brock Purdy hurt his elbow in the NFC title game at Philadelphia, leaving the Niners to try to rely on journeyman Josh Johnson, until he got a concussion ... meaning Purdy needed to go back in ... despite being unable to throw.“That,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said, “was kind of just hard to stomach.”This season revealed, like never before, a glaring amount of instability at quarterback in the NFL, whether because of injury — the reason for nearly half of all changes during the regular season, according to an AP analysis — or poor performance. A total of 68 QBs started at least one game, an average of more than two per team and a record for a non-strike year.What’s more: 13 clubs, another high, needed to use at least three starters at the most important position in this, or any, sport. Some even turned to four — with the Arizona Cardinals using that many starting quarterbacks in a span of just four weeks.Quarterback shuffling can go a long way toward altering a team’s trajectory, as the Jets, Titans and Panthers found out on their way to missing the playoffs. The Dolphins made the postseason despite losing Tua Tagovailoa to a series of concussions, then had backup Teddy Bridgewater dislocate his pinky, leaving them with third-string rookie Skylar Thompson and his 18-for-45, two-interception performance in their wild-card elimination.“When you, as a defender, see a guy at quarterback who has not played a lot, you are going to lick your chops and you assume he's not going to be in rhythm and you assume he's not going to be ready to go,"" Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott said. “Our coach, Bill Walsh, basically said, ‘Hey, Ronnie, a team's only as good as the backup quarterback, because if the backup quarterback can't come in and do the things he needs to be able to do, a team is going to be in trouble.'""And keeping the starter upright is almost always needed for success.The top five regular-season teams in the AFC, including the Chiefs, had their No. 1 QB available for every regular-season game (and when Mahomes did leave a playoff game with a bad ankle, Chad Henne came in and delivered, leading a 98-yard TD drive in what turned out to be a seven-point victory).In all, nine of the 14 participants in the postseason never had to turn to a backup QB to start.The Eagles came close: Hurts missed two games with a bad shoulder; Philadelphia went 0-2 with Gardner Minshew in his place.Seems obvious: Having your preferred QB1 available week after week makes your offense more likely to succeed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803330,Study: 15 million people live under threat of glacial floods,"As glaciers melt and pour massive amounts of water into nearby lakes, 15 million people across the globe live under the threat of a sudden and deadly outburst flood, a new study finds.

            More than half of those living in the shadow of the disaster called glacial lake outburst floods are in just four countries: India, Pakistan, Peru and China, according to a study in Tuesday’s Nature Communications. A second study, awaiting publication in a peer-reviewed journal, catalogs more than 150 glacial flood outbursts in history and recent times. 

            It's a threat Americans and Europeans rarely think about, but 1 million people live within just 6 miles (10 kilometers) of potentially unstable glacial-fed lakes, the study calculated.











            One of the more devastating floods was in Peru in 1941 and it killed between 1,800 and 6,000 people. A 2020 glacial lake outburst flood in British Columbia, Canada, caused a tsunami of water about 330 feet (100 meters) high, but no one was hurt. A 2017 glacial outburst flood in Nepal, triggered by a landslide, was captured on video by German climbers. Alaska’s Mendenhall glacier has had annual small glacial outburst floods in what the National Weather Service calls “suicide basin,” since 2011, according to study lead author Caroline Taylor, a researcher at Newcastle University in the United Kingdom.

            Heavy rains and a glacial lake outburst flood combined in 2013 in India to kill thousands of people. A 2021 deadly flood in India that was initially attributed to a glacial lake outburst wasn’t caused by one, studies later found.

            Scientists say so far it doesn’t seem like climate change has made those floods more frequent, but as glaciers shrink with warming, the amount of water in the lakes grows, making them more dangerous in those rare situations when dams burst.

            “We had glacier lake outburst floods in the past that have killed many many thousands of people in a single catastrophic flooding event,” said study co-author Tom Robinson, a disaster risk scientist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. “And with climate change glaciers are melting so these lakes are getting bigger, potentially getting more unstable.”

            Dan Shugar, a geoscientist at the University of Calgary who wasn't part of the two studies, said much of the threat depends simply on how many people live in a glacial flood zone.

            “In a warming world we certainly expect more and larger glacial lakes,” Shugar said in an email. “But the threat that these lakes might pose critically depends on where people are living and what their vulnerabilities might be.""

            Robinson said what’s different about his study is that it’s the first to look at the climate, geography, population, vulnerability and all these factors to get “a good overview of where in the world is the most dangerous places'' for all 1,089 glacial basins.

            At the top of the list is Khyber Pakhtunkhwa basin in Pakistan, north of Islamabad.

            “That’s particularly bad,” Robinson said. “Lots of people and they’re very, very vulnerable” because they live in a valley below the lake.

            The trouble is that scientists are focusing too much attention on the Pakistan, India, China and the Himalayas, often called High Mountain Asia, and somewhat ignoring the Andes, Robinson said. The second and third highest risk basins are in Peru's Santa basin, and Bolivia's Beni basin, the paper said.

            After the deadly Andes flood in the 1940s that region “was sort of a leader” in working on glacial flood outburst threats, but in the last decade or so, High Mountain Asia has taken over because of the high population, said University of Dayton geology professor Umesh Haritashya, who wasn’t part of the studies.

            India ranks high in the threat list not so much because of the physical setup but because of “a huge number of people downstream.”

            Three lake basins in the United States and Canada rank high for threats, from the Pacific Northwest to Alaska, but aren’t nearly as high as areas in Asia and the Andes with few people in the danger zone. They are in Alaska's Kenai Peninsula — distinct from the Mendenhall glacier near Juneau — northeast Washington and west central British Columbia.

            “This ranking is a good checklist for further research,” said Oliver Korup of the University of Potsdam in Germany, who co-authored the list of glacial lake outburst floods.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803331,"Newborn, toddler saved from rubble in quake-hit Syrian town","JINDERIS, Syria (AP) — Residents digging through a collapsed building in a northwest Syrian town discovered a crying infant whose mother appears to have given birth to her while buried underneath the rubble from this week’s devastating earthquake, relatives and a doctor said Tuesday.

            The newborn girl’s umbilical cord was still connected to her mother, Afraa Abu Hadiya, who was dead, they said. The baby was the only member of her family to survive from the building collapse Monday in the small town of Jinderis, next to the Turkish border, Ramadan Sleiman, a relative, told The Associated Press.

            Monday’s pre-dawn 7.8 magnitude earthquake, followed by multiple aftershocks, caused widespread destruction across southern Turkey and northern Syria. Thousands have been killed, with the toll mounting as more bodies are discovered. But dramatic rescues have also occurred. Elsewhere in Jinderis, a young girl was found alive, buried in concrete under the wreckage of her home. 











            The newborn baby was rescued Monday afternoon, more than 10 hours after the quake struck. After rescuers dug her out, a female neighbor cut the cord, and she and others rushed with the baby to a children’s hospital in the nearby town of Afrin, where she has been kept on an incubator, said the doctor treating the baby, Dr. Hani Maarouf. 

            Video of the rescue circulating on social media shows the moments after the baby was removed from the rubble, as a man lifts her up, her umbilical cord still dangling, and rushes away as another man throws him a blanket to wrap her in. 

            The baby’s body temperature had fallen to 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) and she had bruises, including a large one on her back, but she is in stable condition, he said. 

            Abu Hadiya must have been conscious during the birth and must have died soon after, Maarouf said. He estimated the baby was born several hours before being found, given the amount her temperature had dropped. If the girl had been born just before the quake, she wouldn’t have survived so many hours in the cold, he said. 

            “Had the girl been left for an hour more, she would have died,” he said. 

            When the earthquake hit before dawn on Monday, Abu Hadiya, her husband and four children apparently tried to rush out of their apartment building, but the structure collapsed on them. Their bodies were found near the building’s entrance, said Sleiman, who arrived at the scene just after the newborn was discovered.

            “She was found in front of her mother’s legs,” he said. “After the dust and rocks were removed the girl was found alive.” 

            Maarouf said the baby weighed 3.175 kilograms (7 pounds), an average weight for a newborn, and so was carried nearly to term. “Our only concern is the bruise on her back, and we have to see whether there is any problem with her spinal cord,” he said, saying she has been moving her legs and arms normally. 

            Jinderis, located in the rebel-held enclave of northwest Syria, was hard hit in the quake, with dozens of buildings that collapsed. 

            Abu Hadiya and her family were among the millions of Syrians who fled to the rebel-held territory from other parts of the country. They were originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured their village, said a relative who identified himself as Saleh al-Badran. 

            In 2018, the family moved to Jinderis after the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, an umbrella for several insurgent groups, captured the town from U.S.-backed Kurdish led fighters, Sleiman said. 

            On Tuesday, Abu Hadiya and the girl’s father Abdullah Turki Mleihan, along with their four other children were laid to rest in a cemetery on the outskirts of Jinderis. 

            Back inside the town, rescue operations were still ongoing in their building hoping to find survivors.

            The town saw another dramatic rescue Monday evening, when a toddler was pulled alive from the wreckage of a collapsed building. Video from the White Helmets, the emergency service in the region, shows a rescuer digging through crushed concrete amid twisted metal until the little girl, named Nour, appeared. The girl, still half buried, looks up dazedly as they tell her, “Dad is here, don’t be scared. … Talk to your dad, talk.” 

            A rescuer cradled her head in his hands and tenderly wiped dust from around her eyes before she was pulled out. 

            The quake has wreaked new devastation in the opposition-held zone, centered on the Syrian province of Idlib, which was already been battered by years of war and strained by the influx of displaced people from the country’s civil war, which began in 2011.

            Monday’s earthquake killed hundreds across the area, and the toll was continually mounting with hundreds believed still lost under the rubble. The quake completely or partially toppled more than 730 buildings and damaged thousands more in the territory, according to the White Helmets, as the area’s civil defense is known.

            The White Helmets have years of experience in digging victims out from buildings crushed by bombardment from Russian warplanes or Syrian government forces. An earthquake is a new disaster for them. 

            “They are both catastrophes — a catastrophe that has been ongoing for 12 years and the criminal has not been held accountable, and this one is a natural catastrophe,” said the deputy head of the White Helmets, Munir Mustafa.

            Asked if there was a difference between rescue work in the quake and during the war, he said, “We cannot compare death with death … What we are witnessing today is death on top of death.”

They were originally from the village of Khsham in eastern Deir el-Zour province, but left in 2014 after the Islamic State group captured their village, said a relative who identified himself as Saleh al-Badran.In 2018, the family moved to Jinderis after the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, an umbrella for several insurgent groups, captured the town from U.S.-backed Kurdish led fighters, Sleiman said.On Tuesday, Abu Hadiya and the girl’s father Abdullah Turki Mleihan, along with their four other children were laid to rest in a cemetery on the outskirts of Jinderis.Back inside the town, rescue operations were still ongoing in their building hoping to find survivors.The town saw another dramatic rescue Monday evening, when a toddler was pulled alive from the wreckage of a collapsed building. Video from the White Helmets, the emergency service in the region, shows a rescuer digging through crushed concrete amid twisted metal until the little girl, named Nour, appeared. The girl, still half buried, looks up dazedly as they tell her, “Dad is here, don’t be scared. … Talk to your dad, talk.”A rescuer cradled her head in his hands and tenderly wiped dust from around her eyes before she was pulled out.The quake has wreaked new devastation in the opposition-held zone, centered on the Syrian province of Idlib, which was already been battered by years of war and strained by the influx of displaced people from the country’s civil war, which began in 2011.Monday’s earthquake killed hundreds across the area, and the toll was continually mounting with hundreds believed still lost under the rubble. The quake completely or partially toppled more than 730 buildings and damaged thousands more in the territory, according to the White Helmets, as the area’s civil defense is known.The White Helmets have years of experience in digging victims out from buildings crushed by bombardment from Russian warplanes or Syrian government forces. An earthquake is a new disaster for them.“They are both catastrophes — a catastrophe that has been ongoing for 12 years and the criminal has not been held accountable, and this one is a natural catastrophe,” said the deputy head of the White Helmets, Munir Mustafa.Asked if there was a difference between rescue work in the quake and during the war, he said, “We cannot compare death with death … What we are witnessing today is death on top of death.”___Mroue reported from Beirut.",2023/2/8,,World

            “I can confirm that they have been rearrested on the instructions of NPA (the National Prosecutions Authority). I am not sure of the charges though,” immigration spokesman Namati Nshinka told The Associated Press.

            Zambian officials prevented the eight Croatians — four couples — from boarding a flight to leave the southern African country. On Monday a court dismissed child trafficking charges against them following applications by their lawyers. They had earlier pleaded not guilty.











            The charges alleged that on December 7, last year, the four couples acted together to traffic the children. The young children were from neighboring Congo and the couples said they adopted the children through a lawyer.

            The eight include Zoran Subosic, 52, a guitarist in a well-known band Hladno Pivo, or Cold Beer, and Immovic Subosic, 41, an administrator, according to Croatian media. Others include Damir Magic, 44, an electrical technician, Nadic Magic, 45, a technician, Ladislav Persic, 42, a medical doctor, Aleksandra Persic, 43, a hair salon attendant, Noah Kraljevic, 40, a program director and Ivona Kraljevic, 36, a dog handler.

            In Croatia, that country’s foreign ministry said on Monday that the four couples were told to leave Zambia within 48 hours.

""These changes will focus teams on the issues that will build a better future for our children and grandchildren.""His spokesperson said Tuesday's adjustments might not offer a ""silver bullet"" to all Britain's problems, but it would help the PM deliver his agenda.jsi/rt (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/2/7,,

Belgian police also said they discovered 20 alleged victims of trafficking, all Chinese, during the raids across Belgian cities of Antwerp, Charleroi, Louvain, Neufchateau and Brussels.Prosecutors said there were aware about the increasing presence of Chinese sex workers in Belgium.They said the criminal organization they were probing allegedly recruited women in China and had them travel to Europe, where they were ""sexually exploited, mostly in private prostitution."" The women were forced to give up most of their earnings as well, prosecutors said.The alleged members of the prostitution ring used online websites to offer sex, while clients booked appointments with the women there. They booked online rentals like hotels or vacation homes for sex trafficking.The women were also ""often moved around Europe"" and many of the women were without valid European residency papers, which ""increased their dependency"" on the organization, the office said.The criminal organization earned large sums of money and transferred it abroad through legal and illegal channels, according to the office.Some of the victims found by the police on Tuesday were sheltered in a specialized reception centers, prosecutors said.The European Union's Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, or Eurojust, and the European Union's law enforcement agency, or Europol, were part of the investigation as well.rm/rt (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/2/7,,

All of them had one concern in mind: the fates of those caught in the earthquake on the Turkish-Syrian border.""Everyone who had something at home packed it in a car and came here,"" Kesginlikimiloglu said.Eight vans were already on their way to Turkey, Kesginlikimiloglu said, with more possibly joining along the way from other German cities.""Even if we're 4,000 kilometers away, we can do something good for those impacted by the earthquake,"" he said, adding that he does not know anyone personally in the affected region, but he knows many who do.""It wasn't easy, but in the end I was able to reach my sister in Kayseri,"" Gökay Sofuoglu, the head of the Turkish Community in Germany, told DW. Although not at the center of the quake, ""it was difficult enough. How much more desperate it must be for those in Kahramanmaras or Malatya.""Many people are now trying to fly to Turkey to personally look for loved ones, he added, but the flights are booked out. Meanwhile, the rapid and large response to help those in need is welcome.""The people there need health products, blankets and sleeping bags,"" Sofuoglu said.That need will persist long after the media attention wanes, which is a concern for Sofuoglu, who said he is helping organize long-term aid for those who ""lost everything.""There is precedent for this. After a devastating earthquake rocked northwestern Turkey in 1999, a benefactor program was established that connected people in Germany with victims in Turkey. Money flowed in every month.For now though, the immediate concern is finding loved ones, which has led some families in Germany to turn their attention to political action. Calls are pouring in to elected officials.""Many people are telling me that they’ve already lost relatives and they are under the rubble,"" Hakan Demir, a lawmaker in the Bundestag, the German parliament, told DW. ""They are understandably hysterical and begging that Germany, that we as the Bundestag and the federal government, act fast.""The first, official response, Demir said, came in the form of 20 tons of goods along with rescue assistance.""We are of course in close contact with Turkey and the large community here with roots in Turkey, who have relatives there,"" he added.While this time it's personal for many of the volunteers, Kesginlikimiloglu in Stuttgart said it is just part of a spirit of helping those in need. He and others in the Turkish community have responded to other humanitarian crises, he said, such as the floods in western Germany in 2021 or refugees who have fled the war in Ukraine.For him and many others, he added, it will be another long night loading vans in the commercial parking lot.This article was originally written in German.",2023/2/7,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803341,Turkey issues fewer visas for Russians,"""In recent years, we had often thought about buying an apartment in Turkey that we could rent out and use for our own vacation in the summer. But we were undecided. When this all suddenly started, we realized the moment had come,"" said Nikita [name changed], a 36-year-old computer scientist, who works for an international IT company.He and his wife, who are both from Vladivostok in eastern Russia, had initially set money aside to move to the capital, Moscow. But when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a partial mobilization in September for the war against Ukraine, they changed their plans and opted for Turkey instead.They bought an apartment in the coastal city of Antalya for $65,000 (€59,600). ""We furnished it from scratch, bought good household appliances, and fixed a few structural defects,"" Nikita said. The move from Russia to Turkey cost them around $80,000 altogether.In September, Nikita applied for a residence permit, which would allow him to stay in Turkey for at least one year, with the freedom to leave and reenter the country. At the end of January, however, he heard that his application had been rejected. No reason was given.""I'm ready to accept the fact that Russians are considered toxic all over the world now. I know which side is in the right. But the rules of the game need to be clear, at least. Now I've bought an apartment and I can't live in it,"" he said indignantly.He was told that he had to leave Turkey within 10 days, leaving him without enough time to sell the apartment. It's still unclear whether his wife will be granted a residence permit.""Returning to Russia is not an option. But we have to do something. Maybe we'll leave the apartment behind for now and go to another country,"" said Nikita, who intends to appeal the rejection.So far, it's been the case that those who buy real estate in Turkey usually get a residence permit without a problem, which suggests that Nikita's case is unusual. Many Russians have obtained residence permits in Turkey after showing their rental contract, and providing health insurance documentation and proof of income.Until last October, Russian citizens made up the largest group of foreigners being issued Turkish residence permits. A total of 153,000 Russians were given a permit in 2022, 132,000 of which were for tourist purposes.However, since the end of December, more and more rejections have been reported in different Turkish cities. Precise statistics are not available, however, and when DW requested them from the relevant Turkish authorities, it did not receive a response.Some Russians in Turkey have gathered data from a Telegram chat, according to which there have been more than 250 rejections since the end of December, with slightly more than 100 permits approved.""Lots of people are being rejected, but there are approvals as well. The reasons and criteria are unclear. Official explanations have not been given,"" said Eva Rapoport, the coordinator of The Ark, a project that helps Russian emigrants.Margarita Polyakova, a lawyer and head of the Istanbul-based consulting firm New Days Agency, confirmed that the number of rejections has increased. However, she said this has been happening ever since the summer, particularly in Antalya, a city especially popular with Russians.In an interview last spring, Polyakova said that she backed Putin's decision to go to war against Ukraine. Now, however, she said she won't take sides and is focused on helping people who are suffering from the impact of the conflict.She said that since July, Turkey has added another 1,169 places to the list of areas where residence permits can no longer be issued on the basis of rental contracts. The reason is that, in these areas, foreign residents constitute more than 20% of the local population.""Previously, citizens of Central Asian countries were more likely to be rejected. In December, this trend started affecting Russians as well,"" said Polyakova. However, she pointed out that the increase in the number of rejections can also partly be explained by the increased number of applications.Meanwhile, Turkish media, quoting the authorities, report that the rules and checks for issuing a residence permit have been tightened.""A residence permit for tourist purposes used to be a sort of substitute for a long-term visa in Turkey. Now it's only intended for a short stay, up to a maximum of one year,"" said Polyakova.She believes the authorities in different regions are making different decisions, but that the Turkish state wants to take in fewer migrants overall. ""There will be elections in Turkey in May, and it's clear that the president is making decisions that are popular with the people, such as reducing rents, for example,"" she said.Anyone who stays in Turkey longer than permitted must pay a fine on leaving the country. And those who enter the country by car from Russia are asked to pay twice. Depending on how long they stay in Turkey, they may incur fines of up to $7,000.This article was originally published in Russian.",2023/2/5,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803345,Super Bowl backup QBs have shined from Hostetler to Foles,"Brock Purdy's bid to join the select group of quarterbacks to go from a backup for most of the season to a Super Bowl starter got derailed when he suffered his own injury in the NFC championship game.

            Purdy's elbow injury helped contribute to San Francisco's 31-7 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles that set the stage for a Super Bowl matchup of first and second team All-Pro quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts instead of another improbable story. 

            There have been several examples of backups leading a team to the big game with the most recent coming in the 2017 season when Nick Foles took over in Philadelphia for the final three games of the regular season after Carson Wentz got hurt.











            Foles struggled at first before a storybook finish, becoming the only QB ever to throw for at least 350 yards and three TDs in the conference title game and Super Bowl in the same season to outduel Tom Brady for the championship with a 41-33 win. 

            “I wasn’t worrying about the scoreboard, I wasn’t worrying about the time, I was just playing ball,” Foles said after that game. “I think sometimes you start worrying about that too much, it starts creeping in your brain. I was just playing."" 

            Foles was the 14th quarterback to start the Super Bowl after not holding that role for the season opener, including Brady (2016) and Ben Roethlisberger (2010), who were suspended to start those seasons. The others fall into a few categories.

            There were those who seized the job early in the season such as Jake Delhomme did for Carolina when he replaced Rodney Peete at halftime of the 2003 season opener; Brady when he stepped in for an injured Drew Bledsoe in Week 3 in 2001; and Joe Kapp, who replaced Gary Cuozzo for Minnesota in the second game in 1969.

            Then there were teams looking for a midseason jolt that turned into Super Bowl wins. Roger Staubach shared time with Craig Morton in 1971 before taking over for good midway through the year to launch a Hall of Fame career with his first Super Bowl win. 

            Three years later, Terry Bradshaw began the season on the bench behind Joe Gilliam before taking over as starter in Week 7, then winning the first of four Super Bowl titles. Trent Dilfer then stepped in for Tony Banks midway through the 2000 season for Baltimore, lost his first start and then won 11 in a row behind a dominant defense.

            There were two other cases of injuries leading to changes before the stretch run, with Jim Plunkett stepping in for Dan Pastorini in 1980 in Oakland; and Colin Kaepernick doing the same in San Francisco after Alex Smith had a concussion in 2012.

            Purdy was trying to join the group to make the Super Bowl after starting five or fewer games in the regular season alongside the Rams' Vince Ferragamo (1979), Washington’s Doug Williams (1987), the Giants' Jeff Hostetler (1990) and Foles (2017).

            Hostetler had started just two games in almost seven full seasons for the Giants when Phil Simms injured his foot in Week 14. After starting that season with 10 straight wins, the Giants lost three out of four and were mostly written off as a contender when Simms got hurt.

            “Everyone had jumped off the bandwagon,” Hostetler recalled in 2018. “We were completely shot as a team. That was the outside looking in. Inside where we were at, we just rallied the wagons. It was us versus the world. We just rallied around each other and it showed.""

            When he stepped in for Simms in December, Hostetler had thrown 93 passes since entering the NFL in 1984. Hostetler managed to lead the Giants to two wins to end the regular season, a lopsided playoff opener over Chicago, then upsets over two-time defending champion San Francisco in the NFC title game (15-13 on five field goals) and Buffalo (20-19) in the Super Bowl.

            Williams had much more experience when he made his playoff run, having started 67 games for Tampa Bay before going to the USFL. 

            He returned to the NFL in 1986 and started only two games for Washington when Joe Gibbs made the switch midway through the final regular season game because Jay Schroeder had been struggling because of a lingering shoulder injury.

            “I never was a backup, so the mentality was a lot different,” Williams recalled in 2018. “Even coming to Washington as the backup, I had a backup position with a starter’s mentality. That’s how I always looked at it.”

            Williams played that way in the postseason. He helped overcome a 14-point deficit in wind chill of minus-20 degrees in Chicago against the mighty Bears defense in the division round before throwing two TDs to beat the Vikings again at home in the NFC title game.

            Williams then put together an historic performance in the Super Bowl, leading five TD drives in 18 plays in the second quarter of a 42-10 win over Denver in San Diego. Williams threw for 340 yards and four TD passes on a gimpy knee to win MVP honors.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803346,Vote to block Georgia spaceport upheld by state's high court,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Georgia's highest court Tuesday upheld an election in which coastal residents voted overwhelmingly last year to block their county government from building a launchpad for blasting commercial rockets into space.

            The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal challenge by Camden County commissioners who sought to have the referendum last March declared invalid. The officials argued Georgia's state constitution doesn’t allow citizens to veto decisions of county governments.

            The court strongly disagreed, ruling that the state constitution’s language “plainly grants repeal and amendment powers to the electorate” over county ordinances and resolutions. The opinion by Justice Carla Wong McMillian said the county’s reading of the same provisions “would violate well established tenets of constitutional interpretation.”











            The court's ruling could be the final blow for Camden County's pet economic development project. Elected commissioners for the county of 55,000 residents at the Georgia-Florida line have spent the past decade and more than $11 million seeking to build Spaceport Camden. They say the project would bring economic growth not just from rocket launches, but also by attracting related industries and tourists.

            Opponents say the project poses potential environmental and safety hazards that outweigh any economic benefits. The county planned to build the spaceport on an industrial plot formerly used to manufacture pesticides and munitions. 

            The proposed flight path would send rockets over Little Cumberland Island, which has about 40 private homes, and neighboring Cumberland Island, a federally protected wilderness visited by about 60,000 tourists each year. Residents and the  National Park Service have said they fear explosive misfires raining fiery debris could spark wildfires near homes and people. 

            In March, opponents forced a referendum on the project after gathering more than 3,500 petition signatures from registered voters saying they wanted the spaceport on the ballot. 

            The result was a big defeat for the spaceport. The final tally showed 72% of voters sided with halting the project by overruling commissioners’ prior decision to buy land for the spaceport.

            Despite the project's defeat at the polls, county officials had tried to keep the project moving forward while their legal challenge was pending before the state Supreme Court. 

            The owner of the 4,000-acre (1,600 hectare) site on which the county planned to build the launchpad announced in July — four months after the referendum — it was no longer offering the property to the county. Camden County commissioners then filed suit, seeking to force the landowner to sell.

            County commissioners said in a statement they respect the court's decision. 

            “The future of Spaceport Camden remains a decision of the Camden County Board of Commissioners and as such will be discussed at a future meeting,” the commissioners' statement said.

            Jim Goodman, a spaceport opponent who was elected last year to a seat on the county commission, said he's hopeful the court ruling will finally persuade his fellow commissioners to give up on a spaceport funded and operated by Camden County. 

             “I don’t know that there’s any appetite on the part of the county board, but there would probably be some tarring and feathering if they tried to do it,” Goodman said. ""I think the citizens have finally woken up and had enough.”

            However, Goodman said he suspects county officials might seek a private developer to take over the spaceport project.

            The legal issues before the Georgia Supreme Court had nothing to do with job growth or safety. Instead, they involved how much power the state’s constitution gives people to overrule decisions made by their county governments.

            The Georgia constitution lays out a means for citizens to call special elections to make “amendments to or repeals of (county) ordinances, resolutions, or regulations.” To force a referendum, citizens must collect petition signatures from at least 10% of a county’s registered voters.

            Attorneys for Camden County unsuccessfully argued the state constitution restricts the scope of those elections, only allowing voters to alter powers and responsibilities delegated to county governments by state law.

            The Association County Commissioners of Georgia, which represents elected officials across the state’s 159 counties, joined Camden County in challenging the referendum. Both Camden County and the association said allowing voters to directly overturn decisions of county officials could lead to instances of a single issue being repeatedly approved by a county and then repealed by voters. 

            The Supreme Court dismissed that argument in its ruling, saying: “There is little evidence that such a parade of horribles would occur, given that a county’s governing authority, which is comprised of elected officials, would be unlikely to routinely disregard the will of the electorate.”

            Both sides in the spaceport battle acknowledged that the citizen referendum power has rarely been used in Georgia. 

            Lawyers for spaceport critics who gathered signatures calling for the referendum noted it took roughly two years until enough people had signed their petition to force a vote on the project.SAVANNAH, Ga.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803348,Ballance's historic innings rallies Zimbabwe against Windies,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Gary Ballance became only the second men's cricketer to hit a test hundred for two countries as his unbeaten 137 helped Zimbabwe avoid the follow on against the West Indies on Tuesday.

            Ballance, playing his first test for Zimbabwe after his last for England in 2017, anchored his new side to 379-9 declared, conceding 68 runs on the first innings late on the fourth day.

            The Zimbabweans gave themselves 13 overs to attack the West Indies but openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Tagenarine Chanderpaul were as resolute in reaching stumps at 21 without loss as they were in their stand of 336 in the first innings.











            Ballance went in at 114-3 and watched four teammates dismissed in the days first 12 overs.

            At 192-7 and the tail exposed, Zimbabwe was in jeopardy of having to follow on. It needed 56 more runs.

            Ballance and allrounder Brandon Mavuta combined for 135 to turn around Zimbabwe's mindset from survival into attack. It declared to match West Indies' declaration to try and force a result, though a draw is more likely on the flat pitch with too much time lost to rain.

            “It's a positive move, a positive declaration,” Ballance said. ”We are trying to put ourselves on the front foot to win. That's what the coach want us to play, to play positive.""

            His 42-test career with England petered out nearly six years ago, and Ballance was caught up in the Yorkshire racism scandal. He admitted and apologized for using a racist term against Azeem Rafiq and ended his county contract early.

            He returned to his homeland, and made his Zimbabwe debut in Twenty20s and one-day internationals last month.

            In his first test innings for Zimbabwe, Ballance played a measured innings and didn’t attack at the beginning, showing great poise to hold the innings together. 

            He reached the fifth hundred of his career with a six over point off left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie, and joined Kepler Wessels, formerly of Australia and South Africa, as the only batters to hit test ton for different countries.

            Ballance also became the highest scorer on test debut for Zimbabwe, eclipsing coach and former captain Dave Houghton, to whom he is related. Houghton made 121 in Zimbabwe's maiden test in 1992 against India in Harare.

            “I can't even describe how proud I am, firstly to represent Zimbabwe, and secondly to get the hundred,” Ballance said.

            ""It's been amazing (to play for Zimbabwe). Every single coach, every single player, has been welcoming. I have played with some of the players before, but it makes a difference to come into a new team and be welcome. It makes it easier to perform.”

            On playing tests for different countries, he said, “It's a different feeling. For England, it was a feeling of achievement, while for Zimbabwe, it's also achievement, and a matter of pride.”

            Mavuta rallied with Ballance in their key century stand, scoring 56. Playing in his first test in five years, Mavuta, after taking a maiden five-for on Monday, saw his career-best score ended when he was bowled playing across the line to a short Jason Holder delivery.

            The West Indies used nine bowlers to try and dismiss Zimbabwe. Fast bowler Alzarri Joseph was the pick with 3-75.

            Joseph said they still hoped to win the test.

            “We have a full day of cricket left,” he said. ""The wicket is flat, it should be a batting day (on Wednesday). But we will try to win.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803349,Shooting at Nebraska Target highlights gaps in gun laws,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — In the last three years of his life, Joseph Jones was repeatedly sent to psychiatric hospitals because of his schizophrenia and delusions that a drug cartel was after him. The Nebraska man once lay down on a highway in Kansas because he wanted to be run over by a truck, but officers tackled him as he ran in front of vehicles. Time and time again, his family and the police took away his guns.

Once a deputy returned a Glock pistol to him, while another time a sheriff's department confiscated his gun, although keeping it raised questions. Last month, Jones opened fire in an Omaha Target store using a legally purchased AR-15 rifle. No one was hit by Jones' gunfire, but police shot and killed the 32-year-old as shoppers fled in panic.

            The episode demonstrates how gun laws fail to keep firearms out of the hands of deeply troubled people, despite a national effort to pass red-flag laws in recent years. 











            Mental health experts say most people with mental illness are not violent and that they are far more likely to be victims of violent crime. Access to firearms is a big part of the problem.

            “For him to be allowed to buy a firearm, there’s no excuse for it,” Jones' uncle, Larry Derksen Jr., said. “It was just inevitable that something was going to happen.""

            In August 2021, a deputy was called because Derksen didn't want to return a gun to his nephew, who had just been released from a psychiatric hospital. Derksen said Jones was paranoid, had been hearing voices, and had traveled through several states fearing a cartel was chasing him, according to a Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office incident report.

            But Jones told the deputy that he was taking medication, he felt fine and had no plans to hurt anyone. The gun was clean, and the only conviction Jones had was for a DUI after he collided with another vehicle on his way home from a bar years earlier.

            “I had no reason,” the deputy wrote in the report, “to believe Joseph could not possess a firearm.”

            Nebraska isn't among the 19 states with a red-flag law. Also known as extreme risk protection orders, they’re intended to restrict the purchase of guns or temporarily remove them from people who may hurt themselves or someone else. 

            A red-flag law has been proposed for Nebraska this year, but it hasn’t received a legislative hearing yet. 

            “This is a kind of example screaming out for an extreme risk protection order,” said Kris Brown, the president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “It actually breaks my heart that that did not happen here.”

            Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.

            But it sets what Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives spokesman John Ham described as a “very high bar.” In order for someone's name to be submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, they must undergo a hearing in which they are deemed unable to take care of their personal business because of mental illness. 

            The law describes it as being “adjudicated as a mental defective."" Every state has a different process, but the multiple three-day involuntary commitments that Jones' family and law enforcement records described didn't trigger such a hearing.

            A couple of years ago, Jones’ family was so desperate that they considered going through the process. They are familiar with some of the court processes because Jones’ mother also has schizophrenia, is low functioning and had to be committed to a group home. 

            But they decided not to pursue that because they were able to persuade law enforcement to intervene and get Jones into a mental hospital. 

            In November 2021, the family reported that Jones was threatening his grandmother and asking for a handgun that his uncle was storing so he could kill himself, according to a report from the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office. 

            His grandmother, who was so frightened that she hid, told deputies that her grandson would “be fine for a few days” but then would “take a turn for the worse” as he resumed drinking and using the unregulated plant-based painkiller kratom, and possibly other drugs.

            Deputies handcuffed Jones and took him to a hospital for evaluation. Derksen said the family thought the hospitalization would have the same effect as going through a formal hearing. Doctors can initiate the hearing process, but there is no record that any did, said Bonnie Moore, chief deputy Sarpy County attorney.

            At that time, Derksen asked the deputies to take the handgun into safekeeping. Sarpy County Sheriff Jeff Davis said his department never returned the gun, although Jones repeatedly asked for it.

            “By the letter of the law, some would say that it’s a violation of his Second Amendment rights maybe to take his weapon. But we have always erred on the side of caution,"" Davis said, noting that the circumstances surrounding the removal of the gun were much more alarming than when a deputy returned the firearm. 

            The problems only escalated. In June 2022, Jones’ grandmother reported him missing, saying he had stopped taking his schizophrenia medication months earlier. His employer, a garage door company, said he was no longer showing up for work.

            Law enforcement found him in Kansas, where he had laid down on an interstate in the Emporia area, telling officers he wanted to be “ran over by a semi,"" the Sarpy County incident report said. 

            Derksen said one of the first things Jones did after he returned from Kansas was go to a Cabela’s store and buy a shotgun. The family took that gun, as they had others. Derksen's leverage was that he owned the duplex where Jones stayed with his grandmother. 

            Recently, Jones had called the FBI to report some sort of harassment, his uncle said; the agency said it couldn’t discuss specific calls. 

            Police haven't said why Jones entered the Target with 13 loaded rifle magazines and fired multiple rounds. Derksen said he believes his nephew didn't want to carry out a mass shooting, but instead wanted police to kill him. He said his nephew had delusions that the cartel would hurt his family if he didn’t kill himself.

            
                A timeline released by police made no mention of Jones firing directly at customers or workers. Instead, he fired his AR-15 style rifle in the air and at inanimate objects including a self-checkout and a drink cooler. Authorities ordered him to drop the gun more than 20 times, and after Jones said “I’ll kill you!” he was shot once.

            “We do really feel bad for the people who were traumatized at Target and even for the law enforcement officer who was forced to take that shot,"" Derksen said. “We know they did what they had to do. It just should have never been able to get there.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803350,Column: Rose about majors over money heading into twilight,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Justin Rose and Joaquin Niemann are at different stages of their careers and their achievements in golf are nothing alike.

            Their words, while not verbatim and lacking context, felt familiar.

            They were spoken nearly a year apart, inspired by the joy of winning on the PGA Tour at a course steeped in so much history it adds to the occasion.











            “Winning a PGA Tour event, getting a trophy, having Tiger there, all the history behind it, there's nothing that can compete with this,” Niemann said last year at Riviera, moments after he won the Genesis Invitational and posed with tournament host Tiger Woods.

            Niemann was 23. It was his second win, moving him to No. 20 in the world. He had shared private conversations earlier in the week about the temptation of Saudi-funded LIV Golf, still more rumor than reality at the time, and the Chilean was leaning that way until he won and spoke so passionately about his desire to beat the best in the world.

            Six months later, the lure of guaranteed riches trumped winning at Riviera. Niemann was among the last batch of players to move over to LIV.

            “I've been one of the players that's very fortunate to have done very well at the game of golf,” Rose said Monday after winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

            Rose is 42. He had gone four years since his last victory anywhere in the world. He was not a consideration for Europe's last Ryder Cup team in 2021. His back began to bother him last year. The former U.S. Open champion seemed an ideal candidate for LIV.

            He looked into it but went no further. He said he cared more about majors — that starts with playing in them — and he felt the PGA Tour offered the best path.

            “So moments like I've just had ... I made the decision based upon blind faith,"" Rose said. ""Hope to win. Hope to put myself in the situation. My game hasn't produced many of those opportunities of late. But still have had that belief that it's possible.

            “So to be in the situation on the 18th green at a place like Pebble, holding a trophy, that's what it's for.”

            There are few places more inspiring than Pebble Beach, especially when the sun is so bright it makes the surf look teal, when that felicitous meeting of emerald turf and blue Pacific is separated by the white splash of waves crashing against the rocks along the 18th hole.

            Rose looked around when he finished off his 65-66 weekend for his first win in four years and exclaimed, “What a place to win a tournament.”

            That doesn't mean he will never change his mind, though Rose didn't sound the part. He has a clear idea of where he wants to go.

            And it doesn't involve guaranteed money.

            “Not as important as winning a major or two, for sure,” Rose said. “But you've got to be in it to win it. I think that's just it. Giving up on that opportunity is what you've got to look yourself in the mirror and say, ‘Is that something that’s worth it for me?'”

            To have left the PGA Tour likely would have meant playing only the U.S. Open. His 10-year exemption from winning in 2013 at Merion expires this year.

            Rose is closing in on $60 million in career earnings on the PGA Tour, and it has been a remarkable ride. He challenged for the claret jug at Royal Birkdale as a 17-year-old amateur and then missed 20 straight cuts to start his pro career.

            What stands out from his 23 titles around the world is having trophies from the six main tours in golf — PGA Tour, Europe, Japan, Asia, South Africa and Australia.

            He rates alongside two close mates also born in 1980, Adam Scott and Sergio Garcia. Rose has only the one major, his U.S. Open at Merion, but he lost in a playoff at the Masters to Garcia and played in the final group at Pebble Beach in the U.S. Open.

            Rose has been eligible for every major dating to St. Andrews in 2010, a streak that was at risk until he won at Pebble Beach. His world ranking was at its lowest point 12 years. That's the blind faith to which he spoke.

            The victory moved him from No. 71 to No. 35. He has reached No. 1 on five occasions, never longer than two months. That's not as important as it once was to him.

            “I feel like I’ve achieved enough in the game where I don’t strive for being back to No. 1 in the world. My only goal is to really play well enough where I feel like I can win majors,” Rose said. ""Obviously, rule No. 1, you got to be in them. So moments like this are very important because it gets me back in those tournaments.

            “Two, I just want to keep working on my game to the level where I feel like if I have a good week and I play well, I've got a chance to win a major,” he said. “That’s what I feel my forte is going to be all about. I feel like I pretty much ticked most other boxes.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803351,Mozambique's extremist rebels kill aid worker in north,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Extremist rebels in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado province have killed a worker for the international charity Doctors Without Borders, shortly after a former vice president of the organization was asked to produce a report into the humanitarian situation in the conflict-hit region.

            Mozambique’s Islamic extremist insurgency, which started in October 2017, is blamed for the deaths of more than 3,000 people and for displacing an estimated 900,000 people. In March 2021 the rebel violence forced the France-based firm TotalEnergies to put on hold its $20 billion liquified natural gas project in the north of the province. TotalEnergies invoked force majeure after the insurgents attacked the town of Palma, very near the gas project.

            Palma was later recaptured by Mozambican and Rwandan forces and the government has urged TotalEnergies to resume work on the gas project.











            Last week TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne made a lightning visit to Mozambique during which he inspected the gas project site and Palma as well as the port town of Mocímboa da Praia, once an insurgent stronghold. Pouyanne later dined with Mozambican president Filipe Nyusi in Cabo Delgado's provincial capital of Pemba before flying out the same day.

            At the end of the top executive's visit, TotalEnergies announced the appointment of Jean-Christophe Rufin, “a recognized expert in humanitarian action and human rights,” to undertake “an independent mission to assess the humanitarian situation in Cabo Delgado province.” Rufin is a former vice president of Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym, MSF, and former president of the non-governmental organization Action Against Hunger. Rufin also served as France’s ambassador to Gambia and Senegal, appointed by the then foreign minister Bernard Kouchner, one of the co-founders of MSF.

            Rufin’s report is due at the end of February, and TotalEnergies said it will help it and its consortium partners in the gas project to “decide whether the conditions are met for resuming project activities.”

            “The lifting of the force majeure and the resumption of activities at the Mozambique LNG project site require, in particular, the restoration of security in the region, the resumption of public services and the return to normal life for the people of the region,"" Pouyanne said.

            But while gains have been made by Mozambique’s armed forces and its regional allies, the rebels are still capable of carrying out lethal attacks — including on the main north-south road that links the city of Pemba with the gas project in Palma.

            On Feb. 1, two vans and a minibus were attacked south of the town of Macomia, killing an estimated seven people, including a nurse, and injuring seven others. The vehicles were left burned on the road, local outlet Zitamar News reported.

            Then on Feb. 4, the day after Pouyanne's visit, another attack hit the same stretch of road. An MSF staff member, on his day off, was fatally injured while traveling on public transport to visit his family in Pemba, MSF announced. The man was a driver in Macomia for MSF, which he had joined in 2019. He is survived by his wife and five children.

            ʺToday, we are grieving as we lost a colleague who, like all staff, are fully committed to assisting displaced families and often face significant risks,” said Federica Nogarotto, the director of MSF's mission in Mozambique. “This is a very sad day for us and for our team.”MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Extremist rebels in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado province have killed a worker for the international charity Doctors Without Borders, shortly after a former vice president of the organization was asked to produce a report into the humanitarian situation in the conflict-hit region.Mozambique’s Islamic extremist insurgency, which started in October 2017, is blamed for the deaths of more than 3,000 people and for displacing an estimated 900,000 people.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803352,Jurors hear about blue rain jacket in Alex Murdaugh trial,"Jurors at Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial in South Carolina heard evidence Tuesday that gunshot residue was found inside a rain jacket found at his mother's home three months after his wife and son were killed.

            A judge's decision to allow the testimony was the second win for prosecutors in as many days. Judge Clifton Newman on Monday allowed prosecutors to call witnesses to testify that Murdaugh was stealing money from his law firm and clients and committing other financial crimes long before the killings.

            Later Tuesday, once of Murdaugh's law partners testified about how his firm found out Murdaugh was stealing money and also about trying to collect birdshot from the scene of the shootings at the Murdaugh property the day after the deaths but stopping because they were sickened by the gore still around after the crime scene agents left.











            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, near kennels at their home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.

            Defense attorneys asked the judge to prevent further testimony about the raincoat after the caretaker for Murdaugh's ailing mother testified that she saw him bring a “blue something, looked like a tarp” into his mother's home nine days after the killings.

            State agents got a search warrant four months after the killings and found a tarp but also a blue rain jacket.

            State Law Enforcement Division agent Megan Fletcher testified she found a large amount of gunshot residue inside the jacket and said it was consistent with either firing a gun while wearing it inside out or being wrapped around a recently fired weapon. Court ended Tuesday before she could be cross examined.

            Defense attorneys said prosecutors didn't connect the jacket to Murdaugh through the caretaker's confusing testimony and that it would be unfair and harmful to his case to let state agents testify about what the testing on the jacket found. Witnesses have testified the Murdaugh family often shot guns and hunted on their property and the defense said residue can't be linked to a specific weapon.

            The defense did an “effective job in cross-examination in raising questions as to the credibility of the witness. And that is the exact job the jury has to do — weigh the credibility of the witness,” the judge said.

            But Newman's decisions could also help the defense. If Murdaugh is found guilty, the decisions could be brought up on appeal.

            The extra witnesses will extend a trial that reached its 12th day on Tuesday with no end to the prosecution's case in sight.

            Jurors heard Tuesday from Ronnie Crosby, a law partner with Murdaugh for more than two decades. 

            Crosby testified for the prosecution that Murdaugh told him and other law partners he was never at the kennels the night of the shootings and later became the third witness to identify Murdaugh's voice along with his wife and his son on a video from the kennels about five minutes before investigators say they were killed.

            Crosby became emotional and took his time answering several times during his testimony. Prosecutor Creighton Waters asked Crosby if he had a drink after a partner called him to his home and showed a folder of evidence that Murdaugh was stealing money.

            “Yea, ultimately more than one,"" Crosby said.

            Crosby didn't go to a meeting the next day where other partners confronted Murdaugh and he resigned. But he said he was told that Murdaugh told his colleagues ""he knew he was going to get caught at some point.”

            On cross-examinaton, Crosby said he arrived at the Murdaugh home about an hour after the bodies were found the night of the killings. He got close enough to the bodies to know what kind of ammunition was fired and said it never looked like state agents searched the Murdaugh home.

            The next day after state agents left, Crosby said he and another partner saw birdshot still near the shooting scene and thought about collecting it in case it was important evidence.

            “It was so bad. We thought at some point we were going to clean it up. But it overwhelmed both my partner Mark and I,” Crosby said.

            Tuesday's testimony started with Jeanne Seckinger, who is the office manager and chief financial officer for the law firm Murdaugh's family founded more than a century ago.

            Murdaugh took money from legal settlements that was supposed to go to clients by routing it to a fake company that he created and that had a similar name to the company the law firm had intended to send it to, Seckinger said. The real company would have then dispensed the money to the firm's clients. 

            Seckinger said she confronted Murdaugh about almost $800,000 in missing law firm fees on the day of the killings. But during the conversation, Murdaugh found out doctors had told his father he would die within days. Seckinger said all the grief ended the investigation into the missing fees until things settled down.

            After an extensive investigation, the firm determined that Murdaugh took more than $5 million from clients, and it is in the process of paying them everything they were owed, Seckinger said.

            For nearly two hours, Seckinger went over dozens of checks Murdaugh sent to his fake company. Then he asked why the law firm had to pay the money back.

            “Alex had stolen it,” Seckinger said again and again.

            On cross-examination, she agreed with defense attorney Jim Griffin that Murdaugh faces criminal charges for each client.

            Griffin also asked Seckinger if it was true that Murdaugh started stealing in 2011, “Some 10 years before the murders of Maggie and Paul?”

            “That’s correct. He managed to fool a lot of people, myself included,” Seckinger said.Jurors at Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial in South Carolina heard evidence Tuesday that gunshot residue was found inside a rain jacket found at his mother's home three months after his wife and son were killed.A judge's decision to allow the testimony was the second win for prosecutors in as many days. Judge Clifton Newman on Monday allowed prosecutors to call witnesses to testify that Murdaugh was stealing money from his law firm and clients and committing other financial crimes long before the killings.Later Tuesday, once of Murdaugh's law partners testified about how his firm found out Murdaugh was stealing money and also about trying to collect birdshot from the scene of the shootings at the Murdaugh property the day after the deaths but stopping because they were sickened by the gore still around after the crime scene agents left.Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife, Maggie, and 22-year-old son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, near kennels at their home. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murder.Defense attorneys asked the judge to prevent further testimony about the raincoat after the caretaker for Murdaugh's ailing mother testified that she saw him bring a “blue something, looked like a tarp” into his mother's home nine days after the killings.State agents got a search warrant four months after the killings and found a tarp but also a blue rain jacket.State Law Enforcement Division agent Megan Fletcher testified she found a large amount of gunshot residue inside the jacket and said it was consistent with either firing a gun while wearing it inside out or being wrapped around a recently fired weapon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803353,Stars at the Super Bowl: How Gronk and Shaq plan to party,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rob Gronkowski might be retired from the NFL, but the former all-pro football player is still in the game during the league’s championship week. 

            The four-time Super Bowl winner — who calls himself the “MVP of Fun” — will host a music festival called “Gronk Beach” in Phoenix on Saturday a day ahead of the big game. The beach-themed day party features performances by 21 Savage, Lil Jon and Diplo.

            After hosting the event in Miami and Las Vegas, Gronkowski said he’s introducing a celebrity volleyball pool competition. The event will take place at the Talking Stick Resort — which will host Shaquille O’Neal’s “Shaq’s Fun House” on Friday and Sports Illustrated's The Party later Saturday evening. 











            “This event brings a whole other dynamic to going to a party,” Gronkowski said. “Anyone can go to a party in their basement like high school or college style. But as you get older, you like the theme party now. You like walking in, seeing the beach, seeing the volleyball going on, seeing the stage. It’s like seventh heaven.”

            Along with Gronkowski’s event, the days leading up to the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles will include concerts from some of the biggest music stars including Drake, Cardi B, Snoop Dogg, Patti LaBelle, Kane Brown and Machine Gun Kelly.

            Here’s a look at some of the events during a busy Super Bowl week: 

            SHAQ’S FUNHOUSE

            O’Neal’s carnival-themed event will make its own touchdown in downtown Phoenix on Friday. 

            Like previous years, the former NBA player — who moonlights as DJ Diesel — looks to bring back a fun-filled event that includes a human claw machine, Ferris wheel and an 80-foot slide. Snoop Dogg and Diplo are the expected headliners.

            “We want to have a great time. We know every year you have to up your game. It’s like when you win championships. You know, the first time we did it was a championship, and it was OK, now we got to do back-to-back. So, we want to remain the best Super Bowl party ever in the history of all Super Bowl parties.”

            GOSPEL CELEBRATION

            Buffalo Bills player Isaiah McKenzie and his team fell short in the postseason, but he’s looking to stand tall in a performance with the NFL Players Choir at the Super Bowl Soulful Celebration. 

            Along with the choir, Patti LaBelle, Israel Houghton, Kierra Sheard and Tye Tribbett will grace the stage Wednesday at the Mesa Arts Center. The event — founded by Melanie Few — will honor Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, who will receive the “Faith in Action” award, which recognizes current and former NFL players who have made an impact in their communities. 

            The theme of the event combining comedy, football and soulful inspiration is “Unstoppable.”

            “I’m looking forward to singing my heart out with my band, my singers and just praising God,” said LaBelle, a Philadelphia native who is eager to meet Hurts. “I'm praying for the Eagles to win.” 

            FLAVORTOWN TAILGATE

            Guy Fieri is looking to create the Super Bowl’s largest culinary event ever. 

            For those unable to see the game firsthand, Fieri is hosting Guy’s Flavortown Tailgate. It’s a free, family-friendly event that he expects to draw around 10,000 fans. 

            Fieri will curate more than 15 restaurants and bar experiences along with performances by Diplo and LOCASH. The event will be held adjacent to State Farm Stadium, where the Chiefs and Eagles faceoff. 

            “We got the greatest game in the world and it’s something everyone dreams of going to, but not everybody can get in the stadium,” Fieri said. “So I thought, ‘Why don’t we throw a tailgate?’ A lot of people go to the tailgate instead of going to the actual game. But there’s not tailgating normally at the Super Bowl, because of parking. But we’re right across the street from the stadium. From 11-4:30, we are throwing a free party so you can have that Super Bowl experience.” 

            BUD LIGHT MUSIC FEST

            Paramore and the Bleachers will co-headline the first night of the Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest on Thursday. The three-night festival will celebrate its fourth year of existence at the Footprint Center., the home of the Phoenix Suns. 

            The follow-up night includes performances by Dave Matthews Band along with special guest DJ Pee .Wee (Anderson .Paak). Imagine Dragons and Kane Brown will close out the festival Saturday night. 

            MICHELOB ULTRA x NETFLIX

            Serena Williams and Brian Cox will host the afterparty for the premiere of the documentary “Full Swing.” 

            Michelob ULTRA and Netflix are teaming up to celebrate the next generation of golf culture with appearances by O’Neal, Lori Harvey, DJ Khaled, Canelo Alvarez and Nneka Ogwumike. The event will have performances by Offset and DJ Pee .Wee.

            MORE, MORE, MORE

            Drake is expected to perform at the invite-only Homecoming Weekend pop up bash at the luxury private jet complex, Scottsdale Hangar One. On Saturday night, The Chainsmokers and Machine Gun Kelly will headline the Sports Illustrated party.

            G-Eazy will headline the W Scottsdale’s Super Weekend series on Thursday night with Cardi B set to perform the following night. Ludacris will close out the series with a set on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803354,Off-duty New York City police officer shot in robbery dies,"NEW YORK (AP) — An off-duty New York City police officer who was shot in the head during a botched robbery died Tuesday, the police commissioner said as officials also announced a murder charge against a suspect.

            Officer Adeed Fayaz, 26, was shot Saturday in Brooklyn, where he and his brother-in-law went to buy a car posted on Facebook Marketplace from a man later identified as the alleged shooter, authorities said.

            “Police Officer Adeed Fayaz was a father, a husband, a son, and a protector of our great city,” NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said in a social media post Tuesday evening. “Our Department deeply mourns his passing, and his family and loved ones are in our prayers.”











            Fayaz's family and dozens of police officers gathered outside a Brooklyn hospital Tuesday evening as his body was loaded into an ambulance and driven away in a procession.

            Police officials said earlier Tuesday that Randy Jones, 38, was arrested at a suburban motel Monday in connection with the shooting. Tuesday night, authorities announced Jones was charged with murder and attempted robbery. It was unclear if Jones has a lawyer who could respond to the allegations.

            Fayaz, married with two young children, agreed to meet Jones on Saturday to buy a car for $24,000, Chief of Detectives James Essig said at a news conference. When Fayaz and his brother-in-law arrived, Jones asked “jokingly” if the men were armed, Essig said. Jones then put Fayaz in a headlock and demanded the money, the chief said.

            Fayaz said he didn't have the money, Essig said, and Jones pointed a gun at Fayaz's brother-in-law. Fayaz broke free from the headlock and Jones shot him in the head, Essig said.

            Jones ran, firing more shots at he fled, Essig said. The brother-in-law grabbed Fayaz's gun from his hip and fired several shots as well, he said. The brother-in-law was not injured.

            Jones drove off in a 2011 BMW that was registered to his mother, Essig said. 

            Jones was arrested Monday at a Days Inn in Nanuet, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) north of New York City. A woman and five children ages 6 months to 11 years were with him at the motel, Essig said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803355,"2 women have rare job of coaching both girls, boys HS teams","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Centennial High School girls' basketball team had just left the floor after yet another victory and coach Karen Weitz didn't have time to waste.

            She quickly addressed the girls in the locker room before hurriedly returning to the court, ready to coach the boys.

            Weitz is a rarity — a high school coach overseeing both the boys and girls varsity teams. A woman handling those responsibilities is even rarer.











            ""I’m not saying I’m anything special, but it’s a lot,” Weitz said. “It’s a lot to manage.”

            Weitz has company in her unusual club: Ashley Fouch, who coaches the boys and girls teams at Daleville High in Indiana.

            The National Federation of State High School Associations doesn't keep statistics, media relations manager Nate Perry said, but he believes someone coaching both the boys and girls basketball teams at the same time is atypical. 

            “It’s not any different for me if I’m coaching girls or if I'm coaching boys,"" said Fouch, who is in her second season coaching the boys team and who took on the girls team three weeks before the season. ""I'm a basketball coach and I understand that it’s a big deal and barriers are being broken with it. 

            ""But at the end of the day, I’m just coaching basketball. So I think that’s my baseline and just it kind of releases my pressure of everything when I think about it deeply.”

            Weitz was already a standout in Nevada. Centennial, which plays in the state's highest classification, has won a state-record seven consecutive championships. Its 13 overall titles, all under Weitz, are second in state history. 

            She is the only Nevada girls coach to win more than 700 career games; no one else has more than 600. Her record and retiring from teaching gave Weitz, 54, more time to do both jobs. 

            And she has an especially challenging job with the boys program, which last season went 9-14. This season's team won nine games by Jan. 5. The team was 12-7 through last weekend.

            “I was excited for her to bring in a whole new life for us,"" senior point guard Elijah Burney said. ""She’s a winning coach. She instills that in us every day in our practices.""

            Weitz sees similarities to when she took over the girls team. It didn't have a winning culture, either, and she said it took about three years to build it into the powerhouse it is today.

            “The bottom line is you've got to find the core that wants to buy into your system, wants to buy into your standards, wants to buy into the culture of the program,” Weitz said. “And that’s the first thing you've got to do is find those guys that are OK with that, that are OK with being coached hard, that are OK with being held accountable.”

            The difference in the programs was evident when they shared the same game night. Weitz stood for most of the girls game until late in the third quarter when Centennial had a 22-point lead. She didn't sit during the boys game, which Centennial lost by 29 points.

            “That’s a huge undertaking to be able to try to run both,” athletic director Mike Livreri said. “I just felt it was going to be a really hard thing to do. It looks like she’s been able to juggle it successfully.""

            The time required bleeds into Weitz's personal life, though. She said she was too tired and too busy to put away her Christmas tree until well into January.

            Fouch, who is also Daleville's athletic director, said coaching two teams will “cut into your family time, your friend time.”

            “I have two dogs, and they’re about to kill me right now. I think you prep yourself before you take on something like this and know, like, OK, these next five months are going to be brutal. Are you willing to give up these things to do this?"" the 31-year-old said. “In my mind, I’m like, ‘Heck, yeah, it’s worth it.’ I’m already around these kids all the time at school.” 

            Fouch had immediate success last season coaching the Daleville boys team, going 14-10 and advancing to the sectional championship. This season's team was 7-9 through Monday.

            It's the second time she's been in charge of the girls program, going 31-39 over three seasons and capturing the sectional title in her final season in 2020. Fouch left for another program before returning. Meanwhile, Daleville's girls ended their season Friday with a 3-19 record.

            AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLAS VEGAS (AP) — The Centennial High School girls' basketball team had just left the floor after yet another victory and coach Karen Weitz didn't have time to waste.She quickly addressed the girls in the locker room before hurriedly returning to the court, ready to coach the boys.Weitz is a rarity — a high school coach overseeing both the boys and girls varsity teams. A woman handling those responsibilities is even rarer.""I’m not saying I’m anything special, but it’s a lot,” Weitz said. “It’s a lot to manage.”Weitz has company in her unusual club: Ashley Fouch, who coaches the boys and girls teams at Daleville High in Indiana.The National Federation of State High School Associations doesn't keep statistics, media relations manager Nate Perry said, but he believes someone coaching both the boys and girls basketball teams at the same time is atypical.“It’s not any different for me if I’m coaching girls or if I'm coaching boys,"" said Fouch, who is in her second season coaching the boys team and who took on the girls team three weeks before the season. ""I'm a basketball coach and I understand that it’s a big deal and barriers are being broken with it.""But at the end of the day, I’m just coaching basketball. So I think that’s my baseline and just it kind of releases my pressure of everything when I think about it deeply.”Weitz was already a standout in Nevada. Centennial, which plays in the state's highest classification, has won a state-record seven consecutive championships. Its 13 overall titles, all under Weitz, are second in state history.She is the only Nevada girls coach to win more than 700 career games; no one else has more than 600. Her record and retiring from teaching gave Weitz, 54, more time to do both jobs.And she has an especially challenging job with the boys program, which last season went 9-14. This season's team won nine games by Jan. 5. The team was 12-7 through last weekend.“I was excited for her to bring in a whole new life for us,"" senior point guard Elijah Burney said. ""She’s a winning coach. She instills that in us every day in our practices.""Weitz sees similarities to when she took over the girls team. It didn't have a winning culture, either, and she said it took about three years to build it into the powerhouse it is today.“The bottom line is you've got to find the core that wants to buy into your system, wants to buy into your standards, wants to buy into the culture of the program,” Weitz said. “And that’s the first thing you've got to do is find those guys that are OK with that, that are OK with being coached hard, that are OK with being held accountable.”The difference in the programs was evident when they shared the same game night. Weitz stood for most of the girls game until late in the third quarter when Centennial had a 22-point lead. She didn't sit during the boys game, which Centennial lost by 29 points.“That’s a huge undertaking to be able to try to run both,” athletic director Mike Livreri said. “I just felt it was going to be a really hard thing to do. It looks like she’s been able to juggle it successfully.""The time required bleeds into Weitz's personal life, though. She said she was too tired and too busy to put away her Christmas tree until well into January.Fouch, who is also Daleville's athletic director, said coaching two teams will “cut into your family time, your friend time.”“I have two dogs, and they’re about to kill me right now. I think you prep yourself before you take on something like this and know, like, OK, these next five months are going to be brutal. Are you willing to give up these things to do this?"" the 31-year-old said. “In my mind, I’m like, ‘Heck, yeah, it’s worth it.’ I’m already around these kids all the time at school.”Fouch had immediate success last season coaching the Daleville boys team, going 14-10 and advancing to the sectional championship. This season's team was 7-9 through Monday.It's the second time she's been in charge of the girls program, going 31-39 over three seasons and capturing the sectional title in her final season in 2020. Fouch left for another program before returning. Meanwhile, Daleville's girls ended their season Friday with a 3-19 record.“The biggest thing is if I didn’t have any type of support from this community, I wouldn’t have done it,” said Fouch, who doesn't know whether she'll coach both teams beyond this season. “But because people backed me so well here and because there’s so much care toward me and my basketball programs and my kids, it makes it easy and it makes me want to do it.""___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803357,UK holds ceremony replete with tradition to consider coins,"LONDON (AP) — A jury sat solemnly in a gilded hall in central London on Tuesday, presided over by a bewigged representative of the crown in flowing black robes, but there were no criminals in the dock. 

            Britain’s coinage was on trial.

            In a ceremony that dates back to the 12th century, the jury filed into the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to begin the process of weighing and measuring hundreds of coins to ensure they meet stringent standards set by regulators.











            The tradition — known as the Trial of the Pyx — amounts to a very old type of consumer protection designed to safeguard the nation’s coinage from counterfeiting or other forms of debasement.

            “It’s still really important to make sure that the coins the Royal Mint produce are really uniform,’’ said Eleni Bride, the librarian for the Goldsmith’s Company. “They are produced to a very high specification. This is to make sure people have confidence in them so you can detect counterfeits easily.’’

            Like the many old ceremonies that the U.K. continues to observe, the annual assessment of coinage is replete with traditions that link modern Britain to its historic roots.

            That starts with its name, which comes from the ancient Greek word “pyxis,” or small box, which was later used in Latin, too. 

            Coins are collected throughout the year and deposited in so-called Pyx boxes, from which jurors randomly select the coins to be tested. 

            The coins selected on Tuesday will be weighed, measured, examined for their design and tested for metallic composition over the next three months before the jury reconvenes to give its verdict on whether they meet regulatory standards.

            Last year, the trial examined 7,968 coins before delivering a positive verdict to the nation’s Treasury chief, who also serves as master of the mint.

            The king’s Remembrancer, created by King Henry II in 1154 and Britain’s oldest judicial post, presides over the trial in a curly, white wig and robes.

            Tuesday’s ceremony marked the first time coins bearing the likeness of King Charles III were tested. A 15-kilogram (33-pound) gold coin produced to celebrate the late Queen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee was also among some 10,000 coins submitted for testing.LONDON (AP) — A jury sat solemnly in a gilded hall in central London on Tuesday, presided over by a bewigged representative of the crown in flowing black robes, but there were no criminals in the dock.Britain’s coinage was on trial.In a ceremony that dates back to the 12th century, the jury filed into the livery hall of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths to begin the process of weighing and measuring hundreds of coins to ensure they meet stringent standards set by regulators.The tradition — known as the Trial of the Pyx — amounts to a very old type of consumer protection designed to safeguard the nation’s coinage from counterfeiting or other forms of debasement.“It’s still really important to make sure that the coins the Royal Mint produce are really uniform,’’ said Eleni Bride, the librarian for the Goldsmith’s Company. “They are produced to a very high specification.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803362,Newspapers dying? Ralph Nader's giving birth to one,"NEW YORK (AP) — At age 88, Ralph Nader believes his neighbors in northwest Connecticut are tired of electronics and miss the feel of holding a newspaper to read about their town.

            So at a time that local newspapers are dying at an alarming rate, the longtime activist is helping give birth to one.

            Copies of the first edition of the Winsted Citizen are circulating around this old New England mill town, with stories about a newly-opened food co-op, a Methodist church closing after attendance lagged at services and the repair of a century-old bridge.











            “If it works, it will be a good model for the rest of the country,” said Nader, who as a youngster delivered a long-gone Winsted daily paper in his hometown. He splits time now between Winsted and Washington, D.C.

            The last locally-based weekly paper, the Winsted Journal, began in 1996 before being shut down in 2017, unable to make enough money to support itself.

            A town of about 8,000, Winsted has seen better days. Locals still talk about the 1955 hurricane that wiped out much of Main Street and killed a big employer, the Gilbert Clock Co. Winsted is surrounded by several better-off smaller communities, with Litchfield County a popular second-home destination for city dwellers, and the Winsted Citizen will cover those, too.

            Since the Journal shut down, people are losing touch with what's going on in local government and the news that knits a community — who's getting engaged, who's given birth — Nader said.

            “After awhile it all congeals and you start losing history,” he said. “Every year you don't have a newspaper, you lose that connection.”

            Nader invested $15,000 and hired a veteran Connecticut journalist, Andy Thibault, to get the Citizen started. The masthead lists 17 reporters. They get paid, Thibault said, “when they write a story.”

            The motto: “It's your paper. We work for you.”

            The Citizen plans to publish monthly until next January, when it will become a weekly, Thibault said. He plans to sustain the newspaper through advertising, donations and subscriptions — $25 for the rest of 2023, and $95 a year after that.

            Nader is full of suggestions but not intrusive, Thibault said. The consumer activist and four-time presidential candidate doesn't dictate a political stance, he said.

            Thibault has used his connections to build a solid bench of contributors, including longtime Hartford Courant editorial cartoonist Bob Englehart. The first issue includes a lengthy profile of a successful local basketball coach and a story about a project to paint a five-story mural in two abandoned mill buildings.

            The depiction of Winsted as a news desert has grated on some. Bruno Matarazzo Jr., a reporter for the nearby Republican-American in Waterbury, taunts Nader with tweeted reminders that the daily newspaper covers Winsted regularly. Waterbury is about 28 miles (45 km) from Winsted.

            “It's different coverage when a town has its own newspaper than when you have a daily coming in to cover it,” said Janet Manko, publisher and editor in chief of another Connecticut weekly, the Lakeville Journal, which also published the Winsted Journal before it closed. The failure wasn't because Winsted didn't deserve a paper, she said.

            The Journal is among an estimated 2,500 newspapers that have closed in the United States since 2005, all but about 100 non-dailies, according to a report issued last year by the Northwestern/Medill Local News Initiative.

            So Nader is clearly bucking a trend and is to be commended, said Penelope Muse Abernathy, who wrote “The State of Local News” report.

            “It will turn heads because it’s Ralph Nader,” she said.

            But maybe he won't be as lonely as it seems. Abernathy said she's been getting more frequent calls lately for advice from people who want to open newspapers. The cautious approach used by the Citizen — monthly issues before turning weekly — has been used by others, she said. There's a greater recognition of the need for a smart business plan, instead of just a passion project.

            Given Nader's romance with print, it's somewhat odd that the lead story in the Citizen's inaugural edition talks to young Winsted residents about how they get much of their news from social media. Thibault said he plans to build an online presence.

            “I like print,” said Terry Cowgill, a columnist for the CTNewsJunkie.com website. “I still like holding a print newspaper in my hand. I'm 65 years old. Most people under 50, certainly under 40, have scarcely ever held a newspaper in their hands.""

            He's rooting for the Citizen, though. Cowgill said he suspects the Citizen's best chance for long-term success is whether Nader can trade on his celebrity for foundation grants.

            Volunteers fanned out on a frigid day last week to deliver copies of the first 12-page issue. One woman, Ruthie Ursone Napoleone, stopped a delivery car to ask for more copies. Her father's obituary was in the first issue, her nephew was quoted in another story and a third featured her workplace.

            She hugged the person who gave her the extra papers.

            “I wish my dad could read this,” Napoleone said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803363,St. Andrews to leave the 700-year-old Swilcan Bridge alone,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — What was shaping up as one the biggest controversies in golf this year also turned out to be the shortest one.

            The Swilcan Bridge on the 18th hole at St. Andrews will be left alone.

            The outrage, bordering on horror, began with social media images of the St. Andrews Links Trust extending the start of the bridge to include a circular patio of stones that did not look like they had been there for 700 years.











            “The ongoing works are solely focused on the turfed approach area to the bridge, which regularly falls into disrepair due to the significant foot traffic by tens of thousands of golfers and countless other visitors seeking to have their photograph taken at the landmark,” St. Andrews said in a statement issued Sunday.

            Golf Digest met with Links Trust officials on Monday. Laurie Watson, the external relations and media manager, told Digest the area in front of the bridge was a quagmire just three months after the British Open. Watson said the Links Trust has tried using artificial turf, rubber rocks and turf seeding, and yet nothing has worked.

            “So this is the next step in trying to find a potential solution,” Watson told Golf Digest.

            And then it wasn’t. A few hours later, the Links Trust, which oversees the Old Course and six other public courses in the Scottish town, said it was abandoning the plan.

            “The stonework at the approach and exit of the bridge was identified as one possible long-term solution, however while this installation would have proved some protection, in this instance we believe we are unable to create a look which is in keeping with its iconic setting and have taken the decision to remove it,” said an updated statement issued Monday.

            The bridge, regarded as the most famous landmark in golf, originally was built to allow shepherds get across the small stream. In recent years, shepherds have given way to the likes of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson and Tiger Woods, all of whom have been photographed crossing it for the final time at the home of golf.

            GREAT SCOT

            His PGA Tour debut was largely unnoticed until deep in the weekend at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, and only then because the same question kept coming up.

            Who is Paul O’Hara? And how did he get in Pebble Beach?

            The short answer would be the player with the largest collection of titles in the field.

            O’Hara is a 36-year-old from Scotland, the younger brother of Steven O’Hara on the European tour. He is a PGA professional who cleans up on the regional Scottish PGA circuits (36 wins in the last five years, 62 overall) and that doesn’t include his play on the Tartan Tour.

            One of those regional events was at Skibo Castle, and his amateur that week was Colorado developer Patrick Hamill, a regular in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He raved about O’Hara to Pebble Beach officials.

            Steve John, the tournament director, was even more impressed with the letter O’Hara wrote seeking an exemption.

            The Monterey Peninsula Foundation offered him an exemption, and John laughs at calling O’Hara to give him the news.

            “He said, ‘Can I come tomorrow?’ It was snowing in Glasgow and he couldn’t practice,” John said.

            O’Hara arrived a full week before the tournament, so early that no courtesy cars were available, so John let him use his own car to play and practice at Monterey Peninsula (“He’s practically a member now,” John said) along with Tehama Golf Club and other courses around the peninsula.

            O’Hara had never made the cut in seven European tour events dating to 2017. And then he came to California for his first PGA Tour event and made the cut on the number.

            He played the final round alongside three-time major champion Jordan Spieth.

            Alas, his memorable week ended with a double bogey on the ninth hole, dropping him to last place among 75 players who made the cut. He made $17,550.

            BACK TO HER ROOTS

            Few other LPGA Tour players touch so many parts of the world as Albane Valenzuela.

            Born in New York, she moved to Mexico when she was 3 and then to Geneva three years later. She became a Swiss citizen at age 14 and was a Phi Beta Kappa when she graduated from Stanford with a degree in political science. She speaks four languages.

            And now she has a Ladies European Tour card.

            Valenzuela, a two-time Olympian, turned pro in the fall of 2019 and has spent the last three years on the LPGA with incremental success. She locked up her LPGA card for 2023 by finishing 68th in the Race to CME Globe.

            And then she went to Spain in December to earn an LET card. She tied for sixth in Q-school, making it easily. Part of the appeal is the strongest LET schedule in history, and a big part is the Solheim Cup.

            “There’s so many events worldwide and I think it’s great as a professional golfer to have options to play globally,” Valenzuela said. “I obviously play a lot on the LPGA Tour and that will be my focus, but to be able to play a few events on the LET will be really fun.

            “One of my big goals is to eventually play in the Solheim Cup, so I would love to make the team and that’s part of the process.”

            She starts her season this week in Morocco and is in the field for the Saudi Ladies International the following week.

            RYDER AND RYDER

            Two weeks after Sam Ryder nearly captured his first PGA Tour victory at Torrey Pines, more TV time is coming his way.

            Ryder has a corporate deal with Ryder System Inc. (it’s a natural fit). The transportation company is launching a multimillion-dollar sponsorship and advertising campaign with the PGA Tour player.

            Ryder already has his “name” on the crest of the shirt. The campaign has a series of humorous television, print and digital ads in which Ryder tries to explore why Ryder wanted to sponsor him and what he can offer. One spot includes him playing bongo drums. He has no future there.

            The announcement comes the week of the Phoenix Open, where a year ago Ryder first made news inside the ropes with his hole-in-one on the 16th hole during the raucous third round.

            DIVOTS

            The number Tony Finau saw on a yardage plate on the 13th tee when he played Augusta National in November is now listed in the Masters media guide. The par 5 known as “Azalea” now measures 545 yards, with a new tee that is 35 yards farther back. ... Justin Rose is the first European to win the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. ... Gregory Odom Jr. of Howard University has received the “Pathway Player” exemption to play in the college showcase the Monday before the Genesis Invitational at Riviera. The winner of the showcase gets a spot in the field. The exemption is for college players from a minority background who excel on the course and in school. ... Dustin Johnson is projected to fall out of the top 50 in the world next week for the first time since 2009.

            STAT OF THE WEEK

            Justin Rose has 11 wins on the PGA Tour. Seven were at courses that have held either a major or a Ryder Cup — Pebble Beach, Torrey Pines, Colonial, Congressional, Merion, Aronimink and Muirfield Village.

            FINAL WORD

            “I think the format this week, playing with amateurs, kind of just mellowed me out to the point where I let it happen. I let my good golf come forward. It’s obviously a learning lesson in that.” — Justin Rose on winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803378,Utah man Googled ‘Gunshot in a house' before murder-suicide,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah man who fatally shot his wife, her mother and their five kids before turning the gun on himself had done online searches about how loud different guns sound and whether neighbors could hear gunshots five days before the killings, new court records posted online show.

            According to a document containing the findings of a police search warrant, a search of Michael Haight’s phone showed he searched Google with the question, “can you hear a gunshot in a house."" He also researched how loud 9mm and 40mm guns were. 

            The findings, first reported by KSL.com, add weight to the notion that the Jan. 4 killings in the small town of Enoch were planned. Relatives said Haight, 42, had also previously taken guns from the home, leaving his wife and mother-in-law unable to defend themselves.











            Police believe Haight carried out the shootings, which came two weeks after his wife Tausha had filed for divorce, but have not announced motive for the shootings. 

            Last month, records showed that authorities had investigated Haight for child abuse in 2020 but that police and prosecutors decided not to charge him. 

            In an interview with authorities then, Macie Haight, the family’s eldest daughter, detailed multiple assaults, including one where she was choked by her father and “very afraid that he was going to keep her from breathing and kill her.” However, Tausha Haight told authorities she did not want her husband to be prosecuted, hoping the investigation would be “a wake-up call” for him. 

            In another previously released search warrant from the shooting investigation, one of the family's daughters sent a text message to friend the day before the killings “stating her dad came home, was acting strange and she was worried.”SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah man who fatally shot his wife, her mother and their five kids before turning the gun on himself had done online searches about how loud different guns sound and whether neighbors could hear gunshots five days before the killings, new court records posted online show.According to a document containing the findings of a police search warrant, a search of Michael Haight’s phone showed he searched Google with the question, “can you hear a gunshot in a house.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803379,"Sabres agree with Dylan Cozens on $49.7M, 7-year extension","BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Sabres have agreed to terms with forward Dylan Cozens on a seven-year extension worth $49.7 million.

            The team announced the contract Tuesday. Cozens will count $7.1 million against the salary cap through the 2029-30 season.

            Cozens, who turns 22 Thursday, is the latest core player the Sabres have extended over the past six months. Buffalo signed All-Star forward Tage Thompson for $50 million over seven seasons in August and defenseman Mattias Samuelsson to a $30 million, seven-year deal in October.











            Rasmus Dahlin, the top pick in 2020 who's a Norris Trophy candidate and filled in for Thompson at NHL All-Star weekend, figures to be next for a big contract. He's signed through next season and can begin talking about an extension this summer.

            Cozens, who was set to be a restricted free agent, has already set career highs with 17 goals, 26 assists and 43 points — with 30 games left in the season. The seventh pick in 2019, Cozens has 34 goals and 60 assists in 169 regular-season NHL games, all with Buffalo.

            The Sabres, led by Dahlin, Thompson, Cozens and 2021 No. 1 pick Owen Power, are contending to make the playoffs. The organization's 11-year playoff drought dating to 2011 is by far the longest in the league.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803386,Wisconsin student's dad sues over officer's neck restraint,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — An Illinois man has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that an off-duty police officer improperly restrained his 12-year-old daughter during a fight in a Wisconsin middle school last year by placing his knee on her neck similar to how Derek Chauvin fatally restrained George Floyd.

            Jerrel Perez, who lives in Zion, Illinois, but who used to live about 10 miles (16 kilometers) north in Kenosha, Wisconsin, filed the lawsuit Monday. He alleges that the officer, Shawn Guetschow, used excessive force and inflicted lasting injuries on his daughter. The filing seeks unspecified damages and attorney fees from Guetschow, the city of Kenosha and its school district. 

            Sam Hall, an attorney for Guetschow and the school district, promised to mount a vigorous defense. He said in a statement that state prosecutors decided not to bring charges and the U.S. attorney's office in Milwaukee determined that Guetschow didn't commit any civil rights violations. The Kenosha city attorney, Matthew Knight, declined to comment Tuesday other than to say that the city hadn't been served with the lawsuit yet. 











            Kenosha Police Lt. Joseph Nosalik issued a statement saying the department learned of the lawsuit late Monday afternoon and respects the rights of citizens to file complaints but had no further comment on the matter.

            Guetschow was working his off-duty job as a security guard at Lincoln Middle School in Kenosha on March 4 when Perez's daughter got into a fight with another student in the cafeteria.

            
                Surveillance video shows Guetschow rush over and separate the students. He scuffles with Perez's daughter, who appears to throw a punch at him. He falls to the floor and takes her down with him. He then gets on top of her and appears to press his knee into the back of her neck for about 25 seconds while he handcuffs her. He then hauls her to her feet and leads her off-camera.

            Perez's daughter is Black. Guetschow is white.

            Perez alleges in the lawsuit that his daughter couldn't breathe while Guetschow's knee was on her neck. She sustained a traumatic brain injury and still suffers recurring headaches, according to the lawsuit.

            The lawsuit describes the knee-restraint as an illegal chokehold. Wisconsin passed a law in 2021 prohibiting police from using chokeholds except as a last resort, joining a host of other states that passed similar statutes in the wake of widespread protests over Floyd's death. 

            The Wisconsin law does not lay out any penalties for officers that employ chokeholds, however, leaving it to prosecutors to decide whether other charges such as assault or reckless endangerment might apply in such situations. Guetschow was not charged in the middle school incident, court records show.

            The Kenosha Police Department requires officers to follow its policy and procedures when making off-duty arrests. The lawsuit accuses the city of failing to train its officers to work as off-duty security guards and the school district with failing to train its security guards.

            The lawsuit contends that the city also failed to take into account Guetschow's reputation as having a “short temper."" The filing alleges that in his final year of employment with the Lake Geneva Police Department, a performance review was marked “unacceptable” and he was described as “emotional, panicked or loses their temper.""

            Guetschow resigned from his security guard position days after the incident, saying he had suffered mental and emotional strain and that he felt the district didn't support him. The Kenosha Police Department's statement said that an internal investigation determined that Guetschow didn't violate any department policy or procedures and he was returned to active duty status on Jan. 31. 

            Hall, the attorney for the school district and Guetschow, said Guetschow is still recovering from injuries he suffered trying to break up the fight. He said Guetschow's head struck a table during the scuffle and he suffered a concussion, significant swelling and a bruise to his head, and was treated at a local emergency room. Hall praised Guetschow for regaining control of the situation despite his injuries.MADISON, Wis.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803387,Congress takes up legislation on federal aviation oversight,"Congress began considering critical aviation legislation on Tuesday in the aftermath of recent close calls involving airline and cargo jets at airports in New York and Texas.

            Lawmakers celebrated the small number of deaths on airline flights in the United States since a 2009 crash that killed 50 people, but they noted the recent scary incidents.

            “It shows that even following the safest decade in our history, our aviation system is clearly in need of some urgent attention,” said Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., chairman of the House Transportation Committee. 











            Graves' committee held its first hearing on a must-pass bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration by Sept. 30. The FAA regulates airlines and aircraft manufacturers and manages the nation's airspace.

            The hearing highlighted issues ranging from FAA technology — which broke down last month, snarling U.S. air travel for a day — to the size of airline seats.

            FAA legislation usually focuses on safety, and that is likely to be the case again this year. Consumer groups also are pushing Congress to include a number of passenger-friendly provisions that are opposed by the airline industry. Some of the proposals would require airlines to:

            — Quickly put passengers whose flights are canceled or significantly delayed on another flight — even if that means paying to put them on a competing airline.

            — Increase compensation and reimbursement of expenses for passengers affected by delays and cancellations.

            — Let parents and minor children sit together without paying additional seat-assignment fees; the groups say a 2016 directive to the Transportation Department has been held up.

            — Include a seat, boarding pass, carry-on bag, personal item and water in the price of all tickets.

            It's not clear that anything Congress might do would have prevented close calls between planes last month at New York's JFK Airport, when an American Airlines plane taxied across a runway being used for takeoff by a Delta Air Lines jet, and last weekend in Austin, Texas, when air traffic controllers cleared a FedEx cargo plane to land on a runway from which a Southwest Airlines jet was taking off. In both cases, quick reactions by air traffic controllers or pilots averted disaster.

            Lawmakers pressed an FAA official and other witnesses on technology upgrades, the need for quicker evacuations during emergencies, and minimum experience for airline pilots — that was raised from 250 hours of flying time to 1,500 hours after the 2009 crash.

            Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., asked whether more exemptions to the 1,500-hour rule are needed so airlines have enough pilots to serve smaller communities.

            No, said Jason Ambrosi, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, in defending current standards for pilots.

            “We're in the safest period in aviation history right now, and a lot of that is because of these very rules,” he said.Congress began considering critical aviation legislation on Tuesday in the aftermath of recent close calls involving airline and cargo jets at airports in New York and Texas.Lawmakers celebrated the small number of deaths on airline flights in the United States since a 2009 crash that killed 50 people, but they noted the recent scary incidents.“It shows that even following the safest decade in our history, our aviation system is clearly in need of some urgent attention,” said Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803391,Illinois gun-ban incites challenges to legislative shortcuts,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — For all the fanfare and the legal rigmarole of Illinois' ban on semiautomatic weapons, it might come as a surprise to learn the legislation was titled “Insurance Code-Public Adjusters.”

            To thousands of gun owners and merchants who filed lawsuits over it, the title exemplifies the way legislators cut corners last month to enact the legislation prompted by the deadly Independence Day parade shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park.

            The ban on dozens of semiautomatic rifles and handguns took effect immediately, but enforcement is under scrutiny after a state appellate court endorsed a temporary restraining order last week in a case filed by thousands of advocates and led by Accuracy Firearms, a dealer in Effingham, 101 miles (162 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis. 











            Less than four weeks old, the provision — now known as the “Protect Illinois Communities Act"" — has prompted lawsuits at a rate of more than one every four days. Four cases have landed in federal court, arguing a straightforward principle: the ban violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

            The others take a different track, generally alleging in circuit courts that the process violated requirements from the Illinois Constitution that legislation get three public readings on three separate days in both houses, and that each bill be limited to a single subject.

            Additionally, an argument from Accuracy Firearms — which prompted a restraining order with statewide implications from the 5th District Appellate Court — states the law violates the constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law by exempting certain classes of people, such as corrections officers and retired police.

            “Perhaps some of the plaintiffs’ training is equal to, or superior to, that of the exempted classes,” the appellate court said in its opinion granting the temporary restraining order. 

            Given the checkerboard judicial enforcement history of the single-subject and three-readings rules, the appellate court was less sanguine about the gun-rights advocates' chances on those points. But nothing prevents Accuracy Firearms pressing those complaints when the case returns to circuit court, the company's lawyer Thomas DeVore said. 

            The proposal that became the weapons law was introduced more than a year ago as an Insurance Code change specifying duties and contractual obligations between a public adjuster and an insurance-coverage holder. It was “read” — that means by title only — on three separate days in the House and two in the Senate. 

            Just before the final Senate reading on Jan. 9, the weapons ban was substituted as the subject — a routine tactic known colloquially as a “gut and replace."" In a General Assembly solidly under Democrats' control, the new content hastily won Senate approval, succeeded in a mere concurrence vote in the House and was sent to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker to become a gun ban. 

            “It no longer addressed the issue of insurance adjusters and their contracts, as its new subject was now modifying completely different laws,” alleges a lawsuit led by Rep. Dan Caulkins, a Republican from Decatur, 182 miles (293 kilometers) south of Chicago. As a new bill, it warranted three new House readings, Caulkins argued.

            On the single-subject front, Accuracy Firearms contends the law runs far afield of a solitary decree by ordering investigations into human trafficking, changing rules for Illinois State Police technology procurement, modifying firearms restraining orders and more. 

            The single-subject rule is older than Illinois itself. It dates to 1795 when an approval to sell large swaths of land to presumably favored companies was buried in Georgia legislation, according to a 2009 Loyola University Law Journal article by Michael Kasper. He is a former Illinois House parliamentarian who now represents Democratic Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch in three state-court gun lawsuits. 

            After decades of silence, the Illinois Supreme Court cracked down on single-subject shenanigans in several high-profile cases in the late 1990s, invalidating, for example, legislation that raised the gasoline tax to finance leaking underground storage-tank cleanup, which drew necessary votes by also creating the state’s first sex-offender registry, Kasper wrote. 

            But the court typically has liberally interpreted its requirement of a “natural and logical connection” among subjects of a single bill. 

            It's been even less zealous on the three-readings rule, aside from a 1990s case in which the high court noted the Legislature's “remarkably poor self-discipline in policing itself.""

            The Legislature's own rules rules allow changes along the three-readings route, Kasper said. The separate readings provide pauses in the action for amendments, said Ann Lousin, a University of Illinois-Chicago constitutional law professor. 

            “There’s nothing about it that says you have to go to a committee and hold public hearings,” said Lousin, who was a research assistant to Illinois’ 1970 Constitutional Convention and later House parliamentarian under Republican Speaker W. Robert Blair. “People think it’s public hearings, but it’s three readings.”

            Both Kasper and Lousin agree there's little chance of succeeding on a three-readings challenge because of the so-called enrolled bill rule. It essentially states a law cannot be challenged if both the House speaker and Senate president certify that all the rules were followed. Although appearing ripe for abuse, this 1970 addition to the constitution replaced a rule that often generated circuitous, complicated legal action over procedure and how action was recorded, according to Lousin. 

            “The way it is today, the Illinois Supreme Court doesn’t seem to think much of the single-subject rule,"" Lousin said. “The three-readings rule, at the moment, they’re continuing to say that’s protected by the enrolled bill rule doctrine.""

            Follow Political Writer John O’Connor at https://twitter.com/apoconnorSPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — For all the fanfare and the legal rigmarole of Illinois' ban on semiautomatic weapons, it might come as a surprise to learn the legislation was titled “Insurance Code-Public Adjusters.”To thousands of gun owners and merchants who filed lawsuits over it, the title exemplifies the way legislators cut corners last month to enact the legislation prompted by the deadly Independence Day parade shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park.The ban on dozens of semiautomatic rifles and handguns took effect immediately, but enforcement is under scrutiny after a state appellate court endorsed a temporary restraining order last week in a case filed by thousands of advocates and led by Accuracy Firearms, a dealer in Effingham, 101 miles (162 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis.Less than four weeks old, the provision — now known as the “Protect Illinois Communities Act"" — has prompted lawsuits at a rate of more than one every four days. Four cases have landed in federal court, arguing a straightforward principle: the ban violates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.The others take a different track, generally alleging in circuit courts that the process violated requirements from the Illinois Constitution that legislation get three public readings on three separate days in both houses, and that each bill be limited to a single subject.Additionally, an argument from Accuracy Firearms — which prompted a restraining order with statewide implications from the 5th District Appellate Court — states the law violates the constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law by exempting certain classes of people, such as corrections officers and retired police.“Perhaps some of the plaintiffs’ training is equal to, or superior to, that of the exempted classes,” the appellate court said in its opinion granting the temporary restraining order.Given the checkerboard judicial enforcement history of the single-subject and three-readings rules, the appellate court was less sanguine about the gun-rights advocates' chances on those points.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803392,Analysis: Biden confronts doubters with State of the Union,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden stepped to the rostrum for his State of the Union address at what should be a high point of his presidency. He's repeatedly beaten the odds with a string of legislative accomplishments and a historically strong midterm election where Democrats held the line against Republicans. His steadfast support for Ukraine has won praise. The cloud of the pandemic has lifted.

            But on Tuesday night, he found himself facing a problem that has shadowed him for years — doubt. 

            Polls show a majority of Americans are largely unaware of his successes and don't approve of his job performance. Even Democrats question whether he should run for reelection amid concerns about his age.











            It all added up to a particularly high-stakes moment for Biden, providing him with his last, best opportunity to make his case for why he deserves a second term before a formal campaign announcement.

            He left no doubt that he believes he has more work to do as president. Addressing Republicans who recently won control of the House, Biden said “the people sent us a clear message” about the need to find common ground. 

            “We’ve been sent here to finish the job,” he said.

            Although Biden frequently used the language of cooperation, he slipped in a few digs at the other party, such as when he talked about Republicans who voted against his infrastructure law but still celebrate the money being used in their districts. 

            “Don't worry,” he said. “I promised to be the president for all Americans. We'll fund these projects. And I’ll see you at the groundbreaking!”

            At another point, Biden accused Republicans of trying to curtail Social Security and Medicare benefits for older Americans, provoking shouts of “liar” from his critics. 

            Veering from the text of his speech, Biden responded with a grin. “Anybody who doubts it, contact my office, I'll give you a copy of the proposal."" It was a thrust and parry more likely to be found on a debate stage than in a State of the Union. 

            Now it's just a matter of waiting for Biden to reveal his decision on whether he'll run again. He's promised an announcement early this year. 

            “Until the moment when he makes that pronouncement, that's still that question that hangs over every word that he utters,"" said Patrick Gaspard, a former White House political director and top official at the Democratic National Committee.

            Gaspard, who is currently president of the liberal Center for American Progress, said the State of the Union ""is often considered the opening bid in an argument for reelection. And in this situation, it’s certainly the case.”

            American presidents almost never forgo a shot at a second term. The last one was Lyndon Johnson, who did not seek reelection in 1968 after his presidency became unmoored by the Vietnam War. 

            But there's also never been a president as old as Biden. He's 80, and would be 86 at the end of a second term. He first ran for the White House in 1988.

            “I’m not new to this place,"" Biden acknowledged in his speech. ""I stand here tonight having served as long as about any one of you has ever served here.”

            Lyndsay Chervinsky, a presidential historian, said Biden's age is “the X factor” that differentiates him from his predecessors. Even when other presidents faced low approval ratings during their first term, “no one was suggesting that they not run.”

            “If he was ten years younger, none of these conversations would be happening,"" she said. 

            Biden gave a glimpse of his campaign pitch on Friday in Philadelphia, when he spoke at a Democratic National Committee meeting. He rattled off legislative accomplishments, some of which were achieved after they were left for dead in Congress, and blasted Republicans as “extremists,"" even calling them “nuts” at one point. 

            “Let me ask you a simple question. Are you with me?” he said to the cheering crowd, which responded by chanting, “Four more years!”

            Political appearances rarely draw the same attention as the State of the Union. Last year, 38 million people tuned in, compared to nearly 100 million who watched the Super Bowl. 

            Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said the challenge is to find the right way to harness that fleeting focus.

            “The speech will probably be remembered for two or three lines,” he said. “He has to decide which he wants those to be.“

            Judging by the text, Biden wants that line to be “finish the job,” a phrase included no less than a dozen times. Whether it's increasing taxes on billionaires, preventing police brutality or lowering insulin costs, Biden said he wants to “finish the job.”

            It may not have been a campaign announcement, but it's an implicit request for voters to stick with him. 

            Biden plans to travel to Wisconsin on Wednesday and Florida on Thursday to continue pushing his agenda, part of an administration-wide plan for top officials to fan out across the country this week. 

            After a Democratic midterm showing that was strong by historical averages in a president's first term, Biden has successfully tamped down handwringing within his party over whether he should seek another term. No primary opponent has emerged.

            And he has a record to build upon. He's also secured investments in infrastructure, computer chip manufacturing and financial incentives to encourage Americans to adopt cleaner technologies for fighting climate change. 

            “At the end of the day, you can’t argue with the extraordinary accomplishments, more than almost any other modern president, that President Biden has achieved, again, under the toughest of circumstances,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a Sunday interview with CNN's “State of the Union.”

            However, Biden still faces skepticism from the country at large. 

            Only 37% of Democrats say they want Biden to seek a second term, down from 52% before the midterm elections in November, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 

            Victories in Congress to the contrary, many Americans don't see him making progress either. 

            A new Washington Post-ABC News poll said 36% of Americans believe Biden has accomplished “a great deal” or “a good amount"" since taking office, while 62% said he's done “not very much” or “little or nothing.""

            Cedric Richmond, a former top White House official who is now a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, says the numbers don't concern him. 

            “When you hit a campaign, and you’re going to spend the kind of money that campaigns cost now, people will get inundated” with reminders of changes that Biden has made during his administration, he said. 

            Right now, Richmond said, “people are more focused on their lives than political commentary and polls and all of those things.”

            Now the question is whether Biden's big speech shifted voters' focus to him — and got them to see the country his same way.

            Attorneys for Anthony Sanchez, 44, asked the Court of Criminal Appeals for an evidentiary hearing, and say his convictions and sentences should be vacated. In their filing, attorneys allege that Sanchez's father, Thomas Glen Sanchez, is the actual killer. Thomas Sanchez died last year. A former girlfriend of Thomas Sanchez claims he confessed more than once to killing 21-year-old Juli Busken, but that she was afraid to come forward until after he died.

            Busken, from Benton, Arkansas, had just completed her last semester at OU when she was abducted on Dec. 20, 1996, from her Norman apartment complex. Her body was found that evening in southeast Oklahoma City. She had been raped and shot in the head.











            The slaying went unsolved for years until DNA recovered from her clothes linked Anthony Sanchez to the crime. He was convicted of rape and murder — and sentenced to die in 2006.

            Former Cleveland County District Attorney Tim Kuykendall said that while the DNA evidence was perhaps the most compelling, there was other evidence that linked Anthony Sanchez to the killing, including ballistic evidence and a shoe print found at the crime scene.

            “I know from spending a lot of time on that case, there is not one piece of evidence that pointed to anyone other than Anthony Sanchez,” Kuykendall said. ""I don't care if a hundred people or a thousand people confess to killing Juli Busken.

            “I think this is just a ploy by his family and defense team to detract from his guilt.”

            It's the first trade between the Heat and Spurs. Miami had made at least one other trade with every other NBA franchise.

            Lowry is averaging 12.0 points and 5.3 assists on 39.6% shooting this season, numbers all down from a year ago when Miami went into the Eastern Conference playoffs as the No. 1 seed. He will miss games against Indiana on Wednesday, versus Houston on Friday and at Orlando on Saturday.

            He didn't play Saturday at Milwaukee because of what the Heat called left knee soreness. The Heat will re-evaluate him next week, when Miami has two more games before the All-Star break.











            “I think this is just what you deal with in a long NBA season,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Tuesday. “There’s going to be unpredictable things. The encouraging thing about it is there doesn’t need to be a procedure or anything like that. We just need to calm it down and that’s where we are right now.”

            The last time Lowry's scoring average was this low was the 2012-13 season, the last time he had so few assists per game was 2009-10 — and the only season where he had a lower shooting percentage was a 10-game stint in his rookie year, 2006-07.

            He turns 37 next month. The six-time All-Star is in the second year of a three-year, $85 million deal with Miami.

We just need to calm it down and that’s where we are right now.”The last time Lowry's scoring average was this low was the 2012-13 season, the last time he had so few assists per game was 2009-10 — and the only season where he had a lower shooting percentage was a 10-game stint in his rookie year, 2006-07.He turns 37 next month. The six-time All-Star is in the second year of a three-year, $85 million deal with Miami.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803396,Jessica Pegula reveals her mother Kim Pegula's health crisis,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Pro tennis player Jessica Pegula has revealed that her mother, Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres co-owner and president Kim Pegula, went into cardiac arrest in June and is still recovering while dealing with significant language and memory issues.

            In an essay that The Players' Tribune published Tuesday, Jessica Pegula detailed for the first time the medical crisis that abruptly removed her mother from the public eye and suggested that her mother may not resume the same level of involvement in the family's sports franchises. 

            Kim Pegula, she wrote, went into cardiac arrest while sleeping and received lifesaving CPR from another daughter until paramedics arrived and restored her heartbeat. The family previously said only that Kim Pegula was receiving medical care for “some unexpected health issues” that arose shortly after she celebrated her 53rd birthday.











            “My mom is working hard in her recovery, she is improving, but where she ends up is still unknown,” Jessica Pegula, 28, wrote. 

            She said she decided to write about her mother's ordeal after Bills player Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest on the field during a Jan. 2 game in Cincinnati in what Pegula described as “some bizarre, messed-up, full circle moment.”

            “My stomach sunk because it felt like the exact same thing all over again. I was sitting on the bench for a tennis event in Sydney, Australia. I wanted to throw up,” wrote Jessica Pegula, who is No. 4 in the WTA's singles rankings. ""I was supposed to go on for mixed doubles in 15 minutes and I remember telling one of my teammates, `I am a little freaked out right now, this is too close to home, and I feel like I am going to have a panic attack.'”

            As Hamlin began his recovery, Jessica Pegula joined in an outpouring of support from fans and the NFL and wore a white screen-printed patch with Hamlin’s uniform number while playing at the Australian Open. ""It didn’t feel like it was just for him, it felt like it was for my mom as well,” she said.

            Jessica Pegula had been home in Florida months earlier when she got a call from her sister, Kelly, around midnight on their mother's birthday and learned that their mother was being rushed to the hospital. 

            “My mom was asleep when my dad woke up to her going into cardiac arrest and she was unresponsive for quite a while,” she wrote. Kelly Pegula, who was staying with their parents, performed CPR — just three months after telling her family that she planned to become certified in the procedure for a job.

            “I remember her telling us what she was doing in our family group chat,” Jessica Pegula wrote, ""and my mom even responded, `Nice Kells! Now if we have a heart attack you can revive us.'”

            Today, Kim Pegula “can read, write, and understand pretty well, but she has trouble finding the words to respond,” Jessica Pegula wrote. ""It is hard to deal with and it takes a lot of patience to communicate with her, but I thank God every day that we can still communicate with her at all. The doctors continue to be blown away by her recovery, considering where she started, and her determination is the driving force of that.”

            As the first woman to serve as president of an NHL and NFL team at the same time, Kim Pegula ""lived it and loved it, and it was felt by everyone she met,” Jessica Pegula wrote. “Now we come to the realization that all of that is most likely gone. That she won’t be able to be that person anymore.”BUFFALO, N.Y.

            The 58-year-old woman's eyes darted around in shock and relief as a rescue crew covered her in a bright pink and green fuzzy blanket. Dressed only in shorts and a T-shirt, she had survived through freezing temperatures in Kahramanmaras. 

            Her son, Mufit Hisir, told The Associated Press that firefighters who flew in from Antalya had rescued his relatives. 











            “Two hours ago my sibling was rescued after a six-hour effort. And my mother’s rescue took two hours. They’re both well,” he said.

            Crowds gathered at wreckage sites throughout Turkey, vapor showing the air as people breathed in and out in anticipation of reaching more survivors. Even those who had emerged or escaped collapse in Monday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake and its aftershocks now had to sleep in cars, outside or in government shelters. 

            Many felt abandoned. 

            “We don’t have a tent, we don’t have a heating stove, we don’t have anything. Our children are in bad shape. We are all getting wet under the rain and our kids are out in the cold,"" Aysan Kurt, 27, told the AP. ""We did not die from hunger or the earthquake, but we will die freezing from the cold. It shouldn’t be this way. No one is sending help.”

            In the province of Kahramanmaras, where supermarket shelves were empty, people lined up for pita bread at a restaurant owned by Mevlut Ercan. 

            “We need flour. There is no flour,” Ercan said. “People are desperate. We are desperate too. We will do what we can for the people as long as we are able to do it.”

            Yasar Magara, who waited to get a piece of pita, said: “We have been hungry for days. Our municipality and the others have not helped us yet.”

            In the town of Nurdagi, residents who lost loved ones said relatives could have been saved if rescue teams had arrived earlier. Steel rods jutted out of destroyed concrete like vines that rescuers had to work around in the town nestled below snowcapped hills.

            “My sister has four children. She has one sister-in-law, in-laws and nephews and nieces. They’re all gone. They’re all gone,” Nilufer Sarigoz said, putting her face in her hands and sobbing. 

            Men cried as they used their hands to bless four dead bodies wrapped in blankets in the back of a pickup truck. 

            Sixteen-year-old Havva Topal still hadn't heard from her uncle, his wife and children, who were in a burning building.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803398,Microsoft bakes ChatGPT-like tech into search engine Bing,"REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence.

            The revamping of Microsoft’s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology. 

            Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology at an event Tuesday at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.











            “Think of it as faster, more accurate, more powerful” than ChatGPT, built with technology from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI but tuned for search queries, said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who leads its consumer division, in an interview.

            A public preview of the new Bing launched Tuesday for desktop users who sign up for it, but Mehdi said the technology will scale to millions of users in coming weeks and will eventually come to the smartphone apps for Bing and Edge. For now, everyone can try a limited number of queries, he said. 

            The strengthening partnership with OpenAI has been years in the making, starting with a $1 billion investment from Microsoft in 2019 that led to the development of a powerful supercomputer specifically built to train the San Francisco startup’s AI models.

            While it’s not always factual or logical, ChatGPT’s mastery of language and grammar comes from having ingested a huge trove of digitized books, Wikipedia entries, instruction manuals, newspapers and other online writings.

            Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday that new AI advances are ""going to reshape every software category we know,"" including search, much like earlier innovations in personal computers and cloud computing. He said it is important to develop AI ""with human preferences and societal norms and you’re not going to do that in a lab. You have to do that out in the world.”

            The shift to making search engines more conversational — able to confidently answer questions rather than offering links to other websites — could change the advertising-fueled search business, but also poses risks if the AI systems don’t get their facts right. Their opaqueness also makes it hard to source back to the original human-made images and texts they’ve effectively memorized, though the new Bing includes annotations that reference the source data.

            “Bing is powered by AI, so surprises and mistakes are possible,” is a message that appears at the bottom of the preview version of Bing's new homepage. “Make sure to check the facts.”

            As an example of how it works, Mehdi asked the new Bing to compare the most influential Mexican painters and it provided typical search results, but also, on the right side of the page, compiled a fact box summarizing details about Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and Jose Clemente Orozco. In another example, he quizzed it on 1990s-era rap, showing its ability to distinguish between the song “Jump” by Kris Kross and “Jump Around” by House of Pain. And he used it to show how it could plan a vacation or help with shopping.

            Gartner analyst Jason Wong said new technological advancements will mitigate what led to Microsoft's disastrous 2016 launch of the experimental chatbot Tay, which users trained to spout racist and sexist remarks. But Wong said “reputational risks will still be at the forefront” for Microsoft if Bing produces answers with low accuracy or so-called AI “hallucinations” that mix and conflate data.

            Google has been cautious about such moves. But in response to pressure over ChatGPT’s popularity, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday announced a new conversational service named Bard that will be available exclusively to a group of “trusted testers” before being widely released later this year. 

            Wong said Google was caught off-guard with the success of ChatGPT but still has the advantage over Microsoft in consumer-facing technology, while Microsoft has the edge in selling its products to businesses.

            Chinese tech giant Baidu also this week announced a similar search chatbot coming later this year, according to Chinese media. Other tech rivals such as Facebook parent Meta and Amazon have been researching similar technology, but Microsoft’s latest moves aim to position it at the center of the ChatGPT zeitgeist. 

            Microsoft disclosed in January that it was pouring billions more dollars into OpenAI as it looks to fuse the technology behind ChatGPT, the image-generator DALL-E and other OpenAI innovations into an array of Microsoft products tied to its cloud computing platform and its Office suite of workplace products like email and spreadsheets.

            The most surprising might be the integration with Bing, which is the second-place search engine in many markets but has never come close to challenging Google’s dominant position.

            Bing launched in 2009 as a rebranding of Microsoft’s earlier search engines and was run for a time by Nadella, years before he took over as CEO. Its significance was boosted when Yahoo and Microsoft signed a deal for Bing to power Yahoo’s search engine, giving Microsoft access to Yahoo’s greater search share. Similar deals infused Bing into the search features for devices made by other companies, though users wouldn’t necessarily know that Microsoft was powering their searches.

            By making it a destination for ChatGPT-like conversations, Microsoft could invite more users to give Bing a try, though the new version so far is limited to desktops and doesn't yet have an interface for smartphones — where most people now access the internet.

            On the surface, at least, a Bing integration seems far different from what OpenAI has in mind for its technology. Appearing at Microsoft's event, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the ""the new Bing experience looks fantastic” and is based in part on learnings from its GPT line of large language models. He said a key reason for his startup's Microsoft partnership is to help get OpenAI technology “into the hands of millions of people.”

            OpenAI has long voiced an ambitious vision for safely guiding what’s known as AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a not-yet-realized concept that harkens back to ideas from science fiction about human-like machines. OpenAI’s website describes AGI as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”

            OpenAI started out as a nonprofit research laboratory when it launched in December 2015 with backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”

            That changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT model for generating human-like paragraphs of readable text.

            OpenAI’s other products include the image-generator DALL-E, first released in 2021, the computer programming assistant Codex and the speech recognition tool Whisper.REDMOND, Wash.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803399,Disney faces losing control of its kingdom with Florida bill,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Disney’s government in Florida has been the envy of any private business, with its unprecedented powers in deciding what to build and how to build it at the Walt Disney World Resort, issuing bonds and holding the ability to build its own nuclear plant if it wanted. 

            Those days are numbered as a new bill released this week puts the entertainment giant’s district firmly in the control of Florida’s governor and legislative leaders in what some see as punishment for Disney's opposition to the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature.

            “Disney won't like it because they're not in control,"" said Richard Foglesong, professor emeritus at Rollins College, who wrote a definitive account of Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District in his book, “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.""











            With that loss of control comes an uncertainty about how Disney's revamped government and Walt Disney World, which it governs, will work together — whether the left hand always will be in sync with the right hand as it has been with the company overseeing both entities. 

            The uniqueness of Disney' government, where building inspectors examine black box structures holding thrill rides instead of office buildings, also complicates matters. The district essentially runs a midsize city. On any given day, as many as 350,000 people are on Disney World's 27,000 acres (11,000 hectares) as theme park visitors, overnight hotel guests or employees. The 55-year-old district has to manage the traffic, dispose of the waste and control the plentiful mosquitoes.

            “What kind of control is preferable? Control by a private business or corporation, or control by appointed officials, appointed by governor of the state?"" Foglesong said. “Will they have the expertise to be able to make the new district work as efficiently as the old district works?""

            The bill prohibits anybody who has worked or had a contract with a theme park or entertainment complex in the past three years, or their relatives, from serving on the revamped district's board of supervisors, a prohibition that some experts say eliminates people with expertise in the field.

            The bill's sponsor, Florida Rep. Fred Hawkins, a Republican from St. Cloud, defended the exclusion Tuesday.

            “This was a provision I requested,"" Hawkins said. “We want to try to avoid any conflicts of interest of the new board members.""

            Under the bill's proposals, Florida’s governor appoints the five-member board of supervisors to the renamed Central Florida Tourism Oversight District instead of Disney. Limits would be placed on the district's autonomy by making it subject to oversight and regulation by state agencies, and it would be unable to adopt any codes that conflict with state regulations. The district also would no longer have the ability, if it wanted, to own and operate an airport, stadium, convention center or nuclear power plant.

            DeSantis started gunning for Disney's private government last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposed what critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” law, which bars instruction on sexual orientation, gender identity and other lessons deemed not age-appropriate in kindergarten through third grade. Republican critics of the Disney district also argued it has given the company an unfair advantage over rivals in issuing bonds and financing expansion.

            The Legislature passed a bill last year to dissolve the Disney government by June 2023.

            Lawmakers are meeting this week for a special session to complete the state takeover of the district and approve other key conservative priorities of the governor on immigration and voter fraud. A Senate committee approved separate bills Tuesday to expand the governor's migrant relocation program and allow the statewide prosecutor to bring election crime charges.

            Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, called the Disney bill on Monday a “power grab"" by DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate who has emerged as a fierce opponent of what he describes as “woke"" policies on race, gender and public health. Such positions endear him to the GOP’s conservative base but threaten to alienate independents and moderate voters in both parties who are influential in presidential politics.

            The changes proposed in the legislation were welcomed by at least one group of Reedy Creek employees — firefighters who have clashed in the past with district leaders.

(AP) — Disney’s government in Florida has been the envy of any private business, with its unprecedented powers in deciding what to build and how to build it at the Walt Disney World Resort, issuing bonds and holding the ability to build its own nuclear plant if it wanted.Those days are numbered as a new bill released this week puts the entertainment giant’s district firmly in the control of Florida’s governor and legislative leaders in what some see as punishment for Disney's opposition to the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature.“Disney won't like it because they're not in control,"" said Richard Foglesong, professor emeritus at Rollins College, who wrote a definitive account of Disney's Reedy Creek Improvement District in his book, “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.""With that loss of control comes an uncertainty about how Disney's revamped government and Walt Disney World, which it governs, will work together — whether the left hand always will be in sync with the right hand as it has been with the company overseeing both entities.The uniqueness of Disney' government, where building inspectors examine black box structures holding thrill rides instead of office buildings, also complicates matters. The district essentially runs a midsize city. On any given day, as many as 350,000 people are on Disney World's 27,000 acres (11,000 hectares) as theme park visitors, overnight hotel guests or employees. The 55-year-old district has to manage the traffic, dispose of the waste and control the plentiful mosquitoes.“What kind of control is preferable? Control by a private business or corporation, or control by appointed officials, appointed by governor of the state?"" Foglesong said. “Will they have the expertise to be able to make the new district work as efficiently as the old district works?""The bill prohibits anybody who has worked or had a contract with a theme park or entertainment complex in the past three years, or their relatives, from serving on the revamped district's board of supervisors, a prohibition that some experts say eliminates people with expertise in the field.The bill's sponsor, Florida Rep. Fred Hawkins, a Republican from St. Cloud, defended the exclusion Tuesday.“This was a provision I requested,"" Hawkins said. “We want to try to avoid any conflicts of interest of the new board members.""Under the bill's proposals, Florida’s governor appoints the five-member board of supervisors to the renamed Central Florida Tourism Oversight District instead of Disney. Limits would be placed on the district's autonomy by making it subject to oversight and regulation by state agencies, and it would be unable to adopt any codes that conflict with state regulations. The district also would no longer have the ability, if it wanted, to own and operate an airport, stadium, convention center or nuclear power plant.DeSantis started gunning for Disney's private government last year when the entertainment giant publicly opposed what critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” law, which bars instruction on sexual orientation, gender identity and other lessons deemed not age-appropriate in kindergarten through third grade. Republican critics of the Disney district also argued it has given the company an unfair advantage over rivals in issuing bonds and financing expansion.The Legislature passed a bill last year to dissolve the Disney government by June 2023.Lawmakers are meeting this week for a special session to complete the state takeover of the district and approve other key conservative priorities of the governor on immigration and voter fraud. A Senate committee approved separate bills Tuesday to expand the governor's migrant relocation program and allow the statewide prosecutor to bring election crime charges.Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, called the Disney bill on Monday a “power grab"" by DeSantis, a potential 2024 presidential candidate who has emerged as a fierce opponent of what he describes as “woke"" policies on race, gender and public health. Such positions endear him to the GOP’s conservative base but threaten to alienate independents and moderate voters in both parties who are influential in presidential politics.The changes proposed in the legislation were welcomed by at least one group of Reedy Creek employees — firefighters who have clashed in the past with district leaders. Tim Stromsnes, a spokesperson for Reedy Creek Professional Firefighters Local 2117, said all the current board cares about is “bonds and low-interest loans for building Disney infrastructure, and zero about treating its employees fairly.""“We think they are going to be more receptive to first responders,"" Stomsnes said Tuesday of the proposed new board. “They're calling the governor a fascist for doing this ... but he is actually fixing a fascist, Disney-owned government.""To the relief of taxpayers in neighboring Orange and Osceola counties, the district won't be dissolved, a prospect that had raised fears that the counties would have to absorb the district's responsibilities and raise property taxes significantly.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803402,Navy divers begin pulling up Chinese spy balloon debris,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Navy divers began pulling pieces of the downed Chinese spy balloon from the depths of the ocean floor on Tuesday, using sophisticated reconnaissance drones dubbed the Kingfish and the Swordfish to locate the debris.

            After collecting all of the balloon's white fabric and shell structure found floating on the surface, the Navy has now shifted to an all-underwater search for the remnants of the massive balloon that a U.S. fighter jet shot down off the coast of South Carolina on Saturday, officials said. 

            Navy and Coast Guard personnel were using underwater drones to locate and map the debris field, and divers were in the water gathering up what they could, officials said.











            The debris already collected was being hauled by small boats to a few area locations, including a Coast Guard station south of Myrtle Beach, and, depending on the size, will eventually go either to the FBI lab at Quantico, Virginia, or other sites where experts can analyze it, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details of an ongoing military operation.

            The head of U.S. Northern Command, Gen. Glen VanHerck, who is in charge of the recovery effort, and several Biden administration officials will brief members of Congress on the balloon on Wednesday and Thursday. 

            Lawmakers have raised a number of questions about whether the balloon was able to collect intelligence and transmit it back to China during the time it traveled eastward across the United States, after crossing the border from Canada into Idaho. 

            White House and Pentagon officials have largely avoided providing any details on the balloon's capabilities.

            Officials said Tuesday the U.S. was very aware of the sites the balloon crossed over — including nuclear missile silos and other military installations — and knows how to protect them from any intelligence collection. Even if the balloon was able to transmit, they said, it wasn't getting any new or important information to send.

            The officials were unwilling to provide any insight into what the U.S. has been able to glean about the balloon’s collection and transmission abilities. 

            The balloon, an estimated 200 feet (60 meters) tall, was carrying a long sensor package underneath, which VanHerck estimated was the size of a small regional jet. 

            U.S. counterintelligence teams hope to learn far more about the sensors and other equipment on the balloon as they retrieve it and study it.

            The balloon debris is scattered in waters that are about 50 feet (15 meters) deep, but stretch across an area 15 football fields long and 15 football fields across, VanHerck said. 

            In new images released Tuesday morning, sailors from Explosive Ordnance Disposal Group 2 can be seen leaning over a rigid hull inflatable boat and pulling in broad swaths of the balloon’s white outer fabric and shell structure. 

            VanHerck has also said the recovery teams were taking precautions to safeguard against the chance any part of the balloon was rigged with explosives or was dangerous in any way.

            A Navy warship, the USS Carter Hall, is heading the recovery effort, aided by three Coast Guard cutters — the Venturous, the Richard Snyder and the Nathan Bruckenthal — as well as the USNS Pathfinder, an oceanographic survey ship. A salvage ship is expected to arrive on Wednesday.

            The Pentagon said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin requested a secure call with his Chinese counterpart, Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe, on Saturday after the balloon was shot down. China declined the request, said Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803403,Man charged with homicide in slaying of police officer,"MCKEESPORT, Pa. (AP) — A man is facing homicide and other charges in the shooting and killing of one police officer, and the wounding of a second officer after they responded to a domestic disturbance call in western Pennsylvania.

            Johnathan Jermia Morris — 31, of McKeesport — is charged in Allegheny County with criminal homicide, aggravated assault and attempted murder, and assault of a law enforcement officer in the shooting Monday afternoon in McKeesport, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) south of Pittsburgh.

            Officers were called to a home shortly after noon Monday over a dispute involving a man that police said was having a “mental health crisis.” He refused to talk to them and walked away from the home, and officers were warned by a family member that he might be armed.











            When police encountered him nearby, he “suddenly produced a handgun and shot the two McKeesport officers,” said Christopher Kearns, the county's police superintendent. Thirty-two-year-old Sean Sluganski, who had worked for McKeesport police for two years, died at a hospital. A wounded officer was treated and discharged.

            After the shooting, Morris walked around a corner and fired at the third officer, who returned fire. The suspect was later listed in stable condition at a Pittsburgh-area trauma center. 

            Authorities said in a criminal complaint that two witnesses said Morris flagged them down, told them police were trying to kill him and asked them to record video. They said they saw a police cruiser pull up and another officer approach on foot, and then saw Morris pull a handgun and fire at the cruiser and the officer.

            Morris, wounded in the leg by return fire, ran to a parking lot and told two people he had been shot and needed help, authorities said. A witness putting a tourniquet on his leg reported seeing Morris pull a handgun and point it at an approaching officer, after which the final exchange of gunfire occurred, authorities said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803404,Here's why this year's Super Bowl beer ads go beyond Bud,"NEW YORK (AP) — A bevy of booze brands will be in the Super Bowl ad lineup this year, now that Anheuser-Busch has ended its exclusive advertising sponsorship after more than 30 years. 

            In addition to celebrities hawking Budweiser and Michelob Ultra, viewers will see some famous folks touting the qualities of Heineken and Coors, and even suggesting they drink cognac or whiskey — responsibly, of course. 

            Anheuser-Busch, parent of the Bud, Ultra and Busch beer brands, said in June it would end the exclusivity deal it first struck in 1989. The company is still a big presence at NFL games, sponsoring all major NFL moments during the offseason, such as the 2022 NFL Draft in Las Vegas.











            And the St. Louis, Missouri beverage giant is still the largest alcohol advertiser during the game, with three minutes of national airtime and a 30-second regional Budweiser spot. 

            On A-B's roster this year: A Bud Light ad shows actor Miles Teller and his wife Keleigh dancing to on-hold music. A regional Budweiser ad focuses on people connecting with a six-pack. A Michelob Ultra ad spotlights actor Brian Cox and tennis star Serena Williams at a new members day at the Bushwood Country Club, the golf club in “Caddyshack.” And a Busch Light ad shows singer Sarah McLachlan sharing a tent with a wolf spoofing her well-known animal-advocacy ad.

            The other alcohol brands running ads include beer brands Heineken and Molson Coors and liquor brands Remy Martin and Crown Royal, all eager to make their mark on advertising's largest stage.

            Brands pay premium dollars to advertise during the gridiron classic, which draws about 100 million viewers each year. This year, most 30-second ad blocks sold for between $6 million and $7 million — for the ad space alone. Companies spend millions more to create the ads themselves and book celebrity sponsors.

            Heineken is promoting its alcohol-free beer Heineken 0.0 with an ad that's part of its larger partnership with Marvel — the ad, under wraps until the game, will feature actor Paul Rudd as his Marvel character “Ant Man.”

            “We were really excited to hear that category opened up, and almost immediately we thought, you know, what a great way to really blow out Heineken 0.0 momentum and share that brand and that product with the wider market,” said Heineken chief marketing officer Jonnie Cahill in an interview with the AP.

            Beer sales have held steady in the U.S., but the beer category has been losing market share to other types of alcoholic drinks, said Bart Watson, chief economist for trade group Brewers Association.

            Beer's share in the alcohol market had dropped from 58% in 2000 to about 46% in 2022, while other alcoholic beverages, particularly spirits, have gained share. But overall beer barrel shipments are still up during the same time frame because the overall category has grown, according to figures tallied by the Beer Institute and Brewers Association.

            For Anheuser-Busch, the decision to end its Super Bowl exclusivity is likely about putting marketing dollars elsewhere, Watson said. 

            “You have a new generation that consumes alcohol differently and beer differently. (For A-B), to put all their eggs in this basket isn’t getting the return that maybe it once did.”

            Molson Coors is also keeping its ad for the big game under wraps. But it is attempting to make a splash as a first-time national advertiser by letting fans bet on what the ad will have in it — such as whether the game will feature its Coors Light or Miller Lite brand — via betting site DraftKings.

            Other alcohol ads have enlisted celebrities: Diageo's ad for its Crown Royal whisky will feature musician Dave Grohl. Rémy Cointreau is also using Serena Williams, in an ad that spotlights its Rémy Martin cognac. 

            Not all alcohol makers are jumping to the national stage. Boston Beer Co. is sticking to a regional spot for its Samuel Adams beer — the third year it has run a regional ad. The ad shows Bostonians imagining what would happen if everyone in the city was nice and polite.

            “Samuel Adams is a relatively small player in the beer category, so a regional approach enables us to be part of the Super Bowl conversation without having to pay the huge price tag of a national ad,"" said Lesya Lysyj, chief marketing officer. A cut of the ad will run nationally beginning the week after the Super Bowl, she added.

            Aside from alcohol, big brands including Pepsi Zero Sugar, Doritos, M&Ms, Google, Downy and Kia will all be advertising during Super Bowl LVII, which airs Sunday on Fox.NEW YORK (AP) — A bevy of booze brands will be in the Super Bowl ad lineup this year, now that Anheuser-Busch has ended its exclusive advertising sponsorship after more than 30 years.In addition to celebrities hawking Budweiser and Michelob Ultra, viewers will see some famous folks touting the qualities of Heineken and Coors, and even suggesting they drink cognac or whiskey — responsibly, of course.Anheuser-Busch, parent of the Bud, Ultra and Busch beer brands, said in June it would end the exclusivity deal it first struck in 1989.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803406,"Aid to quake-hit Syria slowed by sanctions, war's divisions","BEIRUT (AP) — Even before Monday’s devastating earthquake, getting aid to all parts of war-battered Syria was fraught with daunting political and logistical challenges.

            Those hurdles have only multiplied in the wake of the disaster that has killed thousands in Turkey and Syria and brought down thousands of buildings.

            Damage to roads and other infrastructure in southern Turkey has stalled aid from reaching northern Syria, an area already devastated by 12 years of conflict.











            Meanwhile, the government of Bashar Assad in Damascus is still a pariah in much of the international community, sanctioned by the U.S. and European countries, which are reluctant to route aid directly through the government. American and EU officials have made clear the quake won’t change that.

            Emergency workers say delays could cost lives, as local rescue crews struggle to pull families and children from the rubble and find housing for survivors amid brutal winter weather.

            A key issue complicating the dispersal of aid is “the war and the way the aid response is split between rebel areas and Damascus,” said Aron Lund, a fellow with New York-based think tank Century International who researches Syria. 

            While the majority of Syria is under the control of the government in Damascus, most of the north is controlled by different — and sometimes conflicting — groups. The northwest is divided between land de facto controlled by Turkey and by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group with ties to al-Qaida. Syria’s northeast is mostly held by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led groups.

            Foreign aid for years has been brought into northwestern Idlib province by way of Turkey, because of the difficulty of going by way of Damascus. But the area of southern Turkey traditionally used as a staging area has itself been heavily damaged by the earthquake.

            Aid delivery into northwestern Syria was “temporarily disrupted” Tuesday, a United Nations spokesperson told The Associated Press, due to infrastructure damage and difficulty with road access. 

            In particular, damage to the Hatay airport and the road to the border crossing used for aid, Bab al-Hawa, was delaying shipments, said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

            “There is also the fact that there are enormous needs in Turkey itself,” she said.

            One cause for hold-ups is that the U.N. mandate for delivering aid to the territory only allows it to enter through Bab al-Hawa crossing, Beals said. Also, international search teams may be reluctant to enter earthquake-affected areas controlled by HTS, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S.

            The group’s “presence limits the kinds of aid many donors are prepared to supply to the area,” she said.

            The government in Damascus and its allies in Russia have seized the moment to renew their push for aid to the north to be routed through Damascus. Countries opposed to Assad do not trust the Syrian authorities to effectively deliver aid to opposition areas and worry it would be diverted to benefit people and institutions linked to the government. 

            Natasha Hall, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said sending aid via Damascus to the north is not viable in practice, especially at a time of urgent need.

            “It is extremely logistically and administratively difficult to get the approvals (from Damascus),” she said. Coordination of aid is also hampered “because the government of Syria doesn’t recognize the non-governmental organizations working in northwest Syria.”

            At a press conference Tuesday in Damascus, Syrian Arab Red Crescent head Khaled Hboubati said his group is “ready to deliver relief aid to all regions of Syria, including areas not under government control.” He called for the European Union to lift its sanctions on Syria in light of the massive destruction caused by the earthquake.

            Aid convoys and rescuers from several countries, notably key ally Russia, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, and Algeria, have landed in airports in government-held Syria. 

            Still, the sanctions exacerbate the “difficult humanitarian situation,” Hboubati said.

            “There is no fuel even to send (aid and rescue) convoys, and this is because of the blockade and sanctions,” he said.

            So far, the U.S. and its allies have resisted attempts at creating a political opening by way of the disaster response. U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Monday that it would be “ironic, if not even counterproductive, for us to reach out to a government that has brutalized its people over the course of a dozen years now.”

            Price said the U.S. would continue to provide aid through “humanitarian partners on the ground.”

            Similarly, a spokesperson for the United Kingdom’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said the “sanctions regime was put in place in response to human rights violations and other abuses by the regime and their cronies.” 

            A U.S. State Department spokesperson said humanitarian assistance in government-held areas go through partner organizations instead of the government.

            “Our partners in regime-controlled areas directly deliver assistance to beneficiaries without control or direction from the Assad regime,"" they told AP. ""This is to ensure that our assistance is not diverted by malign actors or the Assad regime and reaches the intended beneficiaries.”

            One of the main groups supported by the United States and Britain is a civil defense organization in opposition-held areas known as the White Helmets; USAID Administrator Samantha Power spoke with the group's head Tuesday and “discussed how USAID can provide the most urgently needed assistance in response to the earthquake,"" her office said in a statement.

            The European Union has provided aid in all parts of Syria through U.N. and NGO partners and is trying to increase funding for humanitarian support, said European Commission spokesperson Balazs Ujvari. He said the Syrian government has not yet formally requested Europe send rescue and medical workers. 

            In theory, aid operations in government areas should not be blocked by sanctions, since both the U.S. and EU have exemptions for humanitarian aid.

            But the reality on the ground is sometimes different. For example, Lund said, banks might block transfers to pay suppliers or local workers for aid organizations for fear of running afoul of sanctions, despite the exemptions.

            Also, U.S. sanctions and to some extent EU ones try to prevent rebuilding of damaged infrastructure and property in government-held areas in the absence of a political solution, which could hamper post-earthquake recovery, Lund said.

            Meanwhile, in both parts of Syria, local emergency workers say only limited aid is reaching them. 

            “There are promises that aid will get to us but nothing has gotten here yet,” said the White Helmets’ head Raed Saleh.

            Associated Press writer Sarah El Deeb in Beirut contributed to this report.BEIRUT (AP) — Even before Monday’s devastating earthquake, getting aid to all parts of war-battered Syria was fraught with daunting political and logistical challenges.Those hurdles have only multiplied in the wake of the disaster that has killed thousands in Turkey and Syria and brought down thousands of buildings.Damage to roads and other infrastructure in southern Turkey has stalled aid from reaching northern Syria, an area already devastated by 12 years of conflict.Meanwhile, the government of Bashar Assad in Damascus is still a pariah in much of the international community, sanctioned by the U.S. and European countries, which are reluctant to route aid directly through the government. American and EU officials have made clear the quake won’t change that.Emergency workers say delays could cost lives, as local rescue crews struggle to pull families and children from the rubble and find housing for survivors amid brutal winter weather.A key issue complicating the dispersal of aid is “the war and the way the aid response is split between rebel areas and Damascus,” said Aron Lund, a fellow with New York-based think tank Century International who researches Syria.While the majority of Syria is under the control of the government in Damascus, most of the north is controlled by different — and sometimes conflicting — groups. The northwest is divided between land de facto controlled by Turkey and by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group with ties to al-Qaida. Syria’s northeast is mostly held by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led groups.Foreign aid for years has been brought into northwestern Idlib province by way of Turkey, because of the difficulty of going by way of Damascus. But the area of southern Turkey traditionally used as a staging area has itself been heavily damaged by the earthquake.Aid delivery into northwestern Syria was “temporarily disrupted” Tuesday, a United Nations spokesperson told The Associated Press, due to infrastructure damage and difficulty with road access.In particular, damage to the Hatay airport and the road to the border crossing used for aid, Bab al-Hawa, was delaying shipments, said Emma Beals, a nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.“There is also the fact that there are enormous needs in Turkey itself,” she said.One cause for hold-ups is that the U.N. mandate for delivering aid to the territory only allows it to enter through Bab al-Hawa crossing, Beals said. Also, international search teams may be reluctant to enter earthquake-affected areas controlled by HTS, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S.The group’s “presence limits the kinds of aid many donors are prepared to supply to the area,” she said.The government in Damascus and its allies in Russia have seized the moment to renew their push for aid to the north to be routed through Damascus. Countries opposed to Assad do not trust the Syrian authorities to effectively deliver aid to opposition areas and worry it would be diverted to benefit people and institutions linked to the government.Natasha Hall, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said sending aid via Damascus to the north is not viable in practice, especially at a time of urgent need.“It is extremely logistically and administratively difficult to get the approvals (from Damascus),” she said. Coordination of aid is also hampered “because the government of Syria doesn’t recognize the non-governmental organizations working in northwest Syria.”At a press conference Tuesday in Damascus, Syrian Arab Red Crescent head Khaled Hboubati said his group is “ready to deliver relief aid to all regions of Syria, including areas not under government control.” He called for the European Union to lift its sanctions on Syria in light of the massive destruction caused by the earthquake.Aid convoys and rescuers from several countries, notably key ally Russia, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, and Algeria, have landed in airports in government-held Syria.Still, the sanctions exacerbate the “difficult humanitarian situation,” Hboubati said.“There is no fuel even to send (aid and rescue) convoys, and this is because of the blockade and sanctions,” he said.So far, the U.S. and its allies have resisted attempts at creating a political opening by way of the disaster response.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803408,Big tech job cuts keep coming; Zoom latest to trim headcount,"The tech industry started the year with a wave of job cuts, around 50,000 in January alone, and there doesn’t appear to be any let up this month. The computer maker Dell said Monday that it's cutting about 6,600 jobs. Large and small tech companies went on a hiring spree in over the past several years due to a demand for their products, software and services surged with millions of people working remotely. However, even with all of the layoffs announced this year, most tech companies are still vastly larger than they were three years ago. Here’s a look at some of the companies that have announced layoffs so far.

            February 2023

            Zoom: The video-conferencing service is cutting about 1,300 jobs, or approximately 15% of its workforce.











            CEO Eric Yuan said in a blog post Tuesday that the company ramped up staffing during the COVID-19 pandemic, when businesses became increasingly reliant on its service as people worked from home. Yuan said Zoom grew three times in size within 24 months to manage demand.

            The executive said that businesses continue to depend on its service post-pandemic but that adjustments are needed.

            “The uncertainty of the global economy, and its effect on our customers, means we need to take a hard – yet important – look inward to reset ourselves so we can weather the economic environment, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom’s long-term vision,” he wrote. 

            Yuan said he was also lowering his salary for the coming fiscal year by 98% and foregoing his 2023 corporate bonus, saying he was accountable for mistakes made at the San Jose, California-based company and the actions being taken. Yuan's executive leadership team is also reducing their base salaries by 20% for the coming fiscal year and forfeiting their 2023 corporate bonuses. 

            Dell: The computer maker reduced its payroll by 5%, or about 6,600 jobs, saying that the steps it's taken to stay ahead of eroding market conditions are no longer enough. Profits have slipped over the past two quarters at the company, which employed about 133,000 people at the start of last year. The largest drop-off ever in PC deliveries was recorded last year after a surge in purchases during the pandemic. Dell's shipments dropped 16%. 

            January 2023

            
                Amazon: The e-commerce company said it must cut about 18,000 positions. That’s just a fraction of its 1.5 million-strong global workforce.

            
                Salesforce: The company lays off 10% of its workforce, about 8,000 employees.

            
                Coinbase: The cryptocurrency trading platform cuts approximately 20% of its workforce, or about 950 jobs, in a second round of layoffs in less than a year.

            
                Microsoft: The software company said it will cut about 10,000 jobs, almost 5% of its workforce.

            
                Google: The search engine giant becomes the most recent in the industry to say it must adjust, saying 12,000 workers, or about 6% of its workforce, would be let go.

            
                Spotify: The music streaming service is cutting 6% of its global workforce. It did not give a specific number of job losses. Spotify reported in its latest annual report that it had about 6,600 employees, which implies that 400 jobs are being axed.

            
                SAP: Germany-based SAP, Europe’s biggest software company, said it it cutting up to 3,000 jobs worldwide, or about 2.5% of its workforce, after a shop drop in profits.

            
                PayPal: The digital payments company says it will trim about 7% of its total workforce, or about 2,000 full-time workers, as it contends with a challenging environment. 

            IBM: Profits fell in the most recent quarter at the technology and consulting company, but it said the 3,900 job cuts announced in late January were due to earlier sale of parts of its business. IBM sold its health care data business last year and in 2021, it spun off its legacy tech division in 2021. 

            November 2022

            
                Twitter: About half of the social media platform’s staff of 7,500 was let go after it was acquired by the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk. 

            
                Lyft: The ride-hailing service said it was cutting 13% of its workforce, almost 700 employees.

            
                Meta: The parent company of Facebook laid off 11,000 people, about 13% of its workforce.

            HP: The computer maker cited economic challenges in announcing job cuts of as many as 6,000 positions over the next three years. Sales of PCs suffered the most severe drop-off ever as a surge of tech buying by millions working from home began to fade. 

            August 2022

            
                Snap: The parent company of social media platform Snapchat said that it was letting go of 20% of its staff. Snap’s staff has grown to more than 5,600 employees in recent years and the company said at the time that even after laying off more than 1,000 people, its staff would be larger than it was a year earlier.

            
                Robinhood: The company, whose app helped bring a new generation of investors to the market, announced that it would reduce headcount by about 23%, or approximately 780 people. An earlier round of layoffs last year cut 9% of its workforce.

            Smith declined to comment on the specific developments that led to the arrests more than 47 years after the killing, but said that “science finally gave us the evidence we needed.”

            A probable cause affidavit filed Tuesday in Noble County court said witnesses tied the men to Mitchell's killing and DNA evidence linked Bandy to the crime.

            Smith said that on the night of Aug. 6, 1975, Mitchell did not return home from her job at the snack bar of the Epworth Forest church camp near a lake in her hometown of North Webster, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis.

            Her parents reported her missing, and Mitchell's body was discovered the next morning in the Elkhart River about 17 miles northeast of North Webster. Smith said investigators determined that she had drowned, and the autopsy found “signs that she had fought for her life.”

            Officers have spoken to Mitchell's brother and sister, he added, saying he hopes the arrests can bring them “at least a little peace."" 

            “I cannot imagine having dealt with that for 47 years, wondering what happened,” Smith said at a news conference in Albion.

            According to the probable cause affidavit, investigators believe Bandy and Lehman “forcibly, deliberately drowned"" Mitchell after taking her to the Elkhart River in Bandy's 1971 Oldsmobile.

            In addition, the affidavit says a DNA profile was obtained through recent testing on Mitchell's clothing, which was saved along with other evidence collected in 1975. 

            Bandy voluntarily provided a DNA sample in December to state police, and testing determined that he was 13 billion times “more likely to be the contributor of the DNA in Laurel J. Mitchell’s clothing than any other unknown person.” 

            That testing came after three people who were teens at the time of of the killing tied the men to the crime based on incriminating comments made about the death, according to the affidavit. 

            One man told police in 2014 that he socialized with Bandy while in high school and that Bandy told him after Mitchell's murder that “he had committed the crime"" and also provided the location where her body was found.

            A second man told police in 2019 that he and the first witness had attended a high school party with Bandy, Lehman and others when Mitchell's murder came up. Bandy “stated he and John Wayne Lehman committed that crime, together,"" the man told investigators.

            And a Florida woman who was 16 and living in Noble County in 1975 contacted the county sheriff's department in June 2013 to say she had gone on a date with Lehman and as he was driving her home, he “admitted his involvement in a crime that he committed with his friend, Fred Bandy.""

            Lehman also told the woman details consistent with police findings when the body was found and with “anatomical findings"" from the autopsy, according to the affidavit.Two Indiana men have been charged with murder nearly a half-century after a 17-year-old girl failed to return home from her job at a church camp and was found dead in a river, state police announced Tuesday.Fred Bandy Jr., 67, of Goshen, and John Wayne Lehman, 67, of Auburn, were arrested Monday on one count each of murder in the killing of Laurel Jean Mitchell, said Capt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803429,"Georgia panel: Reforms, resources needed for election review","ATLANTA (AP) — A process recently implemented by Georgia state lawmakers to examine how county officials handle elections is likely unsustainable without more resources or reforms, according to the panel that did the first review under the law. 

            The provision in a sweeping 2021 election overhaul allows state lawmakers who represent a given county to request a review of local election officials and their practices. That sets in motion a process that ultimately could lead to the replacement of county election officials by the State Election Board.

            The first three-person review panel was appointed by the state board in August 2021 at the request of Republican lawmakers in Fulton County. The state's most populous county, Fulton, is a Democratic stronghold that includes most of the city of Atlanta and about 11% of the state's voters. 











            It has a history of problematic elections and has long been criticized by Republicans. Former President Donald Trump fixated on Fulton County in the wake of his narrow election loss in Georgia in 2020 and continues to push unfounded claims of widespread election fraud there.

            The bipartisan review panel last month completed its required report and presented its findings on Tuesday to the State Election Board. The panel recommended against a state takeover of Fulton County's elections, saying that while the county still has work to do, it had made significant improvements.

            The review panel included Stephen Day, a Democratic appointee to the Gwinnett County election board; Ricky Kittle, a Republican appointee to the Catoosa County election board; and Ryan Germany, who was until recently the longtime general counsel for the secretary of state’s office.

            The existence of the review “helped incentivize Fulton County to make improvements to their elections, but it took an enormous amount of donated work, and it is difficult to see how it is a sustainable process that can continue to positively influence election administration in Georgia without some reforms,” the panel's report said.

            In addition to observation and work done by the panel, the Atlanta-based Carter Center, which regularly monitors elections around the world, was invited to independently observe the 2022 general election in Fulton County and donated “almost 4000 people hours,” the report said.

            Members of the panel told the state board on Tuesday that it would, perhaps, be more useful to implement a more positive, proactive and periodic review process to help counties fix problems before they become systemic. 

            “It is better to be a partner than an adversary, better to improve systems before dysfunction than trying to fix them after the fact,” Day said.

            He suggested several possible approaches: a review process using retired election officials, or volunteers run through the Georgia Association of Voter Registration and Election Officials; hiring outside consultants to do reviews; or having paid staff within the secretary of state's office that travels to all 159 counties for reviews. But he said that all of those options require funding and called on state lawmakers to adequately fund the secretary of state's office.

            ""If you value elections, then let’s fully fund the staff there and give them the person power they need to do the job rather than begging for crumbs, which they seem to have to do every year in their budget,” he said.

            State Election Board Chair William Duffey said lawmakers who created the review panel process clearly thought it was necessary to have a mechanism to intervene when a county is in dire straits. But he said he doesn't want the board to be perceived “as the sheriff that runs into a county because we found a problem there.” 

            Instead, he said, he'd like the board to work proactively with the secretary of state's office and the counties to identify issues — and to establish uniform processes that can be implemented in all 159 counties. But he also said that the funding to do that is not currently available.

            Senate Ethics Committee Chairman Max Burns, a Sylvania Republican whose committee oversees election matters, said he wasn’t aware of the statements made Tuesday before the State Election Board.

            “Resources are always a challenge. I’m not aware of a specific request by the Secretary of State for resources for investigations,” said Burns, who chaired the committee when the sweeping election overhaul known as SB 202 passed.

            Burns said he believed lawmakers would be receptive to a request for money needed for specific investigations. He praised Duffey and the current board.

            “We’d like for every county to follow Georgia law,” Burns said.

            The provision of state law that allows lawmakers to request a review panel says that up to four counties may be under review at any given time. Sara Tindall Ghazal, a Democratic appointee to the State Election Board, asked the panel whether that would be feasible.

            “It would be impossible to do four counties at one time,” Kittle said, adding, “It may have been a good idea somebody had, but they really didn't think this out.”

            Associated Press writer Jeff Amy in Atlanta contributed reporting.ATLANTA (AP) — A process recently implemented by Georgia state lawmakers to examine how county officials handle elections is likely unsustainable without more resources or reforms, according to the panel that did the first review under the law.The provision in a sweeping 2021 election overhaul allows state lawmakers who represent a given county to request a review of local election officials and their practices. That sets in motion a process that ultimately could lead to the replacement of county election officials by the State Election Board.The first three-person review panel was appointed by the state board in August 2021 at the request of Republican lawmakers in Fulton County.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803430,AP source: 49ers hire Steve Wilks as defensive coordinator,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers are hiring former Carolina interim head coach Steve Wilks as their new defensive coordinator.

            A person familiar with the choice said Tuesday that Wilks will fill the void created when DeMeco Ryans was hired as head coach in Houston. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the hiring hadn't been announced.

            NFL Network first reported that Wilks got the job.











            Wilks is a longtime defensive backs coach in the NFL and has served as defensive coordinator in Cleveland and Carolina before becoming interim coach for the Panthers this season. He also was head coach for one season in Arizona but was fired after going 3-13 in 2018.

            Wilks joined the Panthers staff in 2022 and took over as coach after Matt Rhule was fired following a 1-4 start to the season. 

            Wilks got Carolina back in contention in the NFC South by going 6-6 but the Panthers were eliminated from playoff contention after blowing an 11-point fourth-quarter lead to Tampa Bay in Week 17.

            Wilks was a candidate for the full-time job in Carolina that instead went to Frank Reich. Now Wilks has a shot at running the NFL's best defense from the 2022 season with hopes of using that as a stepping stone to a head coach job the way Ryans and predecessor Robert Saleh did.

            San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan was looking for a coordinator who would keep as many defensive assistants as possible and run a similar system to the one that was so successful under Ryans. 

            “I’m trying to get something where we don’t have to turn much over,” Shanahan said last week. ""Whichever way we decide to go, whether we bring in a new guy or not, that it’s someone who can work with who we have and what we’ve accomplished here because I love the scheme that we run and I feel the foundation we have on the D-line, at linebacker, at corner, at safety, I think our players fit very well in it too, so I’m hoping to find someone who fits with us personality-wise and scheme-wise.” 

            The Niners led the NFL in points allowed (16.3 per game), yards allowed (300.6 per game) and were tied for second in takeaways (30).

            The defense has All-Pros at all three levels led by defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner and safety Talanoa Hufanga. That trio is supported by defensive tackle Arik Armstead, linebacker Dre Greenlaw and cornerback Charvarius Ward, who are all under contract for 2023.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803432,Truex determined to rebound from winless season with Gibbs,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Martin Truex Jr. contemplated retirement during last year’s winless season and needed until June to decide to return in 2023. 

            He announced his plans in his typically understated way, with a one-sentence statement: “I’m back in the 19 next year,"" it read. 

            Truex prefers to make his noise on the racetrack and did so at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum by opening his 18th full season at NASCAR's top level with a win in the exhibition Busch Light Clash. It was Truex's first victory since a Sept. 11, 2021 win at Richmond. 











            When he entered the USC locker room for his post-victory news conference with a gold medal around his neck, Truex was asked his mindset for this upcoming season. 

            “Mad,"" he said. 

            Then he clarified how determined he and his No. 19 team at Joe Gibbs Racing are to rebound from last year, when Truex went winless for the first time in seven years. And, after advancing to the championship finale in five of seven seasons, Truex failed to even make the playoffs. 

            “Just have a lot of fire in my belly to go out and change what we did last year,” he said. ""If you look at all the statistics, we had a decent year. We were consistent. We scored a lot of points. So many times that we felt like we were doing the right things, and probably should have won a couple races, and they got away from us. 

            “That was very, very frustrating. Knowing that we were doing everything we needed to do to win,” he added.

            In fairness, it wasn't a dominating year for Joe Gibbs Racing as an organization. The four drivers combined for six victories, with Christopher Bell using two playoff wins to advance into the championship final four. Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch, who has since left JGR, were both eliminated in knockout rounds. 

            Truex did everything but win, which was his downfall. He ran inside the top-10 in the standings through the entire regular season, only to miss a spot in the playoffs because NASCAR had a record-tying 19 different winners last season. 

            Truex's win was a rebound from last year's inaugural race in the Coliseum. He was one of the last to qualify for the 23-car event, was not competitive, and finished 15th. 

            “Honestly, we were probably the worst car here last year, literally. We were just God awful,” said Truex. “We barely made the race. Rode around the back and I spun out by myself on the last lap it was so bad.""

            He admitted to Saturday night nerves before the race, unable to convince himself his fast times in practice would translate into Sunday night's race. 

            Truex is also facing upheaval in his personal life as he made a rare public statement last week to announce he had split from his longtime partner, Sherry Pollex. The two first got together in 2005 and remained together during Pollex's ongoing eight-year battle with ovarian cancer. 

            ""Sherry and I have made the decision to end our relationship. I will continue supporting Sherry moving forward,"" he said in a statement. ""I would ask that you respect our privacy as there will be no further comment about this matter.”

            Whether it's personal or professional, the change in Truex was noticed by his crew chief. 

            “He’s super motivated, and we’re all behind him,"" said James Small. “I think last year was a big disappointment for all of us. He knew he’s way better than that, and he’s just ready to get going. We all just want to prove everyone wrong.”

            Next up for Truex is the Daytona 500, a race he's never won. He's 0-for-18 in “The Great American Race” despite starting on the pole in 2011. In 2016, Truex lost a photo finish to now teammate Hamlin by .010 seconds. 

            He's ready to end the drought in the Feb. 19 season-opener. 

            “I'm just wanting to go out and show them what we can do,"" Truex said. ""We’ve been very fired up this off-season, working very hard, all of us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803434,Forward Mawot Mag to miss rest of season for No. 24 Rutgers,"PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) — Junior forward Mawot Mag will miss the rest of the season for No. 24 Rutgers after tearing the ACL in his right knee.

            Rutgers announced the injury Tuesday, hours before the Scarlet Knights were to play at No. 18 Indiana. Mag was hurt Saturday in the first half of a game against Michigan State, a 61-55 win.

            Mag, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, started every game for Rutgers this season, averaging 7.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and a steal. His best performance came in an overtime win over Ohio State when he scored a career-high 15 points and added a late 3-pointer to give the Scarlet Knights breathing room in a 68-64 decision.











            Aundre Hyatt, a junior who has been averaging 9.4 points and 4.2 rebounds off the bench, is expected to replace Mag in the starting lineup.

            “We’re going to miss Mawot greatly,” coach Steve Pikiell said. “He’s a high-energy player, a veteran presence and the ultimate glue-guy. He’s one of our best team defenders and one of our best offensive rebounders. There’s not a better person in our program.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803436,States push to enshrine protections for tribal children,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Leo Thompson received plenty of love, food and shelter from the non-Native American family who raised them, but missed out on any exposure to their Indigenous culture, heritage, ancestors and community.

            “The only time they acknowledged my heritage was when they’d make passive comments like, ‘Oh, you know, you’ve always liked that Native American stuff,'"" said Thompson, who lives in Missoula, Montana. “That stuff that they so casually referred to is not casual at all. It’s the practices of my ancestors. It’s the very same culture that’s healed my soul. Reconnecting with my heritage as an adult has been a long and arduous journey.”

            Montana is one of a handful U.S. states — along with Wyoming, Utah and North Dakota — considering legislation this year to keep more Native American children from enduring similar experiences by including provisions of the U.S. Indian Child Welfare Act in state law. 











            The states are driven by concerns that Supreme Court challenges have put the federal law in jeopardy. During a hearing last year, the justices seemed likely to leave in place most of the law that gives preference to Native American families in foster care and adoption proceedings involving Native children. The law also requires child welfare agencies to provide services to help Native families move toward reunification.

            Ten other states have similar laws in place, including New Mexico, whose law took effect this year, and they too could be affected, depending on how the justices rule. Most federally recognized tribes want the act upheld, fearing that an adverse ruling could dismantle a whole range of federal laws based on their political relationships with the U.S. government. 

            Thompson, who uses she/they pronouns, shared their story during a recent legislative hearing on a bill sponsored by Montana Democratic Rep. Jonathan Windy Boy. 

            The federal Indian Child Welfare Act was passed by Congress in 1978 in response to the alarming rate at which Native American and Alaskan Native children were taken from their homes by public and private agencies. From 1887-1969, Native children were placed in boarding schools that used abusive practices to assimilate them into white society. Many were adopted by non-Native families, often depriving them of their tribal and cultural heritage.

            The law has helped change that, but there is still work to do.

            In Montana, nearly 11% of all children are Indigenous but they made up 37% of those in foster care in 2021, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association. About 9% of North Dakota children are Indigenous, but account for 44% of the children in foster care, the association said.

            “I have witnessed and experienced the benefits of keeping a child within the care of their family where he stays connected, rooted and knows who he is and where he comes from,” Sharen Kickingwoman, with the ACLU of Montana. testified. “We know from our experiences and research that affirming Indigenous identity, especially for youth, is some of the strongest things you can do to enhance resilience amidst adverse childhood experiences.”

            Wyoming’s effort is furthest along, having passed the Senate 20-11. In Utah, tribes and statewide officials support the proposal, yet lawmakers held it in a legislative committee during the final week of January amid questions about whether it was needed yet and despite a request by Navajo Nation leaders to pass it. 

            Bills in Montana and North Dakota have had committee hearings but no votes, while a South Dakota bill was rejected this week.

            One aspect of the case awaiting a Supreme Court ruling argued that the Indian Child Welfare Act amounts to federal overreach, and that such protections should be enacted in state law. Another argument is the act provides race-based protections that violate the equal protection guarantee in the Constitution. Native Americans argue the measure is a government-to-government agreement between the U.S. and sovereign tribal nations that, like the U.S., determine citizenship in ways that aren't based on race. 

            No one testified against the proposed policy during a Montana hearing, while supporters testified about the importance of family relationships within tribes. 

            Kickingwoman, a member of the Gros Ventre and Blackfeet nations, said Native societies are built around kinship. Kickingwoman said she’s been honored to provide guardianship to many of her relatives, including her cousin's son, who she said by mainstream society's standards would be considered a distant relative,"" but to her is a son.

            “A lot of our extended families and friends are close kin in relation to us,” she said. “What may be on paper seen as a second or third cousin really is a brother or sister, maybe a niece or a nephew.”

            Keegan Modrano, a policy director with the ACLU of Montana who is Muscogee Creek, also was raised by a non-Native family, and was therefore deprived of being raised with their cultural practices, language or people. 

            “I can not fully ever completely express the incompleteness I feel living my life,” Modrano told the committee.

            “My younger self wants nothing more than a Native father figure in my life. My younger self wants nothing more than a Native mother, for cousins and kin, aunties and uncles,"" they said. ""I cannot rest and I will fight every day so that no other Indian child feels that loss or experiences child removal or the foster care system.”HELENA, Mont.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803440,Man jailed over grass fire near Kansas governor's mansion,"TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A 36-year-old man remained jailed without bond Tuesday after authorities said he intentionally set a grass fire near the Kansas governor's mansion that burned 6 acres (2.4 hectares).

            Police arrested the man, a Topeka resident, while firefighters worked Monday afternoon to put out the blaze, the Topeka Fire Department said. Authorities said the man had been seen lighting the fire. 

            Though the fire department needed nearly two hours to put out the fire, the blaze was contained quickly south of the governor's residence and never got closer to the mansion than between 200 yards and 300 yards (180 and 270 meters), city spokesperson Rosie Nichols said. 











            Gov. Laura Kelly was not at the mansion when the fire occurred.

            The man has not yet been formally charged with a crime, but authorities listed the potential offense as arson. It wasn't clear whether he has an attorney yet.

            The governor's mansion, known as Cedar Crest, sits on 244 acres (100 hectares) overlooking the Kansas River in west Topeka, and the grounds include hiking trails. 

            The home was built in 1928 by the Topeka State Journal's publisher, and he and his wife decided that upon their deaths, the state would be given the chance to use it as the governor's residence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803444,Protests over cash shortage as Nigeria banknote switch looms,"ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — New clashes Tuesday between protesters and security forces in southern Nigeria left at least one person injured, amid demonstrations against a cash shortage caused by the West African nation's push to rapidly phase out its old currency notes.

            Protesters targeted facilities of some banks accused of withholding the new banknotes ahead of the Feb. 10 deadline for people to deposit their old paper currency and use the redesigned version instead. The exchange program started in late November.

            Nigeria’s antigraft agency, meanwhile, arrested a bank manager that it said refused to dispense the new banknotes despite having 29 million naira ($63,000) in the vaults.











            Other bank officials have been arrested in similar circumstances this week. The situation “indicates sabotage of the government’s monetary policy by some banks,” Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said in a statement.

            The Central Bank of Nigeria introduced the redesigned notes and new limits on large cash withdrawals to help recover about 85% of the total currency in circulation outside the banking system. It said this would also help curb money laundering and make digital payments the norm in Africa's biggest economy, that's currently largely driven by cash transactions.

            But the push to replace the old banknotes with new ones has left very limited cash in circulation, causing frustration and anger for many people who spend hours at the banks attempting to withdraw their money.

            The cash shortage, financial analysts say, has affected some critical sectors of Nigeria’s economy, has caused “significant hardship in both rural and urban areas” and has led to many business closures.

            Small protests over the limited cash in circulation started during the weekend but escalated on Tuesday as people attacked bank facilities and workers while also blocking some roads. One of the protesters was shot as demonstrators clashed with police in southwestern Ogun state. The injured person's condition was not immediately known.

            “Some people were attacking banks. In the process, somebody was shot and we are yet to know whether the shot is from the police,” Abimbola Oyeyemi, the police spokesman in Ogun, told The Associated Press. Officers have been deployed to restore peace in volatile areas, he said.

            The economic crisis in Africa’s most populous country comes less than a month before a key election that would see an unprecedented 93 million voters choose a successor for incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.

            At a meeting with the central bank authorities on Tuesday, Mahmood Yakubu, Nigeria’s election chief, expressed concerns the recent monetary policy could affect preparations for the election but authorities promised to ensure there is enough cash for the election commission's use.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — New clashes Tuesday between protesters and security forces in southern Nigeria left at least one person injured, amid demonstrations against a cash shortage caused by the West African nation's push to rapidly phase out its old currency notes.Protesters targeted facilities of some banks accused of withholding the new banknotes ahead of the Feb. 10 deadline for people to deposit their old paper currency and use the redesigned version instead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803445,Air Force leader's spouse opened fire during Andrews breach,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The intruder who breached Joint Base Andrews, the home of Air Force One, reached the residence of one of the Air Force's top leaders before her spouse opened fire, the air base said Tuesday. 

            Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force JoAnne Bass confirmed that the intruder had reached her home on Monday. The chief master sergeant is the Air Force's top enlisted leader. 

            “We appreciate the outpouring of support we received after this incident. I can confirm that my husband, Rahn, was involved, and is safe, thanks to the quick response and professionalism of our Security Forces Airmen,"" Bass said in a statement on Tuesday. 











            In a statement posted to Twitter, the air base said: “A resident discharged a firearm, security forces arrived on scene to apprehend the intruder and law enforcement is investigating the incident.” 

            Joint Base Andrews is home to the fleet of blue and white presidential aircraft, including Air Force One, and a frequent base for the “doomsday” 747 aircraft that can serve as the nation’s airborne nuclear command and control centers if needed. 

            It's not the first time the base's security has been breached; in February 2021 a man got through the military checkpoint onto the installation, then through additional fenced secure areas to gain access to the flight line and climb into a C-40, which is the military's 737-equivalent aircraft used to fly government officials. 

            That intruder was apprehended because the “mouse ears” cap he was wearing struck an observant airman as odd. 

            An inspector general's investigation found three main security failings, starting with “human error” by a gate security guard who allowed the man to drive onto the base even though he had no credentials that authorized his access. 

            Hours later, the man walked undetected onto the flight line by slipping through a fence designed to restrict entry. Finally, he walked onto and off a parked airplane without being challenged, even though he was not wearing a required badge authorizing access to the restricted area.WASHINGTON (AP) — The intruder who breached Joint Base Andrews, the home of Air Force One, reached the residence of one of the Air Force's top leaders before her spouse opened fire, the air base said Tuesday.Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force JoAnne Bass confirmed that the intruder had reached her home on Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803448,Conservative groups look beyond Trump for 2024 GOP nominee,"NEW YORK (AP) — Two major conservative groups have signaled they are open to supporting someone other than Donald Trump in the 2024 race for the White House, the latest sign from an increasingly vocal segment of the Republican Party that it’s time to move on from the former president.

            David McIntosh, the president of the influential Club For Growth group, said Tuesday that the group has invited a half dozen potential Republican candidates to its donor summit in Florida next month, but Trump — the only declared major candidate in the race so far — is not among them. 

            Instead, the group has invited Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is viewed as Trump's most formidable likely challenger, along with Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador; former Vice President Mike Pence; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina; and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.











            “We think it would be great for our members to hear them, see what they have to say, where they want to lead the country,"" McIntosh said in an interview.

            His comments came on the heels of a memo released over the weekend by the conservative advocacy group Americans For Prosperity that said the group was prepared to support someone other than Trump in the GOP primary.

            Tensions between Trump and both groups are not new, but their willingness to get involved on behalf of another candidate may only encourage at least half a dozen potential rivals who are considering campaigns. Haley is expected to announce her 2024 campaign next week in South Carolina.

            Both groups join several megadonors who have signaled in recent months that they’re looking elsewhere for a presidential nominee.

            Trump is facing a swirl of legal problems and has been blamed for the GOP’s underwhelming performance in last year’s midterm elections. However, he remains the most dominant figure in the party and has a been a prolific fundraiser, relying on a network of small donors.

            Asked for comment Tuesday, Trump's campaign pointed to messages on his Truth Social network in which he called McIntosh's organization the “Club For NO Growth."" He later posted an additional message Tuesday calling the group “an assemblage of political misfits, globalists, and losers.""

            Club For Growth, an anti-tax group, opposed Trump during his 2016 campaign but became a big ally once he won the White House. But the group has been at odds with Trump over the last year after it endorsed opposing candidates in Republican primaries, especially in the Ohio and Pennsylvania Senate races. 

            McIntosh said the group is open to supporting a candidate in the Republican presidential primary, potentially running ads on their behalf. But he made clear that the group would support Trump in the general election if he became the nominee. 

            “One of the factors that we’re taking into account is that the Democrats successfully used him in the last election to win a lot of races,"" he said. “There’s a sense in all of this that we want to make sure whoever we nominate can win in the presidential race and people want to see that.”

            Americans For Prosperity, founded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, has long clashed with Trump. Their substantial network refused to endorse him or any candidate in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. 

            Trump in the past has lashed out at the brothers, calling them a “total joke” and “globalists” who are “against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade.”

            In the new memo, the group said “the best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter.” It said the political advocacy arm of AFP is prepared to support a candidate in the GOP primary “who can lead our country forward, and who can win"" — with an added emphasis on “win.”

            A spokesperson for the group did not offer any further details about the process, including when the organization might make a decision on whom to endorse and which candidates might win the group’s backing.

            The pro-business, free-market group spent more than $30 million in advertising against President Barack Obama’s reelection in 2012. AFP's political arm spent almost $80 million in the 2022 midterms on behalf of House and Senate candidates, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.

            Once more candidates enter the race in the coming months, AFP is expected to go through a comprehensive vetting process based first on each candidate’s policy positions. The organization has long refused to endorse Trump because he wasn’t viewed as sufficiently conservative on trade and federal spending, among other issues.

            But AFP will also prioritize viability as a key factor in the endorsement process. By doing so, AFP — viewed as the largest and best-funded grassroots organization in the nation — could help narrow the Republican field in 2024 by starving lower-tier contenders of funding and attention.

            Trump critics within the GOP fear that the former president may benefit from a crowded field that ultimately divides the anti-Trump vote in the early primary states.

Haley is expected to announce her 2024 campaign next week in South Carolina.Both groups join several megadonors who have signaled in recent months that they’re looking elsewhere for a presidential nominee.Trump is facing a swirl of legal problems and has been blamed for the GOP’s underwhelming performance in last year’s midterm elections. However, he remains the most dominant figure in the party and has a been a prolific fundraiser, relying on a network of small donors.Asked for comment Tuesday, Trump's campaign pointed to messages on his Truth Social network in which he called McIntosh's organization the “Club For NO Growth."" He later posted an additional message Tuesday calling the group “an assemblage of political misfits, globalists, and losers.""Club For Growth, an anti-tax group, opposed Trump during his 2016 campaign but became a big ally once he won the White House. But the group has been at odds with Trump over the last year after it endorsed opposing candidates in Republican primaries, especially in the Ohio and Pennsylvania Senate races.McIntosh said the group is open to supporting a candidate in the Republican presidential primary, potentially running ads on their behalf. But he made clear that the group would support Trump in the general election if he became the nominee.“One of the factors that we’re taking into account is that the Democrats successfully used him in the last election to win a lot of races,"" he said. “There’s a sense in all of this that we want to make sure whoever we nominate can win in the presidential race and people want to see that.”Americans For Prosperity, founded by the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, has long clashed with Trump. Their substantial network refused to endorse him or any candidate in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.Trump in the past has lashed out at the brothers, calling them a “total joke” and “globalists” who are “against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade.”In the new memo, the group said “the best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter.” It said the political advocacy arm of AFP is prepared to support a candidate in the GOP primary “who can lead our country forward, and who can win"" — with an added emphasis on “win.”A spokesperson for the group did not offer any further details about the process, including when the organization might make a decision on whom to endorse and which candidates might win the group’s backing.The pro-business, free-market group spent more than $30 million in advertising against President Barack Obama’s reelection in 2012. AFP's political arm spent almost $80 million in the 2022 midterms on behalf of House and Senate candidates, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.Once more candidates enter the race in the coming months, AFP is expected to go through a comprehensive vetting process based first on each candidate’s policy positions. The organization has long refused to endorse Trump because he wasn’t viewed as sufficiently conservative on trade and federal spending, among other issues.But AFP will also prioritize viability as a key factor in the endorsement process. By doing so, AFP — viewed as the largest and best-funded grassroots organization in the nation — could help narrow the Republican field in 2024 by starving lower-tier contenders of funding and attention.Trump critics within the GOP fear that the former president may benefit from a crowded field that ultimately divides the anti-Trump vote in the early primary states.___Associated Press writer Steve Peoples in New York contributed to this report.",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803450,"After ticket flap, Springsteen's fan magazine shutting down","NEW YORK (AP) — A magazine and website that has served Bruce Springsteen's fans for 43 years is shutting down, with its publisher writing that he's been disillusioned by the debate over ticket prices for their hero's current tour.

            Backstreets had been an unusually robust publication that imposed journalistic rigor on its writing and photography, while leaving no doubt of its fan worship.

            But the complaints about high ticket prices left people there “dispirited, downhearted and yes, disillusioned,” publisher Christopher Phillips wrote late last week in a post announcing the shutdown.











            “Disappointment is a common feeling among hardcore fans in the Backstreets community,” he wrote. Phillips did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

            Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, said that “we are very sorry to hear the news of Backstreets closing and want to thank Chris Phillips for his 30 years of dedication on behalf of Springsteen fans everywhere. “

            There was an uproar among some Springsteen fans when tickets first went on sale last summer, particularly over Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing model, which sent tickets soaring to $5,000 or more when there was high demand. At a congressional hearing last month following the fiasco over Ticketmaster's handling of Taylor Swift tour tickets, U.S. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana suggested major artists like Springsteen and Swift should demand fee caps.

            Springsteen’s team has defended the prices as being in line with what is charged today by many of his peers. Like many artists, he says he’s annoyed when unscrupulous ticket brokers — not the musicians — benefit from high markups.

            Ticketmaster has said the vast majority of fans were able to buy tickets at face value, which averaged $202. The tour began Feb. 1 in Tampa, Florida.

            Many Springsteen fans have been with him for decades, appreciating his working class New Jersey roots, and can remember when a ticket for a four-hour, high-energy show on the “Darkness on the Edge of Town” tour in 1978 could be had for $7.50.

            That's not reality anymore. Springsteen hasn't backed down, telling Rolling Stone magazine that fans unhappy with the price after seeing the show can have their money back.

            “You certainly don't like to be the poster boy for high ticket prices,” he told the magazine, but said you have to own your decisions and do your best.

            Phillips wrote that many Backstreets readers have lost interest because they can't afford to go to the show.

            He said he hadn't given up on being a fan of Springsteen's music, and that others shouldn't, either.

            “We simply realized that we would not be able to cover this tour with the drive and sense of purpose with which we've operated continuously since 1980,” he wrote. “That determination came with a quickening sense that we'd reach the end of an era.”NEW YORK (AP) — A magazine and website that has served Bruce Springsteen's fans for 43 years is shutting down, with its publisher writing that he's been disillusioned by the debate over ticket prices for their hero's current tour.Backstreets had been an unusually robust publication that imposed journalistic rigor on its writing and photography, while leaving no doubt of its fan worship.But the complaints about high ticket prices left people there “dispirited, downhearted and yes, disillusioned,” publisher Christopher Phillips wrote late last week in a post announcing the shutdown.“Disappointment is a common feeling among hardcore fans in the Backstreets community,” he wrote.

            Government and soccer officials representing the joint bid of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay held their first organizing committee meeting Tuesday. Argentine President Alberto Fernández also said he wants to add Bolivia to the group.

            One other bid has already been formalized: Spain-Portugal-Ukraine. Morocco and another joint bid of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Greece are moving ahead.











            Alejandro Domínguez, the president of South American soccer body CONMEBOL, highlighted the historical links. Uruguay hosted the first tournament in 1930 and won the first title by beating Argentina 4-2 in the final.

            “FIFA has the obligation of honoring the memory of those who came before us and made the first World Cup,"" he said. “At the end, the ones who want it more win it. And in that Argentina and all of our countries have a tradition.""

            FIFA will make the decision in 2024, two years before the next edition of the tournament takes place in the United States, Mexico and Canada with 48 teams for the first time.

            Chile sports minister Alexandra Benado Vergara said Argentina's World Cup title in Qatar gives an extra push to the South American bid, which she sees as stronger since other nations joined Uruguay's initially single-nation candidacy.

            “Argentina's victory is also the victory of our region,"" Vergara said. “We can totally say we will have a bid that is sustainable, clear, austere during these times of our region and the world.”

            Vergara's Uruguayan counterpart Sebastián Bauzá said South America “feels we have the right to organize that World Cup.""

            Argentina's Fernández said on his social media channels he wanted to add Bolivia to the bid because “this is the candidacy of the entire continent. That is why I will propose that Bolivia become a part of this dream.”

(AP) — Speaking in the aftermath of a brawl at a middle school basketball game that ended with the death of one of the participants, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott Tuesday says there is too much anger in contemporary society and he called for a return to civility.

            The civility challenges are not unique to Vermont and they have been building over the last several years, but Scott, a Republican, placed the Jan. 31 brawl in the Canadian border town of Alburgh on the same spectrum of anger that at its extreme end led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in Washington.

            “We’re constantly being divided into camps, whether it’s politics, religion, race, or social issues where everything has turned into us versus them,” Scott said.











            “All of us have an obligation to tone down the rhetoric, recognize the humanity in everyone, including those we disagree with, and just be better role models for our kids,” Scott said. “The idea that a brawl would break out among adults in front of their kids and a middle school basketball game is just plain sad.”

            During his six years in office Scott, a Republican in state where Democrats control the Legislature, has continually called for a toning down of divisive rhetoric, be it over debates about the best way to confront the COVID-19 pandemic, statehouse politics or a middle school boys basketball game.

            “I don’t care what the situation was,” Scott said. “There’s no justification for a brawl breaking out among adults in front of their seventh and eighth grade kids who are playing basketball.”

            The Vermont State Police are continuing to investigate the melee involving spectators during a seventh- and eighth-grade boys basketball game between Alburgh and St. Albans at the Alburgh Community Education Center. The fight ended before police arrived.

            As one of the participants, Russell Giroux, 60, of Alburgh, drove home, he sought medical attention. He was taken by ambulance to the Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death has not been released.

            In the aftermath of the melee the school district banned spectators from home basketball games for the rest of the season.

            The day after the event last week, Jay Nichols, The Vermont Principals’ Association, said that middle and high school sports are educational and are for the benefit of the student-athletes.

            Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the diplomatic effort “is not at its best point,” but it wasn’t his place to declare whether the process was “dead or alive.’’ However, he said progress is not impossible.

            “I hope to be able to re-set, restore, reinforce that indispensable dialogue,” he said during a discussion at the Chatham House think tank. “Without that, things are going to get worse.’’











            Iran began rebuilding its nuclear stockpile after former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 agreement that limited the Islamic Republic’s atomic energy program. Talks on restoring the deal ended in August when western countries presented the “final text” of a roadmap for progress, which Iran has yet to accept.

            Grossi warned last month that Iran had enough highly enriched uranium to build “several” nuclear weapons if it chose to do so. But diplomatic efforts aimed at once again limiting the country’s atomic program seem more unlikely than ever as Tehran provides arms for Russia’s war in Ukraine and as unrest shakes the Islamic Republic.

            Grossi said the Middle East has a “unique set of problems” that will be aggravated if diplomatic efforts fail.

            Staying in-house and promoting Tim Kelly from passing game coordinator to offensive coordinator after one season as the “right fit.”

            And Vrabel did hire one of those who interviewed for that coordinator job in Charles London, now Tennessee's new pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach, in a flurry of moves announced Tuesday.











            “What Tim ultimately was able to do was be able to provide some familiarity and some carryover to what we were doing because I don’t think everything’s broken,"" Vrabel said. “I don't. I don't believe that. ... I’ve seen him call games in this league against us, felt like he has a great feel for the game."" 

            Kelly replaces Todd Downing, who was fired after two seasons. Before joining the Titans for the 2022 season, Kelly worked with the Houston Texans between 2014 and 2021 with the last three seasons as offensive coordinator. 

            The Titans ranked 28th in scoring an average of 17.5 points a game despite ranking sixth once Tennessee got inside an opponent's 20. 

            The Titans ranked 30th in passing with Ryan Tannehill missing five games and ending the season on injured reserve.

            Whether the Titans keep Tannehill, who has a year left on his deal and turns 35 this July, is just one of the upcoming decisions to be made. 

            Vrabel said Tannehill is in the building every day and is “excited about where things are headed.”

            “Other than that, I don’t know what to tell you,” Vrabel said. ""We’ve got to get ready here to add a lot of pieces and find ways to do that.”

            An offensive assistant for quality control under then-Titans coach Mike Munchak in 2011, London worked with Kelly in Houston coaching running backs between 2014 and 2017. 

            He coached running backs in Chicago before spending the past two seasons coaching Atlanta quarterbacks for former Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. The Titans had their best offensive production in 2020 in Smith’s last season as coordinator. 

            
                London also interviewed last month for Washington’s offensive coordinator vacancy.

            “Some of this stuff is going to be consistent, but there will be a lot that will force us all to learn and to grow,” Vrabel said. 

            The Titans hired former NFL player Chris Harris as their new defensive passing game coordinator and cornerbacks coach among their moves announced Tuesday.

            Vrabel also has hired the franchise's first full-time female coaching assistant, adding Lori Locust as defensive quality control coach from Tampa Bay along with Justin Hamilton, Virginia Tech's defensive coordinator the past two seasons, in the same position. 

            Locust joins scout Mical Johnson, the team's first full-time female scout hired in June 2021. 

            Controlling owner Amy Adams Strunk also hired the franchise's first Black general manager last month in Ran Carthon. 

            Vrabel said he thought Locust's knowledge was excellent and enjoyed their meetings at last week's Senior Bowl. Locust primarily will work with Ryan Crow coaching outside linebackers. 

            “She’s done it,” Vrabel said. “She’s got experience in this league and excited to be able to bring (her) on. They ran great defenses in Tampa.”

            Locust spent the past four seasons as assistant defensive line coach for Tampa Bay, including the Buccaneers’ Super Bowl victory in the 2020 season. She was an assistant defensive line coach in the Alliance of American Football and a coaching intern with the Baltimore Ravens during their 2018 training camp.

            
                Tony Dews is switching from coaching running backs and two-time NFL rushing leader Derrick Henry to tight ends, while Luke Steckel moves from coaching tight ends to the Titans' new run game analyst. Quarterbacks coach Pat O'Hara now is the passing game analyst. 

            Jason Houghtaling takes over as offensive line coach. Tennessee still must hire a running backs coach. 

            Harris played eight seasons in the NFL and has spent the past nine as a coach. He spent the past three seasons coaching Washington's defensive backs. He also has coached with the Chargers and started as a coach in 2013 with Chicago where Harris started his NFL career in 2005.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803455,"Tchatchoua, a 'walking miracle,' back for No. 14 Baylor","WACO, Texas (AP) — Jonathan Tchamwa Tchatchoua knows how special it is just getting back on the court for 14th-ranked Baylor nearly a full year after a gruesome knee injury that many people thought would end his career. 

            The big man for the Bears is a testament to an unwavering spiritual faith and hard work. 

            “You didn’t know if he would ever walk, run, let alone play basketball,” Bears coach Scott Drew said. “But one thing about Jon is his timetable is a little different than everyone else’s. And his work ethic is a little bit different. ... And I know God’s blessed him with allowing him to be able to recover.”











            There were 51 weeks that passed after Tchamwa Tchatchoua crumbled to the court with multiple torn ligaments in his left knee on a non-contact injury at home against Texas last Feb. 12, until the 6-foot-8 forward’s return for the Bears (17-6, 6-4 Big 12) on Saturday with eight points and four rebounds in 14 minutes against Texas Tech. They are home again Wednesday against Oklahoma.

            “Me even stepping on the floor, playing the game that I love, is just a miracle in itself,” Tchamwa Tchatchoua said. “I see myself as a walking miracle, as proof that the Lord can affect your life in a better way.”

            The forward from Cameroon earned the nickname “Everyday Jon” for his constant high-energy approach in games and practices since arriving in Waco nearly four years ago. He remained a significant presence around the Bears even when unable to play after having surgery twice to repair different ligaments.

            “He’s our best leader, and now to have him back out there with us, it’s everything,” forward Jalen Bridges said. “He’s the heart of our team.”

            A few days after the injury, Drew saw Tchamwa Tchatchoua on the practice court taking shots — while sitting in a chair with a brace on his leg. 

            In a tweet the day he got hurt, Tchamwa Tchatchoua thanked the Baylor family for their love and prayers, and added, “All my trust is in GOD so I know everything is going to be ok!”

            When he got up from the bench Saturday and made his way to the scorer’s table, fans in the Ferrell Center broke into a raucous standing ovation. It got so loud that he didn’t even hear his name being announced. 

            Tchamwa Tchatchoua had been practicing with the team and had already taken part in pregame warmups a few times before finally getting clearance from doctors last week to return to game action. It was then up to him, and the more he prayed the more confident and excited he got about playing again.

            “At the end of the day, nobody would expect me to be the same player, and I had some mental battles,” he said. “In a way, I was thinking maybe I’m not good enough because I was comparing myself to my old self and maybe I’m a different player. But at the end of the day, I came back from a really bad injury and I’m using the grace to help me, and it took me such much time to embrace that.”

            As optimistic as Drew is about pretty much everything, the coach never really expected Tchamwa Tchatchoua to play this season. Drew described himself as “blown away and amazed” when the big post started doing more and more in November and December. 

            Asked what his plan is now, Tchamwa Tchatchoua responded without hesitation, “Win more games.”

            While listed as a senior, he still has another season of eligibility remaining after this because of the 2019-20 season, when Baylor was set to be a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament that was never played because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            
                Tchamwa Tchatchoua and 6-10 Flo Thamba were interchangeable athletic posts who played a key role on the guard-oriented Baylor team that won the 2021 national title. The Bears were using them the same way last season on the way to another Big 12 regular-season title before Tchamwa Tchatchoua got hurt, and he was still the co-Big 12 defensive player of the year. 

            In his return against Texas Tech, the big man made 3 of 4 shots. Two were 3-pointers from the top of the key.

            “It was just another shot I’ve been working on,” Tchamwa Tchatchoua said. “I feel like God allowed me to have extra time to work on my game and I used it.”

            Big name advertisers from Netflix to Google paid as much as $7 million for a 30-second spot during the game, seeking to capture the attention of the roughly 100 million viewers who tune in each year.

Ram spoofed ads for erectile dysfunction in a commercial for its Ram 1500 REV electric pickup by showing drivers worried about “premature electrification.” In other ads, John Travolta and “Scrubs” stars Donald Faison and Zach Braff sing a T-Mobile themed version of “Summer Nights” from “Grease,” Adam Driver creates multiple versions of himself for Squarespace, and Alicia Silverstone reprises her “Clueless” character for the online shopping site Rakuten.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803457,"Dudamel to become NY Philharmonic music director, leave LA","NEW YORK (AP) — Gustavo Dudamel will become music director of the New York Philharmonic for the 2026-27 season, ending a heralded tenure with the Los Angeles Philharmonic that began in 2009.

            The 42-year-old Venezuelan conductor agreed to a five-year contract as New York’s artistic and music director, the orchestra announced Tuesday. Dudamel will become the first Latino to head the orchestra since its founding in 1842.

            “What the orchestra told us very, very clearly was that the person that they wanted, their dream candidate, was Gustavo,” New York Philharmonic CEO Deborah Borda said. “When you’re trying to recruit the most sought-after conductor in the world, you don’t run a sort of classic search.”











            Dudamel — who will hold the title of music director designate in 2025-26 — will also remain music director of the Paris Opera, a role he’s held since 2021, and of Venezuela’s Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, a position he took in 1999 that gained him international recognition.

            Dudamel, in a statement, cited the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca’s quote: “Every step we take on earth brings us to a new world.”

            “I gaze with joy and excitement at the world that lies before me in New York City, and with pride and love at the world I have shared — and will continue to share — with my dear Angelenos over the next three seasons and beyond,” Dudamel said. “All of us are united in our belief that culture creates a better world, and in our dream that music is a fundamental right.”

            Jaap van Zweden said in September 2021 that he would leave the New York Philharmonic after the 2023-24 season, a six-season tenure as music director that will be the shortest since Pierre Boulez succeeded Leonard Bernstein and led the orchestra from 1971-77. 

            Borda told the New York orchestra and Dudamel informed the LA musicians of his decision in simultaneous announcements during respective rehearsals at Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall and Walt Disney Concert Hall. The New York Philharmonic moved back into Geffen Hall in October following a $550 million renovation that improved acoustics, sightlines and amenities.

            The New York orchestra plans a Feb. 20 news conference to introduce him.

            Dudamel is among the few conductors who in recent years have gained mainstream attention. A character in Amazon's “Mozart in the Jungle” appeared to be based on Dudamel, who conducted the soundtrack to Steven Spielberg's 2021 remake of Bernstein's “West Side Story.”

            Dudamel made his New York Philharmonic debut in November 2007. He has conducted the orchestra 26 times and is scheduled to lead three performances of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony from May 19-21.

            “This infectious joy and deep musicality and humanism connects with audiences,” Borda said of Dudamel.

            Borda, who is retiring as the New York Philharmonic’s CEO at the end of the current season, was the Los Angeles orchestra’s CEO when she hired Dudamel to succeed Esa-Pekka Salonen as music director for the 2009-10 season. 

            “I remember the first day we tried to book him — he didn’t even have a manager. And look at how he’s progressed since then,” Borda said. “I hadn’t seen a conductor like this since Bernstein.”

            Borda, who returned to New York in 2017 for her second stint in charge, will be succeeded by Gary Ginstling, who had been head of Washington’s National Symphony Orchestra since 2017.

            “He was really the one conductor who could be transformational for the future of this institution,” Ginstling said of Dudamel. “He will be able to bring in new audiences and younger audiences and a broader range of audiences.”

            Dudamel emerged from Venezuela's music education program known as “El Sistema (The System)” and gained praise from his work with young musicians. He won the Gustav Mahler Conducting Competition in 2004. While Dudamel at first declined to speak of Venezuela's economic and political turmoil, he criticized his nation's government in 2017 for suppressing protests. Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro then canceled the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra's U.S. tours.

            Dudamel’s Los Angeles contract was extended through 2025-26 three years ago, and his 17 seasons with LA will match Salonen for the longest as that orchestra's head. Dudamel earned $775,000 from the LA Philharmonic in the COVID-impacted year ending Sept. 30, 2021, down from $3.55 million the previous year, according to the orchestra's tax returns.

            He signed an exclusive recording contract with Deutsche Grammophon in 2005. Borda said details such as recordings and how many weeks per season Dudamel would be committing will be announced at the news conference.NEW YORK (AP) — Gustavo Dudamel will become music director of the New York Philharmonic for the 2026-27 season, ending a heralded tenure with the Los Angeles Philharmonic that began in 2009.The 42-year-old Venezuelan conductor agreed to a five-year contract as New York’s artistic and music director, the orchestra announced Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803462,Fall trial planned for man charged with killing mom at sea,"RUTLAND, Vt. (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday set an October trial for the man charged with killing his mother at sea during a 2016 fishing trip off the coast of New England in what prosecutors say was a scheme to inherit millions of dollars. 

            Nathan Carman, 29, of Vernon, Vermont, pleaded not guilty last year to fraud and first-degree murder in the death of his mother, Linda Carman of Middletown, Connecticut. The eight-count indictment also says Carman shot and killed his wealthy grandfather John Chakalos at his home in Windsor, Connecticut, in 2013 but does not charge him with murder in his death.

            U.S. District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford on Tuesday set the trial for Oct. 2 in Rutland. A federal prosecutor said the government planned to include several different types of expert testimony, including testimony on marine survival and draft analysis. Prosecutors plan to make those disclosures to the court by May 1. 











            Crawford also heard from lawyers about the defense's motion for partial disclosure of minutes from the grand jury proceeding that led to Carman's indictment, seeking to learn what was disclosed about his grandfather’s death. 

            Carman's lawyer, David Sullivan, of Connecticut, told the judge that Carman was never charged in Chakalos’ death, but the indictment includes “outright assertions that are very troubling to the defense."" He said the investigation into Chakalos' death is ongoing and has not been closed. 

            Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Van de Graaf said Chakalos' “murder"" is part of the fraud charge. 

            In September 2016, Carman arranged a fishing trip with his mother, during which prosecutors say he planned to kill her and report that his boat sank and his mother disappeared in the accident.

            He was found floating in an inflatable raft eight days after leaving a Rhode Island marina with his mother, who was never found.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803464,Activists hope indictment in Texas jail death prompts change,"HOUSTON (AP) — Attorneys and community activists said Tuesday they hope the indictment of a former Texas sheriff’s office detention officer in the death of an inmate will prompt changes in the state’s largest county jail, which has been under scrutiny amid overcrowding and a slew of recent deaths. 

            Eric Morales, 28, faces a charge of manslaughter in the death of Jaquaree Simmons. The 23-year-old Houston man was found unconscious in his cell at the Harris County Jail in 2021 and was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Medical examiners later ruled the death a homicide from injuries to his head. 

            Court records did not list an attorney for Morales who could speak on his behalf. He remained jailed Tuesday on a $100,000 bond after being indicted last week. 











            Prosecutors said this was the first time a detention officer at the jail in Houston had been charged in connection with an in-custody death. 

            Community activists and civil rights organizations say overcrowding and understaffing at the lockup have created dangerous conditions for inmates. 

            Last year 27 people died inside the facility, the most since 2006, according to the Texas Justice Initiative nonprofit, of causes including illness, alcohol and drug intoxication and homicide. 

            Last year, the jail’s population exceeded its capacity of 10,000. Activists say the overcrowding has prompted delays in medical care and timely processing of inmates. Officials have blamed the crowding in part on a court backlog caused by damage from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and later the pandemic. On Monday, there were 9,970 inmates at the jail. 

            Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Simmons’ family, called Morales’ indictment a “major milestone.” 

            “I’m hoping a dam will now break so we can address some of the instances of brutality and violence” in jails and prisons, Merritt said. 

            Prosecutor Kimberly Clark of the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said in a statement Monday that county residents expect detention officers to treat inmates fairly and humanely. 

            “Harris County will prosecute those who break the law inside the jail, regardless of which side of the bars they are on,” Clark said. 

            In a statement Monday, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said it “immediately conducted a thorough internal investigation that revealed significant policy violations” after Simmons’ death. It added that nearly 1,200 detention officers have since undergone additional training on how to safely defuse critical incidents and prevent misconduct. 

            Morales was one of 11 employees with the sheriff’s office who were fired after Simmons’ death. Six others were suspended. 

            On Feb. 10, 2021, Simmons was booked into the jail on a charge of a felon in possession of a firearm. 

            Prosecutors allege that Morales hit Simmons three different times on Feb. 16, 2021, kneeing him in the head and hitting his head against a door and a wall. 

            Investigators say Simmons was never brought to a jail clinic for follow-up X-rays. He was found unresponsive in his cell on Feb. 17. 

            Simmons’ mother has filed a wrongful death suit in Houston federal court against Morales, other detention officers and the sheriff’s office. 

            Morales is the only person charged. 

            Merritt said he would be disappointed if charges are not filed against other detention officers. 

            During a news conference Tuesday outside the sheriff’s office, community activist Quanell X called for adequate staffing at the jail and for an outside agency to investigate the recent deaths. 

            “Enough is enough,” he said. ""Too many young men are dying in this jail.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803466,Mudslides smash villages in Peru; at least 12 confirmed dead,"SECOCHA, Peru (AP) — Residents of five small gold-mining villages in southern Peru’s Arequipa region struggled Tuesday to salvage belongings after landslides caused by strong rains killed at least 12 people and dragged mud, water and rocks that turned precarious homes and other buildings into rubble.

            In the Mariano Nicolás Valcárcel municipality, on the edges of a depleted mining extraction area in Camaná province, people desperately searched for anything they could salvage amid the mud. 

            One of them was Mauro Noa, a community leader in the Posco Miski village who has been trying to reach local leaders to obtain first aid and food to help more than 1,000 of his neighbors who have been stuck on the side of a mountain since Sunday and are unable to leave due to the accumulation of mud and rocks.











            “They're hungry and thirsty,” Noa said. “Nobody thinks about them.”

            Noa said this is the first time in 18 years he has seen a landslide of this magnitude and neighbors have compiled a list of 14 Posco Miski residents whose whereabouts are unknown. “The neighbors who couldn’t leave their houses were taken by the wave of mud,” Noa said. “Children have been left traumatized by the rain and the landslide.”

            Law enforcement has sent 15 rescue workers to the area and they were expected to arrive in Secocha late in the afternoon because the road has blocked by mud, police officer Giancarlo Vizcarra said.

            Vizcarra said that after they arrive in Secocha the rescue workers will try to get to the most remote villages to search for bodies that may be buried under the mud with the help of two dogs that have been trained to search for people after earthquakes. 

            A local Civil Defense official said Monday that at least 36 people had died in the landslides, but on Tuesday a prosecutor told The Associated Press they had confirmed only 12 deaths and three people were listed as missing. 

            The landslides destroyed key access roads into the remote villages, making it difficult to confirm the death toll. Peru's government had yet to release any official numbers, although the president traveled to the affected area Tuesday.

            The slides that began Sunday and continued Monday from the highest mountains in the area destroyed everything in their path. 

            People were helpless and could only watch as the mud and rocks swept away their homes in the five villages, where miners have been living for two decades. 

            Dramatic video from the region showed people covered in mud being dragged out of the mud.

            Many people slept outside out of fear that more slides might come.

            “We’re isolated,” Arturo Muñoz, who lives in La Eugenia, where the landslides began Sunday, told The Associated Press by phone. 

            The full extent of the damage remained unknown as rescue workers were unable to get heavy machinery into the area.

            The main road in the small village of Secocha was covered by a muddy sludge that seemed to be everywhere and had pushed through doors and windows. Residents were working feverishly to clean mud out of their belongings, including kitchens, refrigerators and televisions.

            The prosecutor in charge of the incident, Luis Supo, reported the lower death toll Tuesday. A day earlier, Wilson Gutiérrez, a Civil Defense official from the Mariano Nicolás Valcárcel municipality, told local media that 36 bodies had been recovered in the remote village of Posco Miski. 

            Supo said that by Tuesday authorities had received the remains of only 12 people.

            Officials said Monday that the landslides had also affected bridges, irrigation channels and roads. Around 630 homes were no longer usable, officials said. 

            Heavy rains are frequent in Peru in February and they sometimes help spark landslides.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803467,XXXTentacion's friend describes rapper's fatal shooting,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A family friend of the rapper XXXTentacion broke down Tuesday as he told jurors how he and the rapper were ambushed by armed robbers as they drove away from a motorcycle shop, how he fled in fear and then heard the gunshots that killed the rising star.

            Leonard Kerr's testimony highlighted the opening day in the trial of three men accused of fatally shooting XXXTentacion on June 18, 2018, inside his BMW sports car, which had been blocked by an SUV as Kerr and the rapper pulled out of the Riva Motorsports' parking lot near Fort Lauderdale.

            Two men jumped out with guns, Kerr said. He said the taller man pointed his weapon at him and told him not to get out of the car, punctuating his command with a curse word. The other man was trying to pull the rapper's gold chain from his neck. Kerr said he could hear XXXTentacion asking, “What's this for?” At that point, Kerr said, he decided to escape, pushing the button that opened the passenger door.











            “If I run, I can get shot, but I can live. If I sit....” Kerr said, his voicing trailing off until he stopped to regain his composure. 

            Kerr said when he looked back, the taller man was pointing his gun at XXXTentacion, and he said he heard at least two loud bangs. The men then got back into the SUV and sped off, taking with them the $50,000 the rapper had in his designer bag.

            Michael Boatwright, 28, is accused of being the shooter, while his friend, Trayon Newsome, 24, is accused of being the other gunman. Dedrick Williams, 26, is accused of being the driver. They could all receive life sentences if convicted of first-degree murder. A fourth man who prosecutors say was in the SUV, 26-year-old Robert Allen, pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder and is set to testify against his former friends.

            During opening statements earlier Tuesday, the jurors heard divergent theories about the shooting. A robbery gone awry, according to prosecutors. According to the defense, it could have been a feud between XXXTentacion and the megastar Drake, but they say detectives refused to investigate that possibility.

            Prosecutor Pascale Achille told jurors that Boatwright, Newsome, Williams and Allen, set out that day to commit armed robberies. Allen and Williams went inside the motorcycle shop to buy masks, she said.

            There, they happened upon XXXTentacion, who, according to Kerr, had the $50,000 he had just gotten from the bank hanging out of his bag. The pair recognized him, and the group seized upon the opportunity, deciding to rob him as he left, Achille said. Boatwright shot him several times “without any provocation,” she said.

            To varying degrees, the defendants are linked to the shooting by surveillance video and cellphone locations, and all are implicated through Allen's expected testimony, Achille said. Then there are the social media photos of some of the men flashing the money posted that night, she said.

            “They go on social media and start bragging that they have this influx of cash,” Achille said. “They flash it like it's Christmas Day.”

            To the men's attorneys, the defendants are victims of Robert Allen's lies and the failure of detectives to investigate XXXTentacion's feud with Drake — XXXTentacion once said on social media that if he ever wound up dead, the Canadian rapper would be the cause. He later retracted that. Another rapper had also made threats against XXXTentacion.

            They said that with the rapper's slaying coming just four months after the slaying of 17 people at nearby Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, the Broward Sheriff's Office was under extreme political pressure to solve the case quickly.

            “For Broward County, for everyone involved, this was a nightmare,” said Mauricio Padilla, Williams' attorney. 

            That's why they wanted no part with investigating a celebrity, he said.

            Prosecutors say there is no evidence linking Drake to the shooting, and Williams is clearly seen in the store's surveillance video, recognizable through his distinctive facial tattoos. He was also identified by one of the clerks. Padilla conceded Williams was present in the store but didn't say how he would explain that.

            Joseph Kimok, Boatwright's attorney, also pointed the finger at a third man as the possible shooter — a friend Williams was seen talking to inside the motorcycle store just before the shooting who has the same build as his client. He alluded that the friend could have gotten into the SUV Williams was driving outside the view of surveillance cameras. He said the evidence will show that Boatwright was asleep at the home he shared with his grandmother at the time of the shooting. 

            “At no point (in the surveillance videos) will you see Mr. Boatwright, because he wasn’t there,” Kimok said. 

            Yes, a cellphone linked to him was near the store — but that was a community phone used by several men, he said. And yes, he “very stupidly posed” with money that night — but that money was Allen's, not Boatwright's, Kimok said. 

            Newsome's attorney also denied that his client was present.

            The victim, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, pronounced his stage name “ex-ex-ex-ten-ta-see-YAWN.” He was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend.FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

If I sit....” Kerr said, his voicing trailing off until he stopped to regain his composure.Kerr said when he looked back, the taller man was pointing his gun at XXXTentacion, and he said he heard at least two loud bangs. The men then got back into the SUV and sped off, taking with them the $50,000 the rapper had in his designer bag.Michael Boatwright, 28, is accused of being the shooter, while his friend, Trayon Newsome, 24, is accused of being the other gunman. Dedrick Williams, 26, is accused of being the driver. They could all receive life sentences if convicted of first-degree murder. A fourth man who prosecutors say was in the SUV, 26-year-old Robert Allen, pleaded guilty last year to second-degree murder and is set to testify against his former friends.During opening statements earlier Tuesday, the jurors heard divergent theories about the shooting. A robbery gone awry, according to prosecutors. According to the defense, it could have been a feud between XXXTentacion and the megastar Drake, but they say detectives refused to investigate that possibility.Prosecutor Pascale Achille told jurors that Boatwright, Newsome, Williams and Allen, set out that day to commit armed robberies. Allen and Williams went inside the motorcycle shop to buy masks, she said.There, they happened upon XXXTentacion, who, according to Kerr, had the $50,000 he had just gotten from the bank hanging out of his bag. The pair recognized him, and the group seized upon the opportunity, deciding to rob him as he left, Achille said. Boatwright shot him several times “without any provocation,” she said.To varying degrees, the defendants are linked to the shooting by surveillance video and cellphone locations, and all are implicated through Allen's expected testimony, Achille said. Then there are the social media photos of some of the men flashing the money posted that night, she said.“They go on social media and start bragging that they have this influx of cash,” Achille said. “They flash it like it's Christmas Day.”To the men's attorneys, the defendants are victims of Robert Allen's lies and the failure of detectives to investigate XXXTentacion's feud with Drake — XXXTentacion once said on social media that if he ever wound up dead, the Canadian rapper would be the cause. He later retracted that. Another rapper had also made threats against XXXTentacion.They said that with the rapper's slaying coming just four months after the slaying of 17 people at nearby Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, the Broward Sheriff's Office was under extreme political pressure to solve the case quickly.“For Broward County, for everyone involved, this was a nightmare,” said Mauricio Padilla, Williams' attorney.That's why they wanted no part with investigating a celebrity, he said.Prosecutors say there is no evidence linking Drake to the shooting, and Williams is clearly seen in the store's surveillance video, recognizable through his distinctive facial tattoos. He was also identified by one of the clerks. Padilla conceded Williams was present in the store but didn't say how he would explain that.Joseph Kimok, Boatwright's attorney, also pointed the finger at a third man as the possible shooter — a friend Williams was seen talking to inside the motorcycle store just before the shooting who has the same build as his client. He alluded that the friend could have gotten into the SUV Williams was driving outside the view of surveillance cameras. He said the evidence will show that Boatwright was asleep at the home he shared with his grandmother at the time of the shooting.“At no point (in the surveillance videos) will you see Mr. Boatwright, because he wasn’t there,” Kimok said.Yes, a cellphone linked to him was near the store — but that was a community phone used by several men, he said. And yes, he “very stupidly posed” with money that night — but that money was Allen's, not Boatwright's, Kimok said.Newsome's attorney also denied that his client was present.The victim, whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, pronounced his stage name “ex-ex-ex-ten-ta-see-YAWN.” He was a platinum-selling rising star who tackled issues including prejudice and depression in his songs. He also drew criticism over bad behavior and multiple arrests, including charges that he severely beat and abused his girlfriend.",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803468,30 news groups ask Idaho Supreme Court to reject gag order,"BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Thirty news organizations have asked the Idaho Supreme Court to overturn a gag order in a case against a man accused of stabbing four University of Idaho students to death. 

            The challenge, filed Monday evening, comes just a few days after an attorney representing the family of one of the victims filed an opposition to the gag order in state court, saying it is overly broad and places an undue burden on the families.

            Bryan Kohberger, 28, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and burglary in connection with the stabbing deaths in Moscow, Idaho. Prosecutors have yet to reveal if they intend to seek the death penalty.











            The bodies of Madison Mogen, Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin were found on Nov. 13, 2022, at a rental home across the street from the University of Idaho campus. The slayings shocked the rural Idaho community and neighboring Pullman, Washington, where Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University.

            The case garnered widespread publicity, and in January Latah County Magistrate Judge Megan Marshall issued the sweeping gag order, barring attorneys, law enforcement agencies and others associated with the case from talking or writing about it. 

            The coalition of news organizations, which includes The Associated Press, contends the gag order violates the right to free speech by prohibiting it from happening in the first place.

            “Justice cannot survive behind walls of silence. For that reason, ‘a responsible press has always been regarded as the handmaiden of effective judicial administration, especially in the criminal field,’” coalition attorney Wendy Olson wrote in the court filing, quoting historic court rulings about prior restraints on free speech. 

            In the gag order, Marshall said the speech restriction was needed to protect Kohberger's right to a fair trial. 

            “More speech does not mean a less fair trial; the speech at issue must be the kind that could prejudice a jury. And even when publicity may cause prejudice, the answer is not always to suppress the speech,” Olson wrote. “Other remedies like the passing of time, a change in venue, voir dire, jury instructions, and jury sequestration can cleanse any jury taint without offending the right to speech.”

            Despite the great public interest in the case, there have not been any notable leaks of information that would prejudice Kohberger's right to a fair trial, Olson said. 

            The news organizations in the coalition would have published additional information about the slayings if the gag order wasn't in place, she wrote. For instance, police in Pennsylvania told one reporter they can't say whether they are reviewing unsolved cases that could be linked to Kohberger because of the gag order, and the mayor of Moscow told another reporter he can't talk about overall community healing because of the gag. 

            Several journalists have had public record requests rejected or left unfilled because agencies in Idaho and Washington fear they would run afoul of the order. 

            “Petitioners do not make the news; they report the news. They cannot report what they cannot gather,” Olson wrote. 

            The attorney representing Kaylee Goncalves' family, Shanon Gray, filed a separate court action on Friday asking the Latah County magistrate judge to hold a hearing on the gag order or to clarify it. The current order is “overbroad and vague,” wrote Gray. 

            The gag order prevents ""all comments or opinions” regardless of whether they could bias jurors, and it even remains in effect once jurors are instructed to avoid news coverage of the case, Gray noted, calling the order unconstitutional.

            The order also prevents the victims' families from having attorneys talk to the media on their behalf, Gray said. 

            “It would place an undue burden on the Victims’ families,” if they are unable to have a spokesperson transmit their thoughts and opinions to news organizations or others, Gray wrote. 

            It's not immediately clear what next steps will be in the case. Generally the Idaho Supreme Court will ask both sides to respond to requests like the one from the news coalition before issuing a ruling, though sometimes it will rule immediately based on the initial request. 

            Likewise the magistrate judge in Latah County also could set a hearing on the petition from the Goncalves' attorney or could decide to amend or retain the current gag order.BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Thirty news organizations have asked the Idaho Supreme Court to overturn a gag order in a case against a man accused of stabbing four University of Idaho students to death.The challenge, filed Monday evening, comes just a few days after an attorney representing the family of one of the victims filed an opposition to the gag order in state court, saying it is overly broad and places an undue burden on the families.Bryan Kohberger, 28, is charged with four counts of first-degree murder and burglary in connection with the stabbing deaths in Moscow, Idaho.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803471,13 Memphis officers could be disciplined in Nichols case,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Thirteen Memphis officers could end up being disciplined in connection with the violent arrest of Tyre Nichols, officials said Tuesday, as city council members expressed frustration during a meeting with the police and fire chiefs for not moving quickly on policy reforms following the brutal beating. 

            
                Six officers already have been fired and one more has been relieved of duty after Nichols was pulled over for an alleged traffic violation and beaten by Memphis police. Prosecutors say the Jan. 7 arrest, which was captured on police video cameras, led to Nichols’ death three days later. 

            Chief Legal Officer Jennifer Sink told the council that the number of officers disciplined for policy violations could rise to 13. Police spokesperson Karen Rudolph said six officers whose involvement has not been publicly disclosed could face administrative charges. 











            Rudolph stressed that an internal police investigation remains ongoing, and the number of officers disciplined could change. 

            Of those who have been fired, five have been charged with second-degree murder and other criminal offenses in the case of Nichols, a Black man whose death has led to calls for police reform in Memphis and around the country. 

            Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said during the council meeting that besides the internal investigation, there is also an ongoing assessment of the department's specialized police units. The five charged officers were part of the Scorpion unit, a crime-suppression team that has been disbanded.

            Sink said the city could release more information about officer discipline by the end of next week, following administrative hearings. More video of the arrest also will be released, Sink said. 

            Video already made public showed officers punching, kicking, pepper-spraying and using a baton against Nichols, who had fled after being hit with a stun gun at a traffic stop. Afterward, multiple officers stood around and chatted as he sat limply against a car. 

            “We will be prepared to upload onto a website all of the footage, all of the decisions, the entirety of the file,” Sink said. 

            Davis and fire chief Gina Sweat were called before the council to discuss policy changes or reforms put in place since Nichols' arrest and death. But their presentations included procedures that were planned or in place previously. 

            Davis cited past reviews of police procedures; changes in training, leadership, recruitment and career development; data disclosures; adding more supervisors; and policy reforms including duty to intervene and render aid which were enacted after the death of George Floyd.

            That did not satisfy council members who were expecting to hear about changes since Nichols' arrest.

            “I listened to the presentation as patiently as I could, and I heard a lot about discussions and conversations,"" council member JB Smiley Jr. said. 

            ”We're 30 days out and I haven't heard anything specifically to address"" policy changes, Smiley said.

            Smiley then asked Davis what went wrong on Jan. 7.

            “A lot went wrong on Jan. 7,” Davis said.

            “So the reason I asked that question is because what I wanted to hear today is, ‘This is what went wrong, this is what we’ve done to address these issues,” Smiley said. “I didn't hear that today.”

            The council discussed proposed city ordinances related to police reforms later Tuesday, including one to establish a procedure for the department to conduct an annual independent review of the Police Training Academy and another for an independent review process of instances of excessive, unnecessary or deadly use of force.MEMPHIS, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803472,Vlahović inspires Juventus to 3-0 win at Salernitana,"SALERNO, Italy (AP) — Dušan Vlahović proved he is back on form with two goals and an assist to help Juventus win 3-0 at Salernitana in Serie A on Tuesday.

            That snapped a run of three league matches without a win for Juventus. The streak had left the Bianconeri just nine points above the relegation zone coming into the match at Salerno following a 15-point penalty for false accounting.

            It also meant the match was a surprise relegation battle with Salernitana just two points further back.











            But Vlahović helped Juventus push away from the bottom three.

            He scored his first goal for the club since October in the 26th minute with a penalty after Fabio Miretti had been fouled by Salernitana midfielder Nicolussi Caviglia, who is on loan from Juventus.

            Juventus doubled its tally on the stroke of halftime when the Salernitana defense failed to clear a cross and Vlahović’s wayward shot came through to Filip Kostić to bundle in.

            Vlahović did double his tally two minutes after the break with a precise shot into the bottom right corner following a Nicolò Fagioli through ball.

            Ángel Di María hit the crossbar for Juventus five minutes later, while Moise Kean saw an effort come off the post late on.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803474,"US man convicted of aiding Islamic State as sniper, trainer","NEW YORK (AP) — A former New York stockbroker-turned-Islamic State group militant was convicted Tuesday of becoming a sniper and trainer for the extremist group during its brutal reign in Syria and Iraq. 

            
                The trial of Ruslan Maratovich Asainov, a Kazakh-born U.S. citizen, was the latest in a series of cases against people accused of leaving their homelands around the world to join the militants in combat. 

            “Today’s verdict in an American courtroom is a victory for our system of justice"" and against the Islamic State group, Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. Asainov's lawyers had no immediate comment. 











            A onetime broker who doted on his toddler daughter, Asainov converted to Islam around 2009 and later quit his job and started watching radical sermons online, his ex-wife testified. He abruptly left his family in Brooklyn in December 2013 and made his way to Syria as IS stormed to power. 

            In a case built largely on Asainov’s own words in messaging apps, emails, recorded phone calls and an FBI interview, prosecutors said he fought in numerous battles and built a notable profile in IS by becoming a sniper and later an instructor of nearly 100 other long-range shooters.

            “The evidence has shown that people died as a result of the defendant's conduct. It is time to hold him accountable,” prosecutor Douglas Pravda told a Brooklyn federal court jury in a closing argument. 

            Asainov, 46, didn't testify, telling the court he was “not part of this process.” 

            His lawyers didn't dispute that he went to Syria and affiliated with the Islamic State group, but they argued that his accounts of his role were boasts that had no firsthand corroboration and didn't prove anyone died because of his conduct. 

            “Nobody's arguing to you that Mr. Asainov's view of the world is not a very warped view,"" defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in her summation, asking the jury “not to confuse his views with what is needed to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt.”

            “There's not a single piece of paper that ties Mr. Asainov to anything in the Islamic State that would tell you he, in fact, is the person he claims to be,” she said.

            Jurors, whose identities were kept confidential, found Asainov guilty of offenses that include providing and attempting to provide material support to what the U.S. designates a foreign terrorist organization. The jury also concluded that his actions caused at least one death, a finding that means he faces the potential of life in prison. His sentencing is set for June 7. 

            IS fighters seized chunks of Iraq and Syria in 2014, sweeping millions of people into a so-called caliphate ruled according to the group’s iron-fisted interpretation of Islamic law, enforced through massacres, beheadings, sexual slavery and other atrocities. The group’s bloody campaign attracted tens of thousands of foreign fighters; at least scores of them were U.S. citizens, according to a 2018 academic report from George Washington University's Program on Extremism.

            Fighting left a swath of deaths, displacement and destruction in major cities and beyond. The extremists lost the last remnants of their realm in 2019. 

            Asainov was picked up soon after by U.S.-backed forces and turned over to U.S. authorities. Unabashed as FBI agents questioned him, he gave his occupation as “sniper” and frankly detailed how he’d taught others, explaining that he could spend three hours just on the fine points of pulling a trigger, according to video played at trial.

            He had also been forthcoming in messages and calls from Syria to friends and the now-ex-wife he’d left behind, according to trial evidence. 

            “Have you heard of Islamic State? Right. I-S-I-S. Do you watch news on TV? That’s where I am located. I am one of its fighters,” he told his ex in a voicemail that authorities translated from Russian. “We are the worst terrorist organization in the world that ever existed.” 

            He sent photos of himself in camouflage garb with a rifle and pictures of the bloodied bodies of men with whom he said he’d fought. He texted one confidante — in fact a U.S. government informant — a rundown of prominent battles in which he said he’d participated and asked for money to buy a night scope for his rifle. 

            Later, with the sounds of explosions in the background of Asainov’s phone, he asked another friend for money to send his new wife and children to safety as U.S.-backed forces fought to capture the extremists’ de facto capital of Raqqa in 2017. 

            Shroff urged jurors not to take his remarks at face value. 

            “To say the same wrong things over and over again does not make them accurate,” she argued. 

            After his arrest, a defiant Asainov declared at his arraignment that he was an “Islamic State citizen, not a United States citizen,” and jail officials said they later found a hand-drawn version of the militants’ flag in his cell. 

            He told his mother on the jail's recorded phones that her son “doesn’t exist anymore,” replaced by a man who saw himself as a holy warrior who fought and killed on divine command, didn’t regret it and would “be fighting until the end.”

            “I will never change this path, even if they give me freedom a thousand times,” he told her in one translated call.

He abruptly left his family in Brooklyn in December 2013 and made his way to Syria as IS stormed to power.In a case built largely on Asainov’s own words in messaging apps, emails, recorded phone calls and an FBI interview, prosecutors said he fought in numerous battles and built a notable profile in IS by becoming a sniper and later an instructor of nearly 100 other long-range shooters.“The evidence has shown that people died as a result of the defendant's conduct. It is time to hold him accountable,” prosecutor Douglas Pravda told a Brooklyn federal court jury in a closing argument.Asainov, 46, didn't testify, telling the court he was “not part of this process.”His lawyers didn't dispute that he went to Syria and affiliated with the Islamic State group, but they argued that his accounts of his role were boasts that had no firsthand corroboration and didn't prove anyone died because of his conduct.“Nobody's arguing to you that Mr. Asainov's view of the world is not a very warped view,"" defense attorney Sabrina Shroff said in her summation, asking the jury “not to confuse his views with what is needed to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt.”“There's not a single piece of paper that ties Mr. Asainov to anything in the Islamic State that would tell you he, in fact, is the person he claims to be,” she said.Jurors, whose identities were kept confidential, found Asainov guilty of offenses that include providing and attempting to provide material support to what the U.S. designates a foreign terrorist organization. The jury also concluded that his actions caused at least one death, a finding that means he faces the potential of life in prison. His sentencing is set for June 7.IS fighters seized chunks of Iraq and Syria in 2014, sweeping millions of people into a so-called caliphate ruled according to the group’s iron-fisted interpretation of Islamic law, enforced through massacres, beheadings, sexual slavery and other atrocities. The group’s bloody campaign attracted tens of thousands of foreign fighters; at least scores of them were U.S. citizens, according to a 2018 academic report from George Washington University's Program on Extremism.Fighting left a swath of deaths, displacement and destruction in major cities and beyond. The extremists lost the last remnants of their realm in 2019.Asainov was picked up soon after by U.S.-backed forces and turned over to U.S. authorities. Unabashed as FBI agents questioned him, he gave his occupation as “sniper” and frankly detailed how he’d taught others, explaining that he could spend three hours just on the fine points of pulling a trigger, according to video played at trial.He had also been forthcoming in messages and calls from Syria to friends and the now-ex-wife he’d left behind, according to trial evidence.“Have you heard of Islamic State? Right. I-S-I-S. Do you watch news on TV? That’s where I am located. I am one of its fighters,” he told his ex in a voicemail that authorities translated from Russian. “We are the worst terrorist organization in the world that ever existed.”He sent photos of himself in camouflage garb with a rifle and pictures of the bloodied bodies of men with whom he said he’d fought. He texted one confidante — in fact a U.S. government informant — a rundown of prominent battles in which he said he’d participated and asked for money to buy a night scope for his rifle.Later, with the sounds of explosions in the background of Asainov’s phone, he asked another friend for money to send his new wife and children to safety as U.S.-backed forces fought to capture the extremists’ de facto capital of Raqqa in 2017.Shroff urged jurors not to take his remarks at face value.“To say the same wrong things over and over again does not make them accurate,” she argued.After his arrest, a defiant Asainov declared at his arraignment that he was an “Islamic State citizen, not a United States citizen,” and jail officials said they later found a hand-drawn version of the militants’ flag in his cell.He told his mother on the jail's recorded phones that her son “doesn’t exist anymore,” replaced by a man who saw himself as a holy warrior who fought and killed on divine command, didn’t regret it and would “be fighting until the end.”“I will never change this path, even if they give me freedom a thousand times,” he told her in one translated call.“Do you understand?”",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803475,Associate of Russian oligarch accused of violating sanctions,"NEW YORK (AP) — An associate of a Russian billionaire was charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday with violating U.S. sanctions and money laundering.

            The indictment charged Vladimir Voronchenko, a Russian who is a permanent U.S. resident, with joining a scheme to make over $4 million in payments to maintain four U.S. properties belonging to the sanctioned oligarch Viktor Vekselberg. Authorities said Voronchenko also tried to sell two of those properties.

            Voronchenko was also charged with contempt of court for fleeing the U.S. after receiving a grand jury subpoena last May on Fisher Island, Florida, that required his testimony. Voronchenko took a flight from Miami to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and then to Moscow, authorities said.











            Voronchenko, 70, has lived in Moscow, Manhattan, Southampton, New York and Fisher Island, Florida, while promoting himself as as a successful businessman, art collector and dealer and a close friend and business associate of Vekselberg, whose yacht and private airplane were blocked last year by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. officials said in a release.

            The release said Vekselberg, through a series of shell companies, has owned real estate worth about $75 million, including a Manhattan apartment, an estate in Southampton, New York, along with a Fisher Island, Florida apartment and a penthouse apartment there.

            Authorities said Voronchenko and others tried to sell the Manhattan apartment and the Southampton estate after Vekselberg was sanctioned in 2018 by the U.S. Treasury Office.

            It was not immediately clear if Voronchenko has a lawyer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803476,5 priests sentenced to 10 years for conspiracy in Nicaragua,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — A Nicaraguan court has sentenced four Roman Catholic priests to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges stemming from long-standing government allegations that the church backed illegal pro-democracy protests. 

            A human rights group in the Central American country quickly denounced the sentences handed down Monday and made known by lawyers of the Legal Defense Unit.

            It was the latest chapter in a crackdown on the church by President Daniel Ortega.











            On Sunday, a fifth priest was sentenced to 10 years in prison on the same charges.

            The priests were convicted in closed-door trials in which government-appointed defenders acted as the priests’ attorneys.

            Those sentenced Monday had worked with Matagalpa Bishop Rolando Álvarez, and one had been rector of the privately run Juan Pablo II University in the capital of Managua.

            Álvarez is under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and “damaging the Nicaraguan government and society,” and is set to be sentenced soon. 

            Two seminary students and a cameraman who worked for the diocese were also sentenced Monday. All six of the defendants were arrested last year, and all were stripped of the right to ever hold political office.

            The Nicaraguan Human Rights Center described the sentences as “a legal aberration.”

            “This is an insult to the law, an insult to people’s intelligence, an insult to the international community and the international agencies for the protection of human rights,” the center said in a statement Tuesday.

            Alvarez, the bishop, had been a key religious voice in discussions of Nicaragua’s future since 2018, when a wave of protests against Ortega’s government led to a sweeping crackdown on opponents.

            On Sunday, Rev. Óscar Danilo Benavidez, a priest in Mulukuku in northern Nicaragua, was sentenced for conspiracy and spreading false information. He had been arrested Aug. 14.

            The government arrested dozens of opposition leaders in 2021, including seven potential presidential candidates. They were sentenced to prison last year in quick trials that also were closed to the public.

            Ortega has contended the pro-democracy protests were carried out with foreign backing and with the support of the Catholic Church. Last year, he expelled the nuns from Mother Teresa’s Sisters of Charity religious order and the papal nuncio, the Vatican’s top diplomat in Nicaragua.

            Last August, Pope Francis told thousands of people gathered in St. Peter’s Square that he was closely following with “worry and sorrow” events in Nicaragua that involve “persons and institutions.” He didn’t mention the dententions of the priests or Álvarez. 

            “I would like to express my conviction and my hope that through means of open and sincere dialogue, one can still find the bases for respectful and peaceful co-existence,″ the pope said. 

            Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla who first came to power in 1979 after the Sandinista revolutionary group he helped lead overthrew the dictatorship of President Anastasio Somoza, infuriated the Vatican in the 1980s. But he gradually forged an alliance with the church as he moved to regain the presidency in 2007 after a long period out of power.

            Then just days before he was elected to a fourth consecutive term last year, he accused the nation’s Catholic bishops of having drafted a political proposal in 2018 on behalf “of the terrorists, at the service of the Yankees.” He also labeled the bishops themselves as terrorists.MEXICO CITY (AP) — A Nicaraguan court has sentenced four Roman Catholic priests to 10 years in prison on conspiracy charges stemming from long-standing government allegations that the church backed illegal pro-democracy protests.A human rights group in the Central American country quickly denounced the sentences handed down Monday and made known by lawyers of the Legal Defense Unit.It was the latest chapter in a crackdown on the church by President Daniel Ortega.On Sunday, a fifth priest was sentenced to 10 years in prison on the same charges.The priests were convicted in closed-door trials in which government-appointed defenders acted as the priests’ attorneys.Those sentenced Monday had worked with Matagalpa Bishop Rolando Álvarez, and one had been rector of the privately run Juan Pablo II University in the capital of Managua.Álvarez is under house arrest on charges of conspiracy and “damaging the Nicaraguan government and society,” and is set to be sentenced soon.Two seminary students and a cameraman who worked for the diocese were also sentenced Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803477,FA Cup dream over for Wrexham and its Hollywood owners,"For Wrexham’s Hollywood owners, the sequel proved to be a heartbreaker.

            The Welsh soccer club owned by celebrities Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney lost its FA Cup replay with Sheffield United 3-1 on Tuesday, conceding two goals deep into stoppage time.

            A win for Wrexham, the lowest-ranked team remaining in the famous old competition, would have set up a match in the fifth round — or the last 16 — with Tottenham and its star striker, Harry Kane.











            Instead, it was despair for the team from the fifth tier of English soccer which has hit the headlines over the last two years after it was bought by Reynolds and McElhenney for $2.5 million in November 2020 on the recommendation of one of their writers.

            Sheffield United forced a replay by scoring an equalizer in the fifth minute of stoppage time in the first game between the teams, which ended 3-3 at Wrexham’s Racecourse Ground. Reynolds attended that game but wasn’t at the replay at Bramall Lane, where Billy Sharp and Sander Berge scored the late goals.

            “So proud of these boys,” Reynolds, a Canadian-born actor best known for starring in the “Deadpool” movies, posted to his 21.1 million followers on Twitter. “And the 4000 plus away supporters who gave it all.”

            McElhenney, an American actor and director who was the creator of TV show “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” also tweeted, writing: “I could not be more proud of those men than I am right now. They gave it absolutely everything.”

            It was another thrill-a-minute match between the teams, giving Reynolds and McElhenney plenty more material for their behind-the-scenes TV series “Welcome To Wrexham.""

            Wrexham has a history of producing shocks in the FA Cup, having beaten then-English champion Arsenal in the third round in 1992 when playing in the fourth tier and reached the quarterfinals in the 1996-97 season when it was in the third tier.

            The Welsh club had already eliminated second-tier Coventry this season and could easily have done the same to Sheffield United, another Championship team, with Paul Mullin having a penalty saved in the 72nd minute when the score was 1-1.

            Mullin had converted a spot kick in the 59th to equalize for Wrexham, canceling out Anel Ahmedhodzic's opener nine minutes earlier.

            
                Sharp's goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time came from a defensive mistake and proved to be crucial.

            Sharp said after the game he had been annoyed by the conduct of Wrexham, suggesting the team 72 places lower in the English soccer pyramid had already been looking forward to playing Tottenham in the next round.

            “I am glad we’ve beaten them,"" Sharp said. “The way they’ve been as a club before the game, eyeing up Spurs ... They had not even beaten us. They thought we would just roll over.""

            GRIMSBY'S SURPRISE

            The big surprise of the fourth-round replays came when fourth-tier Grimsby won 3-0 at home over Luton, which is in fourth place in the Championship. Grimsby next plays at Premier League team Southampton.

            Second-tier leader Burnley, managed by former Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany, and third-tier Fleetwood also won their replays and will meet for a place in the quarterfinals.

            REMAINING GAME

            The other fourth-round replay takes place on Wednesday, when second-tier Sunderland hosts Fulham of the Premier League. The winner will play Leeds.

            The fifth round takes place at the end of the month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803478,Mat Ishbia to AP: Suns 'will be one of best places to work',"Mat Ishbia said his first major project as owner of the Phoenix Suns will be to listen to employees and figure out what problems they’ve faced.

            After that, he’ll start fixing.

            
                The tenure of embattled Robert Sarver as owner of the NBA’s Suns and WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury officially ended Tuesday, when Ishbia — the chairman, president and chief executive of United Wholesale Mortgage, plus a member of Michigan State’s NCAA championship team in 2000 — took over. He will be governor, while his brother, Justin Ishbia, will be alternate governor.











            Justin Ishbia will be the team's second-largest shareholder, behind his brother. They acquired more than 50% of the franchise, which includes all of what was Sarver's stake as well as some holdings of minority partners, and the sale valued the Suns and Mercury at $4 billion.

            “I’m going to spend a lot of time listening and learning, then make the adjustments to make this not only one of the best organizations in the NBA but also one of the best places to work,” Mat Ishbia told The Associated Press. “That’s a huge part of my success here in Michigan and it will be a big part of our success now in Phoenix. I don’t have enough information to know what exactly it’s been like, but I will dig in and roll up my sleeves and figure it out over the next three, four, five months-plus.”

            The 43-year-old Ishbia was announced as the owner-in-waiting of the Suns on Dec. 20, and the last hurdle before the purchase became official was cleared Monday night when it was revealed that the NBA’s board of governors approved him as the next owner.

            The transaction was completed Tuesday. Ishbia will hold a news conference in Phoenix on Wednesday.

            
                Sarver was suspended for one year by the NBA in mid-September after an investigation found he engaged in workplace misconduct that included racist speech and hostile behavior toward employees. About a week after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced the suspension and $10 million fine — the most allowed by league rule – Sarver said he would start the process of finding a buyer.

            Ishbia’s name had been linked to other potential sales of pro sports teams in the past, including the NFL’s Washington Commanders. And the self-described basketball nut jumped quickly to acquire the Suns and Mercury.

            “This is what I wanted the whole time,” Ishbia said. “My name got linked to a lot of things. That doesn’t mean it was actually necessarily right. The Phoenix Suns, in my opinion, is one of the elite franchises in one of the elite cities in America. To have a chance to be one of the owners of the Suns and Phoenix Mercury is a dream come true.”

            Ishbia’s company, UWM, employs about 7,000 people. It had over $226.5 billion in mortgage originations in 2021, which the company says is a record for wholesale volume.

            “We’re all about culture,” Ishbia said. “We’re all about people. We’re all about the word ‘team.’ It’s almost like a match made in heaven — the city, the location, the NBA, my love of basketball. And I can come in, take some of the really good things they’re doing but maybe make some changes from a culture perspective.”

            There is one immediate order of business: The NBA trade deadline is Thursday.

            The Suns — who went to the NBA Finals in 2021, losing a 2-0 lead and falling to Milwaukee in six games, had the best regular-season record in the league last season — are in a muddled Western Conference playoff race this season.

            Ishbia said he and team president of basketball operations James Jones, who is also the general manager, have talked and will keep talking while Jones gauges the market to see what moves, if any, are right for the Suns.

            “We’ve got to make sure we put ourselves in a great position,” Ishbia said. “I think we have an amazing team and I think we’re in a great position right now. Will I be involved? Yes. Are we highly active? Yes. But at the same time, I think we have a championship-contending team without doing anything over the next two days.”

            Ishbia played for Tom Izzo at Michigan State, and he got into the 2000 title game against Florida at the end. He knew he was out of bounds when he picked up a loose ball in the final moments, but no referee blew the whistle. Sensing opportunity, Ishbia tried a reverse layup at the buzzer; it missed, but he celebrated anyway.

            He senses another opportunity now.

            “For me, this is a lifelong dream,"" he said.

He knew he was out of bounds when he picked up a loose ball in the final moments, but no referee blew the whistle.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803479,Prosecution: Woman planned the killings of her 3 children,"PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts woman used exercise bands to strangle her three children in the family home in a well-planned assault while her husband was out for about 20 minutes picking up medicine at a pharmacy and takeout, a prosecutor said at her arraignment Tuesday.

            Not guilty pleas were entered on behalf of Lindsay Clancy, 32, to charges including two counts of murder, three counts of strangulation and three counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

            Clancy, with a surgical mask over her face, was arraigned in Plymouth District Court remotely from the hospital, where she is recovering from spinal injuries suffered when she jumped out the window of the home. She will likely never walk again, her defense attorney said.











            Judge John Canavan III did not set monetary bail or send her to jail, but ordered she remain in the hospital until she is well enough to be moved to a rehabilitation facility. 

            She did not speak except to say “Yes, your honor” when the judge asked if she could hear the proceedings.

            The prosecution and the defense painted widely divergent pictures of Clancy, a labor and delivery nurse at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, in the weeks and days before she allegedly assaulted her children in the family home in Duxbury. 

            The children were found by their father with the exercise bands still around their necks. Cora, 5, and Dawson, 3, were pronounced dead at the hospital. Callan, 7 months, was also taken to the hospital where doctors restored his pulse but could not restore brain activity. He died several days later, prosecutors said.

            The deaths have shocked the coastal town about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Boston.

            The prosecution said Clancy behaved and appeared normal to everyone she interacted with, including her mother and husband.

            On the day of the killings, she asked her husband if he wanted takeout and went online to measure how much time it would take him to get to the restaurant and pick up some medicine for the children at the pharmacy, prosecutor Jennifer Sprague said.

            “She planned these murders, gave herself the time and privacy needed to commit the murders, and then she strangled each child in the place where they should have felt the safest — at home with their Mom,"" Sprague said. “She did so with deliberate premeditation, extreme atrocity and cruelty.”

            Defense attorney Kevin Reddington, who has indicated that he plans an insanity defense, painted a picture of a woman struggling with mental illness, who had been prescribed about a dozen medications to try and control it.

            “This is not a situation, your honor, that was planned by any means,"" he said. “This was a situation that was clearly the product of mental illness."" Clancy may have been suffering from post-partum depression or post-partum psychosis, he said.

            Reddington has hired a psychologist to evaluate her.

            The prosecution countered that Clancy had been evaluated by mental health professionals before and was told she did not have post-partum depression and no symptoms of post-partum depression.

            Clancy's husband, Patrick, forgave his wife in a post on a fundraising site to assist with medical bills, funeral services and legal help.

            “She’s recently been portrayed largely by people who have never met her and never knew who the real Lindsay was,” he wrote. “Our marriage was wonderful and diametrically grew stronger as her condition rapidly worsened. I took as much pride in being her husband as I did in being a father and felt persistently lucky to have her in my life.”PLYMOUTH, Mass.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803480,Al-Hilal upsets Flamengo 3-2 to reach Club World Cup final,"TANGIER, Morocco (AP) — Saudi striker Salem Al-Dawsari was once again on the scoreboard in a big match.

            Al-Dawsari, who scored the winner in Saudi Arabia's 2-1 upset of Argentina at the World Cup, converted two penalties to help Al-Hilal beat Brazilian club Flamengo 3-2 in the Club World Cup semifinal on Tuesday.

            The Saudi Arabian champion will play either Real Madrid or Egypt's Al Ahly in Saturday's final. It's the first time the club has advanced this far.











            “This is to history, Hilal,"" the club said on Twitter. “Look where we are!”

            Al-Hilal opened the scoring from the spot in the fourth minute with Al-Dawsari after Luciano Vietto was fouled.

            But Flamengo soon picked up its pace and equalized when Pedro, who was also at the World Cup with Brazil, scored in the 20th minute on a crossed shot that gently slid past the goalkeeper.

            The Copa Libertadores champion continued to pressure, but a video assisted decision dramatically changed the encounter in first-half stoppage time.

            Vietto once again fell in the penalty box and the referees later saw a touch from Gerson knocking him down. The Brazilian was sent off after a second yellow and Al-Dawsari calmly added a second for the Saudis.

            Flamengo coach Vitor Pereira, who took the job in January, replaced the team's star midfielder Giorgián de Arrascaeta with Erick Pulgar, a player of more defensive positioning. His strategy did not work and the Saudis came back strong in the second half.

            Minutes after Al-Hilal hit Flamengo's crossbar, Vietto added a third in the 74th minute with a blast from close range to make it 3-1.

            Pedro scored Flamengo's second in stoppage time, but that was the last shot on goal for the Brazilians.

            “We could not come back,"" midfielder Everton Ribeiro told journalists after the match. “It will be a tough moment for us, a moment of criticism, but it will be another challenge for us to overcome.”

            The two teams also met in the same phase in 2019, with Flamengo winning 3-1 before losing the final to Liverpool 1-0.

            The last time a non-European club won the Club World Cup was in 2012, when Brazil's Corinthians beat Chelsea 1-0 in Japan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803495,"As illegal pot dispensaries thrive, NYC goes after landlords","NEW YORK (AP) — In a renewed push to snuff out New York City's thriving illegal cannabis market, Mayor Eric Adams and Manhattan's top prosecutor announced Tuesday that they would go after landlords who allow hundreds of illicit shops to operate.

            During a news conference with the mayor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office has sent notices to more than 400 smoke shops that illegally sell cannabis, warning them of potential eviction proceedings. If shop owners do not cease operation, his office would seek to force property owners to evict the shops.

            It was the latest effort by authorities to force the closure of illegal dispensaries that could undermine the state's nascent legal cannabis market, which began rolling out in recent months and is expected to quickly grow as more state-sanctioned shops open.











            When the state legalized recreational marijuana two years ago, “many people took it that you can just open up a location any way you want,” Adams said. 

            Unauthorized pot shops have cropped up in droves, operating out in the open — and offering cheaper prices than the legal stores, where the products are highly taxed. The number of illegal shops across New York’s five boroughs could exceed 1,200, according to some estimates.

            The illicit stores are cashing in on a lucrative market that the mayor says could reach $1.3 billion, potentially generating $40 million in yearly tax revenues for the city — as long as they are not undercut by illegal offerings. 

            “Marijuana legalization in New York came with rules, and those rules must be respected,"" Bragg said. “Instead of respect for the law, we have seen ... the proliferation of storefronts across New York City selling unlicensed, unregulated, untaxed cannabis products.”

            The notices say that the district attorney's office is prepared to use its authority “to commence eviction proceedings of commercial tenants who are engaged in illegal trade or business,” adding that prosecutors within five days of the written notice would “take over such eviction.""

            The New York Police Department has sued four illicit cannabis shops in Manhattan's Lower East Side to try to shut them down under the city's nuisance and abatement law, as well as the state's new marijuana rules. The city said it took the action after a decoy operation found evidence that the shops sold cannabis products to people below 21 years of age, the legal age to buy marijuana under state law. 

            The state legalized recreational marijuana use in March 2021 and authorized the Office of Cannabis Management to begin establishing a legal marketplace. Most of the shops are to be operated by people of color who had been incarcerated by prohibitionist laws.

            Thus far, the state has issued 66 licenses of the 175 the state expects to distribute. Only two shops have opened, but the rate of openings is expected to accelerate in the coming months.

            “Those legitimate businesses face stiff competition from shops not following the rules,” Bragg said.

            He said it was also a safety issue to ensure that dangerous products, including those containing contaminants, do not make it out on the market. 

            “These illicit storefronts are putting public health at risk while undermining our ability to build an equitable market that works to offset the harms caused by the disproportionate enforcement of cannabis prohibition,” said Chris Alexander, the executive director of the state cannabis office.

            Matt Mundy is the general counsel for RIV Capital, which operates four medicinal dispensaries in the state, including one in Manhattan.

            Mundy said the illicit marketplace not only poses competitive pressures on the developing legal recreational market but also undermines the state's medicinal operations.

            “Our biggest concern as a registered organization and as a soon-to-be participant in the adult-use cannabis market is public safety and health,” he said. “The rapid expansion of the illicit market poses significant risks to both of these.”NEW YORK (AP) — In a renewed push to snuff out New York City's thriving illegal cannabis market, Mayor Eric Adams and Manhattan's top prosecutor announced Tuesday that they would go after landlords who allow hundreds of illicit shops to operate.During a news conference with the mayor, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office has sent notices to more than 400 smoke shops that illegally sell cannabis, warning them of potential eviction proceedings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803497,Eagles GM Howie Roseman again shows his resilience,"PHOENIX (AP) — The “Howie! Howie! Howie” chants at the team’s send-off party in Philadelphia followed Eagles general manager Howie Roseman to Super Bowl opening night.

            They were yelling obscenities at Roseman not too long ago.

            The once-exiled executive who was cast aside for Chip Kelly for a year and returned to lead the Eagles to the franchise’s only Super Bowl title is back again after hitting rock bottom in 2020.











            The Eagles (16-3) are one win away from their second Super Bowl title in five years under Roseman’s leadership. They have to beat former coach Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs (16-3) to hoist the Lombardi Trophy again. 

            “You guys have a job to do. Whether I agree or not, that’s the nature of the beast,” Roseman said of the intense criticism he received in Philadelphia in 2020. “It’s a moment to moment league. We had a terrible moment. In that moment, in this market, people pile on. It’s just the nature of it. I’ve been through it before. I understand it. At the end of the day, it’s my job to turn it around as quickly as possible. That’s what we’re trying to do here.”

            Roseman, who began his NFL career as a non-paid summer intern in 2000 and rose to youngest general manager in the league at age 34 in 2010, lost control of personnel decisions in a power struggle with Kelly in 2015. Kelly got fired after he bombed and Roseman regained his role as GM and executive vice president a year later.

            After the Eagles beat the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl after the 2017 season, All-Pro center Jason Kelce mentioned Roseman’s journey in his famous speech at the team’s victory parade.

            “Howie Roseman, a few years ago, was relinquished of all control pretty much in this organization,” Kelce screamed to the crowd while wearing a costume donned by folks who strut in Philadelphia’s Mummers Parade on New Year’s Day. “He was put in the side of the building where I didn’t see him for over a year! Two years ago, when they made a decision, he came out of there a different man. He came out of there with a purpose and a drive to make this possible. And I saw a different Howie Roseman. An underdog.”

            Roseman’s honeymoon in Philly didn’t last long despite the team going to the playoffs the next two seasons. He was chastised for drafting wide receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside ahead of DK Metcalf in the second round in 2019. It got worse when the Eagles took wideout Jalen Reagor one pick ahead of Justin Jefferson in the first round in 2020. Roseman didn’t get any credit for selecting Jalen Hurts in the second round that year because the Eagles already had Carson Wentz and most people thought they had needs bigger than a backup quarterback.

            So when the Eagles went 4-11-1 in 2020, Roseman was excoriated in Philly. Doug Pederson was fired just three years after coaching the team to the Super Bowl victory. Wentz was traded and Nick Sirianni was hired. That wasn’t popular, either.

            Now, Sirianni is the toast of the town, Hurts is an MVP finalist and nobody cares about Reagor/Jefferson because Roseman drafted DeVonta Smith and acquired A.J. Brown in a trade.

            “I hope it doesn’t happen again in five years but if we’re playing in the Super Bowl I’ll take it,” Roseman said when reminded he’s answering the same questions now that he heard in Minnesota before the Eagles appeared in their last Super Bowl.

            Ten of Philadelphia’s 11 starters on offense are players Roseman drafted. So much for those blunders.

            “There’s so much I wanna say,” Roseman said with a smile. “At the end of the day, I don’t think that we’re at this moment of reflection or talking about anything we’ve done. We’re just trying to win a game quite honestly. We like that we have homegrown players. That’s the key to success. You wanna draft well, you want to re-sign your own guys. Obviously, we’ve supplemented them with some free agents on defense. But when you look at offense, you’ve always had this theory that it’s easier to grow an offense together and it’s easier to bring in defensive players that are free agents or through trades.”

            Roseman made all the right moves last offseason, from a trade with the Saints to acquire more draft capital to acquiring Brown and signing edge rusher Haason Reddick and cornerback James Bradberry.

            “We thought we had an opportunity to be really great,” owner Jeffrey Lurie said about signing off on Roseman’s personnel decisions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803498,Poorer districts win challenge to Pa. public school funding,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A Pennsylvania judge ruled Tuesday that the state's system of funding public schools falls woefully short and violates students’ constitutional rights, siding with poorer districts in a lawsuit launched nearly a decade ago in pursuit of billions of dollars in additional annual aid.

            Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer found that the state hasn't fulfilled its constitutional obligations to students in the poorest school districts, writing in a nearly 800-page ruling that the state is violating those students’ rights to what should be a “comprehensive, effective, and contemporary” education.

            The Public Interest Law Center and the Education Law Center, which represented the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as “a historic victory for students.""











            “This is an earthquake that will reverberate for the children of Pennsylvania for a long, long, long time,” said Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center.

            An appeal to the state Supreme Court is possible, although the districts that sued will fight any attempt to stay judge’s order during appeal, Urevick-Ackelsberg said.

            House Democrats, in a statement, called it a “historic decision” after years of a broken system shortchanging disadvantaged communities and failing to meet moral and constitutional obligations to students. Superintendents from poor districts and the Philadelphia teachers' union also praised the ruling. 

            Top Republican lawmakers, who fought the lawsuit, were comparatively silent, saying only that they were reviewing the ruling.

            The ranking Democrat on the state Senate's Appropriations Committee, Sen. Vincent Hughes of Philadelphia, said the state has billions of surplus dollars in the bank right now and can afford a big boost in aid to the poorest schools to bring the state into compliance with the court order.

            In the ruling, Cohn Jubelirer wrote that students in areas with low property values and incomes “are deprived of the same opportunities and resources"" as those in more affluent areas. 

            That disparity is unjustified, violating both the state's obligations to educate students and the equal protection rights of students, Cohn Jubelirer wrote.

            The school districts that sued presented extensive evidence showing wide achievement gaps between poorer and more affluent districts, the ruling said.

            Those gaps were wider for certain historically disadvantaged groups, including Black and Hispanic students, English-language learners, poorer students and others, Cohn Jubelirer wrote.

            The judge said educators testified that they lacked the very things the state has identified as essential to student achievement, such as safe buildings. 

            “Educators also testified about being forced to choose which few students would benefit from the limited resources they could afford to provide, despite knowing more students needed those same resources,” Cohn Jubelirer wrote.

            The lawsuit, filed in 2014, argued Pennsylvania’s system of paying for public schools did not meet an explicit standard in the state constitution that lawmakers provide a “thorough and efficient system” of education. 

            The plaintiffs — including six school districts, the NAACP and the Pennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools — said Pennsylvania’s school funding system relies disproportionately heavily on local property taxes, helping to widen the gap between rich and poor districts.

            Underfunded districts are more likely to have larger class sizes, less qualified faculty and outdated buildings, textbooks, technology and curriculum, they argued. To get by, they have eliminated positions and offerings, they say.

            One plaintiff, the Wilkes-Barre Area School District, said it was forced to cut 100 positions because of chronic underfunding, eliminating popular programs involving art, libraries, industrial arts and others. The district has also struggled with obsolete school buildings, but simply couldn’t raise taxes anymore, Superintendent Brian Costello said.

            The plaintiffs presented evidence during last year’s trial that schools are underfunded by $4.6 billion, an estimate they said does not account for gaps in spending on special education, school buildings and other facilities.

            Districts spent more than $33 billion in the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available.

            Republican legislative leaders had defended the existing system, telling the judge that public school subsidies were adequate and growing, and that education spending compares favorably to that of other states.

            As state attorney general last year, newly elected Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro filed a brief supporting the lawsuit’s aims and pledged on the campaign trail to “fully fund” public schools. 

            Shapiro's office said it was reviewing the decision.

            Edward Albert, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of Rural and Small Schools, characterized the ruling as a monumental victory.

            “The system is broken, and now somebody put their thumbprints on it and said, ‘We agree,’” Albert said.

            Cohn Jubelirer’s ruling did not direct the Legislature on how much state aid to distribute or how. Rather, she wrote that the court is in “uncharted territory with this landmark case” and left it to the governor, lawmakers and the school districts that sued to come up with a plan to address the constitutional violations. 

            She gave no deadline.

            David McAndrew Jr., superintendent of the Panther Valley School District in Pennsylvania’s coal region, called for immediate action from Shapiro and the Legislature.

            His district desperately needs additional state aid to pay competitive salaries and attract and retain certified teachers, guidance counselors, social workers and other staff, he said.

            “The judge said this is unconstitutional,"" McAndrew said. ""We need those resources to help our kids. I don’t think there should be any delay.”

Rather, she wrote that the court is in “uncharted territory with this landmark case” and left it to the governor, lawmakers and the school districts that sued to come up with a plan to address the constitutional violations.She gave no deadline.David McAndrew Jr., superintendent of the Panther Valley School District in Pennsylvania’s coal region, called for immediate action from Shapiro and the Legislature.His district desperately needs additional state aid to pay competitive salaries and attract and retain certified teachers, guidance counselors, social workers and other staff, he said.“The judge said this is unconstitutional,"" McAndrew said. ""We need those resources to help our kids. I don’t think there should be any delay.”___Follow Marc Levy on Twitter: http://twitter.com/timelywriter",2023/2/8,,World

            Fed’s Powell: Strong hiring could force further rate hikes

            WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that if the U.S. job market further strengthens in the coming months or inflation readings accelerate, the Fed might have to raise its benchmark interest rate higher than it now projects. Powell’s remarks followed the government’s blockbuster report last week that employers added 517,000 jobs in January, nearly double December’s gain. The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in 53 years, 3.4%.Powell made his remarks in an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington.

            REDMOND, Wash. (AP) — Microsoft is fusing ChatGPT-like technology into its search engine Bing, transforming an internet service that now trails far behind Google into a new way of communicating with artificial intelligence. The revamping of Microsoft’s second-place search engine could give the software giant a head start against other tech companies in capitalizing on the worldwide excitement surrounding ChatGPT, a tool that’s awakened millions of people to the possibilities of the latest AI technology. Along with adding it to Bing, Microsoft says it is also integrating the chatbot technology into its Edge browser. Microsoft announced the new technology Tuesday at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington.

            NEW YORK (AP) — A bevy of booze brands will be in the Super Bowl ad lineup this year. Anheuser-Busch has ended its exclusive advertising sponsorship after more than 30 years. The St. Louis, Missouri, beverage giant will still be the largest alcohol advertiser during the game, with three minutes of national airtime and a 30-second regional Budweiser spot. But this year, it will be joined by others, including beer brands Heineken and Molson Coors and liquor brands Remy Martin and Crown Royal, all eager to make their mark on advertising’s largest stage. Brands pay premium dollars to advertise during the gridiron classic, which draws about 100 million viewers each year.

            Super Bowl gambling surging as states legalize it? You bet

            ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The gambling industry’s national trade group predicts that 1 in 5 American adults will make a bet on Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. The American Gaming Association says over 50 million U.S. adults plan to bet on the game, wagering a total of $16 billion. But most of that will happen off the books — whether it’s people placing a bet with an illegal bookie, or filling out squares in an office. Sports betting is legal in 33 states plus Washington, D.C., this year, up from 30 states last year. Experts in addiction say aggressive advertising is contributing to a rise in problem gambling.

            ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Disney’s government in Florida has been the envy of any private business, with its unprecedented powers in deciding what to build and how to build it at Walt Disney World. Those days are numbered as a new bill released this week puts the entertainment giant’s district firmly in the control of Florida’s governor and legislative leaders. Some see it as punishment for Disney’s opposition to the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Republican-controlled Legislature. With Disney’s loss of control comes an uncertainty about how Disney’s revamped government and the Walt Disney World resort, which it governs, will work together.

The London-based company said Tuesday that underlying replacement cost profit jumped to $27.7 billion in 2022 from $12.8 billion a year earlier. Last year’s figure beat the $26.8 billion BP earned in 2008 when tensions in Iran and Nigeria pushed world oil prices to more than $147 a barrel. BP also increased its quarterly dividend by 10% and announced plans to buy back $2.75 billion of stock from shareholders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803501,Minn. governor trusts energy law will survive ND suit threat,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Democratic Gov Tim Walz signed a bill Tuesday that requires Minnesota utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040, saying he's confident it will stand up against a threatened lawsuit from coal and gas producing North Dakota.

            Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum this week renewed his threat to sue his neighboring state over the requirements. He unsuccessfully tried to persuade Minnesota lawmakers as the bill took shape to make changes to ensure that North Dakota utilities — which export electricity produced from coal and natural gas to Minnesota — would not be harmed.

            ""I am not a lawyer but I am surrounded by very good ones,” Walz told reporters after signing the bill into law. “I trust that this bill is solid. I trust that it will stand up because it was written to do exactly that. And just to be clear, Minnesota’s not staking our future on coal and carbon.”











            Walz added that he thought it was “unfortunate” that Burgum is ready to litigate, and that it would be more productive if North Dakota joined Minnesota and the rest of the country instead.

            ""The fact of the matter is, Minnesota is moving into the future and they’re going to have to come sometime,” Walz said.

            The Minnesota Senate passed the plan 34-33 along party lines Thursday after the House approved it 70-60 the week before. Republican lawmakers said it would raise costs for consumers while undermining the reliability of the power grid. Rural utilities said they'll have trouble complying.

            According to the Clean Energy States Alliance, 21 other states have already established 100% clean-energy standards or goals, most with target dates between 2040 and 2050. Minnesota’s previous standard, set in 2007, aimed to cut overall statewide greenhouse emissions to 80% by 2050.

            ""The adoption of 100% clean energy goals by an increasing number of states has been one of the most important energy policy developments of recent years,” Warren Leon, the alliance's executive director, said in a statement. “Minnesota’s addition to the ranks of those states is especially noteworthy, because the state has historically been a leader in clean energy policy and its new goals are ambitious and meaningful.”

            At a meeting of the North Dakota Industrial Commission on Monday, Burgum said the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution and other laws bar Minnesota from having a say over how North Dakota businesses operate.

            “By regulating the percent of electricity sold, they’re essentially overreaching and affecting North Dakota companies,” the Bismarck Tribune quoted Burgum as saying. The commission allocated $1 million to pay for any litigation and voiced support for asking legislators for $3 million, the newspaper reported.

            But Burgum also told the commission — which is made up of him, North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley and Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring — that officials from their state would continue trying to reach an agreement with Minnesota to avoid a lawsuit, the Tribune reported.

            In a letter to their Minnesota counterparts last month, Burgum and the other commissioners said Minnesota’s plan threatens the tax revenue stream from North Dakota's energy industry that they’re counting on to fund their state’s carbon-capture,hydrogen power and other initiatives to “decarbonize” their energy sources

            They also noted that federal courts ruled against Minnesota when North Dakota and its utilities challenged a part of the 2007 Minnesota Next Generation Energy Act that tried to ban importation of power that would increase statewide carbon dioxide emissions from the sector. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals said in 2016 that Minnesota could not do that without congressional approval.

            San Francisco-based Climate Cabinet Action, a political action committee that backs candidates who support fighting climate change, said Burgum's threat is part of a new trend of fossil-fuel industry backlash against states or communities that pass pro-climate measures.

            “States suing other states for passing pro-climate policy is just another tactic by fossil fuel lobbyists to protect their special interests and their bottom line,"" Caroline Spears, the group's executive director, said in a statement.

            The group said those court challenges don't work, citing a lawsuit by the state of Utah and fossil fuel companies against a San Francisco Bay community that banned the handling and storage of coal and petroleum coke. Under a 2021 settlement, a private port operator in the city of Richmond, California, that handles the fuels was given until 2027 to continue those operations.

            And it pointed to a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision to bar Wyoming and Montana from suing Washington state for denying a key permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803502,"Revolving door at QB ruined season for Jets, other NFL teams","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets’ season began with aging Joe Flacco starting at quarterback. It ended the same way.

            And that was the problem. 

            Well, along with all of the other switching, struggling, injuries and inconsistency at QB in between.











            It sent what appeared to be a Jets squad on the brink of ending the NFL’s longest active playoff drought to a 7-10 record, more disappointment and offseason uncertainty. One pivotal area — as it was for other clubs that fell short, such as the Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers — was quarterback.

            “It’s the head of the snake,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said. “And if you’re not getting consistent play or consistent movement from the head of the snake, it’s not going to be good.”

            It certainly wasn’t for the Jets, who were downright snakebit — just as some say they’ve been since Joe Namath delivered the franchise its only Super Bowl title after the 1968 season.

            New York made five changes at quarterback: Flacco to Zach Wilson to Mike White, back to Wilson, back to White, back to Flacco.

            The Jets certainly weren’t alone with that sort of revolving door: NFL teams combined to start 68 quarterbacks — the most in the Super Bowl era in a non-strike year. A league-record 13 teams used three or more starting QBs. In contrast, nine of 14 playoff teams had their preferred starter available for every game.

            Like the Jets, Tennessee and Carolina went 7-10.

            The Titans were 12-5 and the No. 1 seed in the AFC last season, when Ryan Tannehill started every game at quarterback. This season? He missed five starts overall after injuring his right ankle in late October and then again in December, so playing time went to rookie Malik Willis and little-used veteran Josh Dobbs, contributing to a fall from 7-3 and first place in the AFC South to a seven-game skid. 

            Not a coincidence.

            “This is a quarterback-driven league, and people are hired and fired every day over that position,” new Titans GM Ran Carthon said. “I want to spend more time evaluating that position.""

            The Panthers went through a trio of starting QBs — Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and P.J. Walker — and all three missed time because of ankle or foot injuries. That’s aside from rookie Matt Corral, who was lost in the preseason with — yes, you guessed it — a foot injury. The Panthers fired coach Matt Rhule after a 1-4 start before making a late playoff push under interim coach Steve Wilks. He was cast aside for new hire Frank Reich, who might take a QB with the draft’s No. 9 pick. 

            “Quarterback is, I stand by, the most important position in all sports,” Jets general manager Joe Douglas said. “But ultimately, it’s a team sport and you have to have a great group of people around them to support them.”

            Tough to do when quarterback is the weak link.

            Flacco, now 38, started the first three games while Wilson sat with a preseason knee injury. Wilson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2021, had a few good moments overshadowed by plenty of bad over the next seven games. 

            Still, the Jets were 6-4 and in the playoff hunt with a top defense and AP Rookie of the Year finalists in cornerback Sauce Gardner and receiver Garrett Wilson.

            But the season spiraled from there. Zach Wilson got benched, and White delivered a slight spark before being sidelined with broken ribs. After Zach Wilson returned for two games, White gave it another shot, but aggravated his injury.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — The New York Jets’ season began with aging Joe Flacco starting at quarterback. It ended the same way.And that was the problem.Well, along with all of the other switching, struggling, injuries and inconsistency at QB in between.It sent what appeared to be a Jets squad on the brink of ending the NFL’s longest active playoff drought to a 7-10 record, more disappointment and offseason uncertainty. One pivotal area — as it was for other clubs that fell short, such as the Tennessee Titans and Carolina Panthers — was quarterback.“It’s the head of the snake,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said. “And if you’re not getting consistent play or consistent movement from the head of the snake, it’s not going to be good.”It certainly wasn’t for the Jets, who were downright snakebit — just as some say they’ve been since Joe Namath delivered the franchise its only Super Bowl title after the 1968 season.New York made five changes at quarterback: Flacco to Zach Wilson to Mike White, back to Wilson, back to White, back to Flacco.The Jets certainly weren’t alone with that sort of revolving door: NFL teams combined to start 68 quarterbacks — the most in the Super Bowl era in a non-strike year. A league-record 13 teams used three or more starting QBs. In contrast, nine of 14 playoff teams had their preferred starter available for every game.Like the Jets, Tennessee and Carolina went 7-10.The Titans were 12-5 and the No. 1 seed in the AFC last season, when Ryan Tannehill started every game at quarterback. This season? He missed five starts overall after injuring his right ankle in late October and then again in December, so playing time went to rookie Malik Willis and little-used veteran Josh Dobbs, contributing to a fall from 7-3 and first place in the AFC South to a seven-game skid.Not a coincidence.“This is a quarterback-driven league, and people are hired and fired every day over that position,” new Titans GM Ran Carthon said. “I want to spend more time evaluating that position.""The Panthers went through a trio of starting QBs — Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold and P.J. Walker — and all three missed time because of ankle or foot injuries. That’s aside from rookie Matt Corral, who was lost in the preseason with — yes, you guessed it — a foot injury. The Panthers fired coach Matt Rhule after a 1-4 start before making a late playoff push under interim coach Steve Wilks. He was cast aside for new hire Frank Reich, who might take a QB with the draft’s No. 9 pick.“Quarterback is, I stand by, the most important position in all sports,” Jets general manager Joe Douglas said. “But ultimately, it’s a team sport and you have to have a great group of people around them to support them.”Tough to do when quarterback is the weak link.Flacco, now 38, started the first three games while Wilson sat with a preseason knee injury. Wilson, the No. 2 overall pick in 2021, had a few good moments overshadowed by plenty of bad over the next seven games.Still, the Jets were 6-4 and in the playoff hunt with a top defense and AP Rookie of the Year finalists in cornerback Sauce Gardner and receiver Garrett Wilson.But the season spiraled from there. Zach Wilson got benched, and White delivered a slight spark before being sidelined with broken ribs. After Zach Wilson returned for two games, White gave it another shot, but aggravated his injury.New York went back to Flacco and the season ended with six losses in a row — and a franchise-record 12th consecutive year without the playoffs.“We’ve all had a long wait: 54 years from the last Super Bowl is too long,” owner Woody Johnson said. “Way too long.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803504,Turkey and Greece engage in earthquake diplomacy,"In his farewell speech shortly before Christmas 2022, Burak Ozugergin, the Turkish ambassador to Athens at the time, expressed the hope ""that we won't need fires, earthquakes, or other disasters to remind us that we are neighbors.""A few weeks later, these words proved almost prophetic. The catastrophic earthquake that rocked the border region of southern Turkey and northern Syria seems to have brought the two hostile neighbors, Turkey and Greece, closer together.In Greece, both politicians and the general public have responded to the natural disaster with shock and dismay. Athens immediately offered help, and there have been declarations of solidarity at every level: The Greek president, government, political parties, unions, and all sorts of civil society organizations immediately expressed their sympathy and willingness to help.It is not a long way to Gaziantep from Greece, and because of its own experience in dealing with earthquakes, Athens has advanced expertise in the field. Within just a few hours, Greece's special EMAK unit was heading to the disaster zone, dispatched by the government in Athens. A C130 military cargo plane also left for Turkey laden with humanitarian and medical supplies and carrying sniffer dogs, doctors, and first-aiders. Seismologists and the president of Greece's Earthquake Protection Agency, Efthymios Lekkas, were also on board.For the time being, Greece has set aside its difficult bilateral relations with Ankara in view of the drama currently playing out in southern Turkey and northern Syria. The towns and villages there, already afflicted by poverty and war, have now been hit by the earthquake as well. So-called ""earthquake diplomacy"" is taking effect — a phenomenon that brought about an unexpected rapprochement between Greece and Turkey once before.Just three years after the Imia crisis over two small uninhabited islands in the Aegean took them to the brink of war, two natural disasters in 1999 resulted in an easing of tensions. On 17 August, Turkey was rocked by a strong earthquake around the industrial city of Izmit, near Istanbul. At least 17,000 people died in the rubble of their houses; hundreds of thousands were made homeless.The Greek foreign ministry immediately sent rescue workers and trained rescue dogs, doctors, and mobile hospitals. Greek civil society collected donations and organized thousands of tents, medicines, water, clothing, food, and blankets.One month later, another earthquake struck the Greek capital, Athens. And Turkey immediately reciprocated: This time it was Ankara's turn to send rescue workers to help its neighbor. Back then, compassion, solidarity, and concrete help eased the extremely strained relations between Ankara and Athens, and the term ""earthquake diplomacy"" was coined. The positive atmosphere lasted another ten years before quarrels regained the upper hand.It's hard to predict, though, whether it will be enough to reconcile the hostile neighbors this time. In both countries, election campaigns are underway; both Greek and Turkish politicians like to use nationalist slogans, and so far they have shown little willingness to compromise.Now, though, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have at least spoken again, by phone. Mitsotakis assured Erdogan that Greece would put all its resources at Turkey's disposal, and conveyed the support and deep condolences of the government and the Greek people over the loss of life.The Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, also spoke to Erdogan by phone, and expressed her hope that as many lives as possible would be saved. The Turkish president thanked her for both the support of the Greek people and the aid already sent.And foreign minister Nikos Dendias, who is currently in Brazil, contacted his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Cavusoglu to express his condolences to the victims, and to emphasize the Greek government's readiness to provide immediate support for the rescue efforts.There is cross-party support in Greece for the earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria — with the sole exception of the fascist fringe. All other party leaders pledged their solidarity with the affected Turks, Kurds and Syrians, and backed sending urgently needed international assistance, to rescue those trapped in the rubble and provide support for the victims.Unions in Piraeus and Thessaloniki have been collecting blankets, powdered milk, medicines, bandages, diapers, soap, and other toiletries since Monday afternoon. Many non-governmental organizations are already en route to southern Turkey.This article has been translated from German.",2023/2/7,119,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803505,Missouri proposal goes farther than 'Don't Say Gay' bill,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — K-12 public school teachers and counselors would be largely outlawed from talking about LGBTQ people under a Missouri proposal more restrictive than what critics call Florida's “ Don't Say Gay ” law.

            Republican state Sen. Mike Moon’s bill, which received a Tuesday committee hearing in the GOP-led Missouri state Senate, is among several filed across the nation this year that are similar to Florida's new law. 

            The Missouri proposal goes farther than the Florida law, which bars instruction on sexual orientation, gender identity and other lessons deemed not age appropriate in kindergarten through third grade.











            Missouri's bill would only allow licensed mental health care providers to talk to students about gender identity and LGBTQ issues in K-12 public schools, and only if guardians first give permission. 

            “The bill follows the lead of Florida’s ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill but does so with broader impact and implications than any bill being considered in the nation,"" said Katy Erker-Lynch, executive director of the LGBTQ state advocacy group Promo.

            North Carolina senators are expected to vote Tuesday on legislation to prohibit instruction about sexuality and gender identity in K-4 public school classes. The proposal would require schools in most circumstances to alert parents prior to a change in the name or pronoun used for their child. 

            In Kansas, top Republican legislators are focusing on helping conservative parents remove their children from public schools over what’s taught about gender and sexuality. The effort has become their alternative to pursuing a version of the Florida law. 

            Supporters of the Missouri proposal argued Tuesday that parents should be informed about conversations between teachers or counselors and students about gender and sexuality.

            “This is protecting vulnerable children and attempting to protect them from conversations that need to be had with the approval of the parent and potentially at home,"" sponsor Moon told a Senate education committee.

            Democratic state Sen. Greg Razer, who serves on the committee, called the measure the “most disrespectful bill” he has seen since taking office in 2017. Razer said it would prohibit teachers in his Kansas City legislative district from letting students know that he is Missouri's only openly gay state senator.

            “What is so offensive about me that it can't be talked about in schools?” Razer asked Moon. 

            Erker-Lynch told committee members that the legislation “systematically and very specifically erases LGBTQ identity and presence from classrooms.”

            “The fact that the bill was dignified by being given a Senate committee should be appalling to any person paying attention and a wake-up call to those who are not,” she said. 

            The Missouri measure's chances of advancing are unclear, but other transgender-related legislation seems likely to pass. 

            Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden has said Senate Republicans are unified against letting transgender girls play on girls’ sports teams, and lawmakers are considering bills to ban gender-affirming treatments for minors. 

            
                Transgender medical treatment for children and teens is increasingly under attack in many states, labeled child abuse and subject to criminalizing bans. It has been available in the United States for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations.JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803506,North Carolina Senate OKs limits on LGBTQ school instruction,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Public school teachers in North Carolina would be required in most circumstances to alert parents before they call a student by a different name or pronoun, under a bill passed by the Republican-controlled state Senate on Tuesday.

            Senators rejected a wave of warnings that the measure could endanger some LGBTQ students who have unsupportive families.

            While sponsors say the bill is needed to keep parents informed about what their children are being taught in public schools, critics say it would destroy the trust between teachers and their students and make schools unsafe spaces for LGBTQ and questioning children to explore their identities at their own pace.











            The proposal, which passed the Senate 29-18, would also prohibit instruction about gender identity and sexuality in K-4 classrooms, with an exception for “student-initiated questions.” 

            It now heads to the House, where Republicans are one seat shy of a supermajority and likely would need some Democratic support to push it through. A similar version had passed the Senate last session but didn't get a vote in the House.

            Some parents, teachers and students who testified in committee hearings blasted the bill as an attempt at censorship, likening it to the Florida law that opponents dubbed “ Don’t Say Gay.” Others applauded the proposal for keeping what they considered inappropriate topics out of elementary classes.

            Bill sponsor Sen. Amy Galey, an Alamance County Republican, refuted criticisms Tuesday that it might jeopardize the physical safety of transgender and nonbinary students who could be outed to their parents without consent. She pointed again to an exception in the bill that would keep parents from accessing school records if there’s reason to believe it would lead to abuse or neglect.

            “Parents are the primary decisionmakers with respect to their minor children — not their school or even the children themselves,"" Galey said on the Senate floor. ""Parental rights are most important in matters of medical and health-related decisions.”

            While Senate Democrats criticized the measure during floor debate, they and their House counterparts have offered an alternative bill they say protects both parents and students without putting LGBTQ children at risk.

            First-term Sen. Lisa Grafstein, a Wake County Democrat and the only out LGBTQ state senator, shared a personal anecdote and urged anyone with doubts to reject the measure.

            “I want you to be sure to ask yourself this now: Will you be sure that you did no harm by passing this bill, and not one young person will feel like they're trapped and have no one to trust?"" she said. ""That not one young person will be outed to an abusive parent?”

            Lawmakers in at least 23 other states are considering similar bills, constitutional amendments or both. A Missouri bill debated in committee on Tuesday would go farther than the North Carolina proposal, allowing only licensed mental health providers to talk to students about gender identity and LGBTQ issues in K-12 public schools, and only if guardians first give permission. 

            Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told reporters Tuesday morning that he's concerned the North Carolina bill could have similar economic consequences to a 2016 bill that had restricted transgender access to public restrooms and blocked cities from enacting new anti-discrimination ordinances. 

            Widely considered the blueprint for the present wave of nationwide anti-trans legislation, that measure, which has since been rolled back, cost North Carolina hundreds of millions in revenue as businesses, athletic tournaments and conventions cut ties.

            “Not only are these kinds of bills wrong in and of themselves because they hurt people, but they also have the great potential to hurt our economy and to upset this balance that we created,” Cooper said after a meeting with the state's elected executive officials.

            Cooper had signaled last year that he likely would have vetoed the 2022 bill had it reached his desk. He did not indicate Tuesday whether he would veto the new version but said he opposes it.

            House Speaker Tim Moore told reporters on Monday that prospects looked promising in his chamber but that he didn’t anticipate the measure would be fast-tracked. He said discussions so far within the House have been broad and suggested that another version of the measure could be proposed.

            “I think we’ll get a hearing on it (in the House). I think it will successfully pass,"" Moore said. ""I hope it does so in a bipartisan way.”

            Moore has said he expects some Democrats will join Republicans to complete veto overrides this session, but he hasn’t identified the topics on which they could. Democratic unity has yet to be tested by an override vote this session.

            Rep. Vernetta Alston, a Durham County Democrat and another of the state's few out LGBTQ lawmakers, said she's confident Democrats will stand united against the bill if it reaches an override vote. She said it undermines educators and distracts from “the carnage that a decade of underfunding has left in our schools.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803507,"No pitch clock, shift limits for World Baseball Classic","NEW YORK (AP) — Major League Baseball’s new pitch clock, limits on shifts and larger bases will not be used during the World Baseball Classic.

            The three innovations will be debuted during the spring training exhibition season that starts Feb. 24. The 20-team national team tournament runs from March 8-21, and players will return to their clubs for more exhibition games with the new rules ahead of opening day on March 30.

            “There’s going to be an adjustment and learning curve to those, so for the actual quality of baseball in the WBC, it’s probably better that they didn’t spring that on us in important games,” St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt said Tuesday during an online availability. “If something happened in an elimination game that we weren’t prepared for, that could have a negative effect. We’re going to need a learning curve with those and we won’t get it for a few weeks, but we’ll work on it in spring training and other times.” 











            This will be the fifth edition of the WBC following victories by Japan in 2006 and ’09, the Dominican Republic in 2013 and the U.S. in 2017. A scheduled 2021 tournament was called off because of the coronavirus pandemic.

            Goldschmidt was 1 for 13 (.077) for the U.S. in 2017, and Arenado went 5 for 31 (.161) with a three-run homer against Canada's Andrew Albers in the first round.

            “I feel like the hype is a little bit higher this time around than it was in 2017. There’s more guys that want to do it,” Arenado said. “I know it’s not the World Cup, but just watching the World Cup and how awesome that was just to represent your country ... I don’t know if it will get quite there, but get it close at least.”

            Arenado agreed with the decision to not have the new rules in this year’s tournament.

            “Maybe the next WBC, when everyone’s kind of used to it already, you do it,” he said.

            Pitch limits again will be used.

            A pitcher is limited to 65 pitches during a first-round game, 80 in a quarterfinal and 95 in the championship round, though a limit can be exceeded to finish a plate appearance. A pitcher may not pitch in games on three consecutive days. There must be one day off after throwing 30 or more pitches and two days off after throwing 50 or more pitches.

            Designated hitters, the three-batter minimum and video review will be used, but the limit on mound visits will not.

            Thirty-man rosters were due from teams on Tuesday and will be announced Thursday. Each team must include at least 14 pitchers and two catchers, including 10 pitchers eligible to pitch in consecutive rounds.

            “My dad was truly a one of kind person, if you knew him or even met him once you know exactly what I mean when I say that,” DiBetta wrote. “The stories I have received about him from friends, family and complete strangers over the last week have lifted me up more than you can ever realize.”











            Levin, 74, went missing Jan. 30 after dropping off a customer in Okeechobee, a small city north of Florida's Lake Okeechobee. His family reported him missing when he didn't return home and his cellphone had been turned off.

            The Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Okeechobee County Sheriff’s Office previously announced the discovery of human remains near Levin’s last known location before he vanished. FDLE reported Tuesday that it had confirmed the identity of the person found in Okeechobee and notified the person’s family but declined to identify the victim publicly, citing a Florida state constitutional amendment that allows crime victims or their relatives to withhold their names from public reports.

            Levin's red 2022 Kia Stinger was spotted in Miami, Okeechobee and Gainesville in north Florida last week. It was stopped Thursday night in North Carolina, where a U.S. Marshals regional task force asked authorities to be on the lookout. 

            The driver, Matthew Flores, was arrested following a police chase through three counties, Rutherford County, North Carolina Sheriff Aaron Ellenburg said. Flores, 35, fled but was captured a short time later in Ellenboro, North Carolina.

            He's being held on a $2 million bond and scheduled for a Feb. 22 hearing.

            He will eventually be returned to Florida to face second-degree murder charges in the death of Jose Carlos Martinez in Wauchula on Jan. 24, and for the death of Levin.

            It was not known whether Flores has a lawyer who can speak on his behalf.

            Authorities are investigating how Flores obtained the missing Lyft driver’s car. Levin’s family said they do not know whether Flores was the passenger Levin picked up in Delray Beach on Monday. 

            In an emailed statement Friday, Lyft said “our thoughts are with Mr. Levin’s family and loved ones during this deeply concerning time. We’ve been in touch with his family to offer our support, as well as with law enforcement to assist with their investigation.” 

            DiBetta previously said the Lyft gig was great for Levin, who loved telling dad jokes and often told them over and over.

            “It was the perfect set up for him,"" she said. ""He would get a new audience every ride.” 

            Levin lived in the Philadelphia area and was a huge Eagles fan. He worked in auto body sales until retiring to Florida about two years ago. He loved driving for Lyft, where he often told jokes to his customers, his daughter said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803509,IRS urges special refund recipients to delay filing taxes,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Internal Revenue Service is recommending that taxpayers hold off on filing their tax returns for 2022 if they received a special tax refund or payment from their state last year. 

            Last year, 19 states offered diverse programs that offered inflation relief payments or refunds for taxpayers. The IRS issued the guidance Friday due to the agency’s uncertainty about the taxability of the payments.

            “We are working with state tax officials as quickly as possible to provide additional information and clarity for taxpayers,” the IRS said in its statement.











            For residents from states such as California and Illinois, the agency is recommending that they hold off on filing their tax returns until they receive further instruction from the IRS.

            If you received a state tax refund last year, here is what you need to know.

            I GOT A TAX REFUND FROM MY STATE. WHAT DOES THE IRS STATEMENT MEAN FOR ME? 

            If you got a tax refund from your state in 2022, the IRS is recommending you hold off on filing your tax return until the agency gives further instructions. Certain states that provided these refunds have determined that these payments are not taxable for most people. What needs to be determined is if these refunds are taxable on the federal level, said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals.

            In some states, people would get taxed if they received a tax refund in 2022 only if they itemize their deductions, said Keith Hall, president and CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed. An example of a state that is taking this route is Virginia, which has stated that taxpayers that filed a standard deduction will not be taxed for their tax rebate. However, not all states have issued guidance on tax rebates. 

            WHY SHOULD I WAIT TO FILE MY RETURN? 

            Following the IRS recommendations is key if taxpayers want to avoid having to amend a previously filed tax return, said Hall. 

            “I think the IRS is trying to help people save another filing, if they had to do an amended return,” he said.

            I RECEIVED A REFUND AND ALREADY FILED MY TAXES. WHAT SHOULD I DO? 

            The IRS is recommending that you don’t file an amended return yet. If you believe you need to file an amended return, the IRS advises you to wait until further instructions are given.

            WHICH STATES OFFERED SPECIAL TAX REFUNDS IN 2022? 

            Special tax refunds were offered by 19 states in 2022. The list includes Alaska, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Virginia.

            WHAT IF I'M NOT SURE IF THIS APPLIES TO ME?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803510,Browns' Garrett: 'All good' after hurting toe at Pro Bowl,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Myles Garrett's injured toe does not need surgery after the Cleveland Browns defensive end dislocated it during Pro Bowl events last weekend.

            Garrett got hurt while racing Carolina defensive end Brian Burns through an obstacle course in Las Vegas as part of the Pro Bowl's reimagined festivities. Garrett limped off the field and sat down on the turf to check his injury.

            The Browns said X-rays were negative. Garrett's toe popped back into place and the team doesn't expect him to have any issues.











            
                Garrett posted on Twitter that he's OK.

            “Appreciate everyone checking in,” Garrett wrote. “We are all good over here. Go Browns.”

            The 27-year-old Garrett tied his team single-season record with 16 sacks last season despite playing with a shoulder sprain and biceps strain sustained when he crashed his car following a practice in late September.

            Garrett, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2017, has 74 1/2 sacks in six NFL seasons.

            The Browns are expected to upgrade their defensive front during free agency. Cleveland's defense has already undergone a major change with Jim Schwartz taking over as coordinator following the firing of Joe Woods after the season finale in Pittsburgh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803511,Mexico blames anesthesiologist for 35 meningitis deaths,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday they have arrested an anesthesiologist they blame for an outbreak of meningitis that has killed 35 patients and sickened 79. 

            Sonia de la Garza, the chief prosecutor in the northern state of Durango, alleged the anesthesiologist used contaminated morphine. It was unclear what charges he faces.

            De la Garza said the doctor used “improper procedures” in administering spinal blocks, mainly on pregnant women. 











            The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.

            The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don't have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus rely on anesthesiologists to bring their own. 

            De la Garza the morphine was in “multi-use” vials that would be used on more than one patient. She said tests had ruled out the possibility that it might have been contaminated at the point of manufacture.

            Authorities also arrested the head of the state health inspection service and one of his employees.

            They face charges of failing to carry out their duties and homicide. The director was found not qualified to hold the post, and the employee allegedly falsified an inspection report on one of the four private hospitals, failing to report improper handling or storage of medicines. 

            It was the latest scandal for Mexico’s woefully under-equipped health care system, which has also had recurring difficulties in supplying medications for children with cancer.

            In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico’s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803513,Dueling abortion bans emerge in South Carolina chambers,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Dueling abortion bans are once more advancing in the South Carolina House and Senate as Republican lawmakers approach a familiar standstill.

            
                Neither chamber budged from their respective proposals in a special session last year that highlighted the challenging fault lines for GOP-controlled statehouses seeking to further restrict abortion. Five weeks into the current legislative session, Republican leaders have now advanced different proposals they claim adequately address a recent South Carolina Supreme Court decision overturning the state's prior ban.

            “There obviously seems to be some sort of race going on here as to who can get their bill through a committee, through the body, first to the finish line,"" said Republican Sen. Richard Cash, adding: “So we have two chambers moving forward with two different bills. And my concern is we'll end up where we ended up in the fall.”











            In a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor lasting over 30 minutes, Republican Majority Leader Shane Massey outlined his proposed ban. Similar to the now-obsolete 2021 law, the bill bars abortions when cardiac activity is detected, around the sixth week of pregnancy.

            Because each justice wrote their own legal opinion in the January ruling, Massey said it was difficult to craft a ban permissible under their interpretations. Still, Massey argued that the new proposal responds to the South Carolina Supreme Court's concerns in part by defining pregnancy as beginning when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus.

            The Senate bill removes exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest after 12 weeks. Physicians would also be required to document their medical rationale for determining the existence of a fatal fetal anomaly or a risk to the patient's health or life.

            Meanwhile, as in the fall, the House has put forth a more restrictive ban.

            The House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved a ban from conception with exceptions for rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly, and the patient's health and life. While the House proposal would not prosecute someone for seeking an abortion, Republican Rep. John McCravy said medical professionals could lose their medical license for improperly approving one.

            Democratic Rep. Spencer Wetmore criticized what she called extremely broad definitions in the House proposal that could entangle family members alongside physicians and doctors in violating the law. She named one section that bars people from administering, prescribing, delivering or selling any “medicine, drug, or other substance with the specific intent of causing an abortion.” 

            House Democrats accused Republican leaders of ignoring other pressing issues throughout the General Assembly’s sessions-long debate over abortion.

            “I trust that everyone remembers the movie ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Wetmore, referencing the 1993 comedy where a weatherman repeatedly relives the same day.

            Other similarities exist between the House and Senate measures. Both versions explicitly state that the bill does not ban birth control. Both versions impose $10,000 fines or two-year imprisonments for people who “perform, induce, or attempt to perform or induce an abortion” in the Senate bill and someone “who is not a physician” and “prescribes any means of abortion” in the House bill.

            Republicans in both legislative bodies acknowledged “political realities.” McCravy said he added exceptions for sexual assault and fatal fetal anomaly to make his proposal more amenable to the Senate. But, as in the fall, Massey said the upper chamber lacks the votes for a ban from conception.

            “The issue is we don’t have the votes in this body for a ban earlier than when heartbeat is detected,"" Massey said. ""But this is a big deal. This is a big deal. We’d save thousands of lives with this.”

            The continued debates come one day before a joint session is expected to replace retiring South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Kaye Hearn — the high court's lone female judge who wrote the leading opinion in the 3-2 January decision — with Judge Gary Hill.

            Local chapters of Planned Parenthood, the League of Women Voters and other groups have criticized the limited public input. The Senate bypassed a traditional committee hearing last week and sent its bill directly to the floor. Public testimony was limited to one-minute comments at a previous House subcommittee meeting.

            Republicans have defended the process by referring to the many opportunities for public testimony during the dozen meetings held during the special session. Republican Rep. Jay Jordan held a stack of paper he said represented 400 pages of submitted written testimony.

            “The issue has been vetted and discussed in the last year in a very, very in-depth fashion,” said Jordan, vice chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803514,FTX founder heads to court after judge rejects bail request,"NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will head to a New York courtroom Thursday to face a federal judge who said his effort to contact a likely trial witness against him seemed designed so they would “sing out of the same hymn book.”

            On Tuesday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected Bankman's-Fried's lawyers' request that oral arguments about his bail be cancelled because lawyers on both sides have settled their differences on necessary changes to his bail package in order to prevent inappropriate contact with witnesses or damaging encrypted social media communications.

            The arguments, set for Thursday morning, will proceed as scheduled, the judge ruled as he declined to immediately approve new bail conditions that defense lawyers said prosecutors had agreed with, including the exemption of certain individuals from a proposed no-contact list and permission for Bankman-Fried to place audio and video calls.











            A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried's attorneys declined to comment.

            The hearing was scheduled after prosecutors said Bankman-Fried sent an encrypted message over the Signal texting app on Jan. 15 to the general counsel of FTX US.

            “I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other. I'd love to get on a phone call sometime soon and chat,” Bankman-Fried wrote to the FTX general counsel, who isn't named but is dubbed “Witness 1,” in the prosecutors’ letter.

            Federal prosecutors told Kaplan that Bankman-Fried’s communications indicate he may be trying to influence a witness with incriminating evidence against him.

            Last week, Kaplan wrote that Bankman's-Fried's lawyers appealed to him to interpret the message “in a benign way.” But he said their argument was not persuasive.

            “In perhaps more colloquial terms, it appears to have been an effort to have both the defendant and Witness 1 sing out of the same hymn book,” Kaplan said.

            The judge said a possible motive was evident from the fact that the general counsel was undisputedly a witness to some events likely to be at issue in the case and Bankman-Fried faces the possibility of a long prison term if he is convicted.

            Kaplan said the question of whether further measures should be taken to restrict Bankman-Fried's actions was also raised by allegations that he directed employees in the past to use applications whose communications could be erased and because he had invited a telephonic rather than written response from the general counsel.

            The judge said he must decide whether further measures should be imposed to assure the safety of the community from efforts by Bankman-Fried to influence or tamper with prospective witnesses.

            Bankman-Fried, 30, has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, since his December arrest on charges that he cheated investors and that he looted customer deposits on his cryptocurrency trading platform, in part to finance political donations and make risky trades at Alameda Research.

            He has pleaded not guilty. A trial has been tentatively set for early October.

            Also Tuesday, lawyers for Bankman-Fried appealed Kaplan's decision to make public the names of two individuals who signed Bankman-Fried's $250 million personal recognizance bond. The names, which were ordered revealed at the request of news outlets, will remain secret while the appeal is considered.NEW YORK (AP) — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried will head to a New York courtroom Thursday to face a federal judge who said his effort to contact a likely trial witness against him seemed designed so they would “sing out of the same hymn book.”On Tuesday, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected Bankman's-Fried's lawyers' request that oral arguments about his bail be cancelled because lawyers on both sides have settled their differences on necessary changes to his bail package in order to prevent inappropriate contact with witnesses or damaging encrypted social media communications.The arguments, set for Thursday morning, will proceed as scheduled, the judge ruled as he declined to immediately approve new bail conditions that defense lawyers said prosecutors had agreed with, including the exemption of certain individuals from a proposed no-contact list and permission for Bankman-Fried to place audio and video calls.A spokesperson for Bankman-Fried's attorneys declined to comment.The hearing was scheduled after prosecutors said Bankman-Fried sent an encrypted message over the Signal texting app on Jan. 15 to the general counsel of FTX US.“I would really love to reconnect and see if there’s a way for us to have a constructive relationship, use each other as resources when possible, or at least vet things with each other. I'd love to get on a phone call sometime soon and chat,” Bankman-Fried wrote to the FTX general counsel, who isn't named but is dubbed “Witness 1,” in the prosecutors’ letter.Federal prosecutors told Kaplan that Bankman-Fried’s communications indicate he may be trying to influence a witness with incriminating evidence against him.Last week, Kaplan wrote that Bankman's-Fried's lawyers appealed to him to interpret the message “in a benign way.” But he said their argument was not persuasive.“In perhaps more colloquial terms, it appears to have been an effort to have both the defendant and Witness 1 sing out of the same hymn book,” Kaplan said.The judge said a possible motive was evident from the fact that the general counsel was undisputedly a witness to some events likely to be at issue in the case and Bankman-Fried faces the possibility of a long prison term if he is convicted.Kaplan said the question of whether further measures should be taken to restrict Bankman-Fried's actions was also raised by allegations that he directed employees in the past to use applications whose communications could be erased and because he had invited a telephonic rather than written response from the general counsel.The judge said he must decide whether further measures should be imposed to assure the safety of the community from efforts by Bankman-Fried to influence or tamper with prospective witnesses.Bankman-Fried, 30, has been confined with electronic monitoring to his parents' home in Palo Alto, California, since his December arrest on charges that he cheated investors and that he looted customer deposits on his cryptocurrency trading platform, in part to finance political donations and make risky trades at Alameda Research.He has pleaded not guilty. A trial has been tentatively set for early October.Also Tuesday, lawyers for Bankman-Fried appealed Kaplan's decision to make public the names of two individuals who signed Bankman-Fried's $250 million personal recognizance bond. The names, which were ordered revealed at the request of news outlets, will remain secret while the appeal is considered.",2023/2/8,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803515,Kyle Busch violated Mexican gun laws on recent vacation,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Kyle Busch was detained at a Mexican airport late last month when a handgun and ammunition were discovered in his luggage, the NASCAR star acknowledged this week, apologizing for the incident and calling it “a mistake.”

            Busch was sentenced this month to 3 1/2 years in prison and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine for having a gun and ammunition, a punishment handed down by a judge in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, home to beach destinations Cancun and Tulum.

            The federal Attorney General’s Office said the judge decided to allow a conditional punishment and let Busch leave Mexico after he paid a bond. The office did not say how much he paid.











            A two-time NASCAR champion and the winningest active driver in the Cup Series, Busch acknowledged the situation in a Monday social media post. He said he has “a valid concealed carry permit from my local authority and adhere to all handgun laws, but I made a mistake by forgetting it was in my bag.

            “Discovery of the handgun led to my detainment while the situation was resolved. I was not aware of Mexican law and had no intention of bringing a handgun into Mexico,"" Busch wrote. ""When it was discovered, I fully cooperated with the authorities, accepted the penalties, and returned to North Carolina.

            “I apologize for my mistake and appreciate the respect shown by all parties as we resolved the matter. My family and I consider this issue closed.”

            A NASCAR spokesperson said Tuesday that Busch informed the sanctioning body of the incident and is not facing any punishment. Busch is in his first season driving for Richard Childress Racing and finished third in Sunday night's debut, a preseason exhibition at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

            Richard Childress, the team owner of Busch's new car, is an avid hunter and prominent member of the NRA.

            Busch was arrested by the National Guard on Jan. 27 after trying to depart Cancun’s international airport. A scan of his luggage at the terminal for private aircraft revealed a .380 caliber pistol with six hollow-point bullets, according to a statement from the Attorney General’s Office. 

            Busch was brought Jan. 29 before a judge who ruled the arrest was legal and Busch was sentenced Feb. 3, according to the statement.

            The next step would be the judge scheduling another hearing to set the details of Busch’s conditional punishment and where he will pay the fine. He could avoid any additional jail time.

            Mexico’s constitution guarantees citizens’ right to own a handgun and hunting rifles for self-defense and sport, but there are significant bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining a legally registered handgun and the military is the only legal seller. The country is awash with illegal guns, however, most of which are purchased in the United States and smuggled into Mexico.

            Last August, Busch and his family were inside the Mall of America in suburban Minneapolis when shots were fired. They were able to safely leave the mall unharmed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803516,Jackson water system a step closer to getting new owners,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Jackson’s troubled water system could be one step closer to getting new owners after legislation passed the state Senate Tuesday.

            It's the latest development in a crisis that has left residents of Mississippi's capital without consistent access to running water and has aggravated divisions between the Democratic-led city and the Republican-controlled state government.

            The bill would transfer ownership of Jackson's water system to a new regional public entity overseen by a nine-member board — with the majority appointed by state leaders. Sponsored by Republican Sen. David Parker of Olive Branch, it passed in a 34-15 vote and will move to the House for more work.











            Parker said he introduced the bill to establish how the water system will be governed after Ted Henifin, the system's interim manager appointed by a federal court, concludes his work. Parker also said Jackson's water woes are stymying economic development.

            “This crisis has been a black eye on the city of Jackson. But it's also been a problem for the state as a whole,” Parker said. 

            Parker recounted an incident where a German company was considering expanding to Mississippi. The company asked if the state had running water.

            The water crisis has caused repeated outages in which many of the city's 150,000 residents have gone days and weeks without water to drink, cook, bathe or flush toilets.

            Democratic senators rebuked the move as a brazen seizure of a city asset and overreach by the state government into Jackson's affairs.

            “If we’re so concerned about our national reputation, are you aware of how we look right now?” said Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson. “Mississippi looks like the old Mississippi that we heard about and some of us have lived through. We look like we are doing a taking on some Black folks.” 

            Jackson is an 80% Black city. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is Black, as are most of the lawmakers who represent the city in the state legislature. Lumumba has said he wants the city to maintain control of its water.

            Under the bill’s original version, the Jackson mayor would have four appointments to the regional utility. On two of those, the mayor would have been required to “consult” with the mayors of suburban Byram and Ridgeland. The governor would make three appointments, and the lieutenant governor would make two. All nine would need to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled state Senate.

            Parker brought a modified version of the bill to the Senate Tuesday, which he said was the product of a meeting with Lumumba. Under the new version the Senate approved, the mayor would not have to consult with the mayors of the smaller cities. 

            “This is not a problem that the current mayor of Jackson created, that he had had any control over,"" Parker said. “We have been given an opportunity with some federal dollars to try to fix this problem.” 

            Henifin has said that he believed Parker's proposal to create a new regional entity was motivated by a desire by state officials to access a large pot of federal dollars earmarked for the Jackson. Since then, Parker added language to the bill stating that all federal funds should be used within the areas served by Jackson's water system. 

            Parker said he has not met with Henifin, but they have a meeting scheduled later this month. The new version of Parker’s bill also specifies the regional board would be a “corporate nonprofit” — the model favored by Henifin.

            Parker’s district is in northwest Mississippi, but he lives with his daughter at an apartment complex in Jackson when the Legislature is in session. He said scooping up water from the building’s swimming pool to use in their shared apartment’s toilets is part of what prompted him to introduce the bill. 

            The Republican-controlled House voted 83-28 Tuesday to pass legislation that says cities must base water bills on the amount of water a customer uses, prohibiting water billing based on the home’s value. The bill would outlaw a new billing system proposed by Henifin earlier this month. Lumumba watched the debate from a public gallery with other spectators.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803522,Trudeau says Canadian health care isn't living up to promise,"TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that Canada’s health care system isn’t living up to its promise, and he plans to add billions more in funding. 

            Trudeau said wait times in emergency departments have become dangerously long, people are waiting too long for essential surgeries and millions of Canadians are without a family doctor. 

            “For generations, public health care has been a core part of what it means to be Canadian. It’s built on a promise that no matter where you live, or what you earn, you will always be able to get the medical care you need. But right now, our health care system isn’t living up to that promise,” Trudeau said.











            “Canadians deserve better,” he said.

            Trudeau’s Liberal Party government has presented a new health care funding offer that would see Ottawa shift $196 billion Canadian (US$146 billion) over the next 10 years to the provinces and territories, which oversee health care in the country.

            The government has set conditions for the extra funding by asking for commitments to upgrade health data collection and digital medical records

            The premiers have long been asking for more money and pressure increased as the health care system became further stressed from the pandemic. Burned out, understaffed health workforce and emergency rooms could not keep pace with demand.

             About one-quarter of the offer, $46 billion Canadian (US$34 billion), is new money. 

            The premiers of Canada’s provinces say the offer will increase the federal share of health care costs to 24% next year, far short of the 35% the provinces and territories were demanding. 

            Still, most premiers appeared ready to accept the offer even as they promised the health care talks were not over.

            Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, expects public concern about health care to persist.

            “Provincial governments attract most of the blame because they are responsible for delivering it, yet they do not have the fiscal resources of Ottawa,” Wiseman said. 

            “Canada’s health care system is plagued with problems, as is that of the U.S. But the problems are quite different in the two countries. There are health care system problems in virtually every country.""

            Wiseman said health care is effectively rationed in Canada because of shortages of medical professionals. 

            “Nevertheless, critical cases get immediate and excellent attention and treatment,” he said. “In the U.S., the problem is not supply but demand and limitations on it. Some are too poor to get the care they need and many are squeezed by the insurance companies who try to minimize what they cover and for how much.”TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday that Canada’s health care system isn’t living up to its promise, and he plans to add billions more in funding.Trudeau said wait times in emergency departments have become dangerously long, people are waiting too long for essential surgeries and millions of Canadians are without a family doctor.“For generations, public health care has been a core part of what it means to be Canadian.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803523,"As jets closed in on China balloon, hobbyists were listening","WASHINGTON (AP) — The extraordinary scene of U.S. fighter jets getting ready to strike a Chinese balloon had many people along the Carolina coast straining their necks and pointing their smartphones to the sky to capture the moment of impact. 

            But a group of aviation enthusiasts was, instead, intently scanning radio frequencies for the exchanges between the pilots who would follow as Huntress, NORAD’s eastern air defense sector controller, tracked the exact distance as two Air Force F-22 fighter jets closed in on the target. 

            The pilots had to balance striking the balloon when it was at least six miles (10 kilometers) offshore — the distance NASA had advised the military allow to keep debris from falling on land — with ensuring it was still in U.S. territorial airspace. 











            “Five miles offshore,” Huntress advises in a transmission that was captured by aviation hobbyist Ken Harrell, in a recording that was authenticated by NORAD. 

            “Frank One is switches hot,"" the first F-22 reports. The call sign “Frank” was given to both aircraft to honor 2nd Lt. Frank Luke, who earned the Medal of Honor in World War I for downing multiple balloons and aircraft. 

            “Frank Two is switches hot,"" the second F-22 radios in. 

            When Huntress calls out that the balloon is exactly six nautical miles out, Frank One takes the shot. 

            “The balloon is completely destroyed!” radios an F-15 fighter jet that also took part in the mission, advising quickly that “there appears to be metal chaff clouds. … It’s definitely metal breaking apart.”

            This audio, which was first reported by The War Zone, wasn’t on the civilian radio frequencies that commercial pilots use. The Air Force pilots were communicating on an unencrypted military frequency that the North American Aerospace Defense Command uses to conduct missions to secure the eastern United States, under the control center named Huntress. 

            Aviation enthusiasts with the right radios scan for Huntress missions and other military flights as a hobby, calling out exercises. 

            Ken Harrell, a 68-year-old retiree from Summerville, South Carolina, is one of those enthusiasts. On Saturday, he recorded the exchange of the balloon shootdown. 

            NORAD confirmed the authenticity of the recording to The Associated Press in a statement. 

            When Harrell got started a few years ago, he said he “bought the right kind of scanner, put up, you know, a decent antenna and a lot of software to connect to the scanner and just started listening."" He said the scanner only cost about $160 to get started. 

            On Saturday, he got a call from a fellow enthusiast who said Huntress was guiding F-22s in to hit what the Pentagon has said was a spy balloon and China has insisted was a civilian weather balloon. 

            “He says, get on the scanner, man! Huntress has been controlling the F-22 Raptors, you know for the balloon, they’re gonna do it,” Harrell said. “So I jump up, crank up everything, and started listening in.” 

            When Harrell heard the pilots' and controller's voices, “I was excited,” he said. “I've listened to a lot of other stuff — fighters practicing, intercept exercises, and that's cool, but when I first turned the scanner on and it went to my local Huntress frequency, it was pretty apparent: This was a mission.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803525,New receivers helped Chiefs get to Super Bowl without Hill,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs lost one of the NFL’s most dynamic receivers when Tyreek Hill was traded to the Miami Dolphins.

            The loss did nothing to slow them down.

            Kansas City revamped its receiving group in the offseason and the new players quickly meshed with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, riding a high-scoring wave all the way to the Super Bowl.











            “I'm proud of our guys for the job that they've done,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Tuesday. “We had a lot of new faces in there.”

            Kansas City's receiving crew was one of its biggest question marks heading into Sunday's Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles.

            The Chiefs placed Mecole Hardman on injured reserve Monday after he reinjured his pelvis in the AFC Championship against Cincinnati. Kansas City also faced the possibility of not having two others after JuJu Smith-Schuster left the AFC title game with knee inflammation and Kadarius Toney sprained his ankle.

            The good news: both were back at practice this week.

            “They look good,” Reid said. “We'll see how it goes the rest of the week.”

            It went well most of the season.

            All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce is still Mahomes' go-to target, catching 100 passes for 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns.

            With Hill in Miami having an All-Pro season, the Chiefs' new receivers — Hardman was the only returnee — have spread the field in an offense that led the NFL in scoring and total yards.

            Smith-Schuster was Kansas City's big offseason pickup, signing with the Chiefs after five prolific seasons in Pittsburgh. The 6-foot-1, 215-pounder is a strong possession receiver who isn't afraid of catching passes over the middle. He has 78 catches for 933 yards and three touchdowns.

            Marquez Valdes-Scantling, who spent his first four seasons with Green Bay, has field-stretching speed and led the NFL in yards per catch two years ago. Toney has given the Chiefs added depth since being traded from the New York Giants in October, catching 14 passes for 171 yards and two touchdowns in seven games.

            Rookie Skyy Moore had problems with fumbles as a punt returner early in the season, but has been a versatile addition to the offense. He's filled the role Hill had on jet sweeps and had the key punt return to set up Kansas City's winning field goal in the AFC Championship.

            ""We lost an all-time great receiver in Tyreek Hill, someone that did a lot of great things for us, but we’ve got a lot of great receivers as well, “ Mahomes said. ”And coach (Eric) Bieniemy and coach Reid, they went in there and learned what their strengths were, and we maximized that this year.""

            It was good enough to get the Chiefs back to the Super Bowl for the third time in four seasons.

            SNEED CLEARED

            Cornerback L’Jarius Sneed cleared concussion protocol after he was injured against the Bengals, giving the Chiefs some needed experience in a young defensive secondary. The third-year cornerback was Kansas City's second-leading tackler with 108 this season, had 3.5 sacks and three interceptions.

            Mahomes also is progressing from a high ankle sprain suffered against Jacksonville in the divisional round, though he still isn't 100%.

            “I’ll play through all injuries that the trainers will let me play through,” he said. ""As long as the trainers are OK for me to get out there, I’m going to play through it.”

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs lost one of the NFL’s most dynamic receivers when Tyreek Hill was traded to the Miami Dolphins.The loss did nothing to slow them down.Kansas City revamped its receiving group in the offseason and the new players quickly meshed with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, riding a high-scoring wave all the way to the Super Bowl.“I'm proud of our guys for the job that they've done,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said Tuesday. “We had a lot of new faces in there.”Kansas City's receiving crew was one of its biggest question marks heading into Sunday's Super Bowl against the Philadelphia Eagles.The Chiefs placed Mecole Hardman on injured reserve Monday after he reinjured his pelvis in the AFC Championship against Cincinnati. Kansas City also faced the possibility of not having two others after JuJu Smith-Schuster left the AFC title game with knee inflammation and Kadarius Toney sprained his ankle.The good news: both were back at practice this week.“They look good,” Reid said. “We'll see how it goes the rest of the week.”It went well most of the season.All-Pro tight end Travis Kelce is still Mahomes' go-to target, catching 100 passes for 1,338 yards and 12 touchdowns.With Hill in Miami having an All-Pro season, the Chiefs' new receivers — Hardman was the only returnee — have spread the field in an offense that led the NFL in scoring and total yards.Smith-Schuster was Kansas City's big offseason pickup, signing with the Chiefs after five prolific seasons in Pittsburgh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803526,Texas man jailed in Dallas monkey case says he'd do it again,"DALLAS (AP) — A 24-year-old man now linked to an unusual string of crimes that kept the Dallas Zoo on the lookout for missing animals told police that after he swiped two monkeys from their enclosure, he took them onto the city's light rail system to make his getaway, court records show.

            Davion Irvin also said he loves animals and that if he's released from jail, he would steal more, the documents said.

            Irvin, who remained jailed Tuesday on $25,000 bond, was arrested last week after asking questions at a downtown Dallas aquarium about animals there. He is charged with six counts of animal cruelty and two counts of burglary. An attorney listed for Irvin in court records did not respond to a request for comment.











            Irvin told police that on the night of Jan. 29, he waited until dark, jumped a fence to get onto zoo grounds, cut the metal mesh of an enclosure and took the two emperor tamarin monkeys, according to arrest warrant affidavits . He then got on the city's light rail before walking to the vacant home where he said he kept his animals.

            Acting on a tip from the public, police found the monkeys named Bella and Finn on Jan. 31, the day after they were discovered missing, at the empty home in Lancaster, a Dallas suburb about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the zoo. Multiple cats and pigeons were also in the home, in addition to dead feeder fish and fish food that had disappeared from a staff-only area of the zoo earlier in January but wasn't reported stolen at the time, affidavits said.

            Irvin has been charged in two of the odd events over a span of several weeks at the zoo and is linked to another, police said. In the taking of the monkeys, Irvin faces one count of burglary and six counts of animal cruelty — three for each monkey. He also faces a burglary charge in relation to the escape of a clouded leopard named Nova, who was discovered missing Jan. 13. A cut was found in her enclosure, and the zoo closed as a search was launched. She was found later that day near her habitat.

            Irvin told investigators that he’d wanted to take Nova but that he was only able to pet her before she got on top of her enclosure, an affidavit said.

            Police said they’ve linked Irvin to the cutting of an enclosure for langur monkeys, discovered after Nova went missing, but he hasn’t been charged in that. None of the langur monkeys escaped.

            In the days leading up to the emperor tamarin monkeys being taken, a man had been raising suspicions at the zoo, asking questions not only about moving and caring for such monkeys, but about the clouded leopard that had escaped, an affidavit said. He was also seen entering staff buildings near the monkeys’ enclosure.

            After the monkeys were discovered missing Jan. 30, police released a photo and video from the zoo of a man they said they wanted to talk to about the missing monkeys. The man in the images — who police later said was Irvin — prompted the tip that led police to the vacant home where the monkeys were found Jan. 31. An affidavit said the tip came from a caller who said multiple attendees of a church recognized the man from the images as someone who frequented a vacant home owned by the church. 

            Police arrested Irvin on Thursday a few blocks from The Dallas World Aquarium after he'd been there asking questions about animals at the aquarium and a worker recognized him from news coverage.

            Police said have said they are still investigating, but Irvin has not been linked to the suspicious death of an endangered vulture at the zoo in January.

            Meanwhile police in Louisiana announced the arrest Tuesday of a 61-year-old man in the case of 12 squirrel monkeys that were discovered missing Jan. 29 from their enclosure at Zoosiana in Broussard, about 60 miles (96 kilometers) west of Baton Rouge.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803527,Rams OC Mike LaFleur eager to provide support for McVay,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Mike LaFleur is going to wait until he's found a new house and new schools for his kids before he worries about how to make Sean McVay's stressful job easier with the Los Angeles Rams.

            The Rams' new offensive coordinator is still eager to do right by McVay in their first chance to coach together.

            “Right now my mind is totally into, let’s finish the staff, and then let’s get to know these players,” LaFleur said Tuesday. “Let’s figure out what our roster is going to be moving forward, and then let’s get the foundation of what this 2023 Rams offense is going to be. And then whatever happens in August through December, I’m going to be there to support and do my part.”











            LaFleur said talks about any specific coaching duties are “on the back burner” while the Rams flesh out their support staff and while LaFleur’s family settles, but he is eager to embrace whatever responsibilities McVay is willing to give to him.

            McVay clearly values LaFleur’s smarts and experience, particularly from his long history alongside Kyle Shanahan before LaFleur spent the past two years in charge of the New York Jets’ offense. But LaFleur isn’t likely to be the Rams’ play-caller, since McVay has shown no interest in giving up that job even while lamenting his inability to delegate responsibility during his public struggles with burnout over the past three offseasons.

            “It was a pretty simple decision” to join McVay with the Rams, LaFleur said Tuesday. “You’re going into an organization that knows how to win, wants to win, has the right system and process and culture in place to win. And to be able to do it with great people, not just Sean, but the rest of the staff ... what more could you ask for?”

            LaFleur was one year out of college when his older brother, Matt, first told him about McVay, an upstart 24-year-old trying to join Matt on the Washington coaching staff.

            “I'll never forget, they interviewed him in Washington for the quality control job, and I remember my brother calling me up and (saying) he was awesome, and he kept on,” Mike LaFleur said with a smile. “I was like, how good can this QC truly be, especially (when) he's as young as I am? And now I think we all know what he was talking about.”

            Mike LaFleur met McVay for the first time later that year, and they've kept up a professional friendship for the past 13 years. They'll finally work together for the first time in Los Angeles after LaFleur became McVay’s fourth offensive coordinator in seven years with the Rams — and that includes two seasons when Los Angeles didn’t have a formal offensive coordinator.

            LaFleur parted ways with the Jets last month shortly after the end of his second season as Robert Saleh's offensive coordinator. His first experience running an NFL offense wasn’t always smooth, but LaFleur believes the experience he gained far outweighed the bad times.

            “I won’t pass those two years up for anything,” LaFleur said. “We decided two years ago we were going to go young, and we did, and we committed to that. There was things I won’t share in terms of what I would do differently, but it was a great learning experience about building a roster with a lot of youth. I was proud of a lot of things we did, and unfortunately it slipped away from us on the back end, but fortunately I’m in a great situation here.”

            Some of the Jets' problems came down to poor quarterback play, but LaFleur is now joining an offense run by Matthew Stafford, a proven 14-year veteran and a Super Bowl champion.

            LaFleur wasn't about to publicly compare Stafford to the likes of Zach Wilson, Joe Flacco or Mike White, but he knows his new job will be a whole lot easier when Stafford is healthy.

            “It's going to be fun,” LaFleur said. “Coaches can teach players a lot of things, but in more instances, players can teach coaches a lot of things, too. I’m excited to get working with (Stafford), learn from him, and whatever I can provide for him, I’m going to do. I can’t wait to start building that relationship with him.”

            The announcement came after the company based in Union, New Jersey, said it had raised about $1 billion through offerings of preferred stock and warrants to purchase the company’s common stock. The funds will be used to pay off its debt, it said. 

            The company's volatile stock, which rose 92% on Monday, fell 47% on Tuesday, ending the day at $3.01, down 82% over the past year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803531,'Super bloom' swarms force California city to say no more,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A small California city that was overrun by visitors four years ago when heavy winter rains produced a “super bloom” of wild poppies has a message for the public after this year's deluge: Do not come. You could be arrested.

            The poppies are beginning to bloom but so far on a small scale — and the canyon where they grow and parking areas are now completely off-limits, Lake Elsinore Mayor Natasha Johnson told a press conference where she recounted the chaos of 2019.

            “The flowers were beautiful; the scene was a nightmare,” Johnson said.











            Poppies are found throughout California in spring and summer, but usually not as extensively as the blankets of gold that in 2019 covered slopes near Lake Elsinore, a city of 71,000 in Riverside County about 60 miles (96 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles. 

            The focus of the excessive attention was Walker Canyon, a natural area with a hiking trail located just off heavily traveled Interstate 15.

            “Back in 2019 numerous safety incidents occurred on the trail and on our roadways,” Johnson said. “Tens of thousands of people, as many as 100,000 in a weekend — Disneyland-sized crowds — seeking to experience nature trampled the very habitat that they placed so high in regard and sought to enjoy.”

            People illegally parked their cars along the freeway and neighborhoods were so gridlocked that parts of the city were essentially severed, affecting emergency services and the ability of residents to go to stores and work, Johnson said.

            People waited for hours in queues to see the canyon and many were unprepared for the hike, resulting in injuries. 

            California Highway Patrol Lt. Craig Palmer said the agency has already begun saturation patrols of the area, and that freeway shoulders are only for use in emergency situations.

            Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco warned that there will be zero tolerance for parking violations and the result could be a citation, a vehicle being towed or worse.

            “It is a misdemeanor infraction, and you're subject to arrest and booking into jail,” Bianco said.

            The mayor said Lake Elsinore usually welcomes visitors but the 2019 phenomenon came at a cost that was too high for residents.

            “This weekend I encourage you to focus on the Super Bowl and not the super bloom that we’re not having,” she said.LOS ANGELES (AP) — A small California city that was overrun by visitors four years ago when heavy winter rains produced a “super bloom” of wild poppies has a message for the public after this year's deluge: Do not come. You could be arrested.The poppies are beginning to bloom but so far on a small scale — and the canyon where they grow and parking areas are now completely off-limits, Lake Elsinore Mayor Natasha Johnson told a press conference where she recounted the chaos of 2019.“The flowers were beautiful; the scene was a nightmare,” Johnson said.Poppies are found throughout California in spring and summer, but usually not as extensively as the blankets of gold that in 2019 covered slopes near Lake Elsinore, a city of 71,000 in Riverside County about 60 miles (96 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles.The focus of the excessive attention was Walker Canyon, a natural area with a hiking trail located just off heavily traveled Interstate 15.“Back in 2019 numerous safety incidents occurred on the trail and on our roadways,” Johnson said. “Tens of thousands of people, as many as 100,000 in a weekend — Disneyland-sized crowds — seeking to experience nature trampled the very habitat that they placed so high in regard and sought to enjoy.”People illegally parked their cars along the freeway and neighborhoods were so gridlocked that parts of the city were essentially severed, affecting emergency services and the ability of residents to go to stores and work, Johnson said.People waited for hours in queues to see the canyon and many were unprepared for the hike, resulting in injuries.California Highway Patrol Lt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803543,"Rescuers dig through rubble as Turkey-Syria quake death toll passes 7,800","The death toll of a devastating earthquake in southern Turkey and Syria jumped to more than 7,800 people on Tuesday as rescuers worked against time in harsh winter conditions to dig survivors out of the rubble of collapsed buildings.As the scale of the disaster became ever more apparent, the death toll looked likely to rise considerably. One U.N. official said thousands of children may have died.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan declared a state of emergency in 10 provinces. But residents in several damaged Turkish cities voiced anger and despair at what they said was a slow and inadequate response from the authorities to the deadliest earthquake to hit Turkey since 1999.""There is not even a single person here. We are under the snow, without a home, without anything,"" said Murat Alinak, whose home in Malatya had collapsed and whose relatives are missing. ""What shall I do, where can I go?""Monday's magnitude 7.8 quake, followed hours later by a second one almost as powerful, toppled thousands of buildings including hospitals, schools and apartment blocks, injured tens of thousands, and left countless people homeless in Turkey and northern Syria.Rescue workers struggled to reach some of the worst-hit areas, held back by destroyed roads, poor weather and a lack of resources and heavy equipment. Some areas were without fuel and electricity.With little immediate help at hand, residents picked through rubble sometimes without even basic tools in a desperate hunt for survivors.Aid officials voiced particular concern about the situation in Syria, already afflicted by a humanitarian crisis after nearly 12 years of civil war.Erdogan declared 10 Turkish provinces a disaster zone and imposed a state of emergency for three months that will permit the government to bypass parliament in enacting new laws and to limit or suspend rights and freedoms.The government will open up hotels in the tourism hub of Antalya to temporarily house people impacted by the quakes, said Erdogan, who faces a national election in three months' time.The death toll in Turkey rose to 5,894, Vice President Fuat Oktay said. More than 34,000 were injured. In Syria, the toll was at least 1,932, according to the government and a rescue service in the insurgent-held northwest.'EVERY MINUTE, EVERY HOUR'Turkish authorities say some 13.5 million people were affected in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east, and 300 km from Malatya in the north to Hatay in the south.Syrian authorities have reported deaths as far south as Hama, some 250 km from the epicentre.""It's now a race against time,"" World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva. ""Every minute, every hour that passes, the chances of finding survivors alive diminishes.""Across the region, rescuers toiled night and day as people waited in anguish by mounds of rubble clinging to the hope that friends, relatives and neighbours might be found aliveIn Antakya, capital of Hatay province bordering Syria, rescue teams were thin on the ground and residents picked through debris themselves. People pleaded for helmets, hammers, iron rods and rope.One woman, aged 54 and named Gulumser, was pulled alive from an eight-storey building 32 hours after the quake.Another woman then shouted at the rescue workers: ""My father was just behind that room she was in. Please save him.""The workers explained they could not reach the room from the front and needed an excavator to remove the wall first.More than 12,000 Turkish search and rescue personnel are working in the affected areas, along with 9,000 troops. More than 70 countries offered rescue teams and other aid.But the sheer scale of the disaster is daunting.""The area is enormous. I haven't seen anything like this before,"" said Johannes Gust, from Germany's fire and rescue service, as he loaded equipment onto a truck at Adana airport.Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said 5,775 buildings had been destroyed in the quake and that 20,426 people had been injured.Two U.S. Agency for International Development teams with 80 people each and 12 dogs are set to arrive Wednesday morning in Turkey and head to the southeastern province of Adiyaman to focus on urban search and rescue.UNICEF spokesperson James Elder told reporters in Geneva that the earthquake ""may have killed thousands of children.""'TERRIFYING SCENE'Syrian refugees in northwest Syria and in Turkey were among the most vulnerable people affected, Elder said.In the Syrian city of Hama, Abdallah al Dahan said funerals for several families were taking place on Tuesday.""It's a terrifying scene in every sense,"" said Dahan, contacted by phone. ""In my whole life I haven't seen anything like this, despite everything that has happened to us.""Mosques opened their doors to families whose homes were damaged.The Syrian state news agency SANA said at least 812 people were killed in the government-held provinces of Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, Idlib and Tartous.At least 1,120 people were killed in Syria's opposition-held northwest with the toll expected to ""rise dramatically"", the White Helmets rescue team said.""There are lot of efforts by our teams, but they are unable to respond to the catastrophe and the large number of collapsed buildings,"" group head Raed al-Saleh said.A U.N. humanitarian official in Syria said fuel shortages and the harsh weather were creating obstacles.""The infrastructure is damaged, the roads that we used to use for humanitarian work are damaged,"" U.N. resident coordinator El-Mostafa Benlamlih told Reuters from Damascus.In Malatya, Turkey, locals with no specialist equipment or even gloves tried to pick through the wreckage of homes crumpled by the force of the earthquake.""My in-laws' grandchildren are there. We have been here for two days. We are devastated,"" said Sabiha Alinak.""Where is the state? We are begging them. Let us do it, we can rescue them. We can do it with our means.""",2023/2/8,254,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803545,"Moscow intensifies winter assault, Kyiv expects new offensive","Moscow pressed its intensifying winter assault in eastern Ukraine, bringing tens of thousands of freshly mobilised troops to the battlefield, while Kyiv predicted areas in the northeast or south could be part of an expected Russian offensive.Ukraine's military said on Tuesday that 1,030 Russian troops were killed over 24 hours, the highest daily toll of the war. The figure could not be independently verified, and Russia has also claimed to have killed large numbers of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks. For its part, Russia said it had inflicted 6,500 Ukrainian casualties in the month of January.Ukraine national security chief Oleksiy Danilov said in an interview on Tuesday that the Kremlin is expected to target the northeastern Kharkiv or southern Zaporizhzhia regions in a new thrust.""Attempts at an offensive in either the Kharkiv or Zaporizhzhia direction will of course be made,"" he told Reuters, speaking in his office in Kyiv. ""How successful they'll be will depend on us.""The Ukraine Armed Forces said on Tuesday evening that more than 30 towns and villages in Kharkiv and 20 communities in Zaporizhzhia came under fire.Top Ukrainian officials including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have said Moscow will attempt to mount another major offensive with freshly mobilised troops in the coming weeks as the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion nears on Feb. 24.""They need to have something to show before their people, and have a major desire to do something big, as they see it, by this date,"" Danilov said.After Russia failed to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv last year and lost ground in the second half of 2022, Moscow is now making full use of hundreds of thousands of troops it called up in the autumn in its first mobilisation since World War Two.The last few weeks have seen Russia boast of its first gains for half a year. But the progress has been incremental, with Moscow yet to capture a single major population centre in its winter campaign despite thousands of dead.Fighting has focused for months around Ukrainian-held Bakhmut in eastern Donetsk province, a city with a pre-war population of around 75,000. Russia has made clear progress towards encircling it from both the north and south, but Kyiv says its garrison is holding fast.Danilov echoed earlier predictions by Kyiv that Russia still wants to capture all of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the east that Moscow claimed as its own territory last year in referendums dismissed by Ukraine and the West as a sham.Moscow has also launched an assault further south against Vuhledar, a Ukrainian-controlled bastion also in Donetsk province on high ground at the strategic intersection between the eastern and southern front lines.NEW WEAPONS MONTHS AWAYSo far this year, Western countries have pledged hundreds of tanks and armoured vehicles to Ukraine to give it the firepower and mobility to push through Russian lines and recapture territory later in 2023.A new U.S. package of weapons is expected to include longer-range rockets, which would give Ukraine the ability to hit Russian supply lines in all of the territory it occupies in Ukraine's mainland and parts of the Crimea Peninsula.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter he spoke on Tuesday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken about new military aid, sanctions on Russia and ""the preparations of important events.""But it will take months before new weapons arrive, and meanwhile Russia has replenished its manpower. The Kremlin says Western supplies of arms only widen and extend the conflict.""The U.S. and its allies are trying to prolong the conflict as much as possible,"" Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday in a conference call with military officials.""To do this, they have started supplying heavy offensive weapons, openly urging Ukraine to seize our territories. In fact, such steps are dragging NATO countries into the conflict and could lead to an unpredictable level of escalation.""His use of the phrase ""our territories"" appeared to refer to four Ukrainian provinces Russia claimed to have annexed last year, as well as Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014.(Reporting by Reuters bureaus; Writing by Cynthia Osterman; Editing by Michael Perry)",2023/2/8,235,World

            Each of the horses was nominated through a $600 payment to compete in the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont stakes. The Triple Crown opens May 6 with the Derby.

            The number of nominated horses increased by 57 from last year’s total of 312. They include a record 37 horses based in Japan.











            Among the notable horses is Forte, last year's 2-year-old champion trained by Todd Pletcher. 

            Also among the predominantly male horses nominated was a filly named Hoosier Philly.

            Brad Cox led all trainers with 38 horses nominated to the series. Pletcher was second with 36 horses, followed by Steve Asmussen and Ken McPeek with 13 each. Chad Brown and Hideyuki Mori had 12 each.

            Others nominated include Arabian Knight, Cave Rock and Newgate, all trained by Bob Baffert. He is currently banned by Churchill Downs Inc. through this year's Derby, although Baffert is challenging his two-year punishment in federal court.

            For the Derby, horses under the care of any suspended trainer may be transferred to another trainer and become eligible to earn Derby qualifying points as long as the transfer is done by Feb. 28.

            Last year, Baffert transferred two horses to another trainer and both ran in the Derby, although neither was highly placed.

            Horses that were not nominated to the Triple Crown series by the early deadline of Jan. 28 can make a late payment of $6,000 through March 27 to become eligible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803551,Recruiting connection helped land Candace Parker in Vegas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nikki Fargas, then known as Nikki Caldwell, was an assistant coach at the University of Tennessee when she successfully recruited Candace Parker in the early 2000s.

            Parker would go on to lead the Volunteers to national championships in 2007 and 2008, earning AP national player of the year both seasons.

            Fargas, now the Las Vegas Aces president, found herself again successfully recruiting Parker last month, convincing the two-time WNBA MVP to sign with the defending champions.











            “The Las Vegas Aces just from a basketball standpoint, it meets all my needs,” Parker said Tuesday in a virtual news conference. “And then also from a family standpoint, it meets all of my needs. ... I’m extremely excited to be coached by Becky Hammon and obviously the front office putting together an amazing team.”

            A super team, as the Aces are being called by some WNBA experts. The New York Liberty fall into that category as well, already prompting speculation of a potential all-star game of a finals matchup given both teams have separated themselves in terms of pure talent from the rest of the league.

            Just on the Aces, Parker is one of four former No. 1 overall draft picks in the starting lineup, joining two-time MVP A'ja Wilson and All-Star Game starters Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young. WNBA Finals MVP Chelsea Gray is the point guard.

            The Aces not only signed Parker, they brought in four other players and re-signed two.

            The Liberty have added former MVPs Breanna Stewart and Jonquel Jones as well as four-time All-Star Courtney Vandersloot to a roster that includes Sabrina Ionescu and Marine Johannes.

            While the Liberty are trying to catch the Aces, Las Vegas is aggressively trying to maintain its place at the top.

            “Looking at the pieces that we felt like we needed to fill in order to defend our title, (Parker) fits the piece,” Hammon said. “Obviously, her skills, her mind for the game, her past — she does everything. So to be able to add not just her championship culture and mentality that she brings in, but also the human aspect of it. I’m super excited to bring her in and have her in our locker room and get to work.”

            The Aces cleared salary cap room for Parker, who led her hometown Chicago Sky to the 2021 championship and Los Angeles to the 2016 title, by trading two-time Sixth Woman of the Year Dearica Hamby to the Sparks on Jan. 21.

            Hamby posted on social media that she was “lied to, bullied, manipulated, and discriminated against” because she is pregnant with her second child. She didn't back off those words during her introductory news conference last week with the Sparks.

            Fargas didn't mention Hamby by name, but noted “our players and their families will always be in the forefront of who we are as a franchise.”

            “We are here to assemble the best team possible, and when putting together a team, there are times when trades will happen,"" Fargas said. “But that’s for us to also remain competitive. The moves we’ve made, obviously, have given us the flexibility we needed to sign (those) players.”

Our commitment to open lines of communication will continue,"" Ryder said.The balloon caused a political uproar in Washington and prompted the top U.S. diplomat, Antony Blinken, to cancel a Sunday-Monday tip to Beijing that both countries had hoped would steady their rocky relations.China has said it was a weather balloon that had blown off course into U.S. airspace and accused the United States of overreacting.The White House has downplayed any drastic effect the incident would have on U.S.-China relations. Biden himself said on Monday that the issue had not weakened relations.When Austin met Wei in November in Cambodia, he emphasized the need to improve crisis communications.No U.S. defense secretary since Jim Mattis in 2018 has visited China.Despite tensions between the United States and China, U.S. military officials have long sought to maintain open lines of communication with their Chinese counterparts to mitigate the risk of potential flare-ups or deal with any accidents.But China has turned down Austin's requests to talk in the past, before they eventually met for the first time in June 2022.Relations between China and the United States have been tense, with friction between the world's two largest economies over everything from Taiwan and China's human rights record to its military activity in the South China Sea.(Reporting by Idrees Ali, Phil Stewart; Additional reporting by Eric Beech and Rami Ayyub; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2023/2/8,724,World

That would affect products for business, such as the cloud-computing and collaboration tools Microsoft sells, as well as the consumer internet.""This technology is going to reshape pretty much every software category,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella told reporters in a briefing at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.The company's share of search so far is about an estimated tenth of the market. Still, many investors see new technology as a win for all players. Microsoft's stock closed 4.2% higher on Tuesday, while Alphabet gained 4.6%.The power of so-called generative AI that can create virtually any text or image dawned on the public last year with the release of ChatGPT, the chatbot sensation from OpenAI. Its human-like responses to any prompt have given people new ways to think about the possibilities of marketing, writing term papers or disseminating news, or how to query information online.Microsoft's new Bing search engine is live in limited preview on desktop computers and will be available for mobile devices in coming weeks. The company hopes user feedback will improve its AI, which Microsoft officials said may still produce factually inaccurate information known as a hallucination. It meanwhile has pursued work to safeguard against misuse of its tech.Underpinning the new Bing is what Microsoft is calling the Prometheus model - OpenAI's most powerful technology informed as needed by real-time web data from Bing. That means Bing's chatbot can brief consumers on current events, a step beyond ChatGPT's answers that currently are limited to data as of 2021.Jordi Ribas, Microsoft's corporate vice president for search and AI, told Reuters the tech advances his team witnessed last summer emboldened the company to move ahead with an AI-infused Bing.Microsoft's chief financial officer also said OpenAI's ""new, next-generation"" technology is powering its search engine, though officials declined to specify if this entailed the startup's highly anticipated upgrade known as GPT-4.FROM BUSINESS TO CONSUMERMicrosoft is aiming to market OpenAI's technology, including ChatGPT, to its cloud customers and add the same power to its entire suite of products, not just search.In the near term, Gartner analyst Jason Wong said Microsoft's ""partnership with OpenAI is more relevant for its business customers."" Still, he said, it could offer ""disruptive opportunities"" in consumer businesses as well.""Except for gaming, Microsoft has not been a leader in key consumer technologies, such as search, mobile and social media,"" he added.Google has taken note of Microsoft's challenge nonetheless. On Monday it unveiled a chatbot of its own called Bard, while it is planning to release its own AI in search that can synthesize material when no simple answer exists online.Microsoft's decision to update its Edge browser will likewise intensify competition with Google's Chrome competitor. However, the Redmond-based company expects to roll out the updated Bing to other browsers eventually.The rivalry in search is now among the technology industry's biggest, as OpenAI sets up Microsoft to expand its 9% share at Google's expense, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Alphabet reported $42.6 billion in Google Search and other revenue, while Microsoft posted $3.2 billion from search and news advertising.PRACTICAL USESMicrosoft executives said the new Bing would change how people find information on the internet.A chatbot for instance can help users refine queries more easily and give more relevant, up-to-date results.The AI-driven search engine would be able to give clear answers in plain language, synthesizing what Bing found on the web and in its own data vaults, rather than simply spitting out links to websites. Queries on current events would draw more from live data on the internet.At the news briefing with reporters, Microsoft Consumer Chief Marketing Officer Yusuf Mehdi demonstrated how the AI-enhanced search engine also could make shopping easier. He showed how Bing could estimate, for example, whether a certain type of seat could fit in the back of a car by pulling together web data on one's vehicle dimensions and on the shopping product in question.Within the Edge browser, Bing's AI can present takeaways of financial results or other web pages as well, aiming to save readers from having to make sense of a long or complicated document, Microsoft said. It can suggest computer code, too.Behind these efforts is Microsoft's plan to invest in supercomputer development and cloud support so OpenAI can release still more sophisticated technology and aim at the level of machine intelligence dreamed up in science fiction.Already, results of this collaboration are manifesting beyond search. Last week Microsoft announced the startup's AI will generate meeting notes in Teams, its collaboration software, as well as suggest email replies to vendors using its Viva Sales subscription.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in Redmond, Wash.; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Christopher Cushing)",2023/2/8,357,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803558,Isner sweeps tiebreakers in straight-sets win at Dallas Open,"DALLAS (AP) — John Isner won a pair of tiebreakers in a match without any service breaks, advancing to the second round of his hometown Dallas Open with a straight-sets victory over Chun-Hsin Tseng on Tuesday night.

            The fifth-seeded American served 22 aces in a 7-6 (5), 7-6 (1) victory that left Isner with a 498-319 career record in tiebreakers. The 21-year-old Tseng was playing just his 10th and 11th tiebreakers, falling to 3-8.

            Marcos Giron, the No. 7 seed who reached the semifinals of the inaugural event last year along with Isner, advanced with a 6-4, 6-7 (1), 6-1 victory over Alex Rybakov earlier Tuesday.











            Eighth-seeded Adrian Mannarino of France won the final five points of a first-set tiebreaker and the last four games of the second to beat American Steve Johnson 7-6 (6), 6-2.

            J.J. Wolf, the No. 6 seed, had little trouble in a 6-3, 6-3 victory over fellow American Brandon Holt.

            The 5-foot-9 Tseng stayed on serve with the 6-10 Isner, the tour's career leader in aces, before the native of Chinese Taipei finally faltered in the second-set tiebreaker.

            The match was all but over when Isner won consecutive points on Tseng's serve for a 4-1 lead. The 37-year-old Isner won the final six points of the tiebreaker.

            “I was a little bit worn out after that first set emotionally,” Isner said. “But I was able to stay even in the second set and I played a really, really good tiebreaker. And I'm very happy I'm not still on this court.”

            Giron responded quickly after failing to close out the second set, winning the first five games of the deciding set.

            Rybakov broke his fellow American when Giron was serving for the match in the second set. Then Rybakov won the first six points of the second-set tiebreaker.

            “I’m really happy with how I was able to reset in the third and just get back to the game plan from the beginning and elevate,” Giron said. “He played well and served well and kind of hung in there.”

            American Mackenzie McDonald was a 6-3, 6-0 winner over Fernando Verdasco of Spain and will face second-seeded Frances Tiafoe of the U.S. in the second round.

            Wolf will face Radu Albot, who rallied for a 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory over American wild-card entry Liam Krall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803559,Faith leaders urge independent review of Alabama executions,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — More than 170 pastors and other faith leaders on Tuesday urged Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey to authorize an independent review of execution procedures, as Oklahoma and Tennessee did after a series of failed lethal injections in those states. 

            The group applauded Ivey for taking the “bold and necessary step” of ordering a review of Alabama execution procedures following problems locating intravenous lines during three lethal injections, but said that review should be done by those outside the state prison system. Ivey in November ordered the Alabama Department of Corrections, which carries out executions, to undertake the review.

            “Given the gravity of what has transpired, we respectfully request a comprehensive, independent, and external review of Alabama’s death penalty procedures,” they wrote in a letter delivered to Ivey’s Alabama Capitol Office on Tuesday. 











            The faith leaders said the review should be conducted openly — and by a person or group other than the Alabama Department of Corrections. “The fact of the matter is that an agency that has failed repeatedly to get its own house in order cannot be trusted to privately conduct an investigation into problems it is causing,” they wrote. 

            The group cited the example of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, who authorized a state review after acknowledging that the state failed to ensure its lethal injection drugs were properly tested. A former U.S. attorney conducted the review. It found Tennessee had not complied with its own lethal injection process ever since it was revised in 2018, resulting in several executions that were conducted without proper testing of the drugs used.

            A review was also conducted in Oklahoma after the 2014 execution of Clayton Lockett. After the first drug was administered, Lockett struggled on a gurney for 43 minutes before he was declared dead. The review was conducted by a separate state agency from the prison system. It was later learned that members of the execution team had improperly inserted an IV into a vein in Lockett’s groin. 

            The independent Oklahoma Death Penalty Review Commission also scrutinized state procedures. 

            Ivey cited concerns for the victims and their families in ordering the review in Alabama. “For the sake of the victims and their families, we’ve got to get this right,” Ivey said. 

            Carrying out an execution is the state's responsibility to uphold the law and to ensuring justice, Ivey spokesperson Gina Maiola wrote in a statement. ""This is a responsibility Governor Ivey takes very seriously, and as she has made very clear along the way, this will review remain transparent as is appropriate, while also protecting sensitive information,” she continued.

            The Alabama review has so far yielded changes to make it easier to carry out death sentences. At Ivey’s request, the Alabama Supreme Court gave the state a longer amount of time to carry out executions by allowing death warrants authorizing an execution to last for more than 24 hours.

            Ivey announced the pause on executions after a third failed lethal injection in the state. The state called off the November execution of Kenneth Eugene Smith after failing to get an intravenous line connected within the 100-minute window between when courts cleared the way for it to begin and the death warrant's midnight deadline expired.

            In September the state called off the scheduled execution of Alan Miller because of difficulty accessing his veins. Alabama in 2018 called off the execution of Doyle Hamm because of problems getting the intravenous line connected. Hamm had damaged veins because of lymphoma, hepatitis and past drug use, his lawyer said.

            The state completed an execution in July, but only after a three-hour delay caused at least partly by the same problem with starting an IV line.MONTGOMERY, Ala.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803560,Man pleads not guilty to killing 6 at California home,"PORTERVILLE, Calif. (AP) — An alleged gang member pleaded not guilty Tuesday to killing six people, including a teen mother and her baby, last month at a central California home associated with a rival gang, prosecutors said.

            The Jan. 16 massacre shocked rural Goshen, a community of about 3,000 people in the agricultural San Joaquin Valley. 

            Noah David Beard, 25, was arraigned Tuesday and is being held without bail, according to the Tulare County District Attorney's Office. Authorities say he shot Alissa Parraz, 16, and her 10-month-old baby, Nycholas Parraz, in the back of their heads.











            Beard is scheduled to return to court Feb. 16. The Tulare County Public Defender's Office, which is representing him, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            Beard’s alleged accomplice, 35-year-old Angel “Nanu” Uriarte, remains hospitalized in custody after he was wounded in the shootout with federal agents last week. His arraignment has not been scheduled. 

            Both are charged with six counts of murder and other crimes. They each face a potential sentence of the death penalty or life in prison without parole. 

            Investigators believe the two suspects have ties to the Nuestra Familia prison gang. Uriarte was convicted in 2015 of assault with a firearm in association with a street gang, and Beard had juvenile convictions, prosecutors said in a court filing.

            The suspects and members of the victims’ family have a long history of gang violence but the motive for the shooting “is not exactly clear,” Boudreaux said at a news conference last week.

            The other victims were identified as: Rosa Parraz, 72; Eladio Parraz, Jr., 52; Jennifer Analla, 49; and Marcos Parraz, 19.

            The Goshen killings were part of a violent and deadly month in California. 

            On Jan. 21, a gunman killed 11 people and wounded nine others at a Monterey Park dance hall before later killing himself.

However, the exhibition aims for a broader reach in its pursuit of gender equality, choosing representative works from as far abroad as Central America and Asia.Taiwan’s contribution is Li Fangzhi, who passed away at the age of 87 in Dec. 2020. She is best known as being a co-founder of the “Fifth Moon Group,” a collective of painters dissatisfied with the conservative instruction they received at National Taiwan Normal University’s (國立臺灣師範大學) Fine Arts Department in the mid-1950’s. In response, they hosted their own exhibit which included works by Liu Kuo-sung (劉國松), Kuo Yu-Lun (郭豫倫), Kuo Tung-Jung (郭東榮), and others.Each member of the Fifth Moon Group embraced an experimental spirit, and sought to integrate Eastern and Western artistic techniques into their works, such as Fauvism, Cubism, Futurism, among other influences. This helped the group become an important and influential art movement in Taiwan, ushering in avante-garde and modernism.Li's paintings are distinctly modern in her choice of mediums, such as watercolor and oil, though she still managed to retain traditional ink and wash techniques. Li also showed a preference for using thick rice paper for the creation of watercolor paintings, combining transparent watercolor and calligraphic lines, according to the Taipei Representative Office in the U.K. Cultural Division, per the UDN report.The Whitechapel Gallery in London's East End has held several important international exhibitions, including Pablo Picasso's famous anti-war painting ""Guernica” as well as representative works of cultural and artistic movements such as Pop Art.From Feb. 9 to May 7 it will host ""Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-70,"" presenting more than 150 paintings by 80 female artists from different countries. The special exhibition will later tour to France and Germany.",2023/2/8,548,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803575,Space Force vows 'above and beyond' cleanup of Maui spill,"WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — The U.S. Space Force said a power surge during a lightning storm likely caused a mechanical issue that allowed about 700 gallons (2,750 liters) of diesel fuel to spill last week at the environmentally sensitive and culturally important summit of Haleakala mountain on Hawaii's Maui Island.

            Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, the commander of the U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, said a team will take measurements to better understand the severity of the contamination. Mastalir said it's impossible to know right now how far the diesel fuel seeped into the ground. 

            The spill occurred at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex at the summit of Haleakala, 10,023 feet (3,055 meters) above sea level. The site hosts hosts the military’s largest optical telescope, which tracks satellites.











            A pump that supplies fuel to a backup generator from a storage tank failed to shut off during a lightning storm Jan. 29, Mastalir said at a news conference Monday, The Maui News reported. An alarm should have gone off to notify officials of a potential overflow, but didn't.

            The generator is still being used, but the transfer pump is being operated manually, Mastalir said.

            A remediation team will initially clean 200 cubic yards (153 cubic meters) around the generator, to a depth of about 6 feet (1.83 meters). The team will decide what to do next after taking measurements to better understand the level of contamination, Malastir said. 

            “However, industry standard remediation processes and protocols are not sufficient for this sacred ground,"" Malastir said. ""We have to go above and beyond what would otherwise be deemed acceptable, and that is what we are going to do.” 

            On Monday, the spill site was surrounded by sheets of black tarp held down by wooden pallets and concrete blocks.

            This is the latest U.S. military fuel spill that has upset many on the islands. In 2021, the Navy spilled thousands of gallons of jet fuel into a drinking water well, sickening thousands of people in and around Pearl Harbor. Honolulu's water utility is concerned that spill from the Navy's Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility may contaminate another drinking water well that supplies water to 400,000 people in the city.

            The Air Force's lease for land at Haleakala's summit expires in 2031. Some Native Hawaiian groups have called for the state not to renew it. When asked to respond to that, Mastalir said: “We are going to continue to work to rebuild the trust with all Hawaiians, with these Native Hawaiians and their organizations, so that we, given the privilege to operate here, will do so safely and respectfully.”

            Ki’ope Raymond, president of Kilakila ’O Haleakala, which advocates for the protection of Haleakala’s summit, said his group has disagreed in the past that the military should even be on the mountain, but while they are there, they have to increase their vigilance.

            “People have pointed to Red Hill and the other types of spills that have occurred recently, and for this to continue to happen, and to happen in a sacred space, is really difficult, it’s just so difficult to take,” Raymond said.

            The mountain's summit is part of Haleakala National Park, but the space surveillance complex is part of Haleakala High Altitude Observatory and not the park. Red soil and lava rocks dominate the high-altitude landscape, which is also home to endangered and threatened species like the nene, the Hawaiian goose and the Hawaiian petrel.WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) — The U.S. Space Force said a power surge during a lightning storm likely caused a mechanical issue that allowed about 700 gallons (2,750 liters) of diesel fuel to spill last week at the environmentally sensitive and culturally important summit of Haleakala mountain on Hawaii's Maui Island.Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, the commander of the U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, said a team will take measurements to better understand the severity of the contamination. Mastalir said it's impossible to know right now how far the diesel fuel seeped into the ground.The spill occurred at the Maui Space Surveillance Complex at the summit of Haleakala, 10,023 feet (3,055 meters) above sea level. The site hosts hosts the military’s largest optical telescope, which tracks satellites.A pump that supplies fuel to a backup generator from a storage tank failed to shut off during a lightning storm Jan. 29, Mastalir said at a news conference Monday, The Maui News reported. An alarm should have gone off to notify officials of a potential overflow, but didn't.The generator is still being used, but the transfer pump is being operated manually, Mastalir said.A remediation team will initially clean 200 cubic yards (153 cubic meters) around the generator, to a depth of about 6 feet (1.83 meters).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803576,"Memphis officer took, shared photos of bloodied Tyre Nichols","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Documents released Tuesday provided a scathing account of what authorities called the “blatantly unprofessional” conduct of five officers involved in the fatal police beating of Tyre Nichols during a traffic stop last month — including new revelations about how one officer took and shared pictures of the bloodied victim.

            The officer, Demetrius Haley, stood over Nichols as he lay propped against a police car and took photographs, which Haley sent to other officers and a female acquaintance, according to documents released by the Tennessee Peace Officers Standards and Training Commission.

            “Your on-duty conduct was unjustly, blatantly unprofessional and unbecoming for a sworn public servant,” the Memphis Police Department wrote in requesting that Haley and the other officers be decertified. 











            Haley's lawyer declined to comment, and lawyers for the other four officers either declined to comment or did not respond to requests from The Associated Press.

            
                The five officers — Haley, Desmond Mills Jr., Tadarrius Bean, Justin Smith and Emmitt Martin III — have all been fired and charged with second-degree murder. The new documents offer the most detailed account to date of each officer's actions.

            Another officer has also been fired and a seventh has been relieved of duty in connection with the latest police killing to prompt angry nationwide protests and an intense public conversation about how police officers treat Black residents.

            As many as 13 Memphis officers could end up being disciplined, officials said Tuesday.

            The newly released documents are part of a request by the Memphis Police Department that the five officers who have been charged with murder be decertified and prohibited from working in law enforcement again. Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis signed each of the five requests to decertify the officers.

            Haley, who was driving an unmarked car and wore a black sweatshirt hoodie over his head, forced Nichols from his car using loud profanity, then sprayed him directly in the eyes with a chemical irritant spray, according to the statement.

            “You never told the driver the purpose of the vehicle stop or that he was under arrest,” it states.

            Haley did not have his body camera on when he stopped Nichols but was on a phone call with someone who overheard the encounter. 

            Nichols ran from the officers but was apprehended again a few blocks away. At that point, Haley kicked him in the torso as three other officers were handcuffing him. Other officers kicked Nichols in the face, punched him or struck him with a baton. According to footage captured on a utility pole camera, one of the officers appears to quickly take a photo of Nichols on his phone as flashlights are shined on him.

            “You and other officers were captured on body worn camera making multiple unprofessional comments, laughing, bragging about your involvement,” the decertification charges against Mills said.

            They added, “You admitted you did not provide immediate medical aid and walked away and decontaminated yourself from chemical irritant spray,” and further accused Mills of later failing to give Nichols' mother an accurate account of what happened.

            Martin claimed Nichols tried to snatch the officer’s gun from his holster after another officer forced him out of the vehicle, with Martin helping by grabbing Nichols’ wrist. However, video evidence doesn’t corroborate the gun-grab claim, the documents said.

            Audio from a body camera did not capture Nichols using profanity or making violent threats — instead, he appeared calm and polite in his comments to the officers. Martin, meanwhile, cussed at Nichols and threatened to knock him out as he commanded Nichols to put his arm behind his back.

            Martin also failed to disclose in a required form that he punched Nichols in the face and kicked him multiple times, and instead added in his later statement to investigators that he gave “body blows,” the documents said. Video showed Martin kicking Nichols repeatedly and punching him in the face five times while two officers held Nichols’ arms.

            Police deemed Martin's oral and written statements deceitful, the charges said.

            A hearing officer wrote of Justin Smith: “You admitted you struck an unarmed and non-violent subject with a closed fist two to three times in the face because you and your partner were unable to handcuff him. ... You sprayed the subject with your chemical irritant spray and also held the individual’s arm while other officers kicked, punched and pepper sprayed him several times.”

            In a letter from Smith included in his file, he defends his conduct, stating that Nichols was “violent and would not comply.”

            Bean was accused of holding Nichols by one arm while another officer pepper sprayed and beat him with a baton. It also notes that his indifference to Nichols’ distress in the aftermath was reported by a civilian who took video of the incident.

            Nichols died three days after the beating. His family attended the State of the Union address Tuesday as guests of first lady Jill Biden.

            Given that the number of casualties from the earthquake in Turkey and Syria continues to rise, the Taiwan government has decided to boost its original donation of US$200,000 in order to further aid the Turkish government to resettle quake victims so they can resume their daily lives as soon as possible, MOFA said. The ministry also said Taiwan will cooperate with Turkish and foreign NGOs to provide daily necessities and materials for those in the disaster-stricken areas.

            The Taiwan government has already dispatched two search and rescue teams to Turkey and opened an account for people to contribute to disaster relief in Turkey, it added.

            For domestic donations, there are two accounts under the name “Ministry of Health and Welfare Donation”: 270750 via interbank remittance and 50269506 via postal remittance.











            There is also a Mega International Commercial Bank account under the name “Ministry of Health and Welfare Donation” for those living abroad: 007-09-11868-0.

            Additionally, the Turkish Trade Office in Taipei has requested those who would like to make in-kind donations to contact their office by email (tr-office.taipei@mfa.gov.tr) and leave their contact number and details of the donations, including quantity and weight information. The office has shared a list of necessary items for the quake victims, including winter clothing and tents, blankets, mattresses/sleeping pads, and sleeping bags.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803598,North Korean leader Kim brings daughter to visit troops,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his daughter to visit troops to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the country's army as he lauded the “irresistible might” of his nuclear-armed military, state media said Wednesday.

            The visit preceded a massive military parade that apparently began Wednesday night in the capital, Pyongyang, where Kim was expected to showcase the latest hardware of his fast-growing nuclear weapons program that stokes the concern of its neighbors and the United States. 

            Two South Korean officials said the parade likely kicked off around 9 p.m. They didn’t provide further details and it wasn’t immediately clear whether Kim was attending. North Korean military parades are closely watched by outside governments and experts as they often feature newly developed weapons systems the North intends to eventually test and deploy. 











            In her fourth known public appearance, Kim's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, believed to be 9 or 10 years old, stood close to her father as he shook the hands of senior officials and then sat next to him at a table. Analysts say Kim’s decision to bring his daughter to public events tied to his military is to remind the world he has no intention to voluntarily surrender his nuclear weapons, which he apparently sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family’s dynastic rule.

            State media’s lofty description of Kim Ju Ae, who has been called “respected” and “beloved,” has also inspired debate on whether she’s being primed as her father’s successor. She attended a flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in November and has accompanied her father to a meeting with military scientists and an inspection of ballistic missiles.

            North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim visited the lodging quarters of the Korean People’s Army’s general officers with his daughter. He later gave an encouraging speech to troops at a banquet, praising them for maintaining the “strongest army in the world” despite external difficulties.

            The visit came a day after Kim presided over a meeting with his top military brass and called for an expansion of combat exercises aimed at sharpening war readiness, as he looks to escalate an already provocative run in weapons demonstrations in the face of deepening tensions with his neighbors and Washington.

            State media photos showed military officials applauding at the banquet, which appeared to be held at Pyongyang’s Yanggakdo Hotel. Kim and his daughter dressed alike in black suits and white dress shirts and held hands as they walked down a red carpet alongside Kim's wife, Ri Sol Ju.

            Kim during his speech said it was his “greatest honor"" and delight to be the supreme commander of an army that is “fulfilling (the) call of the times and history as the strongest army in the world.”

            State media reports on Kim’s visit to troops didn’t mention any comments made toward Washington or Seoul. But Pyongyang’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday that the North’s military is prepared to unleash a “super strong strike of unimaginable might to wipe out the origins of provocations without a trace” when facing enemy threats.

            The newspaper said North Korea’s ramped up weapons tests and combat exercises last year were successful demonstrations of “overwhelming military might” that supports the government’s escalatory nuclear doctrine and its principle of “power-to-power, all-out confrontation” against enemies.

            Residents in Pyongyang marked the anniversary by visiting the city’s Mansu Hill to lay flowers and pay respect to the statues of their late leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, respectively the grandfather and father of their ruler, as soldiers lined up to salute. 

            North Korean state media haven't confirmed plans for a parade. But commercial satellite images have shown weeks of apparent preparations involving huge numbers of troops and civilians for the event typically intended to glorify Kim Jong Un’s rule and his relentless push to cement the North’s status as a nuclear power.

            North Korea is also facing deepening economic isolation and food shortages, showing the costs of Kim’s nuclear ambitions are piling up. 

            North Korea is coming off a record-breaking year in weapons testing, and the dozens of missiles it fired in 2022 included potentially nuclear-capable systems designed to strike targets in South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

            The intensified testing activity was punctuated by fiery statements threatening preemptive nuclear attacks against its neighbors and the United States in a broad range of scenarios where it may perceive its leadership as under threat.

            Animosity could rise in coming months with Kim doubling down on his nuclear push entering 2023. 

            During a major political conference in December, Kim called for an “exponential increase” of the country’s nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nukes targeting “enemy” South Korea and the development of more powerful intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the continental United States.

            Aside of developmental tests, North Korea could also dial up its military demonstrations in response the United States’ expanding combined militarily exercises with South Korea, which the allies say are aimed at countering the North’s evolving threat. 

            North Korea’s Foreign Ministry last week warned that the country is prepared to counter U.S. military moves with the “most overwhelming nuclear force” as it condemned U.S. plans to expand its joint exercise with South Korea and deploy more advanced military assets like bombers and aircraft carriers to the region.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un brought his daughter to visit troops to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the country's army as he lauded the “irresistible might” of his nuclear-armed military, state media said Wednesday.The visit preceded a massive military parade that apparently began Wednesday night in the capital, Pyongyang, where Kim was expected to showcase the latest hardware of his fast-growing nuclear weapons program that stokes the concern of its neighbors and the United States.Two South Korean officials said the parade likely kicked off around 9 p.m. They didn’t provide further details and it wasn’t immediately clear whether Kim was attending. North Korean military parades are closely watched by outside governments and experts as they often feature newly developed weapons systems the North intends to eventually test and deploy.In her fourth known public appearance, Kim's daughter, Kim Ju Ae, believed to be 9 or 10 years old, stood close to her father as he shook the hands of senior officials and then sat next to him at a table. Analysts say Kim’s decision to bring his daughter to public events tied to his military is to remind the world he has no intention to voluntarily surrender his nuclear weapons, which he apparently sees as the strongest guarantee of his survival and the extension of his family’s dynastic rule.State media’s lofty description of Kim Ju Ae, who has been called “respected” and “beloved,” has also inspired debate on whether she’s being primed as her father’s successor. She attended a flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in November and has accompanied her father to a meeting with military scientists and an inspection of ballistic missiles.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim visited the lodging quarters of the Korean People’s Army’s general officers with his daughter. He later gave an encouraging speech to troops at a banquet, praising them for maintaining the “strongest army in the world” despite external difficulties.The visit came a day after Kim presided over a meeting with his top military brass and called for an expansion of combat exercises aimed at sharpening war readiness, as he looks to escalate an already provocative run in weapons demonstrations in the face of deepening tensions with his neighbors and Washington.State media photos showed military officials applauding at the banquet, which appeared to be held at Pyongyang’s Yanggakdo Hotel. Kim and his daughter dressed alike in black suits and white dress shirts and held hands as they walked down a red carpet alongside Kim's wife, Ri Sol Ju.Kim during his speech said it was his “greatest honor"" and delight to be the supreme commander of an army that is “fulfilling (the) call of the times and history as the strongest army in the world.”State media reports on Kim’s visit to troops didn’t mention any comments made toward Washington or Seoul. But Pyongyang’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in an editorial Wednesday that the North’s military is prepared to unleash a “super strong strike of unimaginable might to wipe out the origins of provocations without a trace” when facing enemy threats.The newspaper said North Korea’s ramped up weapons tests and combat exercises last year were successful demonstrations of “overwhelming military might” that supports the government’s escalatory nuclear doctrine and its principle of “power-to-power, all-out confrontation” against enemies.Residents in Pyongyang marked the anniversary by visiting the city’s Mansu Hill to lay flowers and pay respect to the statues of their late leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, respectively the grandfather and father of their ruler, as soldiers lined up to salute.North Korean state media haven't confirmed plans for a parade.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803599,'Dances With Wolves' actor charged in Canada in 2018 rape,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Canadian police confirmed Tuesday they are pursuing a criminal case against a former “Dances With Wolves” actor who was arrested last week and charged in Nevada with sexually abusing and trafficking Indigenous women and girls.

            Nathan Chasing Horse, who also goes by Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, was taken into custody Jan. 31 near the North Las Vegas home he shares with his five wives. He has been charged with eight felonies in Nevada, including sexual assault, sex trafficking and child abuse.

            Authorities have said the crimes date to the early 2000s and span multiple states, including South Dakota, Montana and Nevada, where Chasing Horse has lived for a decade.











            Prior to his arrest, the 46-year-old had been the focus of a monthslong probe by Las Vegas police prompted by a tip last October from Canadian law enforcement, who had identified Chasing Horse as a suspect in a 2018 rape in the British Columbia village of Keremeos, near the Washington state border.

            Sgt. Kris Clark of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed Tuesday in an email to The Associated Press that Chasing Horse has been charged with one count of sexual assault in connection with the 2018 crime. He said an arrest warrant for Chasing Horse in Canada was issued two days after his arrest in Nevada, but declined to release further details.

            California attorney Alexandra Kazarian, who has been retained by Chasing Horse to replace his public defender, did not immediately respond Tuesday to email and phone requests for comment regarding the new case in Canada.

            Chasing Horse's previous public defender, Michael Wilfong, has not commented on any of the allegations.

            As the number of criminal cases against Chasing Horse grows, his estranged daughter spoke Tuesday in support of the victims.

            In a statement, Quannah Chasinghorse, a model who has appeared on the covers of Vogue Mexico and Vogue Japan, distanced herself from her father, saying she's had minimal contact with him and was raised by her mother and stepfather, who died in 2017.

            “I stand with the victims of Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse,” she said. “I honor the immense courage it takes for survivors to tell their stories, especially publicly.”

            Chasing Horse played the role of Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner’s 1990 Oscar-winning film.

            Since then, he has built a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as as a self-proclaimed “medicine man.”

            Las Vegas police said Chasing Horse abused that position, describing him in their search warrant as the leader of a cult known as The Circle who took underage wives over two decades.

            He also was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, in 2015 following similar allegations.

            Chasing Horse remains held without bail at a jail in downtown Las Vegas. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, when a judge is expected to address his custody status after hearing testimony from investigators, victims and Chasing Horse's relatives.LAS VEGAS (AP) — Canadian police confirmed Tuesday they are pursuing a criminal case against a former “Dances With Wolves” actor who was arrested last week and charged in Nevada with sexually abusing and trafficking Indigenous women and girls.Nathan Chasing Horse, who also goes by Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse, was taken into custody Jan. 31 near the North Las Vegas home he shares with his five wives.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803600,Canada military plane returns after Haiti surveillance,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian Armed Forces surveillance plane was heading home Tuesday after two intelligence-collecting flights over Haiti.

            The CP-140 Aurora’s return came after Prime Minister Justin government announced Saturday that the plane was being deployed to collect intelligence on gang activity in Haiti.

            Defense Minister Anita Anand and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly also described the deployment at the time as a demonstration of Canada’s commitment to Haiti, which has been battered by a series of crises.











            Violent, feuding gangs have taken over the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince since last summer. A United Nations report in October said gangs are sexually assaulting women and children, in addition to curtailing access to health care, electricity and clean water.

            The gangs have reportedly killed and kidnapped hundreds, while filling a power vacuum in a country led by politicians whose terms have expired. No elections have been held since before the COVID-19 pandemic.

            A military spokesman, Capt. Graeme Scott, said Tuesday that the long-range surveillance plane was originally assigned to a U.S.-led counter-narcotics mission in the Caribbean before being tasked with conducting two flights over Haiti over two days.

            “The CP-140 has been capturing information that will be used by the government of Canada to further assess the situation in Haiti,” Scott said in an emailed statement.

            “As the aircraft has now completed that information gathering, as part of Canada’s response to the situation in Haiti, it is now on its way back to Canada.”

            It wasn’t immediately clear how the information will be used, though Haiti’s unelected prime minister, Ariel Henry, has requested a foreign military intervention, which Washington says Canada ought to lead.

            The idea has proven divisive among Haitians. Canada has instead sought a political consensus in Haiti, which includes sanctioning more than a dozen political and economic elites, accusing them of emboldening the gangs.OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — A Canadian Armed Forces surveillance plane was heading home Tuesday after two intelligence-collecting flights over Haiti.The CP-140 Aurora’s return came after Prime Minister Justin government announced Saturday that the plane was being deployed to collect intelligence on gang activity in Haiti.Defense Minister Anita Anand and Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly also described the deployment at the time as a demonstration of Canada’s commitment to Haiti, which has been battered by a series of crises.Violent, feuding gangs have taken over the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince since last summer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803601,"In a first, some CSX railroad workers to get paid sick leave","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Several thousand workers at CSX will soon get one of the things that pushed the U.S. railroad industry to the brink of a strike last fall: paid sick time.

            CSX announced a deal Tuesday with two of its 12 unions, becoming the first major railroad to offer that benefit that most U.S. workers take for granted.

            About 4,000 track-maintenance workers in the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union and another 1,000 mechanical workers in the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen union will get four days of paid sick leave as part of the agreements. The workers will also be able to convert three of their personal leave days into sick-leave days.











            
                Quality-of-life concerns about the lack of paid sick time and demanding schedules that keep many rail workers on call 24-7 dominated contract talks with all the major railroads last fall. More than half of all the roughly 115,000 rail workers involved voted to reject five-year contracts that included 24% raises and $5,000 in bonuses because of those concerns.

            Ultimately, that contract was imposed on all the workers at CSX, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern railroads after Congress and President Joe Biden stepped in to block a strike because of concerns about the potential dire economic consequences.

            Tuesday's deal is especially welcome to rail workers who remained frustrated after the contract was imposed because the new contract didn’t resolve most of their quality-of-life issues. Many workers say their jobs became unbearable after more than one-third of all railroad jobs were eliminated over the last six years as the railroads retooled their operations.

            “It’s a beautiful thing because that’s what we’re fighting for,” said Matt Weaver, a BMWED member based in Toledo, Ohio. “Things are moving in the right direction. We just have to keep the momentum going.”

            CSX CEO Joe Hinrichs said the agreements show that the railroad “is committed to listening to our railroaders and working with their representatives to find solutions that improve their quality of life and experience as employees.” 

            But the head of the union representing engineers said the deal doesn't do enough to help railroad workers, especially for train crews.

            “This agreement is a good start; however engineers are on call every day of the year and four paid sick days per year does not fulfill their needs,"" said Eddie Hall, the newly elected president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. ""Railroaders are essential workers, essential to keeping the supply chain moving, it’s essential that they be provided with adequate sick leave by all of the carriers.” 

            CSX, which is based in Jacksonville, Florida, and the other major freight railroads refused to offer paid sick time last fall because they said the unions had agreed over the decades to forego paid sick leave in favor of strong short-term disability benefits and higher pay. Railroad officials also said it was too late in the yearslong negotiations to work sick time into the deal.

            “This paid sick leave agreement with CSX is certainly welcome but long overdue,"" said Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department labor coalition that includes all the major rail unions. ""We look forward to other rail crafts reaching similar agreements with CSX and other railroads following suit.”

            All the other freight railroads promised to negotiate further with the unions about finding ways to improve their quality of life. Tuesday's announcement is the first significant result of those talks.

            There have been a couple other small encouraging signs of progress this year, with CSX announcing that workers would no longer be penalized for missing work for medical appointments, and Union Pacific launching a small scheduling pilot that's giving a handful of engineers regularly scheduled days off.

            BMWED spokesman Clark Ballew said the union expects the other major freight railroads to reach similar agreements on sick time, “otherwise, they look especially greedy now.” He said this agreement appears to be an effort by CSX to address the simmering concerns of its workers and sinking morale at the railroad.OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803602,The Oscar nominee that says a lot just with its title,"NEW YORK (AP) — Long before a bemused Riz Ahmed read its name on Oscar nominations morning, the title of Pamela Ribon’s short film has tended to have an effect on those who hear it. Like when Ribon went to pick up her festival credential at SXSW in Austin, Texas, shortly before premiering her movie there. 

            Guy at the desk: “What’s it called?”

            Ribon: “My Year of Dicks.” 











            Guy at the desk, not missing a beat: “Hard same.” 

            There is, to be sure, no Oscar nominee this year quite like “My Year of Dicks” — and not just because of a title that, as Ribon notes, “is tough on a spam filter.” 

            The film, written and created by Ribon and directed by Sara Gunnarsdóttir, is one of the more hysterical, painful and sweet portraits of adolescence in all its awkwardness. It's nominated for best animated short film at next month's Academy Awards. Phil Lord (“Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse,” “The Lego Movie”) has called the 26-minute movie “one of the best films of the year of any length.” 

            It’s based on Ribon’s 2014 memoir, “Notes to Boys (and Other Things I Shouldn’t Share in Public)” — particularly a chapter that documents 15-year-old Ribon’s resolution to lose her virginity in 1991 while growing up on the outskirts of Houston. It proceeds as five cringe-inducing chapters of intimate encounters with not-so-great guys, though — as damning as that title is — “My Year of Dicks” is less about judgment for Ribon's far-from-ideal romantic partners than it is about recounting, and illuminating, the bumbling first steps of sex. 

            “It’s cheeky but it isn’t mean,"" Ribon said in a recent interview by Zoom from her home in Los Angeles. ""It really was an inclusive feeling of: ‘We all got through that somehow, didn’t we?’”

            When they were starting out, Gunnarsdóttir, an Icelandic animator who crafted the vivid animations of “Diary of a Teenage Girl, ” wondered if “Notes to Boys” would be a better, less troublesome title. But Ribon sensed something relatable — nay, something universal — about “My Year of Dicks.” 

            “Not everybody has sent a note to a boy but everybody’s had a year of dicks — academically or in business or dating. It has a lot of layers,” Ribon says. “So it has been a way to bring everyone in, unfortunately. Everyone’s like ‘Hard same.’”

            “My Year of Dicks,” which is streaming on Vimeo, has emerged, against the odds, as one of the most talked-about films at this year’s Oscars. Not only will much be riding on whether Ribon and Gunnarsdóttir can win on March 12, but perhaps even more eagerly awaited will be seeing which presenter, at the most dignified of awards shows, gets to utter the film’s name for an audience of millions, on live television. 

            “Do you think they’ll bleep it?” anxiously wonders Ribon. 

            For Ribon, 47, “My Year of Dicks” is an oddly appropriate culmination. Though her best known credits as a screenwriter are for more kid-friendly cartoons (“Moana,” “Ralph Breaks the Internet”), Ribon has, as an essayist, blogger and podcaster, long been an uncommonly open book. Her 2012 essay, “How I Might Have Just Become the Newest Urban Legend,” described a less than, um, sanitary trip to the masseuse parlor while she was many months pregnant. 

            “People were like: ‘It just would never occur to me to share that story with people,’” Ribon says. “And I was like, ‘What would you do?’ They were like, ‘Never tell anyone ever for the rest of life my life what just happened to me.’ I was like, ‘Oh!’”

            “I do sometimes feel like a walking cautionary tale,” says Ribon. 

            Even as a teen, Ribon was deeply aware of the tragicomedy of her coming of age. She didn’t keep a diary but she prodigiously wrote, either by typewriter or by hand, about her life. Holding up a thick green notebook, Ribon flips through the short stories, notes to boys and ticket stubs she accrued through those years. 

            “I liked to have an audience from the beginning when I was processing my thoughts,” says Ribon. “I’m still that way. I much prefer writing an email about my day than keeping it to myself. It feels weird to talk to me.”

            Ribon dumped all of that material and more on Gunnarsdóttir, who, with a small team of indie animators, created a loose kind of rotoscoped version of young Pam intermixed with old footage of her from high school. Each of the five chapters has its own animation design to match, including an anime section and one styled as a vampire tale. For Gunnarsdóttir, the power of animation is take something naturalistic and add expressionism. 

            “So you have this foundation that feels very real but the magic happens when you go away from it and go very abstract,” says Gunnarsdóttir, speaking from France. 

            “That honesty, it comes from her,” Gunnarsdóttir adds. “I think she’s very brave.” 

            Ribon is less convinced. 

            “I don't know if it's brave as much as it's ridiculous,” she says, laughing. 

            Among the film's most cringe-inducing moments is a lewdly frank sex talk from Ribon's father. Ribon has had to insist to her mother it's word-for-word accurate (Ribon's father died years ago). After initially shielding her mom from the film, Ribon's mother has become an ardent supporter — even if she initially couldn't make it all the way through a public reading of “Notes to Boys.” 

            “My Year of Dicks” began as a television project for FX Networks, but the filmmakers ultimately decided to try their luck on the festival circuit. Since the Walt Disney Co. owns FX, “My Year of Dicks” technically counts, ironically enough, as one of Disney's Oscar nods, alongside the likes of “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Turning Red.” 

            As time went on, “My Year of Dicks” began to appear different, and more distant to Ribon. The overturning of Roe v. Wade made such sexual exploration far more perilous for young women. Texas law bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy and makes no exceptions for rape or incest. Ribon's film, increasingly, looked like a time capsule of a bygone era. 

            ""In modern day Texas, this is the most dangerous thing a girl can do with her future. These people should not be responsible for lifelong decisions because of a party,"" says Ribon. “At least I felt free to find out. Now, I would have been too scared to learn about myself. I’m grateful for the mistakes I was able to make. I didn’t have sex in any of those situations but it could have happened. And it could have happened with just one person being more a dick than here. It’s so much scarier to think about.” 

            But Ribon believes animation offers “a tool to talk to someone's unfiltered heart"" — that even in an a very adult animated film, it's possible to connect back to, as she says, “that part where we set out with the best intentions for ourselves.” 

            “We're thrown back into Saturday morning cartoon feelings,” she says. 

            So, yes, “My Year of Dicks” might be the most giggle-inducing Oscar nominee this year. But it also may be the most nakedly heartfelt. 

            “Maybe that’s my job in life, to help people know that you’re not alone and it could be worse. There is something very satisfying about knowing I officially have the worst sex talk of all time. It’s not just something that I say,” Ribon says, pausing to smile. “The academy has spoken.”

            Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAPNEW YORK (AP) — Long before a bemused Riz Ahmed read its name on Oscar nominations morning, the title of Pamela Ribon’s short film has tended to have an effect on those who hear it. Like when Ribon went to pick up her festival credential at SXSW in Austin, Texas, shortly before premiering her movie there.Guy at the desk: “What’s it called?”Ribon: “My Year of Dicks.”Guy at the desk, not missing a beat: “Hard same.”There is, to be sure, no Oscar nominee this year quite like “My Year of Dicks” — and not just because of a title that, as Ribon notes, “is tough on a spam filter.”The film, written and created by Ribon and directed by Sara Gunnarsdóttir, is one of the more hysterical, painful and sweet portraits of adolescence in all its awkwardness. It's nominated for best animated short film at next month's Academy Awards. Phil Lord (“Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse,” “The Lego Movie”) has called the 26-minute movie “one of the best films of the year of any length.”It’s based on Ribon’s 2014 memoir, “Notes to Boys (and Other Things I Shouldn’t Share in Public)” — particularly a chapter that documents 15-year-old Ribon’s resolution to lose her virginity in 1991 while growing up on the outskirts of Houston. It proceeds as five cringe-inducing chapters of intimate encounters with not-so-great guys, though — as damning as that title is — “My Year of Dicks” is less about judgment for Ribon's far-from-ideal romantic partners than it is about recounting, and illuminating, the bumbling first steps of sex.“It’s cheeky but it isn’t mean,"" Ribon said in a recent interview by Zoom from her home in Los Angeles. ""It really was an inclusive feeling of: ‘We all got through that somehow, didn’t we?’”When they were starting out, Gunnarsdóttir, an Icelandic animator who crafted the vivid animations of “Diary of a Teenage Girl, ” wondered if “Notes to Boys” would be a better, less troublesome title. But Ribon sensed something relatable — nay, something universal — about “My Year of Dicks.”“Not everybody has sent a note to a boy but everybody’s had a year of dicks — academically or in business or dating. It has a lot of layers,” Ribon says. “So it has been a way to bring everyone in, unfortunately. Everyone’s like ‘Hard same.’”“My Year of Dicks,” which is streaming on Vimeo, has emerged, against the odds, as one of the most talked-about films at this year’s Oscars. Not only will much be riding on whether Ribon and Gunnarsdóttir can win on March 12, but perhaps even more eagerly awaited will be seeing which presenter, at the most dignified of awards shows, gets to utter the film’s name for an audience of millions, on live television.“Do you think they’ll bleep it?” anxiously wonders Ribon.For Ribon, 47, “My Year of Dicks” is an oddly appropriate culmination. Though her best known credits as a screenwriter are for more kid-friendly cartoons (“Moana,” “Ralph Breaks the Internet”), Ribon has, as an essayist, blogger and podcaster, long been an uncommonly open book. Her 2012 essay, “How I Might Have Just Become the Newest Urban Legend,” described a less than, um, sanitary trip to the masseuse parlor while she was many months pregnant.“People were like: ‘It just would never occur to me to share that story with people,’” Ribon says. “And I was like, ‘What would you do?’ They were like, ‘Never tell anyone ever for the rest of life my life what just happened to me.’ I was like, ‘Oh!’”“I do sometimes feel like a walking cautionary tale,” says Ribon.Even as a teen, Ribon was deeply aware of the tragicomedy of her coming of age. She didn’t keep a diary but she prodigiously wrote, either by typewriter or by hand, about her life. Holding up a thick green notebook, Ribon flips through the short stories, notes to boys and ticket stubs she accrued through those years.“I liked to have an audience from the beginning when I was processing my thoughts,” says Ribon. “I’m still that way. I much prefer writing an email about my day than keeping it to myself. It feels weird to talk to me.”Ribon dumped all of that material and more on Gunnarsdóttir, who, with a small team of indie animators, created a loose kind of rotoscoped version of young Pam intermixed with old footage of her from high school. Each of the five chapters has its own animation design to match, including an anime section and one styled as a vampire tale. For Gunnarsdóttir, the power of animation is take something naturalistic and add expressionism.“So you have this foundation that feels very real but the magic happens when you go away from it and go very abstract,” says Gunnarsdóttir, speaking from France.“That honesty, it comes from her,” Gunnarsdóttir adds. “I think she’s very brave.”Ribon is less convinced.“I don't know if it's brave as much as it's ridiculous,” she says, laughing.Among the film's most cringe-inducing moments is a lewdly frank sex talk from Ribon's father. Ribon has had to insist to her mother it's word-for-word accurate (Ribon's father died years ago). After initially shielding her mom from the film, Ribon's mother has become an ardent supporter — even if she initially couldn't make it all the way through a public reading of “Notes to Boys.”“My Year of Dicks” began as a television project for FX Networks, but the filmmakers ultimately decided to try their luck on the festival circuit. Since the Walt Disney Co. owns FX, “My Year of Dicks” technically counts, ironically enough, as one of Disney's Oscar nods, alongside the likes of “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Turning Red.”As time went on, “My Year of Dicks” began to appear different, and more distant to Ribon. The overturning of Roe v. Wade made such sexual exploration far more perilous for young women. Texas law bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy and makes no exceptions for rape or incest. Ribon's film, increasingly, looked like a time capsule of a bygone era.""In modern day Texas, this is the most dangerous thing a girl can do with her future. These people should not be responsible for lifelong decisions because of a party,"" says Ribon. “At least I felt free to find out. Now, I would have been too scared to learn about myself. I’m grateful for the mistakes I was able to make. I didn’t have sex in any of those situations but it could have happened. And it could have happened with just one person being more a dick than here. It’s so much scarier to think about.”But Ribon believes animation offers “a tool to talk to someone's unfiltered heart"" — that even in an a very adult animated film, it's possible to connect back to, as she says, “that part where we set out with the best intentions for ourselves.”“We're thrown back into Saturday morning cartoon feelings,” she says.So, yes, “My Year of Dicks” might be the most giggle-inducing Oscar nominee this year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803603,AP sources: Derek Carr to visit Saints on Wednesday,"Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr will visit the New Orleans Saints on Wednesday, two people with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday.

            The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly. One person termed the visit as “exploratory in nature.""

            Ian Rapoport of NFL Network was the first to report Carr's trip.











            Saints coach Dennis Allen was the Raiders' coach when the club selected Carr in the second round of the 2014 draft out of Fresno State. Allen coached Carr for only four games before he was fired that year.

            If the Saints and Raiders agree to a deal, they have until Feb. 15 to work out the details. That's when Carr's contract will become guaranteed and he will be owed $40.4 million over the next two years.

            The Raiders could release Carr if no trade agreement is reached, which would make him a free agent. New Orleans or another team could wait to see if that happens and try to lure Carr, who turns 32 on March 28, on the open market.

            Even if a trade agreement is reached before the deadline, a team could renege because no deal can become official until March 15. Carr said last week he would not extend the deadline to facilitate a trade, and sounded content about the possibility of becoming a free agent.

            “I’m just looking for teams that have made that decision consistently that they’ll do whatever it takes to put a winning program out there,” Carr said then. “So for me, that’s just to win, win a championship. That’s at the forefront of the mind. It’s not money.”

            Carr played nine seasons for the Raiders and holds club records for yards passing (35,222) and touchdown passes (217). But he never won a playoff game. And after struggling late in the season, Carr was benched with two games remaining.

            Jameis Winston is under contract with Saints through 2023, but New Orleans is expected to release him. His contract calls for a base salary of $12.8 million next season and he played in just three games in 2022 before losing his job — in part because of a back injury — to Andy Dalton.

            Winston, who was hurt in Week 1, tried to continue playing in Weeks 2 and 3, when he threw five interceptions and was sacked seven times while passing for just two TDs.

            When Winston asserted he was healthy enough to play again and wanted another chance, the Saints stuck with Dalton, who completed 66.7% of his passes for 2,871 yards with 18 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 14 starts.

            Dalton, 35 and a 12-year NFL veteran, is due to be a free agent this offseason.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803621,"Newton has triple-double, No. 21 UConn tops No. 10 Marquette","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — UConn appears to have its mojo back.

            Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points and Tristen Newton recorded his second triple-double of the season as No. 21 Connecticut ran away from No. 10 Marquette 87-72 on Tuesday night.

            Newton had 12 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds for the Huskies (19-6, 8-6 Big East), who won their third straight game after losing six of eight. They started the season 14-0, rising to No. 2 in the AP Top 25. 











            “Teams go through tough stretches during the course of the season,” coach Dan Hurley said. “The bottom line is we're 19-6. You know, we beat some of the best teams in the country.""

            Adama Sanogo added 18 points, while Alex Karaban and Nahiem Alleyne each chipped in with 13 for Connecticut, which never trailed.

            Tyler Kolek had 17 points to lead Marquette (19-6, 11-3), which had its five-game winning streak snapped. Ben Gold and Stevie Mitchell each scored 12.

            The Huskies outrebounded Marquette 48-24 and used 21 offensive boards to help them get 27 second-chance points. The Huskies also had 20 assists on 31 baskets, while holding Marquette to just seven assists.

            UConn opened the game on a 22-6 run, highlighted by a fast-break lob from Newton to Andre Jackson for a dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. The Huskies made their first four 3-point shots, three by Hawkins, who had 14 points in the first half.

            A hook shot by Sanogo gave UConn its first 20-point lead at 32-12 .

            A late first-half run by Marquette cut the margin to 43-29, but Alleyne hit a 3-pointer from almost half court to send UConn into the break with a 17-point cushion.

            Another 3-pointer from Alleyne gave the Huskies a 59-38 lead in the second half.

            UConn led by 25 before Marquette went on an 8-0 run to pull within 17. But the Golden Eagles never threatened to get back in the game. 

            “We won two or three games in January,” Hawkins said. “It was definitely a tough stretch, definitely going to shake your confidence. But you just have to stay the course, trust the process and that's what we did and that's what we're going to continue to do during this last stretch.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Marquette: The Golden Eagles had won nine of 10. They are trying to win a regular-season conference title after being picked ninth in the preseason poll by the league's coaches. 

            UConn: Entered 1-5 against the top five teams in the Big East and 1-3 versus ranked opponents. UConn lost 82-76 at Marquette on Jan. 11 after leading by 11 points in the first half.

            “The rankings mean nothing,” Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. “It's amazing the disparity — no disrespect to anyone here — between what the ranking means to media and fans in the middle of a season and what it means to players and coaches. It just doesn't mean anything.”

            BACK FROM INJURY

            Marquette's Sean Jones, who missed the previous three games with a wrist injury, had 11 points in just over 19 minutes. He came down hard on the wrist in the second half, but appeared to shake it off and continued playing. 

            REPEAT PERFORMANCE

            Newton's first triple-double came in November against Buffalo, when he had 22 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds. He joined Shabazz Napier as the only Huskies players to get more than one. 

            “My amigos right here, they were going crazy hitting shots,” Newton said. “They were boxing out and I was getting the rebound, so I just had the easy job, just get them the ball.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803622,Toll of police brutality on display at State of the Union,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The toll of police brutality in America was on painful display Tuesday night as family members of Black men and women killed in custody joined lawmakers in the Capitol to hear President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.

            Seated near first lady Jill Biden were the mother and father of Tyre Nichols, who died after being savagely beaten by Memphis, Tennessee, police officers last month. 

            “There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child,” Biden said after introducing RowVaughn and Rodney Wells to a standing ovation. “But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.”











            The president described the difficult conversation Black parents have to have with their kids about police at a young age. 

            “Most of us here have never had to have ‘the talk,'” Biden said. “Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.”

            Mothers, fathers and loved ones of victims of police violence were invited as guests of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first lady to put pressure on Washington to address the issue of policing. 

            “It may have been Tyre Nichols yesterday, but it could be any one of us today and tomorrow,” Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., the chairman of the Black Caucus, said of the most recent victim during a news conference Tuesday morning. 

            A video released earlier this month showed the violent Jan. 7 encounter between Nichols and the Memphis, Tennessee, police officers who beat the 29-year-old Black FedEx worker for three minutes while screaming profanities at him. Nichols was hospitalized and died days later. Five police officers, who also are Black, have been fired and charged with second-degree murder and two more have been disciplined. 

            Days after the release of the video, Horsford reached out to Nichols' parents, RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, to invite them to the State of the Union address. The Nevada Democrat said it was important that the couple witnessed the president's speech as he laid out the important issues facing Americans. 

            “Being in the room for the State of the Union is an experience that I hope will give Tyre Nichols’ parents some comfort and, most of all, hope,"" Horsford said. “They deserve to hear a commitment to real action on ending this national scourge of unnecessary deaths at the hands of law enforcement.” 

            Also in attendance, Tuesday night were the mother of Eric Garner and the brother of George Floyd, among others. 

            The visible reminder of police brutality comes against the backdrop of reignited negotiations among lawmakers to draft a modest proposal for police reform that could pass in a newly GOP-controlled House. 

            The talks last Congress focused on writing compromise legislation curbing law enforcement agencies’ use of force and making them more accountable for abuses. But negotiations stalled over Democrats’ demands to make individual police officers accused of abuses liable for civil penalties.

            Black Caucus members went to the White House last week for a three-hour meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and left with an agreement on the path forward both legislatively and through executive action. 

            On Tuesday night, Biden called for Congress to continue that work by passing legislation that gives law enforcement more resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime and invest in more community intervention programs.

            “Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true: Something good must come from this,” Biden said in his speech. “All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.”

            Meanwhile, advocates have been urging the White House to be more clear about what has historically held up progress on police reform, even when Democrats controlled Congress. 

            Horsford and Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., the two men leading negotiations in each chamber, said that this time around, Democrats cannot go forward on their own, but will need buy-in from Republicans and law enforcement groups to pass lasting, meaningful reform.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., the two men leading negotiations in each chamber, said that this time around, Democrats cannot go forward on their own, but will need buy-in from Republicans and law enforcement groups to pass lasting, meaningful reform.___AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.",2023/2/8,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803624,South Carolina's Staley defends team after Auriemma comments,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina coach Dawn Staley strongly defended her top-ranked Gamecocks on Tuesday following critical comments by UConn coach Geno Auriemma two days earlier. 

            Auriemma said after the top-ranked Gamecocks' 81-77 victory that Huskies guard/forward Lou Lopez Senechal had bruises on her body from the game.

            “It's just appalling what teams do to her now,” he said. “It's not basketball anymore. I don't know what it is, but it's not basketball.”











            Staley fired back Tuesday on her radio call-in show, saying when her team has success, “we're called something other than players that are locked in.”

            “They play the right way,” she continued, “and approach it the right way whether they win or lose. We don't denounce anybody's play. They are always uplifting the game of women's basketball and when we were getting our heads beat in by UConn for all those years, I said nothing.” 

            South Carolina's victory Sunday was its fourth in the past five meetings between the schools, including the national championship game last April.

            Staley's South Carolina teams had been 0-7 against UConn before their recent run of success.

            “We've been called so many things and I'm sick of it,” Staley said. “I'm sick of it because I coach some of the best human beings the game has ever had.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803625,Jackson-Davis leads No. 18 Indiana past No. 24 Rutgers 66-60,"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) — The milestone moments keep piling up for Trayce Jackson-Davis.

            Only one really mattered Tuesday night.

            While he scored 20 points to become the sixth player in Hoosiers' history with 2,000 and the first among that group with 1,000 career rebounds, the most satisfying celebration came after No. 18 Indiana beat No. 24 Rutgers 66-60 — Jackson-Davis' first win in the series.











            “I think that’s the last team in the Big Ten I hadn't beaten,” Jackson-Davis said after finishing with 18 rebounds and six assists.

            From the moment Jackson-Davis announced he would attend Indiana, the expectations were great even as critics contended the results were underwhelming.

            Nobody's complaining now. Jackson-Davis now has 2,004 points, 1,035 rebounds, a school-record 242 blocks and ranks fourth all-time with 44 double-doubles after breaking a tie with Steve Downing.

            After helping the Hoosiers snap a five-year NCAA Tournament drought last season and falling out of the rankings after three straight January losses, Jackson-Davis has almost single-handedly led the Hoosiers (17-7, 8-5 Big Ten) into a second-place tie by winning seven of eight.

            And his dominance is starting to open things up for his teammate. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

            “I think we’ve gotten a lot better playing around Trayce, giving him space,"" Miller Kopp said after scoring 18 points. “It comes down to getting better at what the coaches are asking us to do and we're all feeling more comfortable with where our looks are coming from.”

            It certainly showed against the Scarlet Knights (16-8, 8-5), who had won six straight over Indiana including a 15-point blowout in December.

            This time, though, they spent most of the game playing catchup. Clifford Omoruyi had 15 points, Cam Spencer had 14 and nobody else made more than three baskets.

            “It’s a one-possession game with three minutes left, but I look at the (free throw) disparity and you can’t defend the foul line,” coach Steve Pikiell said. “Give Indiana credit, they got there. Tracye Jackson-Davis was a problem.”

            The Hoosiers started fast and then scored 12 straight points to take a 30-14 lead midway through the first half but even without injured starting forward Mawot Mag, Rutgers charged back. It closed the first half on an 11-2 run, then tied it at 38 when Spencer opened the second half with a 3-pointer.

            Kopp broke the tie with his third 3 of the game to start an 11-0 run and Jackson-Davis' monumental basket, a putback dunk off his own miss, made it 54-44 with 11:13 to go.

            The Scarlet Knights could have tied it on Caleb McConnell's 3 with 3:02 left, but it bounced off the back of the rim and the Hoosiers closed Jackson-Davis' big win with a 7-2 spurt.

            “He’s a man who’s done a lot since he’s been here,” said coach Mike Woodson, who is 57 points ahead of Jackson-Davis on the Hoosiers' scoring list. “He's a phenomenal player who does a lot of beautiful things on the court. To get 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds says a lot.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Rutgers: Mag missed his first game with a torn ACL in his right knee and Rutgers struggled against Indiana's size and speed. There could be similar challenges over the final eight regular-season games.

            Indiana: Woodson's team is playing, at times, like the conference's preseason pick to win the league title. When the Hoosiers make perimeter shots and defend well, they're a difficult matchup for anyone. They just need fewer lulls.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            The victory should help solidify Indiana's top-20 status — at least until it hits the road for their next two games. Losing Mag and Tuesday's game may make Rutgers' return to the rankings short-lived regardless of what happens later this week.

The Changhwa County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center carried out the inspection and initiated actions to stop the spread of the disease.According to the center, the farm first reported abnormal deaths on Feb. 2. This led to the dispatch of animal disease personnel to take samples for the examination, which were later sent to the Council of Agriculture’s Animal Health Research Institute.On Feb 5, the institute confirmed the hens were infected with a highly contagious new subtype of H5N1. This led to the deployment of anti-epidemic personnel to carry out culling, cleaning, and disinfection of the poultry farm.Authorities further call upon poultry farms and production and sales companies to pay attention to temperature control measures at poultry farms as well as undertake other preventative measures.

As reported earlier, there have already been 14 avian flu outbreaks at other farms so far this year. This increases the need for implementing staff control and access measures for vehicles to prevent the potential of cross-contamination.",2023/2/8,1134,Food Safety & Health

(AP) — Tyree Appleby scored a season-high 35 points, 23 coming at the free-throw line, and Wake Forest built a big lead early then held on for a 92-85 victory over North Carolina on Tuesday night.

            Appleby was just two points short of his career high while tying his best of 11 assists and sharing the team lead with seven rebounds. Though only 6 of 20 from the floor, he made a career-best 23 of 28 free throws including 13 straight in the final two minutes when the Tar Heels got as close as seven after trailing by 26 early in the second half.

            Damari Monsanto had three 3-pointers and 16 points with seven rebounds and Matthew Marsh came off the bench to score 10 points for the Demon Deacons (16-9, 8-6 ACC), who won their second straight after losing four in a row.











            Caleb Love made all four of North Carolina's 3-pointers, including three in the final minute, and finished with 24 points for the Tar Heels (15-9, 7-6), who have lost three straight. Armando Bacot, who played only eight minutes of the second half before fouling out, had 17 points and 11 rebounds. RJ Davis added 16 points and Pete Nance had 11 points and 10 rebounds. 

            When these teams met on Jan. 4, an 88-79 win for North Carolina, there were 20 lead changes. Tuesday night, there was a lone lead change two minutes into the game as Wake Forest quickly took control and led 47-25 at halftime.

            The Tar Heels trailed by 10 with 3 1/2 minutes left in the game not long after Bacot fouled out. They got as close as seven in the final minute thanks to Love but no closer because of Appleby. 

            Still, it took two from the line by Daivien Williamson with 12 seconds left for a 10-point lead that finally ensured the win before Love hit his final 3-pointer.

            In their Jan. 4 game, North Carolina scored 32 points off 15 turnovers. Tuesday, the Deacons committed just five. They finished 33 of 42 at the line to 21 of 26 for the Heels.

            North Carolina is home against Clemson and Wake Forest is host to Georgia Tech, both games on Saturday.

            Taiwan Chief Trade Representative John Deng (鄧振中) and Canada Trade Minister Mary Ng held a virtual conference on Tuesday, affirming the results of bilateral exploratory discussions launched last year and formally announcing the beginning of FIPA talks.

            Such an agreement will help Taiwan and Canada deepen their partnership, MOFA said. The ministry vowed to continue cooperating with the Cabinet’s Office of Trade Negotiation and other relevant ministries to finalize Taiwan-Canada FIPA talks as soon as possible “to promote bilateral investment and trade, build a more resilient post-pandemic supply chain, support the rules-based global economic and trade order, and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region.”

            In November, Canada revealed its Indo-Pacific Strategy and said it will promote multi-faceted exchanges in Taiwan-Canada relations and enhance bilateral economic and trade links, MOFA said.











            The two nations began exploratory discussions last year after Ng held a meeting with Deng in January, 2022. Ng highlighted Taiwan as a key trade and investment partner as Canada seeks to increase its trade and economic ties in the Indo-Pacific region, according to a Canadian government statement.

            The ministers agreed Canada and Taiwan must work together to further strengthen supply chain resilience, promote mutually beneficial commercial opportunities, and bolster cooperation in science, technology and innovation, education, Indigenous affairs, and the green economy, per the statement.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803687,Bo Horvat scores as New York Islanders beat Seattle Kraken,"NEW YORK (AP) — Bo Horvat scored in his home debut with New York Islanders, leading his new team to a 4-0 victory over the Seattle Kraken on Tuesday night.

            Ilya Sorokin made 31 saves in his fifth shutout this season and No. 15 for his career. Samuel Bolduc, Simon Holmstrom and Zach Parise also scored in New York's fourth straight win, and Jean-Gabriel Pageau added two assists.

            “There is a lot of belief in this group, a lot of energy and you are seeing now a little bit of momentum,” Islanders captain Anders Lee said. “It’s a tough game (for Seattle) coming out of the break, so we were able to take advantage of that.”











            The Islanders acquired Horvat in a blockbuster trade with Vancouver on Jan. 30. The All-Star center then agreed to a $68 million, eight-year contract on Sunday.

            The 27-year-old Horvat skated in his first game with New York on Monday night, helping the Islanders to a 2-1 victory at Philadelphia.

            He got his first goal with his new team 5:08 into the second period. Mathew Barzal stole the puck from Yanni Gourde in the offensive zone and set up Horvat for a one-timer.

            Horvat's career-best 32nd goal of the season gave New York a 4-0 lead.

            “I’m not going to lie, it definitely felt good,” Horvat said. “I got to take a little bit of a deep breath. It felt even better to score it at home, then on top of that get the win, made it that much sweeter.”

            Martin Jones had 23 saves for the Pacific Division-leading Kraken, but Seattle dropped the opener of a five-game trip to begin the second half of the season. 

            “Too many mistakes that ended up in direct opportunities against,” Kraken coach Dave Hakstol said. “We could not find a way to give ourselves energy. One goal might have been able to change a little bit of momentum.”

            Kraken forward Andre Burakovsky left after his first shift with a lower-body injury.

            Bolduc opened the scoring at 7:59 of the first period when his shot from the point found the back of the net. Lee and Kyle Palmieri screened Jones on Bolduc's first career goal.

            “It’s pretty nice, especially at home when you get the fans behind you,” Bolduc said. “It’s an amazing feeling.”

            Holmstrom made it 2-0 with a nifty forehand-backhand combination at 18:29. Pageau found the Swedish winger all alone in the slot from behind the net. 

            Parise masterfully redirected Pageau’s shot past Jones to give New York a three-goal advantage 3:38 into the second.

            New York improved to 22-5-2 when scoring at least three times, including shootout winners.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803688,Letang's OT winner caps rally as Penguins stun Avalanche 2-1,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Penguins talked about hitting reset following a wildly uneven first half of the season.

            Perhaps no player wanted a fresh start more than Kris Letang.

            The veteran defenseman's nightmarish last two months included the death of his father, a stroke due to a rare heart condition and a separate lower-body injury that forced him to miss several weeks.











            Letang finally appears to be at full speed now. His wrist shot from the left circle 3:36 into overtime capped a frantic rally as the Penguins stunned the Colorado Avalanche 2-1 on Tuesday night.

            “Tanger’s had a tough first half in so many different ways, so when he scores big goals like that, I know it makes him feel good, it makes our whole team feel good,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.

            The Avalanche controlled long stretches of regulation before Bryan Rust tied it with 3:38 remaining in the third period. The Penguins killed a penalty in overtime before Letang won it with a shot from the left circle, his second game-winning goal in the extra period since returning to the team on Jan. 24.

            “It’s a game after the break, it's never pretty usually,” Letang said. ""They came hard at us. Obviously they’re the Stanley Cup champions for a reason. I thought we didn’t go off page. I thought we stayed in our system.”

            Having Casey DeSmith sharp, particularly early, helped. DeSmith made 41 saves while making a fourth straight start in place of injured Tristan Jarry. 

            “Just grabbing two points when it looked like it could be zero, that’s a huge momentum builder for us,” DeSmith said.

            Letang nearly won it earlier in the extra period when he jammed a portion of the puck over the goal line. Colorado goaltender Pavel Francouz managed to push it back out of harm’s way before it made it all the way over.

            Francouz couldn't do the same minutes later when Letang flicked one from in tight that became his fifth goal of the season. 

            Nathan MacKinnon scored his 14th goal of the season for the Avalanche. Francouz stopped 36 shots but couldn't get a handle on Letang's laser that handed Colorado just its second loss in its last nine games.

            “I liked our game tonight,” Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. “I thought we checked hard. We were dangerous on the offensive side of it. I thought their goalie had a really good night, and we didn’t shoot the puck well.”

            Colorado hardly looked rusty while playing their first game since Jan. 28. The same couldn't be said for the Penguins, who were dominated for long stretches by the younger, faster Avalanche despite coming off the same 10-day layoff.

            Colorado recorded the game's first eight shots and 13 of the first 15 as the Penguins got off to another slow start, symptomatic of a sluggish four months that sent Pittsburgh into the All-Star break clinging to the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.

            DeSmith held the Avalanche at bay before MacKinnon finally broke through 10:21 into the second period. Colorado couldn't extend the lead despite numerous opportunities, and the Penguins finally awoke in the third period.

            Rust ultimately drew Pittsburgh even at the end of a sequence in which Francouz's ill-advised poke check led to a scramble that ended with Evgeni Malkin feeding the puck from behind the Colorado net to Rust just outside the crease. The puck smacked off Rust's skate, hit Francouz then trickled into the net to force overtime.

            NOTES: Colorado star D Cale Makar left briefly in the third period after taking a right shoulder to the head by Pittsburgh's Jeff Carter. No penalty was called on the play. ... Letang's 32 points in overtime are the most by a defenseman in NHL history.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4803690,"Brunson scores 25, late basket lifts Knicks over Magic","ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Jalen Brunson scored 25 points and made the go-ahead basket with 1:13 left, Julius Randle had 22 points and 14 rebounds and the New York Knicks beat the Orlando Magic 102-98 Tuesday night.

            Brunson’s running bank shot put the Knicks up for good at 94-93 in a game they played almost entirely from behind. He then fed Jericho Sims for a dunk and a three-point lead with 40 seconds left.

            “We keep putting ourselves in this position of coming back from deficits,” said Brunson, who had 10 points and two assists in the fourth quarter. “On the flip side of that we kept fighting, but we've got to start games better.”











            The teams combined to shoot 10 free throws in the final 7.7 seconds. The only miss was by Orlando's Paolo Banchero, who intentionally tried to set up a tying basket with 2.3 seconds remaining.

            Markelle Fultz led the Magic with 21 points. Franz Wagner added 18 points and Banchero finished with 16 points after being held to four in the first half.

            “Every possession matters and I think we got good experience of that tonight,” Fultz said. “We came up short but I'm happy with the way we fought. A couple of things cost us down he stretch.”

            According to Magic coach Jamahl Mosley, those things were “shooting 6 for 25 (3-pointers), missing a couple of free throws, and giving up 11 offensive rebounds.”

            Immanuel Quickley came off the New York bench with 18 points.

            Wagner made his first five shots, two of them on a 10-0 run that gave Orlando a 12-point lead midway through the second quarter, the largest lead for either team.

            “We started off in a hole and we fought out of the hole,"" Knicks coach Tom Thibodeaux said. “I thought in the second half we were a lot better, and I thought in the fourth quarter we were very good.”

            Back-to-back 3-pointers by Randle erased most of that lead, but the Knicks went scoreless for the final 2:20 of the first half and fell behind 48-40.

            Two baskets by Quickley helped New York close the third quarter on a 7-0 run, and when Randle and Quickly opened the fourth quarter with 3s, the Knicks had their first lead since 2-0. They scored 36 in the fourth quarter, shooting 12 for 19 (63.2%).

            “I thought Julius and Jalen set the tone in the fourth quarter. Just the way we closed - big rebounds, physicality, hustle plays,” Thibodeaux said.

            “That’s what it came down to in the end,” Randle said. “We made our free throws, got rebounds and didn’t turn the ball over.”

             “Our job is to show up and play basketball and let the front office deal with those situations,” Brunson said. “But I love my teammates. The relationships I’ve made in the last couple of months have been special, and that’s all I can say.”

            Said Thibodeaux: “I love our team. We know we have a and we have a lot of young players that are going to get better as time goes on. I’ve been around a long time and for every 100 trades they talk about, one gets done. So it’s just noise.”
