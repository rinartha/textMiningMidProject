https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816711,Supreme Court wrestles with lawsuit shield for social media,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In its first case about the federal law that is credited with helping create the modern internet, the Supreme Court seemed unlikely Tuesday to side with a family wanting to hold Google liable for the death of their daughter in a terrorist attack.

            At the same time, the justices also signaled in arguments lasting two and a half hours that they are wary of Google's claims that a 1996 law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, affords it, Twitter, Facebook and other companies far-reaching immunity from lawsuits over their targeted recommendations of videos, documents and other content. 

            The case highlighted the tension between technology policy fashioned a generation ago and the reach of today's social media, numbering billions of posts each day. 











            “We really don’t know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet,” Justice Elena Kagan said of herself and her colleagues, several of whom smiled at the description.

            Congress, not the court, should make needed changes to a law passed early in the internet age, Kagan said.

            Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of six conservatives, agreed with his liberal colleague in a case that seemed to cut across ideological lines. 

            “Isn’t it better,” Kavanaugh asked, to keep things the way they are and “put the burden on Congress to change that?”

            The case before the court stems from the death of American college student Nohemi Gonzalez in a terrorist attack in Paris in 2015. Members of her family were in the courtroom to listen to arguments about whether they can sue Google-owned YouTube for helping the Islamic State spread its message and attract new recruits, in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Lower courts sided with Google.

            The justices used a variety of examples to probe what YouTube does when it uses computer algorithms to recommend videos to viewers, whether content produced by terrorists or cat lovers. Chief Justice John Roberts suggested what YouTube is doing isn't “pitching something in particular to the person who's made the request” but just a “21st century version” of what has been taking place for a long time, putting together a group of things the person may want to look at. 

            Justice Clarence Thomas asked whether YouTube uses the same algorithm to recommend rice pilaf recipes and terrorist content. Yes, he was told.

            Kagan noted that “every time anybody looks at anything on the internet, there is an algorithm involved,” whether it’s a Google search, YouTube or Twitter. She asked the Gonzalez family’s lawyer, Eric Schnapper, whether agreeing with him would ultimately make Section 230 meaningless.

            Lower courts have broadly interpreted Section 230 to protect the industry, which the companies and their allies say has fueled the meteoric growth of the internet by protecting businesses from lawsuits over posts by users and encouraging the removal of harmful content. 

            But critics argue that the companies have not done nearly enough to police and moderate content and that the law should not block lawsuits over the recommendations that point viewers to more material that interests them and keeps them online longer.

            Any narrowing of their immunity could have dramatic consequences that could affect every corner of the internet because websites use algorithms to sort and filter a mountain of data.

            Lisa Blatt, representing Google, told the court that recommendations are just a way of organizing all that information. YouTube users watch a billion hours of videos daily and upload 500 hours of videos every minute, Blatt said. 

            Roberts, though, was among several justices who questioned Blatt about whether YouTube should have the same legal protection for its recommendations as for hosting videos.

            “They appear pursuant to the algorithms that your clients have. And those algorithms must be targeted to something. And that targeting, I think, is fairly called a recommendation, and that is Google’s. That’s not the provider of the underlying information,” Roberts said. 

            Reflecting the complexity of the issue and the court's seeming caution, Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested another factor in recommendations made by YouTube and others, noting that ”most algorithms are designed these days to maximize profits."" 

            Gorsuch suggested the court could send the case back to a lower court without weighing in on the extent of Google's legal protections. He participated in arguments by phone because he was “a little under the weather,"" Roberts said.

            Several other justices indicated that arguments in a related case Wednesday might provide an avenue for avoiding the difficult questions raised Tuesday.

            The court will hear about another terrorist attack, at a nightclub in Istanbul in 2017 that killed 39 people and prompted a lawsuit against Twitter, Facebook and Google. 

            Separate challenges to social media laws enacted by Republicans in Florida and Texas are pending before the high court, but they would not be argued before the fall or decided until the first half of 2024.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816712,"Biden in Poland: US, allies 'will never waver' in Ukraine","WARSAW, Poland (AP) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned of “hard and bitter days ahead"" as Russia's invasion of Ukraine nears the one-year mark, but vowed that no matter what, the United States and allies “will not waver” in supporting the Ukrainians.

            A day after his surprise visit to Kyiv, Biden used a strongly worded address in neighboring Poland to praise allies in Europe for stepping up over the past year and to send a clear message to Russian President Vladimir Putin that ""NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.”

            “One year ago, the world was bracing for the fall of Kyiv,” Biden said before a crowd of thousands outside Warsaw’s Royal Castle. “I can report: Kyiv stands strong. Kyiv stands proud. It stands tall and, most important, it stands free.""











            With Russia and Ukraine each preparing spring offensives, Biden insisted there will be no backing down from what he’s portrayed as a global struggle between democracy and autocracy — though polling suggests American support for ongoing military assistance appears to be softening. 

            “Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow and forever,"" Biden declared. The U.S. and allies will “have Ukraine's back.”

            Biden's speech came a day after his unannounced trip to Kyiv, where he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and walked the city streets as an air raid siren blared. 

            Last year, weeks after Russian forces began their attacks on Ukraine, Biden delivered a harsh condemnation of Putin from the gardens of the castle. Speaking Tuesday to a crowd that included Polish citizens and Ukrainian refugees — and millions more following in Ukraine, Russia and around the world — he made his case that Putin's war has been a failure.

            “When President Putin ordered his tanks to roll into Ukraine, he thought we would roll over. He was wrong,” Biden said.

            The president also declared “the democracies of the world have grown stronger"" while the world's autocrats — including Putin — have become weaker.

            “Autocrats only understand one word — no, no, no,” Biden said. “No, you will not take my country. No, you will not take my freedom. No, you will not take my future.”

            Biden was using the trip to prepare allies for an ever-more-complicated stage of the war and to reassure allies in the region that the U.S. was committed for the long haul. He met Tuesday with Moldovan President Maia Sandu — who last week claimed Moscow was behind a plot to overthrow her country’s government using external saboteurs — and with his host Polish President Andrzej Duda.

            “We have to have security in Europe,” Biden said at the presidential palace. “It's that basic, that simple, that consequential.”

            He described NATO as “maybe the most consequential alliance in history,"" and he said it's “stronger than it's ever been” despite the Russian leader's hopes that it would fracture over the war in Ukraine. 

            Duda praised the American president’s visit to Kyiv as “spectacular,” saying it “boosted morale of Ukraine’s defenders.”

            He said the trip was “a sign that the free world, and its biggest leader, the president of the United States, stands by them.”

            On Wednesday, Biden will meet again with Duda along with other leaders of the Bucharest Nine, the easternmost members of the NATO military alliance. Ukraine is not a member.

            While Biden was in Poland, Putin announced that Moscow would suspend its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the United States.

            The New START Treaty caps the number of long-range nuclear warheads countries may deploy and limits the use of missiles that can carry atomic weapons.

            Despite his criticisms of Putin, Biden did not mention the START suspension during his speech. And the Russian Foreign Ministry later said that, despite Putin's announcement, it would continue abiding by the treaty's caps. 

            The conflict in Ukraine — the most significant war in Europe since World War II — has already left tens of thousands of people dead, devastated Ukraine’s infrastructure system and damaged the global economy.

            While Biden is looking to use his whirlwind trip to Europe as a moment of affirmation for Ukraine and allies, the White House has also acknowledged that there is no clear endgame to the war in the near term, and the situation on the ground has become increasingly complex.

            The administration on Sunday said it has new intelligence suggesting that China, which has generally remained on the sidelines of the conflict, is now considering sending Moscow lethal aid. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it could become a “serious problem” if Beijing follows through.

            Biden and Zelenskyy discussed capabilities that Ukraine needs “to be able to succeed on the battlefield” in the months ahead, said U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. and European allies to provide fighter jets and long-range missile systems known as ATACMS — which Biden has declined to provide so far. Sullivan declined to comment on whether there was any movement on that during the leaders' talk.

            With no quick end in sight for the war, the anniversary is a critical moment for Biden to try to bolster European unity and reiterate the West's position that Putin's invasion was a frontal attack on the post-World War II international order. The White House hopes the president's visit to Kyiv and Warsaw will help bolster American and global resolve. 

            In the U.S., a poll published last week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that support for providing Ukraine with weapons and direct economic assistance is softening. And earlier this month, 11 House Republicans introduced what they called the “Ukraine fatigue” resolution urging Biden to end military and financial aid to Ukraine, while pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to a peace agreement. 

            Biden dismissed the notion of waning American support during his visit to Kyiv.

            “For all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues, there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine,” he said. He described the conflict as ""about freedom of democracy at large.”

            Biden had high praise for Poland's efforts to assist Ukraine. More than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees have settled in Poland since the start of the war, and millions more have crossed through Poland on their way to other countries. Poland has also provided Ukraine with $3.8 billion in military and humanitarian aid, according to the White House.

            The Biden administration announced last summer that it was establishing a permanent U.S. garrison in Poland, creating an enduring American foothold on NATO's eastern flank.

            “The truth of the matter is the United States needs Poland and NATO as much as NATO needs the United States,” Biden told Duda on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816713,UNLV freshman football player Ryan Keeler dies,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — UNLV defensive lineman Ryan Keeler died Monday at 20, the university announced.

            No cause of death was given.

            “We are devastated to have lost a member of our Rebel family,” UNLV coach Barry Odom said in a statement. “While I had the honor of knowing Ryan for only a couple of months, he already stood out to our coaching staff as an incredible person, student and teammate. Our condolences and prayers go out to Ryan’s family as we grieve along with them over this tremendous loss.” 











            Keeler, who is from Chicago, transferred to UNLV from Rutgers last year. He played in seven games as a redshirt freshman this past season, and he made eight tackles and a sack.

            Keeler, who made the academic All-Mountain West team, had a 3.80 GPA.

            “Words are hard to come by this evening as we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of UNLV student-athlete Ryan Keeler,” UNLV President Keith Whitfield said in a statement. “My sincere condolences are with Ryan’s family, friends, loved ones, and teammates during this very difficult time.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816714,Kari Lake looks to harness her movement after Arizona loss,"PHOENIX (AP) — Brett Foto and his fiancee were vacationing in Phoenix last fall when they heard about a rally nearby for Kari Lake, then running for governor of Arizona.

            No matter that they don't live or vote in Arizona. Lake was going places, an emerging star on the populist right, and they had to see her. 

            “We’re seeing something very interesting tonight,” said Foto, a 52-year-old sales representative who lives outside Denver. ""We’re going to look back and say, ‘We saw her when we went to this little hangar in Phoenix.’”











            Lake went on to lose that race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, a setback that would typically thwart political ambitions. But among conservatives, defeat has done little to erode Lake's standing. If anything, her refusal to acknowledge her loss only enhances her stature well beyond Arizona.

            In the months since the election, Lake has popped up at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate and a palatial California hotel, where she unsuccessfully lobbied members of the Republican National Committee to defeat Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. A more recent swing through Iowa sparked speculation about whether she may run for president or angle for a role as Trump's running mate if he clinches the GOP nomination again. 

            Wherever she is, she's doubling down on the formula that enthralled the Republican base but was rejected by a broader electorate: unflinching fealty to Trump, a relentless focus on unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, and tough talk about securing the U.S.-Mexico border with force. 

            Lake will have another chance to showcase her bond with the GOP base next month with a prominent speaking role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Washington.

            “She speaks MAGA,” Chuck Coughlin, a longtime political consultant in Arizona who was one of former Gov. Jan Brewer's top advisers, said, referring to Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan. “She’s better than Trump in many respects. She’s a cultural warrior. She expresses their angst and anxiety over the way the country’s going.”

            Meanwhile, Lake is continuing to fight her loss in the Arizona appellate courts, which rejected her election challenge Thursday. She vowed to take her lawsuit to the state Supreme Court. She held a campaign-style rally this month to draw attention to her case. 

            “Kari Lake is the total package. She’s articulate. She’s confident. She’s beautiful, but not in a threatening way,” said Linda Greulich, a 70-year-old retiree in Phoenix. “And I think if she wants to stay in politics, I see her going all the way to the top.”

            The flurry of activity comes as Lake considers running for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent and former Democrat. She met recently with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials in Washington.

            Republicans outnumber Democrats in Arizona, yet they've struggled to win during the Trump era. The GOP lost three straight Senate races in Arizona as ticket-splitting voters who mostly support Republicans refused to vote for candidates closely aligned with Trump. 

            Eleven percent of voters identifying as Republicans voted for Hobbs last year, compared with just 4% of Democrats who voted for Lake, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 3,200 voters in Arizona. 

            Sinema has not said whether she'll run for a second term, a decision that could have a monumental impact on the battle for control of the Senate. Democrats worry a three-way race between Sinema, a Democrat and a Republican will scramble the formula that's worked so well for them, creating an opening for a candidate like Lake. 

            Other Republicans looking at running include Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb. Also considering a bid are Jim Lamon, Blake Masters and Karrin Taylor Robson, candidates in 2022 for either the Senate or governor.

            Lake is pushing back against those in the GOP trying to move past claims of election fraud that have proved toxic in swing states, including Arizona, where Lake and three other Trump-backed Republicans lost their races. She told Iowans, who are proud of their role in vetting presidential hopefuls, to press candidates about “where they stand on stolen elections.""

            “We need to make sure all of these candidates think that election integrity is a No. 1 issue,” she said. 

            Lake was a news anchor for nearly 30 years in the Phoenix market. She left the Fox affiliate in 2021, saying journalism had strayed into advocacy. She began her campaign for governor a short time later, channeling Trump with frequent attacks on the news media she left behind.

            She records every interaction with reporters, often posting contentious exchanges on social media and earning plaudits from her fans, and she still attracted unprecedented attention from global media.

            Money has continued to pour in for Lake since her loss. Her campaign raised $2.6 million from Election Day through the end of the year, with the biggest haul coming on the day the race was called for Hobbs. 

            She's raised more money through a nonprofit group her advisers created in December, which doesn't have to disclose details about its donations and has become her main fundraising vehicle. 

            Foto, who saw Lake on his Arizona vacation, was not deterred by her loss to Hobbs and hopes she'll take another stab at running for office. 

            “I pray for that to happen and I pray for that for this country,” Foto said by phone. “I think we need people like her to make sure of a strong future for all of us.”PHOENIX (AP) — Brett Foto and his fiancee were vacationing in Phoenix last fall when they heard about a rally nearby for Kari Lake, then running for governor of Arizona.No matter that they don't live or vote in Arizona. Lake was going places, an emerging star on the populist right, and they had to see her.“We’re seeing something very interesting tonight,” said Foto, a 52-year-old sales representative who lives outside Denver. ""We’re going to look back and say, ‘We saw her when we went to this little hangar in Phoenix.’”Lake went on to lose that race to Democrat Katie Hobbs, a setback that would typically thwart political ambitions. But among conservatives, defeat has done little to erode Lake's standing. If anything, her refusal to acknowledge her loss only enhances her stature well beyond Arizona.In the months since the election, Lake has popped up at former President Donald Trump's Florida estate and a palatial California hotel, where she unsuccessfully lobbied members of the Republican National Committee to defeat Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. A more recent swing through Iowa sparked speculation about whether she may run for president or angle for a role as Trump's running mate if he clinches the GOP nomination again.Wherever she is, she's doubling down on the formula that enthralled the Republican base but was rejected by a broader electorate: unflinching fealty to Trump, a relentless focus on unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, and tough talk about securing the U.S.-Mexico border with force.Lake will have another chance to showcase her bond with the GOP base next month with a prominent speaking role at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in Washington.“She speaks MAGA,” Chuck Coughlin, a longtime political consultant in Arizona who was one of former Gov. Jan Brewer's top advisers, said, referring to Trump's “Make America Great Again” slogan. “She’s better than Trump in many respects. She’s a cultural warrior. She expresses their angst and anxiety over the way the country’s going.”Meanwhile, Lake is continuing to fight her loss in the Arizona appellate courts, which rejected her election challenge Thursday. She vowed to take her lawsuit to the state Supreme Court. She held a campaign-style rally this month to draw attention to her case.“Kari Lake is the total package. She’s articulate. She’s confident. She’s beautiful, but not in a threatening way,” said Linda Greulich, a 70-year-old retiree in Phoenix. “And I think if she wants to stay in politics, I see her going all the way to the top.”The flurry of activity comes as Lake considers running for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Kyrsten Sinema, an independent and former Democrat. She met recently with National Republican Senatorial Committee officials in Washington.Republicans outnumber Democrats in Arizona, yet they've struggled to win during the Trump era.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816722,Northern Taiwan expects cold weather throughout the week,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A continental cold air mass continues to grip much of northern and northeastern Taiwan, leading temperatures to potentially drop below 10 C beginning Tuesday (Feb. 21), according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).Those residing in areas such as New Taipei City, Hsinchu, Miaoli, and Kinmen should be prepared for cold temperatures lasting until Thursday (Feb. 23) at the earliest. A special advisory was also issued for those using gas heaters and electric heating appliances.CWB advises residents to pay careful attention to indoor ventilation and the safety of electrical appliances. Those with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases should also take precautions, as well as the elderly, the homeless, and other vulnerable groups.Colder temperatures are also associated with strengthening northeasterly monsoon winds, which are affecting the northern coast of Keelung and other coastal areas as waves can range from four to six meters in height. Those doing water sports should pay attention for strong winds.The air quality forecast is improving according to the Environmental Protection Bureau, as a continental cold air mass will cause winds to blow in a northeasterly direction, leading to a normal diffusion effect in the north and central areas. However, strong winds could lead to dust and lower visibility in Chiayi and Tainan.A meteorological forecast by Wu Der-rong (吳德榮), predicts that from Friday (Feb. 24), a stronger cold front will arrive, leading to more rain in the north and east, resulting in lower temperatures. Saturday and Sunday (Feb. 25-26) will continue to be cold with lows below 10 C. Next Monday and Tuesday (Feb. 27-28) will finally see the cold air weaken and temperatures eventually rise.",2023/2/21,1337,Environment

The ministry said, however, that it could not establish a direct link with the nuclear site.More than 880 North Koreans have escaped from those regions since 2006, the report said.The rights group urged a resumption of testing and an international enquiry into the radiation risks for communities around Punggye-ri.The Unification Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Seoul and Washington have said Pyongyang could be preparing for a seventh nuclear test.",2023/2/21,125,World

Leader of the Inter-party Alliance Chen Yang-hu (陳泱瑚) said that Kinmen residents had reached an anti-war “consensus” motivating the two alliances to come together and submit the petition.Earlier this month, CNA reported the councilors' concern over mounting tensions between China, Taiwan, and the U.S., saying that they did not want history to repeat itself, referencing the heavy shelling endured over the course of two Taiwan Strait Crises throughout the 1950s. At the height of the conflict, 120,000 Taiwan soldiers were stationed there.The letter said the petitioners wanted demilitarization of the island in order to take full advantage of the opportunities for open exchange between the two sides of the strait.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816742,China says it's seeking role in Ukraine peace settlement,"BEIJING (AP) — The foreign minister of China, which has provided strong political backing for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, said Tuesday his country wants to play a role in ending the conflict. 

            Qin Gang told participants at a security conference in Beijing that China was concerned the almost yearlong war could escalate further and spin “out of control.” 

            China would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said. 











            “At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blames to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,"" Qin said in an apparent reference to military support provided to Ukraine by the United States and its allies, as well as concerns that China is preparing to make good on its threats to use force to assert its claim over Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy. 

            China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and strongly criticized Western economic sanctions against Moscow. In deference to Moscow, it has yet to describe the conflict as an invasion. 

            China and Russia have aligned their foreign policies to oppose the U.S. and, weeks before the Ukraine invasion, their leaders declared a partnership with “no limits.” China also says Russia was provoked into using military force by NATO's eastward expansion. 

            Despite that, Qin reiterated China's claim that it has “always taken an objective and impartial stance based on the merits of the issue."" 

            “China is deeply worried about the escalation of the situation and even the possibility of it going out of control,"" Qin said. He said Chinese President Xi Jinping had put forward proposals that have “played a responsible and constructive role in easing the situation and de-escalating the crisis,” without offering any details or evidence. 

            “We will continue to promote peace talks, provide Chinese wisdom for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and work with the international community to promote dialogue and consultation to address the concerns of all parties and seek common security,"" Qin said. 

            China has opposed criticism of Russia at the United Nations, while insisting that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations be respected, a position that underpins its claim to Taiwan, which separated from the mainland amid civil war more than 70 years ago. 

            Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet with the Chinese Communist Party’s foreign policy chief Wang Yi in Moscow, the Kremlin said Monday. 

            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hailed Russia-China ties as “multidimensional and allied in nature.” 

            That statement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden's unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and show support for Kyiv days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.

            Wang’s trip to Russia follows talks Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich. Blinken said he reiterated to Wang that any Chinese material support for the Russian armed forces would trigger a strong response from Washington. Thus far, the U.S. says there are no indications that China is doing so, although its close economic ties with Russia have offered a lifeline to Putin's regime. 

            Russia, in turn, has offered strong support for China and held a series of joint military drills amid tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan, trade, human rights and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. 

            China's Foreign Ministry issued a lengthy statement Tuesday outlining Xi's “Global Security Initiative,"" which aims to “eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world."" 

            In its only reference to Russia's invasion, it said the initiative would “support political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Ukraine crisis through dialogue and negotiation."" 

            At a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin criticized military aid provided to Ukraine by the U.S. and its allies, saying that “the U.S. claims to maintain peace, but actually it is making money from the crisis."" 

            “There are enough facts to show the true nature of the U.S. as a source of trouble rather than a defender of peace for the world,"" Wang said. 

            The U.S. has committed about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine since last year, while European allies have committed tens of billions of dollars more and welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled the conflict. Such aid is funded by U.S. and other foreign taxpayers, with Ukraine under no obligation to provide repayment as it seeks to withstand renewed Russian attempts to regain territory it had earlier conquered. 

            Wang also defended China's “comprehensive strategic partnership"" with Russia as “based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties, which is within the sovereignty of two independent countries."" 

            Wang gave no details on Wang Yi's visit to Moscow, but called it “an opportunity to work with Russia to jointly promote steady progress of bilateral relations in the direction determined by the two leaders, safeguard each other’s legitimate rights and interests and contribute positively to world peace.""BEIJING (AP) — The foreign minister of China, which has provided strong political backing for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, said Tuesday his country wants to play a role in ending the conflict.Qin Gang told participants at a security conference in Beijing that China was concerned the almost yearlong war could escalate further and spin “out of control.”China would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said.“At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blames to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,"" Qin said in an apparent reference to military support provided to Ukraine by the United States and its allies, as well as concerns that China is preparing to make good on its threats to use force to assert its claim over Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy.China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and strongly criticized Western economic sanctions against Moscow.

Thus far, the U.S. says there are no indications that China is doing so, although its close economic ties with Russia have offered a lifeline to Putin's regime.Russia, in turn, has offered strong support for China and held a series of joint military drills amid tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan, trade, human rights and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.China's Foreign Ministry issued a lengthy statement Tuesday outlining Xi's “Global Security Initiative,"" which aims to “eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world.""In its only reference to Russia's invasion, it said the initiative would “support political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Ukraine crisis through dialogue and negotiation.""At a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin criticized military aid provided to Ukraine by the U.S. and its allies, saying that “the U.S. claims to maintain peace, but actually it is making money from the crisis.""“There are enough facts to show the true nature of the U.S. as a source of trouble rather than a defender of peace for the world,"" Wang said.The U.S. has committed about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine since last year, while European allies have committed tens of billions of dollars more and welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled the conflict. Such aid is funded by U.S. and other foreign taxpayers, with Ukraine under no obligation to provide repayment as it seeks to withstand renewed Russian attempts to regain territory it had earlier conquered.Wang also defended China's “comprehensive strategic partnership"" with Russia as “based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties, which is within the sovereignty of two independent countries.""Wang gave no details on Wang Yi's visit to Moscow, but called it “an opportunity to work with Russia to jointly promote steady progress of bilateral relations in the direction determined by the two leaders, safeguard each other’s legitimate rights and interests and contribute positively to world peace.""",2023/2/21,,World

The replies were almost evenly divided, with 45.3% professing faith, and 47.2% holding little trust in Taiwan’s armed forces. The poll found a wide divergence according to political party, with 72% of supporters of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government expressing faith in the military, but 73% of opposition Kuomintang (KMT) backers holding the opposite view.Turning to the recent controversy about Chinese spy balloons spotted in the U.S. and in Taiwan, 66.3% approved of the military shooting down Chinese balloons, while 19.2% objected.The TPOF conducted the survey Feb. 12-13, obtaining 1,072 valid results with a margin of error of 2.99%.",2023/2/21,1775,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816800,Evolving 3D Mapping and Modeling Technologies and Applications Across Various Verticals,"The growth of the 3D mapping and modeling market is being driven by several factors, including the emergence of 3D-enabled display devices for improved navigation, technological advancements in 3D scanners and sensors, and the increasing availability of 3D content. However, there are also challenges facing the market, such as stringent government regulations, a lack of investment, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth in the market, particularly with the emergence of AI and ML technologies that can enhance the accuracy of 3D content. Overall, the 3D mapping and  3d modeling services market is expected to continue growing as technology advances and demand for more immersive experiences increases.In the past, obtaining 3D data was a challenging endeavor due to the lack of adequate tools, technologies, or systems. However, the emergence of 3D technology has popularized 3D content generation and led to the development of various 3D mapping technologies capable of mapping the 3D content in the surrounding environment.These technologies have found their way into mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, and notebooks. Previously, mapping was limited to a 2D plane with atlas maps or online 2D maps. By utilizing 2D images, 3D content could be modeled with available cloud points, resulting in more realistic maps and a more accurate view of objects for users.The use of 3D scanners, sensors, and other acquisition devices has given a boost to the 3D mapping and modeling market. Advanced 3D laser scanning technology now delivers precise 3D data in a shorter amount of time. Meanwhile, other acquisition devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and mobile mapping platforms (including vehicles, vessels, and other moving platforms) are also capable of capturing the right amount of data, making them popular choices in the industry.Advancements in 3D mapping technology have led to the availability of high-quality 3D content and an enhanced user experience, but the cost of capturing 3D data using acquisition devices such as scanners and lasers can be a significant obstacle to adoption. The cost of projection mapping services can be as high as $10,000 per minute of 3D video content, and additional costs such as projectors and media servers further add to the overall expense.Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have the potential to boost the accuracy of 3D mapping and modeling while reducing operational downtime. AI-based big data solutions and services can automate the detection of fraudulent activities and improve data quality. Companies such as Google are already using AI for various features, and other companies can employ AI to increase opportunities in 3D mapping.However, developing expertise in 3D mapping and modeling can be challenging. Animators require creative and artistic skills, and experience to develop 3D projects, and skill gaps can occur due to inadequate training. Animation companies should invest in training their workforce to bridge these gaps and improve their profitability.Yes, that is correct. The 3D mapping and modeling market has been segmented into five regions: North America, Europe, APAC, MEA, and Latin America, with APAC expected to have the highest growth rate during the forecast period. This is due to the increasing demand for 3D imaging sensors, modeling, visualization, and rendering software tools across various verticals, including healthcare and life sciences, manufacturing, construction, and media and entertainment.North America is expected to hold the largest market size in the global 3D mapping and modeling market during the forecast period, driven by the increasing demand for realistic virtual views of products for marketing purposes by small and medium businesses and government agencies. Europe is also experiencing growth in this market, driven by factors such as the rising adoption of cloud and IoT, and increasing use of the web. The increasing number of players across different regions is expected to further drive the growth of the 3D mapping and modeling market.",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816813,Austrian children take government to court over climate,"BERLIN (AP) — A dozen minors filed a lawsuit with Austria's top court Tuesday seeking to force the government to ensure their constitutional rights are protected by taking tougher action against climate change.

            A lawyer for the group said the case submitted to the Constitutional Court is modeled on a similar lawsuit in Germany that prompted the government there to set new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions two years ago.

            Their lawyer Michaela Kroemer says Austria's climate law from 2011 doesn't sufficiently protect the plaintiffs, aged five to 16, from the life-threatening consequences of global warming. Specifically, she said the children's right to “generational justice” — guaranteed in the Austrian constitution — is breached by the Alpine nation's climate law.











            Kroemer said the lawsuit is backed by the youth climate group Fridays for Future — which was inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg — and financially supported through philanthropic donations.BERLIN (AP) — A dozen minors filed a lawsuit with Austria's top court Tuesday seeking to force the government to ensure their constitutional rights are protected by taking tougher action against climate change.A lawyer for the group said the case submitted to the Constitutional Court is modeled on a similar lawsuit in Germany that prompted the government there to set new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions two years ago.Their lawyer Michaela Kroemer says Austria's climate law from 2011 doesn't sufficiently protect the plaintiffs, aged five to 16, from the life-threatening consequences of global warming.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816814,Mardi Gras brings joy - but also worry over violent crime,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Sunny skies and unusually warm weather fueled the street party fervor in New Orleans as the city celebrated Mardi Gras — Fat Tuesday — the annual, ebullient climax of Carnival season, marked by shoulder-to-shoulder crowds on raucous Bourbon Street and thousand lining St. Charles Avenue for family-friendly parades.

            Celebrations began before dawn in some parts of the city. TV crews captured images of The North Side Skull and Bones Gang — skeleton-costumed revelers — spreading out through the Tremé area to awaken people for Mardi Gras. As the sun rose, parade watchers were already claiming spots along the parade route. Barbecue smells wafted through the Central Business District.

            Revelers were undeterred by violence that marred a glitzy weekend parade. Gunfire that broke out during a parade Sunday night left a teenager dead and four others injured, including a 4-year-old girl. Police quickly arrested Mansour Mbodj, 21, for illegally carrying a weapon, then upgraded the charge to second-degree murder.











            Officials stressed Monday that the shooting was an isolated event.

            “It's discouraging, but it's not going to stop me from coming,” said Roz Walker, 55. She and her friend Tracy Dunbar are Baton Rouge residents who were among the crowd awaiting the parades of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization. They have been visiting New Orleans on Mardi Gras for decades.

            “In our 40-plus years of coming to Mardi Gras we've never been involved in a situation at all,” she said.

            First-time Mardi Gras participant Ken Traylor of Houston had heard about the shooting, but shrugged it off. “I just think you have to be careful with your surroundings,” he said. “Things happen nowadays everywhere.""

            Crime has contributed to dissatisfaction with New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. She won reelection easily in 2021, but has suffered a myriad of political problems since, including criticism about crime, the slow pace of major street repairs and questions over her personal use of a city-owned French Quarter apartment.

            A recall petition launched last year is nearing a Wednesday deadline. One of the organizers, Eileen Carter, said she believes the movement has enough signatures, but will make a last-minute push.

            “We're going to have people canvassing the parade routes,” Carter said. “That's been really helpful to us.”

            There was no sign of political rancor as Cantrell watched St. Charles Avenue parades from a restricted access reviewing stand with city council members in front of Gallier Hall, the 19th century Greek Revival style building that once served as City Hall. She greeted leaders with hearty shouts of “Hail Zulu!” and “Hail Rex,” traditional mayoral tributes.

            It was in stark contrast to a scene from the weekend when Cantrell was captured in a social media video gesturing with her middle-finger as a parade passed a city reviewing stand. What sparked the gesture was unclear. The mayor's press office did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A statement given to The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate shed little light.

            “Mardi Gras is a time where satire and jest are on full display,” spokesperson Gregory Joseph said in a prepared statement. “The city has been enjoying a safe and healthy Carnival,” the statement said, adding that the mayor was looking forward to continuing the celebration.

            It was a continuous costume party along French Quarter streets, where carnival revelers typically gather for a more naughty experience. Attire ran the gamut from skimpy lingerie to full nun's habits. Some costumes shimmered with sequins. Some evoked historical eras. And some evoked current events. 

            Jerome FitzGibbons wore a phony nose, mustache and glasses and carried binoculars as he strolled Chartres Street with a large white sphere strapped to the top of his head — he was a Chinese spy balloon. He and his similarly-clad wife, Jennifer, moved to New Orleans from New Jersey.

            “This is our kind of crazy,” she said.

            Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, is the culmination of Carnival season, which officially begins each year on Jan. 6, the 12th day after Christmas, and closes with the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday.

            New Orleans’ raucous celebration is the nation’s most well-known, but the holiday is also celebrated throughout much of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast. Mobile, Alabama, lays claim to the oldest Mardi Gras celebration in the country.NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Sunny skies and unusually warm weather fueled the street party fervor in New Orleans as the city celebrated Mardi Gras — Fat Tuesday — the annual, ebullient climax of Carnival season, marked by shoulder-to-shoulder crowds on raucous Bourbon Street and thousand lining St. Charles Avenue for family-friendly parades.Celebrations began before dawn in some parts of the city. TV crews captured images of The North Side Skull and Bones Gang — skeleton-costumed revelers — spreading out through the Tremé area to awaken people for Mardi Gras. As the sun rose, parade watchers were already claiming spots along the parade route. Barbecue smells wafted through the Central Business District.Revelers were undeterred by violence that marred a glitzy weekend parade. Gunfire that broke out during a parade Sunday night left a teenager dead and four others injured, including a 4-year-old girl. Police quickly arrested Mansour Mbodj, 21, for illegally carrying a weapon, then upgraded the charge to second-degree murder.Officials stressed Monday that the shooting was an isolated event.“It's discouraging, but it's not going to stop me from coming,” said Roz Walker, 55. She and her friend Tracy Dunbar are Baton Rouge residents who were among the crowd awaiting the parades of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization. They have been visiting New Orleans on Mardi Gras for decades.“In our 40-plus years of coming to Mardi Gras we've never been involved in a situation at all,” she said.First-time Mardi Gras participant Ken Traylor of Houston had heard about the shooting, but shrugged it off. “I just think you have to be careful with your surroundings,” he said. “Things happen nowadays everywhere.""Crime has contributed to dissatisfaction with New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816816,Calls for change in Iran reach even Shiite heartland of Qom,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s city of Qom is one of the country’s most important centers for Shiite Muslim clerics, packed with religious schools and revered shrines. But even here, some are quietly calling for Iran’s ruling theocracy to change its ways after months of protests shaking the country. 

            To be clear: Many here still support the cleric-led ruling system, which marked the 44th anniversary this month of Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. 

            This includes support for many of the restrictions that set off the protests, such as the mandatory hjjab, or headscarf, for women in public. They believe the state’s claims that Iran’s foreign enemies are the ones fomenting the unrest gripping the country. 











            But they say the government should change how it approaches demonstrators and women’s demands to be able to choose whether to wear an Islamic head covering or not. 

            “The harsh crackdown was a mistake from the beginning,” said Abuzar Sahebnazaran, a cleric who described himself as an ardent backer of the theocracy, as he visited a former residence of the late revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. “And the youth should have been treated softly and politely. They should have been enlightened and guided.”

            Qom, some 125 kilometers (80 miles) southwest of Iran’s capital, Tehran, draws millions of pilgrims each year and is home to half of the country’s Shiite clerics. Its religious institutions graduate the country’s top clerical minds, making the city a power bastion in the country. The faithful believe the city’s dazzling blue-domed Fatima Masumeh Shrine represents a route to heaven or a place to have prayers answered for their woes. 

            For Iran today, the woes are many. 

            Protests have rocked the country since September after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman who had been detained by morality police over alleged improper dress. The demonstrations, initially focused on the mandatory hijab, soon morphed into calls for a new revolution in the country.

            Activists outside the country say at least 528 people have been killed and 19,600 people detained in a crackdown that followed. The Iranian government has not provided any figures. 

            Meanwhile, Iran faces increasing pressure abroad over enriching uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels following the collapse of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Renewed sanctions worsen longstanding financial problems, pushing its currency — the rial — to historic lows against the dollar.

            “Many protesters either had economic problems or were influenced by the internet,” Sahebnazaran said from inside Khomeini’s former home, which bore pictures of the ayatollah and Iranian flags. 

            Protesters have even vented their anger directly at clerics, whom they see as the foundations of the system. Some videos circulated online show young protesters running up behind clerics on the street and knocking off their turbans, a sign of their status. Those wearing a black turban claim descent directly from Islam’s Prophet Muhammad. 

            The scattered videos are a sign of the alienation felt by some toward the clergy in a nation where, 44 years ago, clerics helped lead the revolution against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

            “This was part of enemy plans, they wanted to tell people that the clerics are the reason behind all problems and high prices,” Sahebnazaran said. “But the clergy are being impacted by the inflation like the rest of the people. Many clerics live on tuition fees at the lowest economic level of society. The majority of them face the same problems as the people do.”

            Seminary students receive some $50 a month, with many working as laborers or taxi drivers. Fewer than 10% of Iran’s 200,000 clerics have official posts in the government. 

            Sakineh Heidarifard, who voluntarily works with the morality police in Qom and actively promotes the hijab, said arresting women and forcefully taking them into police custody isn’t a good idea.

            She said the morality patrols are necessary, but if they find violators they should give them a warning. “Use of force and coercion is not correct at all. We should talk to them with a soft and gentle tone, with kindness and care,” she said. 

            Still, she sees the hijab as a central tenet of the Islamic Republic. “We have sacrificed a lot of martyrs or blood to keep this veil,” she said. “God willing, it will never be removed from our heads.” 

            Changes in approach, however, are not likely to satisfy those calling for the wholesale rejection of the cleric-run government. Politicians in the reform movement for years have been urging change within the theocratic system to no avail, and many protesters have lost patience.

            Also, the ever-growing economic pressure on Iran’s 80 million people may one day explode across all of society, said Alireza Fateh, a carpet salesman standing next to his empty shop in Qom’s traditional bazaar. 

            “Economic collapse is usually followed by political collapse ... and unfortunately this is what is happening here,” he said. 

            “The majority of the population ... still have a little left in their bank accounts. But someday they will take to streets too, someday soon. Soon the poor, those who can’t make ends meet, will take to streets definitely.”DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s city of Qom is one of the country’s most important centers for Shiite Muslim clerics, packed with religious schools and revered shrines.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816818,McClellan wins special election for Virginia’s 4th District,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia voters on Tuesday elected Democrat Jennifer McClellan, a veteran state legislator from Richmond, to fill an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where she will make history as the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress. 

            “We will make this commonwealth and this country a better place for everyone,” McClellan said in a victory speech at a party with supporters in Richmond. “I am ready to get to work.”

            McClellan, 50, prevailed over right-wing Republican nominee Leon Benjamin in the special election for the blue-leaning 4th District, which has its population center in the capital city and stretches south to the North Carolina border. 











            The seat was open after the death of Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin, who passed away following a long fight with the secondary effects of colorectal cancer in November, weeks after being elected to a fourth term. McClellan's election won’t change the balance of power of the U.S. House, which Republicans narrowly control. 

            “Historical. Had to be a part of it,” voter Rashida Mitchell said of the ballot she cast for McClellan on Tuesday afternoon. “She’s done great things for the city of Richmond, for the commonwealth as a whole.”

            Prior to Tuesday, only 22 states had ever elected a Black woman to Congress, according to a recent Pew Research Center analysis of historical records. McClellan said breaking that barrier in Virginia carries extra weight because of her family’s history in the Jim Crow South. 

            Her father’s grandfather had to take a literacy test and find three white people to vouch for him just to be able to register to vote, said McClellan, a native of central Virginia. Her grandfather and father paid poll taxes and her mother, now 90, didn’t vote until after the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

            “It’s a huge honor, and responsibility, to ensure that I’m not the last,” she said in an interview last week. 

            An associate general counsel for Verizon, where she’s worked for 20 years, McClellan has represented parts of the Richmond area in the General Assembly for nearly as long. 

            At the statehouse, McClellan has cultivated a reputation as a deeply knowledgeable, widely respected consensus builder and legislator. A skilled debater with a polished, reserved style, she’s sponsored many of Democrats’ top legislative priorities in recent years, including bills that expanded voting access and abortion rights and legislation that set ambitious clean energy mandates.

            Now the mother of two school-aged children, McClellan was the first delegate to serve while pregnant and give birth while in office after she joined the state House in 2006. 

            McClellan also followed in McEachin’s footsteps when she moved up to the state Senate. She announced her candidacy for a seat he previously held after he was first elected to Congress in 2016, and she easily won a January 2017 special election.

            In 2021, she was part of the crowded Democratic field seeking the party’s nomination for governor, which she and three other candidates lost to Terry McAuliffe. That experience, McClellan said, helped her pivot quickly to this race and the high-speed December nominating contest that lasted just over a week. 

            McClellan said her interest in politics first began in middle school. 

            “It was listening to my parents’ stories. ... They saw the best of government through the New Deal and they saw the worst of government through Jim Crow. And their stories sparked a love of history,” McClellan said. 

            She graduated from a suburban Richmond high school, attended the University of Richmond and obtained her law degree from the University of Virginia, initially with a goal of becoming an attorney for a congressional committee.

            She changed course and first sought elected office herself in 2005. She’s been active in the state Democratic party since she was in college and met her husband, David Mills, through politics. They were married by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a mentor and adviser of McClellan who campaigned with her over the weekend. 

            Kaine said at a Saturday rally in Richmond that McClellan’s combination of legislative experience and her existing connections with Virginia’s congressional delegation — including four Republican members with whom she served in the General Assembly — means she’ll be well positioned to be effective despite the GOP majority. 

            “She’s a hard worker, does the homework, really gets into the details,” Kaine told reporters. “She’s very firm in her convictions, but she’s a civil, courteous person who doesn’t push anybody away.”

            McClellan pledged in her speech Tuesday night to serve as a unifier.

            “We can prove that when we come together and we care more about doing the work and solving the problems than soundbites and the show, that we can help people,"" she said.

            She opened her remarks with a remembrance of McEachin. His widow, Richmond prosecutor Colette McEachin, was among a number of high-profile endorsers of McClellan as she campaigned for and handily secured the party’s nomination for the race. 

            The contest between McClellan and Benjamin, a pastor and Navy veteran who as a commentator has espoused conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and voter fraud, was not seen as competitive, though McClellan said she took nothing for granted. She campaigned and fundraised amid the ongoing General Assembly session. The two did not meet for a debate, and McClellan largely focused her message on her legislative record rather than highlighting Benjamin’s positions. 

            McClellan far outraised Benjamin, who was endorsed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other top Virginia Republicans, and she had a structural advantage in the heavily Democratic, majority-minority district.

            The race marked the third loss in a row for Benjamin, who twice previously challenged McEachin.

            McClellan’s victory Tuesday will set up another special election to fill her seat in the General Assembly. She declined in the interview to say whether she would issue an endorsement in what’s shaping up to be another crowded primary. 

            As for her own political future, she didn’t rule out another statewide run down the road but said she hopes to make progress in Congress on some of the same issues she’s championed in Richmond: environmental justice and climate change, abortion rights, public school funding, and expanding voting rights. 

            “All of the success that I have had with major legislation at the state level, all of that work still hasn’t been done at the federal level. And so I will bring my expertise on those issues and continue to work on those issues in Congress,” she said.RICHMOND, Va.

A skilled debater with a polished, reserved style, she’s sponsored many of Democrats’ top legislative priorities in recent years, including bills that expanded voting access and abortion rights and legislation that set ambitious clean energy mandates.Now the mother of two school-aged children, McClellan was the first delegate to serve while pregnant and give birth while in office after she joined the state House in 2006.McClellan also followed in McEachin’s footsteps when she moved up to the state Senate. She announced her candidacy for a seat he previously held after he was first elected to Congress in 2016, and she easily won a January 2017 special election.In 2021, she was part of the crowded Democratic field seeking the party’s nomination for governor, which she and three other candidates lost to Terry McAuliffe. That experience, McClellan said, helped her pivot quickly to this race and the high-speed December nominating contest that lasted just over a week.McClellan said her interest in politics first began in middle school.“It was listening to my parents’ stories. ... They saw the best of government through the New Deal and they saw the worst of government through Jim Crow. And their stories sparked a love of history,” McClellan said.She graduated from a suburban Richmond high school, attended the University of Richmond and obtained her law degree from the University of Virginia, initially with a goal of becoming an attorney for a congressional committee.She changed course and first sought elected office herself in 2005. She’s been active in the state Democratic party since she was in college and met her husband, David Mills, through politics. They were married by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a mentor and adviser of McClellan who campaigned with her over the weekend.Kaine said at a Saturday rally in Richmond that McClellan’s combination of legislative experience and her existing connections with Virginia’s congressional delegation — including four Republican members with whom she served in the General Assembly — means she’ll be well positioned to be effective despite the GOP majority.“She’s a hard worker, does the homework, really gets into the details,” Kaine told reporters. “She’s very firm in her convictions, but she’s a civil, courteous person who doesn’t push anybody away.”McClellan pledged in her speech Tuesday night to serve as a unifier.“We can prove that when we come together and we care more about doing the work and solving the problems than soundbites and the show, that we can help people,"" she said.She opened her remarks with a remembrance of McEachin. His widow, Richmond prosecutor Colette McEachin, was among a number of high-profile endorsers of McClellan as she campaigned for and handily secured the party’s nomination for the race.The contest between McClellan and Benjamin, a pastor and Navy veteran who as a commentator has espoused conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and voter fraud, was not seen as competitive, though McClellan said she took nothing for granted. She campaigned and fundraised amid the ongoing General Assembly session. The two did not meet for a debate, and McClellan largely focused her message on her legislative record rather than highlighting Benjamin’s positions.McClellan far outraised Benjamin, who was endorsed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other top Virginia Republicans, and she had a structural advantage in the heavily Democratic, majority-minority district.The race marked the third loss in a row for Benjamin, who twice previously challenged McEachin.McClellan’s victory Tuesday will set up another special election to fill her seat in the General Assembly. She declined in the interview to say whether she would issue an endorsement in what’s shaping up to be another crowded primary.As for her own political future, she didn’t rule out another statewide run down the road but said she hopes to make progress in Congress on some of the same issues she’s championed in Richmond: environmental justice and climate change, abortion rights, public school funding, and expanding voting rights.“All of the success that I have had with major legislation at the state level, all of that work still hasn’t been done at the federal level. And so I will bring my expertise on those issues and continue to work on those issues in Congress,” she said.",2023/2/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816833,US 8th grader wins state spelling bee with word 'Taiwan',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An eighth grader won a spelling bee in Idaho after she correctly spelled the word ""Taiwan.""Kayla Tenney Villalobos, a student at Coeur d'Alene Charter Academy, became the champion of the 20th North Idaho Spelling Bee on Feb. 11, reported the Coeur d'Alene Press. For her efforts, she was awarded a trophy, a cash prize of US$1,000, a one-year subscription to the online editions of Encyclopedia Britannica and Webster’s Dictionary, and a ticket to Washington, D.C. to compete in the Scripps National Spelling Bee later this year.Villalobos' closest rival was runner-up Erik Brunner, a sixth-grader from Lakes Middle School. The two were tied in the 16th round when they both misspelled their words.Because they both made mistakes, they each were given another chance in the 17th round, and both succeeded. However, in the 18th round, Brunner missed another word, leaving Villalobos the sole survivor.In the 19th round, Villalobos was presented with the word ""Taiwan,"" which she spelled correctly, enabling her to take the championship. Right after winning the contest, Kayla was cited by the newspaper as saying ""I'm kind of in shock.""She admitted that she had not practiced as thoroughly as she could have prior to the competition, except for some last-minute cramming. For that reason, she did not expect to win and thought she might make it to the top 10 at best.Villalobos is the fourth student from Coeur d’Alene Charter Academy to win the North Idaho Spelling Bee. This year's championship featured 21 students from fourth to eighth grade who were presented with challenging words such as hologram, gumption, puckish, harmonious, tawny, stewardship, windbaggery, illusionist, and mano a mano, among others.",2023/2/21,2017,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816847,The story of Nazi resistance fighter Sophie Scholl,"We want to be Jungmädel. / We want to have clear eyes / and busy hands. / We want to become strong and proud: (...) too defiant to be cowards.In 1934, in the German city of Ulm, a group of girls made that solemn pledge to the ""Jungmädelbund"" (Young Girls' League), a branch of Adolf Hitler's youth movement for girls aged 10 to 14. Sophie Scholl was one of them, and she, too, was given the trademark black scarf to tie around her neck.Just three years later, she and her brother Werner were confirmed while wearing Hitler Youth uniforms at St. Paul's Church in Ulm. These two examples are often quoted as evidence that Sophie Scholl, who became famous as a member of the White Rose student group and an icon of the anti-Nazi resistance, first had sympathies for the regime.Werner Milstein, author of a biography on Sophie Scholl, sees different explanations as to why she would have joined Hitler's youth groups.For Sophie Scholl, the Young Girls' League was ""very attractive, because it was where she could do what she enjoyed doing — be outdoors, climb trees,"" the biographer told DW in 2021. She liked to sit around the campfire, but also read poetry by Rainer Maria Rilke, ""which didn't fit at all with Nazi ideology,"" he added.Born on May 9, 1921, in the town of Forchtenberg, Sophie Scholl grew up with four siblings in a politically liberal, Christian home. She liked to spend time in nature and enjoyed reading and painting. She spent her childhood in the southern city of Ulm, where her father worked as a tax consultant.Sophie Scholl's parents had little use for the new regime and were upset to see their children react with enthusiasm to the Nazis, even taking on leadership positions in Nazi youth organizations.For the young people of that time, membership meant personal responsibility, independence and emancipation from home, even if Nazi youth organizations demanded iron discipline and obedience.But the young generation was split; not everyone was as fanatical as the Nazis would have liked them to be. ""They thought they had the youth under control, that they had infiltrated them enough, so they were shocked when things turned out differently,"" said Milstein.For the most part, young people in church or political groups were reticent. By dissolving and synchronizing youth associations including Boy Scouts, Socialist Workers' Youth and Christian youth associations, the regime tried to dominate how all youth were influenced and shaped.Late in the 1930s, the Nazis introduced ""compulsory youth service,"" which meant young people were forced to join the Hitler Youth. Those who resisted faced harsh consequences, including jail time.One of the best-known opposition youth groups at the time were the Edelweiss Pirates, which had branches in large cities across Germany. They rejected the Hitler Youth coercion and drill.Students at German universities were not very involved in the resistance. In fact, some helped pave the way to power for the National Socialists before 1933. Munich's ""Die Weisse Rose"" (White Rose) resistance group, which Sophie Scholl joined, was one of the few exceptions.Sophie Scholl went from Hitler Youth to uncompromising resistance fighter. Her change of heart was prompted by several events, including her friend Fritz Hartnagel's accounts from the front and her father's arrest for ""treachery"" in 1941. Cracks had appeared in her world, and she began to recognize the signs of the times.""If Hitler came along and I had a gun, I would shoot him. If the men don't do it, a woman has to do it,"" Sophie Scholl told her best friend one day in 1942 when they were sitting in a cafe, according to Milstein's book, which was published in German in 2021 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Sophie Scholl's birth.As part of the White Rose group, she asked Fritz Hartnagel for 1,000 Reichsmark for a printing machine — procuring materials like ink, paper and stamps was her task. The first four White Rose flyers appeared between June 27 and July 12, 1942, before Sophie Scholl had joined the group, so she was not yet involved in these early writings.""Of course, Hans Scholl [Sophie's older brother] and his friend Alexander Schmorell were much more important; they were the center of the group. Sophie Scholl came later, but as a young woman, she has a special appeal,"" noted Milstein.To this day, Sophie Scholl is an icon of resistance against Nazi Germany, a symbol of exemplary civil courage.During the height of the coronavirus, however, her name was misused by a loud minority in Germany. Participants in anti-coronavirus protection policies drew comparisons with the Nazi era, stylizing themselves as victims, and their opposition as being similar to her resistance.Sophie Scholl would have not have joined the protests, said Milstein: ""She was way too smart.""""Freedom also means responsibility,"" the biographer added. ""Freedom does not mean that we can do whatever we want. Sophie Scholl fought for a different Germany, and the fact that she is now being misused for other purposes leaves a bitter aftertaste.""The fates of Sophie and her brother, Hans Scholl, were sealed on February 18, 1943. At 10 a.m. they carried a heavy suitcase to a building at the University of Munich. Its contents: flyers. They managed to distribute 1,700 of them before Sophie — intentionally or accidentally — knocked a stack off the gallery. Like doves of peace, the flyers fluttered to the atrium.That was the Scholls' undoing. ""Stop! You're under arrest!"" shouted a janitor who had witnessed the scene.Four days later, on February 22, White Rose members Hans Scholl, Sophie Scholl and Christoph Probst were sentenced to death. Sophie was the first to be executed by guillotine. Reportedly she remained brave, determined and upright to the last — her executioner later said that he had never seen a person die so bravely.For Sophie Scholl, it was a matter of morality and politics, of thought and action.This article has been translated from the German. Originally published on the occassion of her 100th birthday anniveseary in 2021, it was updated on January 20th, 2023, to reflect the 80th anniversary of her execution.",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816850,Asian shares decline following Wall Street tumble,"TOKYO (AP) — Asian shares declined Wednesday after stocks tumbled on Wall Street as worries persist about higher interest rates and their tightening squeeze on the global economy.

            Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.4% in morning trading to 27,100.51. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3% to 7,312.50. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.6% to 2,420.93. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 20,500.35, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.1% to 3,302.23. 

            
                New Zealand’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75% to try to wrestle down inflation. The increase, which can raise the borrowing costs for consumers on everything from credit cards to mortgages, comes despite widespread economic pain from a devastating cyclone.











            Higher rates hurt investment prices and raise the risk of a recession by slowing business investment and consumer spending. 

            U.S. employment and consumer spending have weathered higher interest rates well, but a report Tuesday showed sales of previously occupied homes slowed to their slowest pace in more than a decade. The mixed signals leave investors wondering if the Fed will ease back on rate hikes or resume a more aggressive stance. 

            “Amid the evolving new narrative of stronger US growth, payrolls, retail sales, and the additional Fed response required to tame the rude health of the US economy, investors are beginning to think the hawkish Fed may not have entirely run its course yet,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary. 

            The S&P 500 fell 2% to 3,997.34 on Tuesday for its sharpest drop since the market was selling off in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 697 points, or 2.1%, to 33,129.59 while the Nasdaq composite sank 2.5% to 11,492.30.

            
                Home Depot fell to one of the market's larger losses after giving financial forecasts that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. It dropped 7.1% despite reporting stronger profit for the last three months of 2022 than expected.

            The retailer said it would spend $1 billion to increase wages for hourly U.S. and Canadian workers. That fed into broader worries for markets that rising costs for companies have been eating into profits, which are one of the main levers that set stock prices.

The Fed has already pulled its key overnight rate up to a range of 4.50% to 4.75%, up from basically zero at the start of last year. 

            The worry is that the Fed could ratchet up its forecasts for rates further next month when it releases its latest projections for the economy.

            Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyamaTOKYO (AP) — Asian shares declined Wednesday after stocks tumbled on Wall Street as worries persist about higher interest rates and their tightening squeeze on the global economy.Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 1.4% in morning trading to 27,100.51. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3% to 7,312.50. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.6% to 2,420.93. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.1% to 20,500.35, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.1% to 3,302.23.New Zealand’s central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half-point to 4.75% to try to wrestle down inflation. The increase, which can raise the borrowing costs for consumers on everything from credit cards to mortgages, comes despite widespread economic pain from a devastating cyclone.Higher rates hurt investment prices and raise the risk of a recession by slowing business investment and consumer spending.U.S. employment and consumer spending have weathered higher interest rates well, but a report Tuesday showed sales of previously occupied homes slowed to their slowest pace in more than a decade. The mixed signals leave investors wondering if the Fed will ease back on rate hikes or resume a more aggressive stance.“Amid the evolving new narrative of stronger US growth, payrolls, retail sales, and the additional Fed response required to tame the rude health of the US economy, investors are beginning to think the hawkish Fed may not have entirely run its course yet,"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.The S&P 500 fell 2% to 3,997.34 on Tuesday for its sharpest drop since the market was selling off in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 697 points, or 2.1%, to 33,129.59 while the Nasdaq composite sank 2.5% to 11,492.30.Home Depot fell to one of the market's larger losses after giving financial forecasts that fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. It dropped 7.1% despite reporting stronger profit for the last three months of 2022 than expected.The retailer said it would spend $1 billion to increase wages for hourly U.S. and Canadian workers.

In early February, the man developed progressively worse symptoms, including blisters, rashes, sore throat, joint pain, and body aches. After being evaluated by a doctor, he was tested for Mpox.On Feb. 15, he tested positive for Mpox, and it was determined that he was an imported case. He is currently undergoing treatment in a hospital isolation ward.A total of 39 recent contacts of the man have been identified. These contacts have been advised about the disease and have started 21 days of self-health monitoring.According to the CDC, Mpox was listed as a category 2 notifiable communicable disease on June 23, 2022. As of Tuesday, a total of 45 suspected cases have been reported and five cases have been confirmed, all of which were imported.The imported cases include one from Germany, three from the U.S., and one from Austria. The remaining 40 cases were ruled out as Mpox infections.The CDC stated that since June 30 last year, there have been 30 countries that have reported more than 100 cases of local or unknown infection sources and have been listed as ""Level 2 Alert"" countries, meaning that enhanced precautions are recommended. If Taiwanese travel to these countries, they are advised to avoid high-risk settings such as social activities in which they may come in direct contact with strangers.If they develop symptoms such as a fever, or skin lesions such as rashes, papules, blisters, or pustules when they return to Taiwan, they should proactively inform airline personnel and quarantine officers at airports and ports. They should also seek medical treatment as soon as possible and inform the doctor of their recent travel history and contacts.In addition, if members of the public go to high-risk areas within Taiwan, they should implement self-protection measures. If they have symptoms, they should also seek medical treatment as soon as possible and actively inform the doctor of their contact history.The CDC pointed out that since the outbreak of Mpox in the U.K. in mid-May last year, at least 109 countries have reported more than 86,000 cases, of which the Americas (58,367 cases) and Europe (25,849 cases) have the largest number of cases. The top five countries in terms of Mpox cases are the U.S. with 30,193, Brazil with 10,808, Spain with 7,538, France with 4,128, and Colombia with 4,074.Cases have also been reported in neighboring countries and territories such as Singapore, Japan, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and China. The Mpox outbreak in Japan has reportedly recently intensified.The World Health Organization announced on July 23 last year that the monkeypox outbreak was listed as a ""Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)"" and remains so thus far.The CDC reminded the public that the transmissibility of monkeypox is limited, with transmission more likely to occur through direct skin-to-skin contact. Transmission may also occur from patients to the medical staff caring for them.",2023/2/21,1909,Society
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816878,"Energy agency chief: ""No excuse"" for high methane emissions","MOMBASA, Kenya (AP) — The International Energy Agency on Tuesday accused fossil fuel industries of doing too little to curb methane emissions and undermining global climate goals to limit warming.

            Economic uncertainty, high energy prices and concerns over the security of supply — which should have led to emissions cuts in 2022 — were ineffective as methane emissions remained “stubbornly high,” it said.

            “Methane cuts are among the cheapest options to limit near-term global warming,"" said IEA's executive director Fatih Birol. ""There is just no excuse.” 











            The IEA's annual Methane Gas Tracker report found that 75% of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector can be reduced with cheap and readily available technologies. 

            Methane, which makes up natural gas, can escape into the air from oil and gas infrastructure. Fossil fuel companies may also flare or burn off excess gas which can release methane into the atmosphere.

            The report slammed oil and gas majors’ refusal to pay up the some $100 billion needed for technologies to spearhead the emissions cuts, which is less than 3% of the industry’s profits in 2022. 

            
                Energy giants like Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and others reported record profits last year as Russia’s war in Ukraine drove up oil and natural gas prices, spurring calls for the companies to do more to contain climate-changing emissions and help households and businesses that saw their utility bills explode.

            The war exacerbated a global energy crunch that started as demand rebounded from pandemic lows, especially in Europe, which relied on Russian supplies before the invasion nearly a year ago. Fears about natural gas shortages drove up prices, sending parts of Europe back to coal and seeking suppliers outside Russia. Prices have steadily dropped as the continent made it through the winter heating season with enough supply and the global economy has slowed, meaning less demand for energy. 

            The report said that the energy sector accounts for around 40% of the total average methane emissions from human activity, second only to agriculture, and is responsible for 135 million tons of methane released into the atmosphere last year.

            “The untamed release of methane in fossil fuel production is a problem that sometimes goes under the radar in public debate,” Birol said. “Fossil fuel producers need to step up and policy makers need to step in – and both must do so quickly.” 

            Methane is a greenhouse gas which is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term and is responsible for about a fifth of all warming. In 2021, world leaders committed to reducing methane emissions from human activities by 30% by the end of the decade. 

            Limiting emissions from coal mines — another source of methane — by cutting coal consumption was also highlighted in the report. A toolkit and regulatory roadmap for policymakers and industry on coal methane reductions has been developed by the IEA.

            New advanced technologies and satellites are providing clearer methane emissions images, increasing the world’s knowledge of how much is being spewed into the atmosphere.

            Lemon has not been on the air since Thursday, when he said the 51-year-old Haley was not “in her prime” during the broadcast of “CNN This Morning.” Lemon and fellow hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins had been discussing Haley's suggestion that politicians over 75 should be subject to mandatory mental competency tests.











            “Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime, sorry,” Lemon said, explaining why he was “uncomfortable” with the age discussion. He said a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s. Haley is 51.

            He was challenged by Harlow, who tried to clarify what Lemon was referencing: “I think we need to qualify. Are you talking about prime for childbearing or are you talking about prime for being president?”

            “Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying what the facts are,” Lemon responded. He brought up the subject again an hour later, and was rebutted by commentator Audie Cornish.

            “She's in her prime for running for office,” Cornish said of Haley. “Political prime is what we’re talking about.”

            Lemon issued a statement that same day saying he regretted his “inartful and irrelevant” comments, which were widely condemned. Haley herself called the comments sexist and used the episode to fundraise.

            According to The New York Times, Licht chastised Lemon during an editorial call Friday, saying his remarks were “upsetting, unacceptable and unfair” and a “huge distraction.” Lemon appeared at the meeting and apologized to staffers, CNN reported.

            “I sat down with Don and had a frank and meaningful conversation,” Licht wrote in the Monday night memo. “He has agreed to participate in formal training, as well as continuing to listen and learn. We take this situation very seriously.""

            Harlow said at the top of Tuesday morning's show that Lemon would be back the next day.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816913,"Ukraine's year of pain, death — and also nation-building","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — In the final hours before the Russian onslaught, a last grasp at peace. Russian troops would soon pour across Ukraine's borders and Russian missiles would fill Ukrainian skies, taking Ukrainian lives in the biggest air, sea and ground assault in Europe since World War II. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy still appealed, on war's brink, for reason to prevail. 

            Staring intently into the camera in a last-ditch, dead-of-night, video-recorded plea against the invasion, Zelenskyy warned Russia that the consequences would be “an abundance of pain, filth, blood and death.” 

            “War is a huge calamity,"" Zelenskyy said, in what proved to be one of his last outings in a suit before his switch to military-style casual wear. “This calamity carries a huge cost — in every meaning of this word.” 











            The date was Feb. 24, 2022 — cataclysmic for Ukraine, course-changing for Russia, history-shaping for the wider world. Every hour of every day since has proven those words to be right.

            ___

            As milestones go, the invasion's first anniversary Friday is both grim and vexing. It marks a full year of killing, destruction, loss and pain felt even beyond the borders of Russia and Ukraine — with war-related price shocks being just one example. But it also raises a question that is unsatisfying because it can't be answered at this partway point: How much longer until this stops? 

            ""Not soon enough"" might be one response, though any peace deal looks far off as Russia's invasion force meat-grinds into Year Two, with neither side close to reaching hoped-for objectives. 

            The misery of 365 days of bloodshed and the full scale of the global repercussions are difficult to sum up with mere words. Russia is more isolated than at any time since the Cold War. Western nations are banding together for Russian President Vladimir Putin 's defeat while also gambling that the ex-KGB spy won't go nuclear. China is filing away lessons that could be used against Taiwan. 

            And how to measure all the tears? How to adequately describe all the suffering and atrocities? Or even the broken heart of just one of the children who have lost loved ones and futures?

            The numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men escaping abroad to avoid being thrown into battle, millions of Ukrainians uprooted from their homes, tens of billions of dollars poured into weaponry that is making war ever-more lethal, trillions more dollars estimated lost for the global economy. And even those figures don't do justice to the human and economic costs. 

            Of the body count — surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides — all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.

            But Ukraine is still here. That in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin. Putin seemingly believed his forces and secret services would have turned Ukraine into a puppet state by now. The invasion plan called for resistant Ukrainian officials to be liquidated, weeded out or flipped into collaborating, according to a British think tank’s study based in part on captured Russian documents. 

            Instead, the threat of extinction as a free nation is pushing Ukraine into an ever-closer orbit with the European Union, the United States and the wider West — the very outcome Putin wanted to avoid. Each additional delivery of NATO-standard weapons, the billions of dollars in other Western aid, and pledges to stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” are hard-wiring bonds that, in peacetime, might have taken many more years to build.

            Ukraine, independent from the ex-Soviet Union only since 1991, has also grown in war as a nation. Fighting to remain Ukrainian has forced clarity about what exactly that means, sharpening the contours of national identity. 

            In what have become daily video addresses to share news from the fronts and boost morale, Zelenskyy sometimes wears black hoodies emblazoned on the front with the words, “I'm Ukrainian.” Many more Ukrainians have joined the president in ditching Russian for Ukrainian as their primary language. Statues of Russians are also being torn down, street names are being changed and Russian history is being expunged from school textbooks. 

            Says Olena Sotnyk, a lawyer and former legislator: “Putin did for us something which nobody did. He helped us to become a free nation."" 

            ___

            Abroad, too, Ukraine has won hearts and minds, evidenced by the blue-and-yellow flags flying from town halls and the foreign fighters and aid workers risking — and sometimes losing — their lives on Ukrainian battlefields pounded by shellfire into hellscapes hauntingly reminiscent of World War I.

            “No one will ever confuse Ukraine and Russia (again),"" says Mykhailo Podolyak, one of Zelenskyy’s closest advisers. ""No one will say, ‘It is something over there, near Russia.’” 

            Ukrainians argue that in resisting Putin, they've also done the world the favor of unmasking him as a cruel and dangerous foe. The Russian leader who bewitched George W. Bush (“I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy,"" the then U.S. president said in 2001 ) and who was chauffeured on a golf cart through the gardens of Versailles Palace by France's president in 2017, has become a pariah to Western leaders. But others remain close with him, notably Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

            Despite the failure to secure quick victory, Putin's grip on power remains firm, with protests quashed and most Russians seemingly rallied behind the war effort. Still, Russia is making previously unimaginable sacrifices. 

            In battle, Putin has increasingly had to turn to the mercenaries of the notorious Wagner Group, a private military company that has recruited fighters from prisons and tossed them into combat, with high casualty rates. Putin is also losing energy leverage over Europe as it veers away from Russian gas and most Russian oil. Russia's economy is laboring under Western sanctions. As Putin is boxed in, some fear he could lash out in new ways, perhaps resort to more nuclear saber-rattling or worse.

            But history is written by war's victors. And at this point, the invasion's outcome is far from clear.

            One of Putin's initial mistakes was trying to conquer a country the size of France with a force that Western estimates suggest was barely larger than the Allies' D-Day army in World War II. And the mission on June 6, 1944, was far narrower: assault five French beaches, opening the breach from which the Allies then pushed through Nazi-occupied Europe.

            Putin is now throwing additional equipment and manpower at the problem of his own making, with 300,000 mobilized troops in his pipeline for a new offensive that Russia hasn't announced — but which Western and Ukrainian officials say is already underway in eastern Ukraine.

            ""Don't be seduced by ‘plucky little Ukraine,’ because Russia is much bigger. It could just grind Ukraine out,” cautions retired Air Marshal Edward Stringer, a former senior officer in Britain's Royal Air Force. “It could force Ukraine to run out of bullets by putting one Russian in front of every bullet until Ukraine runs out of bullets before Putin runs out of Russians.”

            ___

            Certainly, Podolyak says, time is not on Ukraine's side. Just the opposite. 

            “A protracted war is the slow death of Ukraine,” he says. But the invasion's first anniversary, he insists, “means that we are on the right track.” 

            “It means that we have a different Ukraine,"" he says. ""It looks completely different.”

            So different that pre-invasion life is an ever-hazier memory. Back then, statues in the capital, Kyiv, hadn't disappeared behind walls of protective sandbags. People didn't need to fill bathtubs when air raid sirens sounded so they have water if Russian strikes knock out supplies. They didn't download phone apps that issue shrill alarms when Russian missiles and killer drones are en route. 

            And those same apps didn't have “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill announcing when the danger has passed, reassuringly saying in his Luke Skywalker voice: ""The air alert is over. May the force be with you.” Surreal. 

            Sotnyk, the former legislator, recalls the panic that gripped her when Russia's missiles first started striking Kyiv a year ago. She called up her mother and ordered her to pack. Now Sotnyk knows better than to dash across town in an air raid. 

            “It’s not like we became braver,"" she says. ""We (just) became more aware of what does it mean — ‘war.’”

            Before the invasion, Feb. 24 hadn't been much of a mover and shaker as a date in world history. Then Prince Charles and Lady Diana announced their engagement on that day in 1981. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was born Feb. 24, 1955. In 1938, it was the launch day of the first nylon-bristle toothbrush, “ Dr. West’s Miracle Toothbrush."" 

            But in 1920, in Germany, it was also the day that Adolf Hitler presented a 25-point platform for the new Nazi Party. Back then, Hitler's audience couldn't have known that his speech in a Munich beer hall would prove to be a step toward World War II. Had they guessed, would they have turned back?

            Feb. 24, 2022, hasn't led to World War III — not “yet,” pessimists might add. But the past year was, as Zelenskyy forewarned, full of pain, filth, blood and death.

            And ahead: a grim abundance of more to come.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816914,Warner ruled out of Australia's remaining 2 tests in India,"SYDNEY (AP) — Veteran opener David Warner has been ruled out of Australia’s remaining two test matches in India after injuring his elbow and sustaining a concussion in the second cricket test in New Delhi. 

            Warner was substituted out of the match after the first innings and replaced by Matt Renshaw. Australia slumped to a six-wicket loss following a dramatic second-innings batting collapse as India took a 2-0 series lead and retained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. 

            Cricket Australia issued a statement Tuesday saying Warner will return to Sydney for rest and recovery but is expected to return to India next month for the three-game limited-overs series. 











            Australia is struggling with form and injury problems in India. Injured pace bowler Josh Hazlewood also returned to Australia, without playing a test, after the loss in New Delhi. Skipper Pat Cummins was making a quick return to Sydney because of a serious family illness but was scheduled to be back in India ahead of the third test starting March 1 at Indore.

            The 36-year-old Warner had been struggling on the slow, up-and-down pitches in India, scoring 1 and 10 in Australia's big series-opening loss in Nagpur and 15 in the second test, when he was hit on the elbow trying to fend away a short ball and also hit on the batting helmet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816931,Chinese “Military Support” to Russia?… Fears Portend the “Worst of the Cold War”,"Recent US warnings to China about providing military assistance to Russia in its war against Ukraine foreshadow a “global conflict”, according to an analysis by The Washington Post that highlighted the extent of the crisis in US-Chinese relations, and Washington’s strategy to discourage it from engaging in the Ukraine war after it committed itself to military neutrality since the start of the invasion.The US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has stated on several occasions, during the past few days, that China is studying the issue of supplying weapons to Russia.US officials told CNN, on Saturday, that the United States had recently detected “disturbing” trends indicating that Beijing wanted to “infiltrate the line” of providing lethal military assistance to Moscow.The officials did not detail what intelligence the United States had found indicating a recent shift in China’s position but said the officials were concerned enough that they shared the intelligence with allies and partners during the Munich Security Conference.Officials said Blinken raised the issue when he met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Saturday, on the sidelines of the conference.The minister confirmed that he “shared these concerns” with Wang, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, described, on Monday, the US accusations as “false information.”He denied that Beijing intends to supply Russia with weapons to support it in its war against Ukraine, accusing Washington of “adding fuel to the fire” by making such accusations, reiterating the call to support a Chinese proposal to end the war.In response to this, the German Foreign Ministry has issued a recommendation advising its citizens to refrain from traveling to Russia, according to an Indian newspaper The Eastern Herald.And on the American warning line, the European Union’s foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, said that China’s delivery of weapons to Russia would constitute a “red line” for the Union, and confirmed that the Chinese Foreign Minister “told me that they will not do this and that they do not plan to do so. But we will remain.” Wake up.”Addressing this issue again, Monday, Blinken warned that “providing lethal support to Russia to help it in its aggressive war in Ukraine will have real consequences for our relations with China… and this will pose a real problem for China in its relations with many other countries, not just the United States.” United”.“So we hope they don’t go that route,” he added.And the US Vice President, Kamala Harris, also questioned, on Saturday, in Munich, the neutrality declared by China.She said the United States was “concerned about China’s deepening of its relations with Moscow since the war began… Any move by China aimed at providing lethal support to Russia would only reward aggression, continued killings, and the further undermining of a rules-based order in place.”The Washington Post says in its analysis that the two sides, the US and China, confirmed during the Munich conference that they do not want to enter a new Cold War, however, the new warnings launched by US officials ” portend the worst of the old Cold War.”The newspaper said, “There is no doubt that China’s entry into the war in this way would transform the nature of the conflict into a historic conflict involving all three major superpowers in the world and their partners from the opposing parties: Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea will ally against the United States and Ukraine and their European allies and partners.” and Asians, including Japan and South Korea.The comments by US officials mark another chapter in the intelligence disclosure strategy, which previously included information about Russia’s attempt to obtain aid from China.US officials say China deepened its ties with Russia during the war. Last Thursday, on the eve of the security conference, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, “China is ready to work with Russia to enhance our comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.”Wang Yi flew to Moscow on Monday at the end of a diplomatic tour of Europe, a trip closely watched by US officials.Russian officials said Monday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Moscow later this year. The comment came on the same day that US President Joe Biden visited Kyiv.China has supported Russia diplomatically throughout the war, and its Foreign Ministry has officially pushed anti-US and anti-Ukraine conspiracy theories.In January, the United States imposed sanctions on a Chinese company for providing satellite imagery to the Kremlin-aligned Wagner Group. US officials said it also sanctioned Chinese companies for violating export restrictions against Russia.The Wall Street Journal reported that the Russian military is still able to obtain Chinese-made commercial drones for use in the war.The Washington Post says that although the two countries remain strong trading partners, relations are at one of their lowest levels in decades, exacerbated by the Chinese spy balloon crisis.US officials are skeptical about the idea of ​​Xi delivering a “peace speech” in the coming days, Chinese officials said. American officials believe that Beijing is trying to make it appear that China is a neutral mediator seeking a peace deal, when in fact it is moving toward providing military assistance to Russia.Barry Pavel, of the Washington-based Atlantic Council, said in a publication that the news that Xi is preparing a peace speech is “extremely disturbing” because it will ultimately be aimed at supporting him militarily.",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816977,Group urges radiation tests for 900 North Korean escapees,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Human rights advocates on Tuesday urged South Korea to offer radiation exposure tests to hundreds of North Korean escapees who had lived near the country’s nuclear testing ground. 

            Tests conducted by the South Korean government on 40 people in 2017 and 2018 found at least nine of them had abnormalities that could indicate high radiation exposure, but Seoul's Unification Ministry said a conclusive link to North Korea's nuclear activity couldn't be established and other factors were possible, such as age, smoking habits or other types of chemical exposure. 

            The South Korean radiation tests were subsequently discontinued. 











            The Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group cited the findings and its own analysis of geographic and census data to say that North Korea's six nuclear detonations could have spread radioactive materials by water within 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) of the Punggye-ri nuclear facility. It said more than a million people live in the area dependent on groundwater and wells since piped water is scarce beyond the capital, Pyongyang and a few other cities. 

            North Korea has rejected safety concerns surrounding its nuclear tests, saying the testing environment each time was fully controlled and that it detected no radioactive leaks. It allowed foreign journalists to film the detonation of some tunnels at the site in 2018 but has never allowed international nuclear inspectors to visit the Punggye-ri testing ground.

            Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles affairs with the North, said in a statement that it would consider resuming the tests if the North Korean escapees have health problems or request examinations.

            The advocacy group said South Korean records show nearly 900 people from the region around the Punggye-ri site have escaped to South Korea since the North's first nuclear test in 2006. It said resuming radiation testing for them was crucial considering the lack of access to North Korea's nuclear facility.

            “North Korean escapees who display symptoms of radiation exposure must given accurate information and appropriate medical treatment,” said Ethan Hee-Seok Shin, a legal expert with the group. He also urged an independent investigation in North Korea based on the test results.

            The advocacy group also urged South Korea, Japan and China to investigate the contamination risks of North Korean agricultural and seafood products. It said the area around the nuclear testing site is a food-producing region with abundant rainfall and a network of streams that lead to the sea.

            South Korea and Japan have imposed bans for many years, but the products are often smuggled and disguised as Chinese.

            In 2015, Seoul's Food and Drug Safety Ministry found high levels of radioactive cesium isotopes in North Korea-produced dried hedgehog mushrooms that were being sold as Chinese products.

            Observers have said North Korea may be making preparations at the Punggye-ri site to conduct its seventh nuclear test and the first since September 2017.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Human rights advocates on Tuesday urged South Korea to offer radiation exposure tests to hundreds of North Korean escapees who had lived near the country’s nuclear testing ground.Tests conducted by the South Korean government on 40 people in 2017 and 2018 found at least nine of them had abnormalities that could indicate high radiation exposure, but Seoul's Unification Ministry said a conclusive link to North Korea's nuclear activity couldn't be established and other factors were possible, such as age, smoking habits or other types of chemical exposure.The South Korean radiation tests were subsequently discontinued.The Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group cited the findings and its own analysis of geographic and census data to say that North Korea's six nuclear detonations could have spread radioactive materials by water within 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) of the Punggye-ri nuclear facility.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816978,"In unlikely wartime role, Zelenskyy gives Ukrainians hope","WASHINGTON (AP) — A year ago, with Russian forces bearing down on Ukraine’s capital, Western leaders feared for the life of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and advised him to flee. The U.S. offered him an escape route. 

            Instead, he filmed a defiant video of himself on a darkened street outside the presidential offices with his four closest aides arrayed behind him. “We are all here,” Zelenskyy said in a declaration of their determination to stay in Kyiv and defend Ukraine’s independence. 

            It was powerful political theater. From the first days of the war, when few expected Ukraine’s army to hold up against a Russian onslaught, Zelenskyy has inspired Ukrainians to fight. He has given them hope. 











            Night after night, he has addressed the nation in a video posted on social media. His actor-trained voice can be soothing or forceful, rising in moral outrage as he condemns the most recent Russian atrocities and insists that those responsible will be punished. 

            He speaks of the anger and pain from the devastation of the country and the untold deaths. He vows that Ukraine will one day be made whole. He never tires of thanking all those on the front lines. Through all the horrors of the war, Zelenskyy has instilled a belief that Ukraine can prevail.

            Zelenskyy was just 41 when he was elected president in 2019, largely on the promise that he would be the kind of corruption-fighting president he had played so well in a popular television show. In those first years, he struggled to convince Ukrainians he was up to the job and his approval ratings slumped.

            War can take leaders and make them heroes or fools. Moscow's struggles in Ukraine have done nothing to elevate Russian President Vladimir Putin in the eyes of the world. But it was as a wartime leader that Zelenskyy found his moment. Many now compare him to Winston Churchill, the British prime minister who famously led his country in World War II as it came under attack from Nazi Germany.

            “He’s been extraordinarily good at channeling a kind of larger national spirit,” Fiona Hill, a Russia scholar at the Brookings Institution who served in the past three U.S. administrations, said in an interview with The Associated Press. She credits, in part, Zelenskyy’s training as an actor. “Sometimes, it’s literally when we say this is the role of a lifetime, there is that performative element of it.”

            Hill notes that Churchill “wasn’t this great a leader in peacetime as he was in the war, and he himself was a performer and he enjoyed amateur theatricals and also knew that he was playing a role.”

            As a wartime leader, Zelenskyy almost immediately began to dress the part, shedding his trim suits for an entire wardrobe of army green. His boyish face grew a dark beard. He seemed to age overnight. 

            Before the invasion, he looked much like the affable young history teacher from his TV show, “Servant of the People,” about a man who was improbably elected president after a student surreptitiously filmed his profanity-filled rant against government corruption. The comedy show, which ran from 2015 until the real election in spring 2019, was hugely popular. 

            Michael Kimmage, who worked on Russia and Ukraine policy at the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration, traces some of Zelenskyy’s success in uniting the country back to the 2019 election, which he won with 70% of the vote and without the kind of East-West division seen in previous elections. 

            But Kimmage says Zelenskyy’s “quasi-Churchillian characteristics” came as a surprise.

            “He’s a former entertainer and comedian, so you don’t sort of naturally put him into that military role. But it just fit,” he said. “I don’t know where that came from. It’s obviously enormously consequential for the war itself, but not a quality that I saw in Zelenskyy before the war.”

            While uniting his own country, Zelenskyy also has been highly effective in getting the world to stand with the Ukrainians and provide the steady flow of money and military supplies that have kept them in the fight. After dozens of speeches by video link, Zelenskyy traveled out of the country in December for the first time since the war began to meet U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House and address Congress. He followed that up with visits this month to London, Paris and Brussels. 

            At the Munich Security Conference last week, Zelenskyy was relentless in imploring allies to keep standing firm with Ukraine and not to waste a minute doing so. Russia is the Goliath, he said; Ukraine is David with the sling.

            “There is no alternative to speed,"" he said, “because it's speed that life depends on.”

            In pleading for ever more powerful weapons, he has steadily worn down resistance. He has been rewarded recently with promises of the longer-range missiles, advanced air defense systems and modern battle tanks that will help his army try to win back territory as the war enters its second year.

            Despite Zelenskyy’s obvious star power, his adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, one of the four men standing behind him in the video at the start of the war, qualifies his praise.

            “You put me in a bit of an awkward positions, because on the one hand, of course, I see a president who is in his place at this time,"" Podolyak told the AP. “It’s very cool. He has an iron core, an iron will, a fantastic willingness to take responsibility, courage and so on.”

            But, Podolyak said, the war has shown that Ukraine has many people with the same iron will: “That is, this country cannot be broken because many people will always be against being broken, and who will never kneel down, who will always be ready to take some responsibility.”

            Hill also made the point that Zelenskyy isn't the only one who has stepped up during the war. Unlike for Russia, where the war is being driven from the top down, for Ukraine it's an existential fight.

            “Really, I think every Ukrainian, for the most part, has been stepping up as well,” she said. “You think about all the people who have gone to the front, all the people who have basically had to face up to this every single day. This is a national effort.” 

            Before taking office in 2019, Zelenskyy traveled to his hometown of Kryvyi Rih to visit the grave of his grandfather, a Red Army officer who fought the Nazis in World War II. A family friend, Oleksandr Krizhov, a 73-year-old dentist, told the AP that he asked Zelenskyy’s father, a university professor, why he had done it.

            Said Krizhov: “It was a vow to his grandfather: ‘You won’t be ashamed of me.'""

Temple patrons spotted the snake and contacted a veterinary clinic specializing in the rescue of wildlife.Beauty snakes are non-venomous, though they imitate venomous varieties by inflating their neck and widely opening their mouth. They frequently act viciously and aggressively when handled, very quick to strike and bite.Veterinarians care for an injured beauty snake. (Wild One photo)After being injured, the beauty snake sought refuge in Taitung County’s Chishang Township Fude Temple. In Taiwan, the beauty snake is listed as a Class-3, conservation-deserving wildlife.The snake measured more than one meter in length. After being contacted by the public, Wild One Taiwan rushed to the scene and found the snake’s mouth damaged with multiple other injuries.The snake was soon brought back to the veterinary hospital where wounds were treated and it was given the nickname, Land God. To facilitate wound debridement and injury examination, a veterinarian anesthetized and intubated the distressed snake.During examination, it was found that the snake had multiple fractures in the upper and lower jaws, a vertebral fracture, and multiple cuts and ulcerations. Because of the fractures, the snake’s mouth could not close completely.Veterinarian Liao Chao-sheng (廖朝聖) said wild snakes are usually too nervous to eat when being treated in clinics. In addition to medication, the snake was given the chance to rest until its bones healed naturally. The snake also shed skin, and after 16 days in the hospital, an evaluation revealed it could be released into the wild.Taitung temple where a beauty snake was discovered. (Chishang Fude Temple Facebook photo)Liao said that 27 snakes have been treated at this veterinary clinic in the past two years, including snakes snared by glue traps, run over by cars, or bitten by dogs. Of this number, most have perished before or after care, though nine have been rescued and eventually released into the wild.Liao reminded the public that snakes are not scary and do not pose a threat to humans. He said the best way to avoid unexpected snake encounters is to keep homes clean and free from clutter, eliminating spaces for snakes to hide.",2023/2/21,1201,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4816983,Taiwan to upgrade 1st of 6 Kang Ding frigates later this month,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The first of Taiwan’s fleet of six Kang Ding-class frigates is set to undergo upgrades to its combat systems at the end of February, the Ministry of Defense (MND) announced.

            Upgrades for the ship, Si Ning, are expected to be completed by 2025. The MND inked the modernization deal for all nine ships with DCI-DESCO in April 2020 for a total of NT$43 billion (US$1.4 billion), Liberty Times reported.

            DCI-DESCO is a subsidiary of DCI Group, which is an affiliate company of the French Ministry for the Armed Forces responsible for the transfer of technology to France's partner countries.

            The French-built frigates have been in service in the Taiwan Navy for 26 years. The upgrades will replace all the aging combat systems, radars, and anti-aircraft missiles with modern ones.











            Evaluation and verification of Si Ning's new systems will take three years, per Liberty Times. Once the process is done, the five other ships will undergo upgrades.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817023,MAC blasts Wang Yi's claim Taiwan is part of China,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on Sunday (Feb. 19) refuted claims by Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi (王毅) that Taiwan is part of China.During the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, Wang was asked by the media to ""reassure the audience"" that a military escalation over Taiwan was not imminent. Instead of reassuring the audience, Wang ""assured the audience that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory,"" reported DW.He went on to claim that Taiwan has never been a country and it ""will not be a country in the future."" The foreign minister claimed that Taiwan's alleged status as China's territory is the ""status quo"" which Beijing does not wish to change.Wang blamed ""Taiwan separatist forces"" for wanting to change Beijing's perceived status quo. He claimed that such purported forces threaten to ""undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.""That same day, the MAC issued a statement in response relaying its stern protest to Wang's remarks. First, it pointed out that the status quo in the Taiwan Strait consists of two sides that are ""not affiliated with each other."" It argued that the ""one China principle"" is an attempt by Beijing to ""belittle Taiwan and distort the facts.""The MAC asserted that this attempt to mislead other countries' political views on Taiwan has never been recognized by the international community. It stressed that ""The Republic of China is a sovereign country, and Taiwan has never been part of the People's Republic of China, nor will it be in the future.""Secondly, the MAC pointed out that the purpose of the Munich Security Conference is to maintain peace and prevent the risk of conflict through dialogue. It observed that as the first anniversary of the world's condemnation of Russia's war against Ukraine nears, the attention of all countries toward maintaining Taiwan's security and its will to defend its sovereignty and democracy have increased.It accused Beijing of ""lacking the moral courage to condemn Russia's aggression."" Instead, the MAC stated accused China of regarding the global ""consensus"" against authoritarian aggression and expansion as a ""double standard.""This will only deepen doubts and opposition from the international community, stated the council. It closed by once again calling on the Chinese Communist Party authorities to ""adjust their coercive thinking towards Taiwan, maintain regional security responsibly, and improve cross-strait relations in a pragmatic and rational way.""",2023/2/21,1573,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817040,Most Taiwanese aged 50 to 64 think they need NT$8.37 million for retirement: Survey,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The results of a survey of about 700 people aged 50 to 64 regarding retirement planning show that respondents on average believe they need to have NT$8.37 million (US$276,210) in retirement savings.The survey, which was recently conducted by the Hondao Senior Citizen’s Welfare Foundation, found that 84% of near and recent retirees believe they do not have enough retirement savings and are worried about long-term care expenses, medical expenses, and unexpected expenses they may face in the future, CNA reported.Nearly 80% think that they need to have more than NT$5 million in retirement savings, while 30% think that they need to have at least NT$10 million. The data on ideal savings for retirement collected from the respondents average out to NT$8.37 million, according to the survey.Lin Po-hua (林博樺), deputy chief executive officer of the Hondao Senior Citizen’s Welfare Foundation, said that based on data from the Bureau of Labor Insurance, each retired worker received an average monthly labor pension of NT$18,209 in November last year.The survey also showed that individuals aged 50 to 64 are most worried about long-term care expenses (74.7%), followed by medical expenses (68.4%), and unexpected expenses (49.8%).Hsu Ching-hsin (許靜心), a 64-year-old who retired as an early childhood educator at the age of 55, said that the retirement savings she prepared were less than NT$1 million, which was far from what she thought would be enough, NT$10 million. Fortunately, she later started to receive the national pension and then the labor insurance pension, and she tried to control her expenses as much as possible. Although she is not worried about daily expenses, she said medical expenses arising from accidents and long-term care expenses would be big challenges for her down the road.The survey was conducted online from November to December, and obtained 697 qualified responses, per CNA.",2023/2/21,2234,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817052,"Taiwan AI, health, comms experts create dementia detection app","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwanese psychiatric and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have collaborated to create an app that helps detect the early signs of dementia, according to CNA.The app uses AI technology and machine learning to detect mild cognitive impairment, and important early warning signs indicating possible dementia onset. Taiwan’s rapidly aging population means demand for healthcare and cost-effective diagnostic devices is growing fast.The app was spearheaded by Yuan Ze University’s Department of Electrical Engineering and AI Research Center Professor Chao Yao-keng (趙燿庚), in collaboration with U.S. firm Qualcomm’s Taiwan R&D Program, and psychiatrists at Far Eastern Memorial Hospital in New Taipei.Zhao said that the deterioration of the brain caused by dementia is irreversible, the cost of care is high, and current testing methods often overlook early onset symptoms. He said that the app is cheap, fast, and simple to use, and that these features make it important for identifying the disease early and reducing the damage it causes.The research team used over 1,500 input video clips to train the AI model, with each video ranging from five to 30 minutes. Zhao said that the process of training the model to capture indicators of dementia onset (e.g. facial features, eye, and lip movement) is very resource intensive, and that this was one of the main difficulties encountered when developing the app.Despite this, Zhao said that the app had an accuracy of 80%. In the future it is planned that the app will be developed for automatic detection, or as an auxiliary tool for self-diagnosis before medical professionals are involved.Researchers say that mild cognitive impairment is considered a transitional stage between a healthy brain and a state of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s Disease. About 50% of mild cognitive impairment sufferers will deteriorate to a state of dementia within five years, according to research.",2023/2/22,284,Society

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817064,"New quake brings fresh losses to residents of Turkey, Syria","ISTANBUL (AP) — Survivors of the earthquake that jolted Turkey and Syria 15 days ago, killing tens of thousands of people and leaving hundreds of thousands of others homeless, dealt with more trauma and loss Tuesday after another deadly quake and aftershocks rocked the region. 

            
                The 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck Monday evening had its epicenter in the Defne district of Turkey's Hatay province, which was of the area's worst affected by the Feb. 6 magnitude 7.8 quake that killed nearly 46,000 people in the two countries. 

            Turkey’s disaster management authority, AFAD, said the new quake killed six people and injured 294 others, including 18 who were in critical condition. In Syria, a woman and a girl died as a result of panic during the earthquake in the provinces of Hama and Tartus, pro-government media said.











            Monday’s quake was felt in Jordan, Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon and Egypt. A magnitude 5.8 quake followed, along with dozens of aftershocks. The White Helmets, northwest Syria’s civil defense organization, said about 190 people suffered injuries in rebel-held areas and that several flimsy buildings collapsed but there were no reports of anyone trapped under the debris. 

            In Turkey, teacher Zuher Capar, 42, said he was mourning the loss of relatives in the original earthquake and having a meal with his aunt and uncle near the Hatay town of Samandag when they felt Monday's temblor.

            “It shook a little, then it grew strong,"" he said. ""The electricity went and there were screams everywhere. There were small children in the house. They were screaming, my aunt was crying.”

            On Feb. 6, Capar rushed to try to help his cousin, the cousin's wife and the couple's small children out of the rubble of their collapsed home, but they did not survive.

            “We had barely overcome the sadness (from the first earthquake),” he said.

            While his large family's home withstood the quake earlier in the month, it was damaged on Monday. Capar said they are too frightened to sleep there and plan to stay in a large tent and cars.

            “We are trying to stay strong but it is a terrifying process. The cities we knew, the memories we had, have been destroyed,"" he said. “When we go in the streets, there is only rubble and heavy machinery. It’s like a horror movie scene.”

            Turkish officials warned residents not to go into the remains of their homes, but people have done so to retrieve what they can. Three of the people killed Monday were inside a damaged four-story building when the new quake hit.

            Aftershocks and the instability of the structure complicated the rescue effort, and it took several hours for search crews to find the bodies, Turkish news agency DHA said.

            Dr. Tahsin Cinar, an anesthesiologist using vacation time to help provide medical care in Hatay as a representative of the Turkish Medical Association, said earthquake survivors need serious help with their mental health.

            “They feel so alone, so deserted and very anxious. Even a small tremor leads to a big anxious reaction,” he said.

            Cinar and other volunteers initially provided emergency care for people with physical injuries. Now, they are seeing more signs of psychological trauma, depression and the stress that comes with a lack of safe housing, winter weather and a pause in education.

            “There is nearly nothing to create social well-being,” he said.

            The U.N.’s World Food Program said Monday's quake frightened employees who were distributing food to hundreds of thousands of people in northwest Syria and Turkey. The employees are sleeping in their cars in freezing temperatures while still trying to do their jobs, the program said.

            Kamal Abuhassan’s small house in Jinderis, Syria, was damaged in the the first earthquake, but after a few days, he and his family returned. They ran out when Monday’s quake hit; the dwelling is now partially collapsed into piles of rubble.

            “Our house is ruined, but at least our kids are OK,“ Abuhassan said.

            He has set up a tent just outside the house, too afraid to go back inside. 

            “We just don’t know when the next earthquake is going to happen. Where else are we supposed to go other than tents?” he said.

            Some 13.5 million people live in Turkey's 11 quake-hit provinces, where authorities said more than 139,000 buildings were either destroyed or so severely damaged that they need to be torn down. 

            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 865,000 people were living in tents as of Tuesday. Some 270 tent cities have been set up in the affected provinces, and winter weather added to the suffering of displaced citizens. 

            Umit Ozalp, who has lived for 40 years in Antakya, a historic city that’s now devastated, was preparing to leave, joining others carrying just a few small bags at a bus station.

            “We have nothing left. Our home, our homeland, our children. We lost our work. Our situation is painful,” Ozalp told the IHA news agency. 

            Kenan Caglar, a bus company employee, said the company was transporting at least 2,000 passengers a day, most bound for Istanbul or the Mediterranean cities of Antalya and Mersin.

            The majority of deaths in the massive Feb. 6 quake, which was followed by a magnitude 7.5 temblor nine hours later, were in Turkey, where at least 42,310 people died, according to the disaster management agency. 

            Turkey's defense minister said about 20,000 Syrians living in Turkey had returned to Syria after the quakes. 

            “They are returning to their lands because they lost their homes and their relatives,” Hulusi Akar said from Hatay on Tuesday.

Three of the people killed Monday were inside a damaged four-story building when the new quake hit.Aftershocks and the instability of the structure complicated the rescue effort, and it took several hours for search crews to find the bodies, Turkish news agency DHA said.Dr. Tahsin Cinar, an anesthesiologist using vacation time to help provide medical care in Hatay as a representative of the Turkish Medical Association, said earthquake survivors need serious help with their mental health.“They feel so alone, so deserted and very anxious. Even a small tremor leads to a big anxious reaction,” he said.Cinar and other volunteers initially provided emergency care for people with physical injuries. Now, they are seeing more signs of psychological trauma, depression and the stress that comes with a lack of safe housing, winter weather and a pause in education.“There is nearly nothing to create social well-being,” he said.The U.N.’s World Food Program said Monday's quake frightened employees who were distributing food to hundreds of thousands of people in northwest Syria and Turkey. The employees are sleeping in their cars in freezing temperatures while still trying to do their jobs, the program said.Kamal Abuhassan’s small house in Jinderis, Syria, was damaged in the the first earthquake, but after a few days, he and his family returned. They ran out when Monday’s quake hit; the dwelling is now partially collapsed into piles of rubble.“Our house is ruined, but at least our kids are OK,“ Abuhassan said.He has set up a tent just outside the house, too afraid to go back inside.“We just don’t know when the next earthquake is going to happen. Where else are we supposed to go other than tents?” he said.Some 13.5 million people live in Turkey's 11 quake-hit provinces, where authorities said more than 139,000 buildings were either destroyed or so severely damaged that they need to be torn down.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 865,000 people were living in tents as of Tuesday. Some 270 tent cities have been set up in the affected provinces, and winter weather added to the suffering of displaced citizens.Umit Ozalp, who has lived for 40 years in Antakya, a historic city that’s now devastated, was preparing to leave, joining others carrying just a few small bags at a bus station.“We have nothing left. Our home, our homeland, our children. We lost our work. Our situation is painful,” Ozalp told the IHA news agency.Kenan Caglar, a bus company employee, said the company was transporting at least 2,000 passengers a day, most bound for Istanbul or the Mediterranean cities of Antalya and Mersin.The majority of deaths in the massive Feb. 6 quake, which was followed by a magnitude 7.5 temblor nine hours later, were in Turkey, where at least 42,310 people died, according to the disaster management agency.Turkey's defense minister said about 20,000 Syrians living in Turkey had returned to Syria after the quakes.“They are returning to their lands because they lost their homes and their relatives,” Hulusi Akar said from Hatay on Tuesday.___Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817065,"Putin raises tension on Ukraine, suspends START nuclear pact","Russian President Vladimir Putin suspended Moscow’s participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the United States, announcing the move Tuesday in a bitter speech in which he made clear he would not change his strategy in the war in Ukraine.

            Putin emphasized, however, that Russia isn’t withdrawing from the pact yet, and hours after his address the Foreign Ministry said Moscow would respect the treaty's caps on nuclear weapons. It also said Russia would continue to exchange information about test launches of ballistic missiles per earlier agreements with the United States.

            In his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast his country — and Ukraine — as victims of Western double-dealing and said it was Russia, not Ukraine, fighting for its very existence.











            “We aren’t fighting the Ukrainian people,” Putin said ahead of the war’s first anniversary Friday. “The Ukrainian people have become hostages of the Kyiv regime and its Western masters, which have effectively occupied the country.”

            The speech reiterated a litany of grievances he has frequently offered as justification for the widely condemned military campaign, while vowing no military letup.

            Along with limits on the number of nuclear weapons, the 2010 New START envisages broad inspections of nuclear sites. Putin said Russia should stand ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the U.S. does so, a move that would end a global ban on such tests in place since the Cold War era.

            U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded by calling for Russia and the United States to return to dialogue immediately because “a world without nuclear arms control is a far more dangerous and unstable one.”

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Moscow’s decision to suspend participation in the treaty as “really unfortunate and very irresponsible.""

            “We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does,” he said while visiting Greece.

            China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called on the U.S. and Russia to “continue to negotiate with each other in finding a good solution.”

            U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Poland a day after his surprise visit to Ukraine, did not mention the START suspension but blasted Putin for the invasion. He pledged continued support for Ukraine despite “hard and bitter days ahead.”

            “Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow and forever,” Biden said at Warsaw's landmark Royal Castle before a cheering crowd of Poles and Ukrainian refugees.

            Putin's announcement was the second time in recent days the Ukraine war showed it could spread into perilous new terrain, after Blinken told China over the weekend that it would be a “serious problem” if Beijing provided arms and ammunition to Russia.

            China and Russia have aligned their foreign policies to oppose Washington. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, while strongly criticizing Western economic sanctions on Moscow. Late last year, Russia and China held joint naval drills.

            The deputy head of Ukraine’s intelligence service, Vadym Skibitskyi, told The Associated Press his agency hasn’t seen any signs so far that China is providing weapons to Moscow.

            Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and made a dash toward Kyiv, apparently expecting to overrun the capital quickly. But stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces — supported by Western weapons — turned back Moscow's troops. While Ukraine has reclaimed many areas initially seized by Russia, the sides have become bogged down elsewhere.

            The war has revived the divide between Russia and the West, reinvigorated the NATO alliance, and created the biggest threat to Putin's rule of more than two decades. 

            In Tuesday's speech, Putin again offered his own version of recent history, discounting Ukraine's arguments that it needed Western help to thwart a Russian military takeover. He has repeatedly depicted NATO’s expansion to include countries close to Russia as an existential threat to his country.

            “It’s they who have started the war. And we are using force to end it,” he said before an audience of lawmakers, officials and soldiers, and broadcast on all state TV channels.

            Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who was in Ukraine on Tuesday, said she wished Putin had taken a different approach.

            “What we heard this morning was propaganda that we already know,” Meloni said in English. “He says (Russia) worked on diplomacy to avoid the conflict, but the truth is that there is somebody who is the invader and somebody who is defending itself.”

            Also meeting with Zelenskyy was the newly appointed chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, who led a delegation for the first time since the start of the war and since Republicans won control of the House of Representatives. 

            Chairman Mike McCaul and a handful of other GOP lawmakers said they had a productive meeting about what Zelenskyy needs for winning the war. He provided them with a list of weapons, including longer-range artillery and air-to-surface systems.

            The meeting comes as some hard-right Republicans are vowing to block future U.S. aid to Ukraine. “We have seen time and again the majority of Republicans and Democrats support our assistance to Ukraine,” McCaul said in a statement. “But the Biden administration needs to lay out their long-term strategy.”

            Putin denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine, even after Kremlin forces struck civilian targets, including hospitals, and are widely accused of war crimes.

            Zelenskyy cited fresh attacks on Ukrainian civilians Tuesday, and downplayed Putin’s speech. 

            “I have not watched it, because during this time there were missile strikes on Kherson. Twenty-one people were wounded and six were killed,” he said.

            Putin also accused the West of taking aim at Russian culture, religion and values. He fired another broadside at Western gender policies that he described as efforts to destroy “traditional” values.

            And he said Western sanctions hadn’t “achieved anything and will not achieve anything.” He blasted Russian tycoons who kept their assets in the West and saw them confiscated or frozen as part of the sanctions. 

            “Believe me, ordinary people had no sympathy for those who lost their yachts, palaces and other assets abroad,” Putin said.

            While Russia’s Constitution mandates that the president deliver the state-of-the-nation speech annually, Putin never gave one in 2022. Last year, the Kremlin also canceled two other big annual events — Putin’s news conference and a highly scripted phone-in marathon taking questions from the public.

            Reflecting the Kremlin's clampdown on free speech and press, it barred in-person coverage of the address by media from “unfriendly” countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and those in the European Union.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817066,"Fears, questions about N. Korea's growing nuclear arsenal","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's latest missile launches are a demonstration of the country's avowed ability to use nuclear force against South Korea and the mainland U.S. How immediate is that threat?

            North Korea claims its nuclear forces are capable of destroying its rivals, and often follows its provocative weapons tests with launch details. But many foreign experts call the North’s claims propaganda and suggest that the country is not yet capable of hitting the United States or its allies with a nuclear weapon.

            There’s no question that North Korea has nuclear bombs, and that it has missiles that place the U.S. mainland, South Korea and Japan within striking distance. What’s not yet clear is whether the country has mastered the tricky engineering required to join the bombs and the missiles.











            ___

            ICBMs

            North Korea has demonstrated that it has missiles that could fly far enough to reach deep into the continental U.S., but it's not clear whether they can survive reentering the Earth's atmosphere on arrival.

            North Korea said it launched a Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile on Saturday to verify the weapon’s reliability and the combat readiness of the country’s nuclear forces. It’s one of three kinds of ICBMs the country has developed, along with the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-17. All three are liquid-fueled, and North Korea has portrayed them all as nuclear-capable.

            Launched almost straight up to avoid the territories of neighbors, the weapon reached a maximum altitude of about 5,770 kilometers (3,585 miles) and flew 990 kilometers (615 miles), according to North Korean state media. The reported flight details suggest the missile could travel 13,000 kilometers (8,080 miles) or beyond if launched on a normal trajectory.

            “These days, North Korea has been disclosing information about its launches in a very detailed manner to try to let others believe what they’ve done is genuine,” analyst Shin Jong-woo at South Korea’s Defense and Security Forum said. “But I think that’s part of their propaganda.”

            There are questions on whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric reentry.

            A South Korean biennial defense document released last week said it’s not clear whether the missiles can survive reentry, because all of North Korea’s ICBM tests have so far been made on high angles.

            Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said a normal trajectory would cause greater stress, as a warhead would spend a longer time passing through altitudes with high air density. 

            North Korean state media said the launch was made “suddenly” after a surprise order from leader Kim Jong Un. 

            “The Kim regime’s claims of short-notice launches are thus intended to demonstrate not only the development of strategic and tactical nuclear forces but also the operational capability to use them,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said.

            In a military parade earlier this month, North Korea showcased around a dozen ICBMs, an unprecedented number that suggested progress in its efforts to mass-produce powerful weapons.

            Among them were huge canister-sealed missiles that experts say were likely a version of a solid-fuel ICBM that North Korea has been trying to develop in recent years. Solid-fueled systems allow missiles to be mobile on the ground and make them faster to launch.

            ___

            WARHEADS

            North Korea likely has dozens of nuclear warheads. The question is whether they are small enough to fit on a missile.

            North Korea has so far performed six underground nuclear test explosions to manufacture warheads that it can place on missiles. Outside estimates of the number of North Korean nuclear warheads vary widely, ranging from 20-60 to up to about 115. 

            In a 2021 interview with 38 North, a North Korea-focused website, renowned nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker, who has visited North Korea’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex numerous times, said that “20 to 60 is possible, with the most likely number being 45.” 

            Some experts argue that North Korea has likely already built miniaturized nuclear warheads to be mounted on missiles, citing the number of years the country has spent on its nuclear and missile programs. But others say North Korea is still years away from producing such warheads.

            “After its sixth nuclear test, people accepted that North Korea really will have nuclear weapons. But they are still debating whether it has warhead miniaturization technology,” Shin, the analyst, said. 

            The North described its sixth nuclear test in 2017 as a detonation of a thermonuclear bomb built for ICBMs. It created a tremor that measured magnitude 6.3, and some studies put its estimated explosive yield at about 50 to 140 kilotons of TNT. In comparison, the pair of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II — which killed a total of more than 210,000 people — yielded explosions equivalent to about 15 and 20 kilotons of TNT, respectively. 

            The biennial South Korean defense document said North Korea is estimated to have 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium. Some observers say that's enough for about 9-18 bombs. The document estimated that North Korea has “a considerable amount of” highly enriched uranium as well. 

            North Korea’s Yongbyon complex has facilities to produce both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the two main ingredients to build nuclear weapons. 

            Plutonium plants are generally large and generate a lot of heat, making them easier to detect. But a uranium enrichment plant is more compact and can be easily hidden from satellite cameras. North Korea is believed to be running at least one additional covert uranium enrichment facility, in addition to one at its Yongbyon complex.

            ___

            SHORT-RANGE WEAPONS

            Following the collapse of diplomacy with then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, Kim sped up the development of short-range solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missiles designed to strike key targets in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there.

            The so-called “tactical” nuclear weapons include what North Korea calls “super-large” 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that it tested Monday. South Korea describes the weapon as a short-range missile system. 

            North Korean state media said its new artillery system can carry nuclear warheads, and that four rockets would be enough to wipe out an enemy airfield. The statement drew quick outside doubts about whether the weapons are indeed nuclear-capable.

            “The North Korean claim doesn’t make sense to some extent. ... Why do they need four tactical nuclear weapons to destroy just one airfield?” Shin, the analyst, said. “Also, which country would disclose such attack scenarios via state media?”

            Other new North Korean short-range systems include missiles that were apparently modeled after the Russian Iskander mobile ballistic system or outwardly resemble the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System. Launched from land vehicles, these missiles are designed to be maneuverable and fly at low altitudes, theoretically giving them a better chance of defeating South Korean and U.S. missile defense systems.

            Whether North Korea has an ability to arm short-range missiles with nuclear warheads has not been independently confirmed.

            While North Korea may be able to place simple nuclear warheads on some of its older missiles, including Scuds or Rodong missiles, it would likely require further technology advancements and nuclear tests to build smaller and more advanced warheads that can be installed on its newer tactical systems, said Lee, the expert.

            North Korea also has an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable Hwasong-12 missile capable of reaching Guam, a major U.S. military hub in the Pacific. It has been developing a family of mid-range, solid-fuel Pukguksong missiles which are designed to be fired from submarines or land vehicles.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's latest missile launches are a demonstration of the country's avowed ability to use nuclear force against South Korea and the mainland U.S. How immediate is that threat?North Korea claims its nuclear forces are capable of destroying its rivals, and often follows its provocative weapons tests with launch details.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817095,Australian spy boss details unprecedented espionage danger,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia faces an unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference with more Australians being targeted by agents than ever before, the head of the nation’s main domestic spy agency said on Tuesday.

            Multiple nations were using espionage and foreign interference to advance their interests and undermine Australia’s, Mike Burgess, secretary-general of security at the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, said in his 21-page assessment speech. 

            “They are using espionage to covertly understand Australia’s politics and decision-making, our alliances and partnerships, and our economic and policy priorities,” Burgess said. 











            “Based on what ASIO is seeing, more Australians are being targeted for espionage and foreign interference than at any time in Australia’s history – more hostile foreign intelligence services, more spies, more targeting, more harm, more ASIO investigations, more ASIO disruptions.” 

            He added, “From where I sit, it feels like hand-to-hand combat.”

            His comments were released to the media before the speech at ASIO headquarters in the Australian capital Canberra.

            He said his agency had noticed an uptick in online targeting of people working in Australia’s defense industry since September 2021, when U.S. President Joe Biden, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a three-way agreement known as AUKUS to provide Australia with a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.

            “As we progress AUKUS, it’s critical our allies know we can keep our secrets and keep their secrets,” Burgess said.

            
                Australians being targeted by foreign governments include judges, media commentators and journalists, Burgess said, adding that a small number of “judicial figures” has been subjected to “suspicious approaches.” 

            Spies were seeking to use litigation as an “intelligence collection toll,” Burgess said.

            ASIO had uncovered and stopped a plot to potentially recruit Australian journalists through all-expenses paid “study tours” of a foreign country. The agency also had been tracking for several years former Australian military personnel who were willing to sell their training and expertise to foreign governments, Burgess said.

            Australian, British and Canadian defense officials have voiced concerns in recent months that China is attempting to poach military expertise such as fighter jet pilots. The United States is attempting to extradite from Sydney former U.S. pilot Daniel Duggan on an indictment that he conspired with others to provide training to Chinese pilots in 2010 and 2012.

            “Third party companies have offered Australians hundreds of thousands of dollars and other significant perks to help authoritarian regimes improve their combat skills,” Burgess said. 

            He said that in some cases, authorities have been able to stop the former insiders travelling overseas to provide the training, but in others, legal ambiguities have impeded law enforcement’s ability to intervene.

            ASIO last year downgraded Australia’s terrorism threat level from “probable” to “possible” for the first time since 2014.

            ASIO assesses that Australia remains a potential terrorist target, but there were fewer extremists with the intention to conduct an attack in Australia than there were when the threat level of raised in 2014, Burgess said.CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia faces an unprecedented threat of espionage and foreign interference with more Australians being targeted by agents than ever before, the head of the nation’s main domestic spy agency said on Tuesday.Multiple nations were using espionage and foreign interference to advance their interests and undermine Australia’s, Mike Burgess, secretary-general of security at the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, said in his 21-page assessment speech.“They are using espionage to covertly understand Australia’s politics and decision-making, our alliances and partnerships, and our economic and policy priorities,” Burgess said.“Based on what ASIO is seeing, more Australians are being targeted for espionage and foreign interference than at any time in Australia’s history – more hostile foreign intelligence services, more spies, more targeting, more harm, more ASIO investigations, more ASIO disruptions.”He added, “From where I sit, it feels like hand-to-hand combat.”His comments were released to the media before the speech at ASIO headquarters in the Australian capital Canberra.He said his agency had noticed an uptick in online targeting of people working in Australia’s defense industry since September 2021, when U.S. President Joe Biden, then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a three-way agreement known as AUKUS to provide Australia with a fleet of submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.“As we progress AUKUS, it’s critical our allies know we can keep our secrets and keep their secrets,” Burgess said.Australians being targeted by foreign governments include judges, media commentators and journalists, Burgess said, adding that a small number of “judicial figures” has been subjected to “suspicious approaches.”Spies were seeking to use litigation as an “intelligence collection toll,” Burgess said.ASIO had uncovered and stopped a plot to potentially recruit Australian journalists through all-expenses paid “study tours” of a foreign country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817096,Ruins of Turkish city of Antakya tell story of a rich past,"ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — For nearly two weeks, Mehmet Ismet has lived in the ruins of Antakya’s most beloved historic mosque, a landmark in a now-devastated city that was famed for thousands of years as a meeting place of civilizations and revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews.

            The 74-year-old took refuge in the Habib Najjar mosque after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed tens of thousands in Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6. He has slept and prayed under the few arches still standing, mourning the future of a city renowned for its past. 

            The destruction in Antakya was nearly total. Much of the city is rubble. What’s still standing is too unsafe to live in. Almost everyone has left. On Monday, a new 6.4 magnitude earthquake, centered in Hatay province where Antakya is located, struck again, killing people, injuring more than 200 and causing more buildings to collapse, in some cases trapping people.











            “It can be rebuilt. But it will not be like the old one,” said Ismet, pointing to the destruction of the mosque, where he sat in the courtyard with a friend by a wood-burning heater. “The old is gone. Only the name remains.”

            Antakya, known as Antioch in ancient times, has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and rebuilt over history. But residents fear it will be a long time before it recovers from this one, and that its unique historical identity may never be fully restored. The destruction is so great, and they say the government cares little for this area. 

            Antioch, built in 300 B.C. by a general of Alexander the Great in the Orontes River valley, was one of the biggest cities of the Greco-Roman world, rivaling Alexandria and Constantinople. Saints Peter and Paul are said to have founded one of the oldest Christian communities here, and it’s here that the word “Christian” first came into use. It later drew Muslim and Christian Crusader invaders. 

            The melding of faiths is part of the city’s character. 

            A parable from the Quran kept running through Ismet’s mind. Three messengers from God came to a town, urging its sinful people to follow His word. They refused, and God destroyed the city with a mighty blast. The Quran doesn’t name the town, but many traditions say it was ancient Antioch. 

            Ismet saw a new lesson from the present-day devastation.

            “All religions are here. We were living well. Then politics and hypocrisy prevailed, and disagreement followed,” Ismet said. “People... have disagreed and are robbing each other. God is punishing them.” 

            The mosque can now be reached only by clambering over heaps of concrete and old stones that were once Antakya’s old city. It traces Antakya’s many histories: The site originally held an ancient pagan temple, then a church, before finally settling as a mosque, built in the 13th century. The mosque was destroyed in an earthquake in 1853 and rebuilt four years later by the Ottomans.

            Even the legends surrounding Habib Najjar, the mosque’s unknown namesake, are intertwined with multiple faiths. 

            Ismet recounted one popular story: Najjar was a resident of Antioch who urged locals to believe God’s messengers referred to in the Quran. They beheaded him, and his head rolled down the mountain to the spot where the mosque now stands. Another version of the legend says Najjar was a believer in Jesus, whose disciples cured his son of leprosy, and was killed for promoting the new Christian faith. 

            Modern Antakya was already a shadow of its ancient self. 

            In recent years, it witnessed steep economic decline and growing emigration to Europe and the Gulf. Tension had been growing between the shrinking local population, which included Christian and Alevi communities, and a growing Syrian population that fled its country’s civil war. 

            Some city residents complain of neglect from a central government busy with helping other provinces where it has a stronger voting base. With little evidence, locals accused Syrian refugees of stealing from stores and the government of downplaying the death toll. Many worry more people could leave if Antakya is not rebuilt quickly.

            In the face of rising criticism from several quake-hit cities, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other officials have recognized delays in the response. No one addressed Antakya’s woes in particular. 

            “Maybe in one month, we will start the renovation or organization,” Yahya Coskun, deputy director general of Turkey’s museums and cultural heritage, said about the destruction to the city’s landmarks. 

            “Antakya’s destruction is a loss to humanity,” said Jan Estefan, a silversmith and one of the city’s few remaining Christians. “We still want to live here. We have no intention of leaving.”

            Antakya’s Greek Orthodox Church was destroyed. The church, which was the seat of the Greek Orthodox patriarch up until the 14th century, was leveled in an 1872 earthquake and rebuilt. 

            “History has once again been wiped out,” said Fadi Hurigil, chairman of the board of directors of Antakya Greek Orthodox Church Foundation. 

            Old mosques were cut off by mountains of rubble. The old bazaar lay in ruins. Crushed buildings line Kurtulus Street, said to have been the world’s first illuminated street when it was lit with torches at night in Roman times. Parts of the archaeological museum have been damaged. 

            Outside the city center, Mount Starius protected one of Christianity’s earliest churches — St. Pierre — which is built in a cave in the mountain and has sections dating to the 4th century. A set of stairs leading to it was damaged. 

            There were cracks in the walls of the Synagogue of Antakya, home to the area’s 2,500-year-old Jewish community. The president of the city’s Jewish community and his wife didn’t survive. About a dozen Jewish residents and the synagogue’s Torah scrolls were temporarily relocated to Istanbul, said Rabbi Mendy Chitrik, chairman of the Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States. 

            Chitrik said it will hard for the small, elderly community, whittled down by years of emigration, to rebuild. “However, I am certain that it will come back.” 

            Many residents seem to have accepted it is their city’s fate to return from disaster. 

            “After seven times, they rebuilt and brought it to life again. Now is the eighth time, and God willing ... we will live in it again,” said Bulent Cifcifli. His mother was killed in the quake, and it took a week to dig her body out.

            In one shape or another, Antakya will survive, he said.

            “Death is unavoidable. We will die and new people will come,” he said, choking on tears. “Who is Antakya? Today it is us. Tomorrow someone else.”ANTAKYA, Turkey (AP) — For nearly two weeks, Mehmet Ismet has lived in the ruins of Antakya’s most beloved historic mosque, a landmark in a now-devastated city that was famed for thousands of years as a meeting place of civilizations and revered by Christians, Muslims and Jews.The 74-year-old took refuge in the Habib Najjar mosque after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed tens of thousands in Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6.

We have to accept that billions of dollars of additional investment is going to be required not just to fix up what has been damaged but to build more resilience so that we can better cope with these types of events in the future,” Hipkins said.The government is making road repair a focus of the recovery effort. Around 250 state highways and local roads remained closed Monday afternoon and crews were repairing 400 kilometers (249 miles) of highway, Hipkins said.",2023/2/21,123,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817108,China says it's seeking role in Ukraine peace settlement,"BEIJING (AP) — The foreign minister of China, which has provided strong political backing for Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, said Tuesday his country wants to play a role in ending the conflict.Qin Gang told participants at a security conference in Beijing that China was concerned the almost yearlong war could escalate further and spin “out of control.”China would continue to urge peace talks and provide “Chinese wisdom” to bring about a political settlement, he said.“At the same time, we urge relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blames to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow,"" Qin said in an apparent reference to military support provided to Ukraine by the United States and its allies, as well as concerns that China is preparing to make good on its threats to use force to assert its claim over Taiwan, a self-governing island democracy.China has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and strongly criticized Western economic sanctions against Moscow. In deference to Moscow, it has yet to describe the conflict as an invasion.China and Russia have aligned their foreign policies to oppose the U.S. and, weeks before the Ukraine invasion, their leaders declared a partnership with “no limits.” China also says Russia was provoked into using military force by NATO's eastward expansion.Despite that, Qin reiterated China's claim that it has “always taken an objective and impartial stance based on the merits of the issue.""“China is deeply worried about the escalation of the situation and even the possibility of it going out of control,"" Qin said. He said Chinese President Xi Jinping had put forward proposals that have “played a responsible and constructive role in easing the situation and de-escalating the crisis,” without offering any details or evidence.“We will continue to promote peace talks, provide Chinese wisdom for the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, and work with the international community to promote dialogue and consultation to address the concerns of all parties and seek common security,"" Qin said.China has opposed criticism of Russia at the United Nations, while insisting that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations be respected, a position that underpins its claim to Taiwan, which separated from the mainland amid civil war more than 70 years ago.Russian President Vladimir Putin could meet with the Chinese Communist Party’s foreign policy chief Wang Yi in Moscow, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov hailed Russia-China ties as “multidimensional and allied in nature.”That statement coincided with U.S. President Joe Biden's unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and show support for Kyiv days ahead of the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.Wang’s trip to Russia follows talks Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich. Blinken said he reiterated to Wang that any Chinese material support for the Russian armed forces would trigger a strong response from Washington. Thus far, the U.S. says there are no indications that China is doing so, although its close economic ties with Russia have offered a lifeline to Putin's regime.Russia, in turn, has offered strong support for China and held a series of joint military drills amid tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan, trade, human rights and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.China's Foreign Ministry issued a lengthy statement Tuesday outlining Xi's “Global Security Initiative,"" which aims to “eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, improve global security governance, encourage joint international efforts to bring more stability and certainty to a volatile and changing era, and promote durable peace and development in the world.""In its only reference to Russia's invasion, it said the initiative would “support political settlement of hotspot issues such as the Ukraine crisis through dialogue and negotiation.""At a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin criticized military aid provided to Ukraine by the U.S. and its allies, saying that “the U.S. claims to maintain peace, but actually it is making money from the crisis.""“There are enough facts to show the true nature of the U.S. as a source of trouble rather than a defender of peace for the world,"" Wang said.The U.S. has committed about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine since last year, while European allies have committed tens of billions of dollars more and welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled the conflict. Such aid is funded by U.S. and other foreign taxpayers, with Ukraine under no obligation to provide repayment as it seeks to withstand renewed Russian attempts to regain territory it had earlier conquered.Wang also defended China's “comprehensive strategic partnership"" with Russia as “based on non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-targeting of third parties, which is within the sovereignty of two independent countries.""Wang gave no details on Wang Yi's visit to Moscow, but called it “an opportunity to work with Russia to jointly promote steady progress of bilateral relations in the direction determined by the two leaders, safeguard each other’s legitimate rights and interests and contribute positively to world peace.""",2023/2/21,154,World

More buildings collapsed, trapping some people, while scores of injuries were recorded in neighboring Syria too.Monday's earthquake was centered in the town of Defne, in Turkey's Hatay province, one the worst-hit regions in the magnitude 7.8 quake that struck on Feb. 6. It was felt in Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Israel and as far away as Egypt, and followed by a second, magnitude 5.8 temblor.Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said three people were killed and 213 injured. Search and rescue efforts were underway in three collapsed buildings where six people were believed trapped.In Hatay, police rescued one person trapped inside a three-story building and were trying to reach three others inside, HaberTurk television reported. It said those trapped included movers helping people shift furniture and other belongings from the building that was damaged in the massive quake.Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported that six people were injured in Aleppo by falling debris. The White Helmets, northwest Syria’s civil defense organization, reported more than 130 injuries, most of them non-life threatening, including fractures and cases of people fainting from fear, while a number of buildings in areas already damaged by the quake collapsed.The Feb. 6 quake killed nearly 45,000 people in both countries — the vast majority of them in Turkey, where more than a million and a half people are in temporary shelters. Turkish authorities have recorded more than 6,000 aftershocks since.HaberTurk journalists reporting from Hatay said they were jolted violently by Monday's quake and held onto to each other to avoid falling.In the Turkish city of Adana, eyewitness Alejandro Malaver said people left homes for the streets, carrying blankets into their cars. Malaver said everyone is really scared and “no one wants to get back into their houses.”Mehmet Salhaoglullari, from a village near Samandag, said he was eating at a restaurant when the building began to shake.“We all threw ourselves outside and we continued to shake outside,” he said.In the Syrian city of Idlib, frightened residents were preparing to sleep in parks and other public places, while fuel lines formed at gas stations as people attempted to get as far as possible from any buildings that might collapse.The Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals in northern Syria, said it had treated a number of patients — including a 7-year-old boy — who suffered heart attacks brought on by fear following the new quake.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Hatay earlier on Monday, and said his government would begin constructing close to 200,000 new homes in the quake-devastated region as early as next month.Erdogan said the new buildings will be no taller than three or four stories, built on firmer ground and to higher standards and in consultation with “geophysics, geotechnical, geology and seismology professors” and other experts.The Turkish leader said destroyed cultural monuments would be rebuilt in accordance with their “historic and cultural texture.”Erdogan said around 1.6 million people are currently being housed in temporary shelters.The Turkish disaster management agency AFAD on Monday raised the number of confirmed fatalities from the Feb. 6 earthquake in Turkey to 41,156. That increased the overall death toll in both Turkey and Syria to 44,844.Search and rescue operations for survivors have been called off in most of the quake zone, but AFAD chief Yunus Sezer said earlier that search teams were continuing their efforts in more than a dozen collapsed buildings — mostly in Hatay province.There were no signs of anyone being alive under the rubble since three members of one family — a mother, father and 12-year-old boy — were extracted from a collapsed building in Hatay on Saturday. The boy later died.Authorities said more than 110,000 buildings across 11 quake-hit Turkish provinces were either destroyed or so severely damaged by the Feb. 6 quake that they need to be torn down.The European Union’s health agency warned Monday of the risk of disease outbreaks in the coming weeks. The Centre for Disease Prevention and Controls said that “food and water-borne diseases, respiratory infections and vaccine-preventable infections are a risk in the upcoming period, with the potential to cause outbreaks, particularly as survivors are moving to temporary shelters.”“A surge of cholera cases in the affected areas is a significant possibility in the coming weeks,” it said, noting that authorities in northwestern Syria have reported thousands of cases of the disease since last September and a planned vaccination campaign was delayed due to the quake.",2023/2/21,152,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817153,"Fears, questions about N. Korea's growing nuclear arsenal","SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea's latest missile launches are a demonstration of the country's avowed ability to use nuclear force against South Korea and the mainland U.S. How immediate is that threat?North Korea claims its nuclear forces area capable of destroying its rivals, and often follows each of its provocative weapons tests with launch details. But many foreign experts call the North's claim propaganda and suggest that the country is not yet capable of hitting the United States or its allies with a nuclear weapon.There's no question that North Korea has nuclear bombs, and that is has missiles that place the U.S. mainland, South Korea and Japan within striking distance. What's not yet clear is whether the country has mastered the tricky engineering required to join the bombs and the missiles.__ICBMsNorth Korea has demonstrated that it has missiles that could fly far enough to reach deep into the continental U.S., but it's not clear whether they can survive re-entering the earth's atmosphere on arrival.North Korea said it had launched a Hwasong-15 inter-continental ballistic missile on Saturday to verify the weapon’s reliability and combat readiness of the country’s nuclear forces. It's one of three kinds of ICBMs the country has developed, along with the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-17. All three are all liquid-fueled, and North Korea has portrayed them all as nuclear-capable.Launched almost straight up to avoid the territories of neighbors, the weapon reached a maximum altitude of about 5,770 kilometers (3,585 miles) and flew 990 kilometers (615 miles), according to North Korea’s state media. The reported flight details suggest the missile could travel 13,000 kilometers (8,080 miles) or beyond if launched on a normal trajectory.“These days, North Korea has been disclosing details about its launches in a very detailed manner to try to let others believe what they’ve done is genuine,” analyst Shin Jong-woo at South Korea’s Defense and Security Forum said. “But I think that’s part of their propaganda.”There are questions on whether North Korea has acquired the technology to shield warheads from the high-temperature, high-stress environment of atmospheric re-entry.A South Korean biennial defense document released last week said that it's not clear whether the missiles can survive re-entry, because all of North Korea’s ICBM tests have so far been made on high angles.Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute, said a normal trajectory would cause greater stress, as a warhead would spend a longer time passing through altitudes of high air density.North Korea’s state media said the launch was made “suddenly” at a surprise order from Kim Jong-Un.“The Kim regime’s claims of short-notice launches are thus intended to demonstrate not only the development of strategic and tactical nuclear forces but also the operational capability to use them,” Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said.In a military parade earlier this month, North Korea showcased around a dozen ICBMs, an unprecedented number that suggested progress in its efforts to mass-produce powerful weapons.Among them were huge canister-sealed missiles that experts say were likely a version of a solid-fuel ICBM North Korea has been trying to develop in recent years. Solid-fueled allows missiles to be mobile on the ground and makes them faster to launch.__WARHEADSNorth Korea likely has dozens of nuclear warheads. The question is whether they are small enough to fit on a missile.North Korea has so far performed six underground nuclear test explosions to manufacture warheads that it can place on missiles. Outside estimates on the number of North Korean nuclear warheads vary widely, ranging from 20-60 to up to about 115.In a 2021 interview with 38 North, a North Korea-focused website, renowned nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker, who has visited North Korea’s main Yongbyon nuclear complex numerous times, said that “20 to 60 is possible, with the most likely number being 45.”Some experts argue that North Korea has likely already built miniaturized nuclear warheads to be mounted on missiles citing the number of years the country has spent on its nuclear and missile programs. But others say North Korea is still years away from producing such warheads.“After its sixth nuclear test, people accepted that North Korea really will have nuclear weapons. But they are still debating whether it has warhead miniaturization technology,” Shin, the analyst, said.The North described its sixth nuclear test, in 2017, as a detonation of a thermonuclear bomb built for ICBMs. It created a tremor that measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, and some studies put its estimated explosive yield at about 50 to 140 kilotons of TNT. In comparison, the pair of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II — which killed a total of more than 210,000 people — yielded explosions equivalent to about 15 and 20 kilotons of TNT, respectively.The biennial South Korean defense document said that North Korea is estimated to have 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium. Some observers say that's enough for about 9-18 bombs. The document estimated that North Korea has “a considerable amount of” highly enriched uranium as well.North Korea’s Yongbyon complex has facilities to produce both plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the two main ingredients to build nuclear weapons.Plutonium plants are generally large and generate a lot of heat, making it easier to detect. But a uranium enrichment plant is more compact and can be easily hidden from satellite cameras. North Korea is believed to be running at least one additional covert uranium enrichment facility, in addition to one at its Yongbyon complex.__SHORT-RANGE WEAPONSFollowing the collapse of diplomacy with then-U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, Kim sped up the development of short-range solid-fuel, nuclear-capable missiles targeting key targets in South Korea, including U.S. military bases there.The so-called “tactical” nuclear weapons include what North Korea calls “super-large” 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that it tested Monday. South Korea describes the weapon as a short-range missile system.North Korea's state media said its new artillery system can carry nuclear warheads, saying that four rockets would be enough to wipe out an enemy airfield. The statement drew quick outside doubts about whether weapons are indeed nuclear-capable.“The North Korean claim doesn’t make sense to some extent ... Why do they need four tactical nuclear weapons to destroy just one airfield?” Shin, the analyst, said. “Also, which country would disclose such attack scenarios via state media?”Other new North Korean short-range systems include missiles that were apparently modeled after the Russian Iskander mobile ballistic system or outwardly resemble the U.S. MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System. Launched from land vehicles, these missiles are designed to be maneuverable and fly at low altitudes, theoretically giving them a better chance of defeating South Korean and U.S. missile defense systems.Whether North Korea has an ability to arm short-range missiles with nuclear warheads has been independently confirmed.While North Korea may be able to place simple nuclear warheads on some of its older missiles, including Scuds or Rodong missiles, it would likely require further technology advancements and nuclear tests to build smaller and more advanced warheads that can be installed on its newer tactical systems, said Lee, the expert.North Korea also has an intermediate-range, nuclear-capable Hwasong-12 missile capable of reaching Guam, a major U.S. military hub in the Pacific. It has been developing a family of mid-range, solid-fuel Pukguksong missiles, which are designed to be fired from submarines or land vehicles.",2023/2/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817154,Biden to rally allies as Ukraine war gets more complicated,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — President Joe Biden is set to consult with allies from NATO's eastern flank in Poland on Tuesday as the Russian invasion of Ukraine edges toward an even more complicated stage.After paying an unannounced visit to Kyiv, Biden made his way to Warsaw on Monday on a mission to solidify Western unity as both Ukraine and Russia prepare to launch spring offensives. The conflict — the most significant war in Europe since World War II — has already left tens of thousands dead, devastated Ukraine’s infrastructure system and damaged the global economy.“I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said as he stood with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv before departing for Poland. “The Ukrainian people have stepped up in a way that few people ever have in the past.”Biden is scheduled to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and deliver an address from the gardens of Warsaw's Royal Castle on Tuesday, where he’s expected to highlight the commitment of the central European country and other allies to Ukraine over the past year. On Wednesday, he’ll consult with Duda and other leaders of the Bucharest Nine, a group of the easternmost members of NATO military alliance.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden would underscore in his Warsaw address that Russian President Vladimir Putin wrongly surmised “that Ukraine would cower and that the West would be divided” when he launched his invasion.“He got the opposite of that across the board,” Sullivan said.While Biden is looking to use his whirlwind trip to Europe as a moment of affirmation for Ukraine and allies, the White House has also emphasized that there is no clear endgame to the war in the near term and the situation on the ground has become increasingly complex.The administration on Sunday revealed it has new intelligence suggesting that China, which has remained on the sidelines of the conflict, is now considering sending Moscow lethal aid. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it could become a “serious problem” if Beijing follows through.Biden and Zelenskyy discussed capabilities that Ukraine needs “to be able to succeed on the battlefield” in the months ahead, Sullivan said. Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. and European allies to provide fighter jets and long-range missile systems known as ATACMS — which Biden has declined to provide so far. Sullivan declined to comment on whether there was any movement on the matter during the leaders' talk.With no end in sight for the war, the anniversary is a critical moment for Biden to try to bolster European unity and reiterate that Putin's invasion was a frontal attack on the post-World War II international order. The White House hopes the president's visit to Kyiv and Warsaw will help bolster American and global resolve.“It is going to be a long war,” said Michal Baranowski, managing director of the German Marshall Fund East. “If we don’t have the political leadership and if we don’t explain to our societies why this war is critical for their security ... then Ukraine would be in trouble.”In the U.S., a poll published last week by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that support for providing Ukraine with weapons and direct economic assistance is softening. And earlier this month, 11 House Republicans introduced what they called the “Ukraine fatigue” resolution urging Biden to end military and financial aid to Ukraine, while pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to a peace agreement.Biden dismissed the notion of waning American support during his visit to Kyiv.“For all the disagreement we have in our Congress on some issues, there is significant agreement on support for Ukraine,” he said. “It’s not just about freedom in Ukraine. … It’s about freedom of democracy at large.”Some establishment Republicans say it’s now more important than ever for Biden and others in Washington to hammer home why continued backing of Ukraine matters.“The bottom line for me is this is a war of aggression, war crimes on steroids, on television every day. To turn your back on this leads to more aggression,"" said Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C. ""Putin won’t stop in Ukraine. I’m firmly in the camp of it’s in our vital national security interest to continue to help Ukraine and I can sell it at home and will continue to sell it.""Former U.S. Ambassador John Herbst, who served as the top diplomat to Ukraine from 2003 to 2006, said Biden's White House can do better making the case to a domestic audience that “at minimum keeping Putin bottled up in Ukraine"" is in U.S. economic and foreign policy interest and lessens the chance that Russia can turn the conflict into a wider war.“The smart play is to give Ukraine the substantial assistance to make sure that the Putin problem is solved,” said Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center. “If this were something laid out clearly from the Oval Office and then repeated constantly by the president, his senior foreign policy and national security team, I don’t have any doubt the American public will embrace it.”Ahead of the trip, the White House spotlighted Poland's efforts to assist Ukraine. More than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees have settled in Poland since the start of the war and millions more have crossed through Poland on their way to other countries. Poland has also provided Ukraine with $3.8 billion in military and humanitarian aid, according to the White House.The Biden administration announced last summer that it was establishing a permanent U.S. garrison in Poland, creating an enduring American foothold on NATO's eastern flank.The U.S. has committed about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine since last year, while European allies have committed tens of billions of dollars more and welcomed millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled the conflict.“We built a coalition from the Atlantic to the Pacific,” Biden said. “Russia’s aim was to wipe Ukraine off the map. Putin’s war of conquest is failing.”For the second time in less than a year, Biden will use Warsaw as the backdrop to deliver a major address on the Russian invasion. Last March, he delivered a forceful and highly personal condemnation of Putin at the Royal Castle just weeks after the start of the war.Duda said Biden's presence on Polish soil as the war's anniversary approaches sends an important signal about the U.S. commitment to European security.“In Warsaw, the president will deliver a very important address — one that a large part of the world, if not the whole world actually, is waiting for,"" Duda said.___Miller reported from Washington.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817162,Spain court denies Dani Alves' appeal to be freed on bail,"MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court denied Dani Alves' appeal on Tuesday to be freed on bail while the investigation of a sexual assault accusation against the Brazilian soccer player continues.

            The court ruled that Alves was a flight risk and must remain in prison during the investigation. A trial has not been set.

            Alves was provisionally detained in January after being accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a nightclub on Dec. 30. He has denied wrongdoing and said sex with the accuser was consensual.











            A judge ordered him to be jailed without bail after analyzing the initial probe by authorities and hearing testimony from Alves, the alleged victim and witnesses.

            “Daniel Alves remains as innocent as he was before this ruling,” his defense team said in a statement. “His desire to leave Spain and elude the process did not, and does not, exist.”

            Alves’ lawyers filed the appeal saying the Brazilian agreed to turn in his passport and wear a tracking device if he was freed. Alves would also report to the court and to authorities as often as required, including daily, and would not go within 500 meters (yards) of the accuser or her home or workplace.

            But the court ruled that those measures would not be enough to keep the player from potentially trying to escape considering he faces several years in prison if found guilty. It also said there was considerable evidence that a crime might have been committed, and that Alves' wealth could make it easier for him to try to flee regardless of the amount of bail.

            “Nothing would stop Mr. Alves from leaving Spain by air, sea or even land without documentation and reaching his country of origin, where he could stay knowing that he would not be delivered to Spain despite international arrest warrants or extradition orders,” the court said.

            Brazil does not extradite its own citizens when they are sentenced in other countries. Another former Brazil player, Robinho, had a nine-year sentence for the rape of a young woman in Italy upheld by a top Italian court last year, but he remains free in Brazil.

            The 39-year-old Alves can appeal again while the court decides whether to set up a trial.

            Under Spain’s sexual consent law passed last year, sexual assault takes in a wide array of crimes from online abuse and groping to rape, each with different possible punishments. A case of rape can receive a maximum sentence of 15 years.

            Alves won 42 soccer titles, including three Champions Leagues with Barcelona and two Copa Americas with Brazil. He played in his third World Cup last year in Qatar.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817188,"Ukraine updates: War 'strategic failure' for Putin, says US","""One year after (Russian President Vladimir) Putin attacked Ukraine, it is clear that his war has been a strategic failure in every way,"" said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Tuesday.""No one wanted this war. No one likes this war. Everyone wants it to end as quickly as possible,"" Blinken said.Blinken was in Athens alongside his Greek counterpart Nikos Dendias as part of a number of high-level US diplomatic trips to mark the upcoming anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.On social media, Blinken added that ""as a NATO ally, I appreciate Greece’s steadfast support of Ukraine,"" and highlighted the US-European partnership in supporting Kyiv with humanitarian and military aid.Blinken's comments came one day after President Joe Biden made a surprise visit to Kyiv and announced $500 million (around €470 million) in fresh aid during talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Tuesday, February 21:An EU document seen by reporters details a plan prepared by some EU members to stop Russian companies and individuals flouting economic sanctions.The plan, see by Reuters news agency, uses trade and access to the EU single market as leverage.""Circumvention tactics and procurement efforts by the Russians are getting more numerous and more creative,"" the paper, authored by German, French, and Italian officials amongst others, reportedly says.These member states are seeking the expanded cooperation of customs, tax authorities and prosecutors, as well as intelligence and statistics agencies at both EU and national levels.""The responsibility for fueling the Ukrainian conflict, for its escalation, for the number of victims... lies completely with Western elites,"" said Russian President Vladimir Putin in his annual 'state of the nation' speech.As Russia's strategic, equipment, and personnel losses mount, Putin continued to call the war a ""special military operation"" that was aimed at ""liberating"" Ukraine.Despite the setbacks, Putin promised to press on: ""step by step, we will carefully and systematically solve the aims that face us,"" he said.Italy's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday morning as the latest Western ally to meet with President Zelenskyy and discuss military aid.""Ukraine can count on Italy,"" she told a press conference ahead of her trip.The visit is not without controversy, however, as Meloni attempts to show solidarity after making ambivalent statements about the war on the campaign trail last year.Meloni is likely also seeking to do some damage control. Last week, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a key ally in Meloni's governing coalition, boasted once again of his longtime friendship with Russia's President Putin, bragging about being sent cases of vodka as gifts.Zelenskyy then joked that he would send Berlusconi vodka if that was all it took to secure his friendship.Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told a security conference in Beijing that Ukraine and Russia should return to the negotiating table, lest the conflict ""spiral out of control.""He offered to bring ""Chinese wisdom"" to the peace process.In the same speech, he appeared to criticize the US when he urged ""relevant countries to immediately stop adding fuel to the fire, stop shifting blame to China, and stop hyping up the discourse of 'Ukraine today, Taiwan tomorrow.'""Qin was likely referencing security talking points from Washington and its allies implying that Russian expansion in Ukraine could embolden China to launch a military takeover of Taiwan.US President Joe Biden arrived in Warsaw late on Monday after his surprise visit to Ukraine.On Tuesday, he was due to meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda to discuss continued support for Kyiv and to thank Polandfor helping allied nations deliver military and humanitarian aid.The pair are also expected to discuss expanding the NATO presence in Poland, including military equipment. This is something Duda has been seeking as a security reassurance in the wake of increased Russian aggression.An official Russian presidential document obtained by news outlets such as Yahoo and Germany's Süddeutsche Zeitung Newspaper reportedly outlines a plan to absorb neighboring Belarus by 2030.The document, which dates to the summer of 2021, sets out goals of inflitrating Belarus's military, economy, and political system in different stages throughout the coming decade.The two countries already have strong political and military ties.Should such a plan ever come into being, Russia would become an immediate neighbor to EU and NATO members Poland and Lithuania.US President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday, which was seen as an important show of solidarity from Washington ahead of the first anniversary of the invasion.The annual Munich Security Conference has closed, with Western allies seeking a 'rebalance' of the global security status quo and an end to the war.Beijing strongly denied US claims that it was planning to send military hardware to Russia.es/nm (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817190,Taiwan to bolster military ties with US,"Taiwan and the United States will deepen military cooperation in an effort to curb ""authoritarian expansionism,"" Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, after meeting with a delegation of US lawmakers.""Taiwan and the US (will) continue to bolster military exchanges,"" Tsai said. ""Going forward, Taiwan will cooperate even more actively with the US and other democratic partners to confront such global challenges as authoritarian expansionism and climate change.""The president did not give more details on what these exchanges will look like.The five-day long US congressional visit comes amid strained relations with China.The delegation was led by California representative Ro Khanna to expand ""the partnership on military and defense"" and to improve ties with the island's world-leading semiconductor industry. Khanna also met Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semicondictor Manufacturing Company — the world's largest contract chipmaker.A pandemic-induced slowdown hit the global semiconductor chip industry hard, leading to a shortage of chips and delayed production of cars, TVs, and computers.Relations between the US and China dipped to a low point last year when China staged military drills near Taiwan in response to a visit from then speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi. Taiwan has since seen a string of visits from high-ranking US officials, drawing China's ire.Direct relations between two of the world's largest economies soured even more after the US spotted an alleged Chinese spy balloon flying over the west of the country and shot it down earlier in February.Taiwan, a self-ruling island which seperated from China in 1949 after a civil war, is a geopolitical sore point. China claims Taiwan as its territory and has vowed to sieze it in the future. It opposes any official exchanges with the democracy and generally responds to visits from foreign delegations with fresh military drills in the region.The US officially recognizes Taiwan as part of Chinese territory but has increased its support of the island's right to self-rule at the same time.While China and the US have at times signaled a reset in relations, little progress has been made. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has become another point of division between the two. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday warned that Beijing could be considering providing weapons to Russia for the Ukraine war.Meanwhile, China's top diplomat was expected in Moscow on Tuesday, with a possibility of meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Separately, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang told a security conference in Beijing that China was ""deeply"" concerned about the war in Ukraine and wanted a role in settling the conflict.mk/nm (AFP, AP)",2023/2/21,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817191,Moldova calls for EU sanctions on oligarchs helping Russia,"The European Union should sanction ""oligarchs"" working with Russia to ""destabilize"" Moldova, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu told DW on Monday.""One of the objectives of today is to make it more urgent: the need for the European Union to apply sanctions against corrupt oligarchs who have escaped Moldova, who have stolen a lot of money and who are working shoulder to shoulder with Russia to destabilize the country, to bring violence on Moldovan streets,"" Popescu said on the sidelines of a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels.Protests took place in Moldova's capital, Chisinau, over the weekend and the country's pro-Western government resigned earlier this month amid domestic political pressure. A new administration is now in office promising a similar political trajectory.Popescu accused Moscow of trying to ""derail Moldova's stability."" Russia has refuted this claim, and on Monday a Kremlin spokesperson said Moldova was ""slipping into anti-Russian hysteria.""The Moldovan foreign minister said his country also needs air surveillance equipment. This comes after national authorities said Russian missiles crossed Moldovan airspace on February 10.Popescu said getting the equipment among his country's ""priorities"" to allow ""a much better understanding"" of security risks and protect citizens.Moldova shares a border with Ukraine and has taken in more than 100,000 Ukrainian refugees since last February, according to the United Nations. In the early days of the full-scale invasion, Moldova asked for urgent help with refugee reception under the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism. Brussels has said member countries offered Moldova support with sheltering refugees and provided hygiene kits and power generators.Due to its constitutional neutrality, Moldova cannot be a member of Western military alliance NATO — but Popescu said his country's neutrality ""does not preclude security and defense cooperation.""Increasing security ties with the European Union, the United States and NATO would help Moldova in future to maintain ""liberty, democracy and freedom,"" he said.Brussels is considering sending experts to Moldova to improve resilience to cyberthreats, according to diplomats. In 2022, EU member states also greenlit €150 million ($160.1 million) in grants and loans for Moldova to be disbursed over the next two years. The Eastern European country is among the poorest on the continent.Moldova harbors hopes of one day joining the European Union, and in 2022 the country officially applied soon after Ukraine signed its own membership bid. The two nations were granted candidate status by EU countries in June, marking an important step on the path toward accession.But becoming a member of the bloc generally takes years and involves hefty reforms to align with EU norms, including curbs on corruption. Popescu said his government is ""working on reaching the necessary standards.""""We've done reasonably well in this reform process,"" Popescu said, ""and we've also done reasonably well in the last year in keeping peace, calm and stability and freedom in our country in the face of this Russian brutal war against Ukraine that is having very, very negative effects on Moldova.""Russia has maintained a military presence in Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria since the 1990s under the banner of peacekeeping. Popescu called this presence ""illegal.""""What we also know in Moldova is that Russia has been supporting separatism in Moldova for over 30 years,"" he said.Edited by: Martin Kuebler",2023/2/20,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817192,The evil and vicious councilor challenging Taiwan's KMT,"TAICHUNG (Taiwan News) — The headline of this column is not slander, editorial or malicious.It’s how Kuomintang (KMT) Taipei City Councilor Hsu Chiao-hsin (徐巧芯) describes herself when she takes on her political opponents in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP): As “vicious and merciless” (心狠手辣) and as an “evil woman” (惡女).She is the most visible of the “Vigorous Youth Faction” (青壯派), a group of (perhaps as many as 13) KMT Taipei city councilors that, in spite of only having just been elected in November, are planning to stand in the KMT primaries for legislative seats. Hsu, aged 33, is the most audacious of the group.Having only served one full term as city councilor, she announced she plans to take down and oust veteran lawmaker Fei Hung-tai (費鴻泰), an incumbent from her own party. She claims that Fei promised the south Songshan/Xinyi (南松山信義) seat to her, which is apparently news to Fei.She and her fellow “vigorous youth” are openly calling for generational change in the KMT. For the traditionally hierarchical party, this is radical stuff.Critics are calling them the “runaway faction” for abandoning their seats so soon after the election, but this is not deterring the group. Fei clearly feels betrayed, long-standing incumbents are not usually challenged like this, especially not by someone so young.Fei is calling for a party member-only primary because that would favor him, while Hsu is calling for a public opinion poll primary. As we have examined previously, Taiwan has a variety of methods of holding primaries, and they are often used strategically by the party to accomplish specific political ends.On Sunday (Feb. 19) a bombshell was dropped that a source or sources in the KMT said they were planning a “general situation clause” that would favor incumbents. It was widely assumed to be targeting her specifically.Hsu knew how to use this to dominate the news cycle. She likened it to “domestic violence” and said it was the most “heartbreaking day” since entering politics and thoroughly dominated the news cycle with her comments.The KMT promptly came out and denied there was any such clause. Hsu was not about the have the limelight stolen from her and ignored that statement, acting as if it were still true and crying on a television talk show, generating yet more headlines.All of this is playing out very publicly. In Taiwan, Taipei city councilors are often better known nationally than local legislators are.Because they are in Taipei, and most of the political journalists and all the big television and radio talk shows are based there, they are frequent guests and interview subjects. Their constant exposure on these platforms makes many of them stars.Hsu is one of the very best at playing the game. She’s a politician to watch.Hsu’s father is Hakka, and her mother’s family 49ers who fled the Chinese Civil War. Both demographics lean heavily toward the KMT.She started out in the KMT Youth League. Starting in 2015, despite only being in her mid-20s, she was picked as a spokesperson for the office of Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱), then as a campaign spokesperson for Eric Chu’s (朱立倫) presidential campaign followed by a stint as spokesperson for former President Ma Ying-jeou’s (馬英九) office in 2016.In 2018, she won a seat on the Taipei City Council with the second-highest vote count in her district, and last November was re-elected. City council districts are multi-seat constituencies.In appearance, like fellow politicians Eric Chu, Wang Jin-pyng (王金平) and Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文), she looks fairly harmless, but appearances are deceiving. Like those fellow politicians, she is formidable, even when she has campaigned dressed in a schoolgirl uniform.She refers to herself as the Songshan Honey Badger and says she follows a honey badger philosophy. As she puts it: “Don’t look at them as small and cute, one of them can take on ten enemies, stand off against lions, eat cobras like french fries, and their reputation is as the world’s most fearless animal, indifferent to life and death struggle.”As she puts it, she is “not to be trifled with” and is proud of working long hours looking for damaging dirt on her political opponents. She claims to have 60,000 photographs on her phone collected to do battle with “pan-green jackals.”In December she announced that she planned to launch lawsuits against 107 pan-green figures, saying “I want to see a river of blood.” She kept the names and subject of the lawsuits a secret, though, and it is unclear if she ever went through with it.She also is not afraid of embarrassing her former boss Eric Chu, as was shown during the ugly nominating process for the party’s candidate for Taoyuan mayor. She went to bat for her former colleague Lo Chih-chiang (羅智強) and released an account of a private phone call Chu had that showed Chu in a very bad light.She’s a trench fighter who gets into many controversies and spins things her way. For example, during the Taipei mayoral race last year, she accused DPP candidate Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) of being a “pervert” after he was photographed leaving a restaurant with a group of people and he briefly held a female friend’s hand.She was sued, but when the case was dropped she claimed on Facebook that the “court authenticated he was a pervert,” which of course was not the case at all. It was clever politically, though, as some people may actually believe her.She also promotes terms like “taluban” (塔綠班) to describe the DPP. That is a play on words with Taliban, but substituting the ‘li’ in the center with ‘lu’ meaning green, the color associated with the DPP (there are netizen equivalents on the pan-green side that are similarly vicious, but usually are not used by politicians).It is hard to say how Eric Chu and the KMT will handle this situation. On the one hand, the party is traditionally hierarchical and long-term loyalty is rewarded, and Hsu is not playing by the unofficial rulebook on this.There are a lot of people in the party upset with her challenge, not just Fei. Probably many in the older generations are feeling nervous about their futures.On the other hand, Chu went out of his way to try and run more younger candidates in the last election. The KMT had been losing youth support for years and the party has been worried about being eventually aged out of existence in the coming years.Hsu is a media darling, and potentially could lead the charge with her fellow Vigorous Youth. I have yet to see any polling that breaks down her support by age, though, so it is speculative.If Chu decides to make a move to stop her, it will likely be through his choice of primary method.",2023/2/21,1909,Opinion
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817193,Inside the Trump grand jury that probed election meddling,"ATLANTA (AP) — They were led down a staircase into a garage beneath a downtown Atlanta courthouse, where officers with big guns were waiting. From there, they were ushered into vans with heavily tinted windows and driven to their cars under police escort.

            For Emily Kohrs, these were the moments last May when she realized she wasn’t participating in just any grand jury.

            “That was the first indication that this was a big freaking deal,” Kohrs told The Associated Press.











            The 30-year-old Fulton County resident who was between jobs suddenly found herself at the center of one of the nation’s most significant legal proceedings. She would become foreperson of the special grand jury selected to investigate whether then-President Donald Trump and his Republican associates illegally meddled in Georgia’s 2020 presidential election. The case has emerged as one of Trump’s most glaring legal vulnerabilities as he mounts a third presidential campaign, in part because he was recorded asking state election officials to “find 11,780 votes"" for him. 

            For the next eight months, Kohrs and her fellow jurors would hear testimony from 75 witnesses, ranging from some of Trump’s most prominent allies to local election workers. Portions of the panel’s final report released last Thursday said jurors believed that “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The report’s recommendations for charges on other issues, including potential attempts to influence the election, remain secret for now.

            The AP identified Kohrs after her name was included on subpoenas obtained through open records requests. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney advised Kohrs and other jurors on what they could and could not share publicly, including in interviews with the news media.

            During a lengthy recent interview, Kohrs complied with the judge’s instructions not to discuss details related to the jury’s deliberations. She also declined to talk about unpublished portions of the panel’s final report. 

            But her general characterizations provided unusual insight into a process that is typically cloaked in secrecy.

            Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was on the receiving end of Trump’s pressure campaign, was “a really geeky kind of funny,” she said. State House Speaker David Ralston, who died in November, was hilarious and had the room in stitches. And Gov. Brian Kemp, who succeeded in delaying his appearance until after his reelection in November, seemed unhappy to be there.

            Kohrs was fascinated by an explainer on Georgia’s voting machines offered by a former Dominion Voting Systems executive. She also enjoyed learning about the inner workings of the White House from Cassidy Hutchinson, who Kohrs said was much more forthcoming than her old boss, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. 

            Kohrs sketched witnesses in her notebook as they spoke and was tickled when Bobby Christine, the former U.S. attorney for Georgia’s Southern District, complimented her “remarkable talent.” When the jurors’ notes were taken for shredding after their work was done, she managed to salvage two sketches — U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and Marc Short, who served as chief of staff to former Vice President Mike Pence — because there were no notes on those pages.

            After Graham tried so hard to avoid testifying — taking his fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court — Kohrs was surprised when he politely answered questions and even joked with jurors. 

            Former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani was funny and invoked privilege to avoid answering many questions but “genuinely seemed to consider” whether it was merited before declining to answer, she said.

            When witnesses refused to answer almost every question, the lawyers would engage in what Kohrs came to think of as “show and tell.” The lawyers would show video of the person appearing on television or testifying before the U.S. House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, periodically asking the witness to confirm certain things. Then the scratching of pens on paper could be heard as jurors tallied how many times the person invoked the Fifth Amendment. 

            At least one person who resisted answering questions became much more cooperative when prosecutors offered him immunity in front of the jurors, Kohrs said. Other witnesses came in with immunity deals already in place.

            Trump’s attorneys have said he was never asked to testify. Kohrs said the grand jury wanted to hear from the former president but didn’t have any real expectation that he would offer meaningful testimony.

            “Trump was not a battle we picked to fight,” she said.

            Kohrs didn’t vote in 2020 and was only vaguely aware of controversy swirling in the wake of the election. She didn’t know the specifics of Trump’s allegations of widespread election fraud or his efforts to reverse his loss. When prosecutors played the then-president’s phone call with Raffensperger on the first day the jurors met to consider evidence, it was the first time Kohrs had heard it. 

            “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have,"" Trump said on the call. 

            Though Kohrs said she tends to agree more with Democrats, Kohrs said she doesn’t identify with any political party and prefers to listen to all opinions. 

            “If I chose a political party, it would be the not-crazy party,” she said. 

            Kohrs called herself a “geek about the justice system” and noted the challenges some jurors faced balancing their responsibilities on the panel with outside duties. When she eagerly volunteered to be foreperson, she met no resistance from her fellow jurors, who were less enthusiastic about the time-consuming obligation stretching before them, she said.

            One of her first duties as foreperson was to sign a big stack of subpoenas. 

            As the proceedings played out, one of her fellow jurors brought the newspaper every day and pointed out stories about the investigation. Prosecutors, Kohrs said, told jurors they could consume news coverage related to the case but urged them to keep an open mind. 

            Kohrs said she mostly avoided stories related to the proceedings to avoid forming an opinion.

            “I didn’t want to characterize anyone before they walked in the room,” she said. “I felt they all deserved an impartial listener.”

            Of the 26 people on the panel — 23 jurors and three alternates — 16 had to be present for a quorum. There was a core group of between 12 and 16 who showed up almost every day they were in session, Kohrs said, and she could recall only one day when they couldn’t proceed because not enough seats were filled. The most they ever had in the room was 22 — on the day Giuliani testified.

            As the months passed, the grand jurors grew more comfortable with each other and with the four lawyers on Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ team who led the proceedings. But they’re not all best friends now that it’s over.

            “We are not meeting up now. We don’t have a group chat,” Kohrs said.

            While the jurors asked to hear from certain witnesses, most witnesses were decided upon by the district attorney’s office. But Kohrs said she didn’t feel as though prosecutors were trying to influence the jurors’ final report.

            “I fully stand by our report as our decision and our conclusion,” she said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817194,Hong Kong pulls visa for man behind gene-edited babies claim,"BEIJING (AP) — Hong Kong on Tuesday revoked a visa it granted to a Chinese scientist who set off an ethical debate five years ago with claims that he made the world’s first genetically edited babies, pulling it hours after he announced his research plans in the financial hub.

            He Jiankui shocked the world in 2018 when he announced he had altered the embryos of twin girls, with many in the scientific community criticizing his work as unethical. He was convicted by a mainland Chinese court in 2019 of practicing medicine without a license and sentenced to three years in prison with a fine of 3 million yuan ($445,000).

            Ten months after his release, He announced in Beijing on Tuesday that he had been granted a Hong Kong visa and was in contact with universities, research institutes and companies in the financial hub. 











            He said he would consider working in Hong Kong if there were an appropriate opportunity, and that he plans to research gene therapy for rare hereditary diseases.

            “My scientific research will comply with the ethics codes and international consensus on scientific research,” he said at a brief news conference.

            But in a statement hours later in which it didn't refer to He by name but said it was responding to reports about a visa applicant who was jailed because of illegal medical practices, the Hong Kong government said it had revoked the visa.

            “After the immigration department reviewed the application, it suspected that someone had made false statements to get the visa approval,” the statement wrote. “The director of immigration has declared that the visa is invalid in accordance with the law.” 

            Law enforcement officers would conduct a criminal investigation to follow up the case, it added. 

            He didn't immediately reply to an Associated Press request for comment. 

            His announcement in 2018 sparked a global debate over the ethics of gene editing. In interviews with The Associated Press, he said he had used a tool called CRISPR to try to disable a gene that allows HIV to enter cells in an attempt to give the babies the ability to resist AIDS.

            The CRISPR tool has been tested elsewhere in adults to treat diseases, but many in the scientific community criticized He’s work as medically unnecessary and unethical partly because any genetic changes could be passed down to future generations. 

            In convicting him in 2019, the Chinese court in Shenzhen said he had not obtained qualifications as a doctor, had pursued fame and profit, deliberately violated Chinese regulations on scientific research, and crossed an ethical line in both scientific research and medicine. The court also confirmed a third birth, saying his project involved three gene-edited babies born to two women.

            He was released last April and was invited to speak at the University of Oxford next month. But he wrote on Twitter this month that he was not ready to talk about his experiences over the last three years and decided to cancel the visit.

            He invited about six media organizations to his news conference on Tuesday but left after reading a statement for about two minutes. He did not respond to questions as he left.

            In a later written response, he said he plans to form an advisory committee on ethics to vet his future work and make sure the process is open and transparent.

            He said he plans to research Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that he said often causes people to die of heart and lung failure when they are about 20 years old. No medicine can cure the disease but gene therapy might help, he said. 

            He said his team hopes to use AI tools to improve gene therapy and lower the costs of the treatment to make it affordable to every family. 

            Earlier in Hong Kong, the granting of a visa to He under a new program to woo global talent raised concerns that recipients might have criminal records.

            According to the Immigration Department, applicants should meet normal immigration requirements, including having a “clear criminal record” and raising “no security or criminal concerns” to Hong Kong.

            Hong Kong Labour Minister Chris Sun refused to comment on individual cases but acknowledged that applicants have not needed to disclose any criminal record in the application process. He said applicants will have to do so starting Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817195,Blinken welcomes 'time out' on Greece-Turkey tension,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged NATO allies Greece and Turkey to calm rhetoric as both countries head to national elections, in an effort to bolster unity in the trans-Atlantic alliance as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears its anniversary.

            Blinken met with officials in Athens after a stop in Turkey, where he also visited regions hardest hit by devastating recent earthquakes. 

            Greek and Turkish officials said they are willing to take a time out from longstanding disputes over sea boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean in the aftermath of the earthquakes that have killed about 45,000 people in Turkey and Syria. 











            Blinken said he hoped the pause would provide an opportunity to return to diplomacy. 

            “It’s profoundly in our interest and I believe in the interest of both Greece and Turkey to find ways to resolve longstanding differences,” he told reporters in Athens on Tuesday. 

            “And to do it through dialogue through diplomacy to do it peacefully and in the meantime to not take any unilateral actions or use any charged rhetoric that would only make things more difficult.”

            Greece is expected to hold a parliamentary election in April, while Turkey will hold a general election in June. 

            “Both countries are heading to an election. That certainly creates, sometimes, incentives to engage in rhetoric that can create more problems,” Blinken said. 

            In Athens, he met with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis as well as Greece's ministers of foreign affairs and defense, continuing discussions to deepen bilateral military cooperation that has significantly expanded in recent years. ""We’re all heartbroken over the humanitarian catastrophe that has struck our neighbors,” Mitsotakis told Blinken late Monday. “I think this horrible catastrophe has proven that there is a deep connection between our two peoples. We may have big, significant political differences, but the bonds between our peoples are there.” Celeste Wallander, the U.S. assistant defense secretary for international security affairs, accompanied Blinken on his European trip and on Monday visited military bases and port facilities in northern Greece where the United States has been granted access in recent years. They include a base near Larissa, in central Greece, used by the U.S. for MQ-9 Reaper drones, and the port of Alexandroupolis, near Greece's border with Turkey, which has become an important logistics hub for U.S. military assistance bound for Ukraine. During his trip, Blinken called for Sweden and Finland to be admitted to NATO, which has been held up by Ankara's concerns over security threats it describes as terrorism. He also sharply criticized Iran for providing Russia with attack drones and failing to engage in internationally-sponsored nuclear talks. Asked Tuesday if the United States would discourage Israel from taking military action aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, Blinken responded: “Countries will make sovereign decisions for their own security and of course that’s no different when it comes to Israel or any country. We can’t make those decisions for them.”ATHENS, Greece (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday urged NATO allies Greece and Turkey to calm rhetoric as both countries head to national elections, in an effort to bolster unity in the trans-Atlantic alliance as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears its anniversary.Blinken met with officials in Athens after a stop in Turkey, where he also visited regions hardest hit by devastating recent earthquakes.Greek and Turkish officials said they are willing to take a time out from longstanding disputes over sea boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean in the aftermath of the earthquakes that have killed about 45,000 people in Turkey and Syria.Blinken said he hoped the pause would provide an opportunity to return to diplomacy.“It’s profoundly in our interest and I believe in the interest of both Greece and Turkey to find ways to resolve longstanding differences,” he told reporters in Athens on Tuesday.“And to do it through dialogue through diplomacy to do it peacefully and in the meantime to not take any unilateral actions or use any charged rhetoric that would only make things more difficult.”Greece is expected to hold a parliamentary election in April, while Turkey will hold a general election in June.“Both countries are heading to an election. That certainly creates, sometimes, incentives to engage in rhetoric that can create more problems,” Blinken said.In Athens, he met with Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis as well as Greece's ministers of foreign affairs and defense, continuing discussions to deepen bilateral military cooperation that has significantly expanded in recent years. ""We’re all heartbroken over the humanitarian catastrophe that has struck our neighbors,” Mitsotakis told Blinken late Monday. “I think this horrible catastrophe has proven that there is a deep connection between our two peoples. We may have big, significant political differences, but the bonds between our peoples are there.” Celeste Wallander, the U.S. assistant defense secretary for international security affairs, accompanied Blinken on his European trip and on Monday visited military bases and port facilities in northern Greece where the United States has been granted access in recent years. They include a base near Larissa, in central Greece, used by the U.S. for MQ-9 Reaper drones, and the port of Alexandroupolis, near Greece's border with Turkey, which has become an important logistics hub for U.S. military assistance bound for Ukraine. During his trip, Blinken called for Sweden and Finland to be admitted to NATO, which has been held up by Ankara's concerns over security threats it describes as terrorism. He also sharply criticized Iran for providing Russia with attack drones and failing to engage in internationally-sponsored nuclear talks. Asked Tuesday if the United States would discourage Israel from taking military action aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, Blinken responded: “Countries will make sovereign decisions for their own security and of course that’s no different when it comes to Israel or any country. We can’t make those decisions for them.”",2023/2/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817196,Traffic surges at Dubai airport but lags behind 2019 peak,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Traffic more than doubled last year at Dubai's airport, the world's busiest for international flights, but has yet to fully recover after the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures released Tuesday.

            Even as the number of passengers has surged, the state-of-the-art airport in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates has avoided the travel chaos that rippled across North America and Europe last year, as it maintained capacity through the darkest days of the pandemic.

            Over 66 million passengers moved through the airport, known as DXB, in 2022, up from 29.1 million in 2021, when global travel was still snarled by pandemic restrictions. But it remains well below the pre-pandemic milestone of 86.4 million logged in 2019.











            Paul Griffiths, the airport's CEO, told The Associated Press that he expects traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year or early 2024, with a boost from China's easing of its “zero COVID” policies. The airport currently forecasts 78 million passengers in 2023.

            “We’re optimistic that the traffic levels every month will be regularly over the seven million mark, which means that we’re very, very precisely on a trajectory to recover to the pre-pandemic levels, if not this year, certainly by the first half of 2024,"" he said.

            “We’ve now got seven cities in China with 25 flights a week with five airlines,"" he said. ""That I think is going to be the new engine of growth.”

            Located at the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Dubai's airport has long been the busiest worldwide for international flights. Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is the busiest overall, including domestic routes, according to flight data provider OAG.

            DXB is is linked to 229 destinations across 99 countries, with routes operated by scores of international carriers.

            Tourism is a major industry in the UAE, which has plowed its oil wealth into lavish infrastructure over the past few decades, giving rise to the futuristic cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 

            Dubai was one of the first major destinations to lift its tourism lockdown. Major sporting and entertainment events have brought even more people to the region in recent years, and the UAE is set to host this year's COP28 U.N. climate talks.

            As the pandemic ushered in worldwide lockdowns and travel bans in early 2020, the UAE made it a “strategic priority” to ensure that it would be ready for the eventual recovery, Griffiths said.

            “We always believed that growth following the pandemic would be very sharp and very quick to recover, so we didn’t retrench the huge number of employees that a lot of other airports and airlines around the world undertook.”

            As travelers across North America and Europe huddled in packed airports last summer watching screens light up with delays and cancellations, passengers moved through Dubai with ease.

            The airport says the average wait time at passport control upon arrival was less than 13 minutes, and at security was less than three minutes, for more than 95% of passengers. It boasts a baggage handling success rate of 99.8%, with just over two mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers.

            India remained the top destination of passengers moving through the airport, followed by Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. Neighboring Saudi Arabia will host the first hajj pilgrimage since the lifting of pandemic restrictions, with millions of Muslims from across the world expected to travel to Mecca and Medina this summer.

            The UAE has also seen a growing influx of visitors from Russia since the start of the Ukraine war, fueling a local real estate boom.

            “If we don't get back to pre-pandemic levels by Q4 this year I'll be surprised, but it won't be much beyond Q4 2023 that we'll see traffic back to where it was pre-pandemic,"" Griffiths said.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Traffic more than doubled last year at Dubai's airport, the world's busiest for international flights, but has yet to fully recover after the coronavirus pandemic, according to figures released Tuesday.Even as the number of passengers has surged, the state-of-the-art airport in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates has avoided the travel chaos that rippled across North America and Europe last year, as it maintained capacity through the darkest days of the pandemic.Over 66 million passengers moved through the airport, known as DXB, in 2022, up from 29.1 million in 2021, when global travel was still snarled by pandemic restrictions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817197,Buttigieg urges safety changes after fiery Ohio derailment,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg wants the nation’s freight railroads to immediately act to improve safety while regulators try to strengthen safety rules in the wake of a fiery derailment in Ohio that forced evacuations when toxic chemicals were released and burned. 

            Buttigieg announced a package of reforms Tuesday — two days after he warned the railroad responsible for the derailment, Norfolk Southern, to fulfill its promises to clean up the mess just outside East Palestine, Ohio, and help the town recover. He said the Department of Transportation will hold the railroad accountable for any safety violations that contributed to the Feb. 3 crash near the Pennsylvania border.

            “While ensuring the safety of those impacted by this crash is the immediate priority, we also have to recognize that this represents an important moment to redouble our efforts to make this far less likely to happen again in the future,"" Buttigieg said. 











            President Joe Biden said on Twitter that the past pattern of railroads resisting safety regulations must change and that Congress should support the effort to improve safety.

            “Rail companies have spent millions of dollars to oppose common-sense safety regulations. And it’s worked,” Biden tweeted. “This is more than a train derailment or a toxic waste spill – it’s years of opposition to safety measures coming home to roost.”

            Even though government data shows that derailments have declined in recent years, there were still 1,049 of them last year. Most are ordinary and don't cause any major problems, like the derailment in Nebraska on Tuesday morning that toppled more than two dozen Union Pacific railcars, spilled coal and blocked the tracks.

            The head of the Environmental Protection Agency returned to the town of 4,700 Tuesday along with the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania and Norfolk Southern's CEO. Also on Tuesday, a medical clinic staffed by contamination experts opened to evaluate residents' complaints. State and federal officials have reiterated that their testing of air and water samples doesn't show dangerous levels of any toxins, but some people have complained about constant headaches and irritated eyes as they worry about returning to their homes.

            Buttigieg said railroads and tank car owners should accelerate their plan to upgrade the tank cars that haul flammable liquids like crude oil and ethanol by 2025 instead of waiting to comply with the 2029 standard Congress ultimately approved after regulators suggested the earlier deadline. He also said freight railroads should reach more agreements to provide their employees with paid sick time to help prevent fatigue.

            Railroad unions have also raised concerns that car inspections are being rushed and preventative maintenance may be getting neglected after widespread job cuts in the industry in recent years that they say have made railroads riskier. 

            “I do think that there’s a moment to look in the mirror as an entire industry and decide what we can do better,” said Greg Regan, president of the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department coalition. “I think the industry by and large has been reluctant to make the types of changes that are needed. They have obviously fought regulations in the past, but I think they are running out of excuses here.” 

            Jeremy Ferguson, the president of the largest rail union that represents conductors, said railroads' reliance on longer trains and fewer employees since they started adopting this new operating model in 2017 is jeopardizing public safety. 

            Ferguson said the pursuit of higher profits prompted “rail carriers to abandon fundamentally sound practices for haphazard, inherently dangerous, impetuous movements of freight and locomotives across America's rail system.”

            Buttigieg said regulators will try to revive a proposed rule the Trump administration dropped that would have required upgraded, electronically controlled brakes on certain trains filled with flammable liquids that are designated “high-hazardous flammable trains.” The rule was dropped after Congress directed regulators to use a strict cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the rule.

            Buttigieg said he'll ask Congress to “untie our hands here” on the braking rule, and regulators may look at expanding which trains are covered by the “high-hazardous” rules that were announced in 2015 after several fiery crude oil train derailments — the worst of which killed 47 people and decimated the Canadian town of Lac Mégantic in 2013. He also said Congress should raise the current $225,455 limit on railroad safety fines at least tenfold to create a better deterrent.

            Buttigieg criticized railroads for lobbying against the braking rule and challenging it in court. But railroad safety expert David Clarke, who previously led the Center for Transportation Research at the University of Tennessee, said the industry shouldn’t be criticized too heavily for pushing back against proposed regulations.

            “The fact that you couch those in terms of safety makes it seem like it’s, you know, mom, God and apple pie — anything safety related is sacred,” Clarke said. “But the bottom line is companies have to look at the benefits and the cost of any expenditure.”

            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine was incredulous when he learned the Norfolk Southern train that derailed didn’t carry that “high-hazardous” designation, meaning that the railroad didn’t have to notify the state about the dangerous chemicals it was carrying.

            “This is absurd,” DeWine said. “Congress needs to take a look at how this is handled.”

            Regulators and the Association of American Railroads trade group say there are hundreds of pages of other rules railroads must follow when they transport any hazardous chemicals, whether it is the vinyl chloride that has gotten so much attention in this derailment, crude oil, nuclear materials or any of the hundreds of other dangerous chemicals that railroads routinely carry. 

            It’s not clear whether the “high-hazardous” rules could have prevented this derailment. The National Transportation Safety Board is in the early stages of its investigation, although officials with that agency have said they believe the failure of an axle on one of the railcars not long after the train crew got a warning about a possible mechanical problem caused this crash.

            The head of the AAR trade group, Ian Jefferies, said regulators should let the findings of the NTSB investigation — not “politics and speculation” — guide their response and keep the focus for now on supporting East Palestine. He said railroads will address the cause of this accident once it is known.

            The Federal Railroad Administration will also work to finalize its proposed rule to require two-person crews that Buttigieg pointed to as one of the Biden administration's main efforts to improve rail safety.

            The president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, Eddie Hall, said he believes the freight railroads' efforts to cut crews down to one person represent a clear safety threat.

            “Railroads in the United States largely self-regulate, and right now, rather than learn from their mistakes and improve oversight and safety, they are going in the opposite direction,” Hall said. 

            Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw said Tuesday that he has spoken with Buttigieg several times since the derailment and that he's made the same commitment to Buttigieg that he made to the community of East Palestine: The railroad is committed to cleaning up the mess and helping the town rebuild. He acknowledged the railroad could do more to ensure safety because there is always room to do more and said Norfolk Southern will look to make changes once the NTSB investigation is complete.

            “It’s clear that our safety culture and our investments in safety were not enough to prevent this accident,"" Shaw said. ""We’re going to learn from it. We’re going to improve. And we’re going to make Norfolk Southern a safer railroad.”

            Norfolk Southern has already committed $6.5 million to the community. That is likely just the start, as the EPA made clear Tuesday that Norfolk Southern will be responsible for the cleanup costs, and several lawsuits have already been filed against the railroad.OMAHA, Neb.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817216,"Abrahamic House in UAE houses a church, synagogue and mosque","ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — On the shores of the Persian Gulf, a new complex houses a Catholic church, a Jewish synagogue and an Islamic mosque in the capital of the United Arab Emirates. 

            The Abrahamic Family House offers a concrete, marble and oak manifestation of the UAE's publicized push toward tolerance after hosting Pope Francis in 2019 and later diplomatically recognizing Israel in 2020. Worshippers have already prayed and communed at the site on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island, while the general public will be allowed in next month. 

            However, the UAE still criminalizes proselytizing outside of the Islamic faith. Security also remains a concern as well for Jewish worshippers in this new outpost on the Arabian Peninsula, whether from Israel's regional enemy Iran or from those angered by Israel pursuing settlements on land Palestinians seek for their future state. 











            Organizers declined to speak on camera Tuesday to The Associated Press about the project, even as they led journalists around the site. 

            The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, announced plans for the Abrahamic Family House in 2019 during the country's “Year of Tolerance.” Designed by the British-Ghanian architect Sir David Adjaye, the site includes the three houses of worship and a center connecting them for future events. 

            The site itself stands out as a stark, white-marble place of worship in a capital more known for its oil industry, ongoing arms fair, glass towers and beachfront hotels. The three houses of worship — the St. Francis of Assisi Church, the Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue and the Imam al-Tayeb Mosque — stand at triangle points, each a structure of about 30 cubic meters (1,060 cubic feet).

            Triangular fountains lay set inside parts of the grounds, providing a bubbling background against the sound of construction taking place elsewhere on an island that is already home to the domed Louvre Abu Dhabi, a museum opened under an agreement with France. Behind the site, the massive falcon wings of the under-construction Zayed National Museum rise overhead as workers climbed through its scaffolding on Tuesday. 

            While each house of worship is the same size, all appear different on the inside. In the church, eastward windows with morning light frame a marble altar and lectern with a crucifix above it. Oaken pews sit inside for the faithful under suspended wooden columns hanging from the ceiling. 

            The synagogue has similar pews, with the Ten Commandments inscribed in Hebrew at the front. A room for the Torah is located behind the front. Bronze netting hangs from the ceiling, playing with the light from the windows and a skylight above. 

            The mosque has shelves for the Quran and also outside, for the faithful to remove their shoes, hidden behind Islamic geometric designs. Gray carpeting covers the floor, with two microphones under and one above on the minbar, the platform where the imam stands for Friday prayers. Moveable walls separate the men's and women's sections. 

            Officials gave no figure for the cost of construction of the site, though the materials alone likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 

            Still, proselytizing outside of the Islamic faith remains illegal in the UAE and Islam is enshrined as the official religion in the country’s constitution, with government websites even offering online applications to convert. Conversion from Islam to another religion, however, is illegal, as is witchcraft and sorcery, the U.S. State Department has warned.

            Blasphemy and apostasy laws also carry a possible death sentence — though no such execution is known to have been carried out since the UAE became a nation in 1971. Despite facing restrictions, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus and others in the UAE have never faced the violence that has targeted their communities in Syria and Iraq during the rise of the Islamic State group and other militants.

            Security appears to be a major concern for the site. Though hidden as much as possible, metal detectors screen those coming into the facility. Security cameras can be seen at every major corner, both inside and outside the houses of worship. On Tuesday, black-suited private security guards also ran mirrors around vehicles to check their undercarriages for explosives — a measure rarely seen in the Emirates. 

            Hard-line media in Iran have previously described the UAE as a “legitimate” target, given its recognition of Israel.

            Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — On the shores of the Persian Gulf, a new complex houses a Catholic church, a Jewish synagogue and an Islamic mosque in the capital of the United Arab Emirates.The Abrahamic Family House offers a concrete, marble and oak manifestation of the UAE's publicized push toward tolerance after hosting Pope Francis in 2019 and later diplomatically recognizing Israel in 2020. Worshippers have already prayed and communed at the site on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island, while the general public will be allowed in next month.However, the UAE still criminalizes proselytizing outside of the Islamic faith. Security also remains a concern as well for Jewish worshippers in this new outpost on the Arabian Peninsula, whether from Israel's regional enemy Iran or from those angered by Israel pursuing settlements on land Palestinians seek for their future state.Organizers declined to speak on camera Tuesday to The Associated Press about the project, even as they led journalists around the site.The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, announced plans for the Abrahamic Family House in 2019 during the country's “Year of Tolerance.” Designed by the British-Ghanian architect Sir David Adjaye, the site includes the three houses of worship and a center connecting them for future events.The site itself stands out as a stark, white-marble place of worship in a capital more known for its oil industry, ongoing arms fair, glass towers and beachfront hotels. The three houses of worship — the St. Francis of Assisi Church, the Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue and the Imam al-Tayeb Mosque — stand at triangle points, each a structure of about 30 cubic meters (1,060 cubic feet).Triangular fountains lay set inside parts of the grounds, providing a bubbling background against the sound of construction taking place elsewhere on an island that is already home to the domed Louvre Abu Dhabi, a museum opened under an agreement with France. Behind the site, the massive falcon wings of the under-construction Zayed National Museum rise overhead as workers climbed through its scaffolding on Tuesday.While each house of worship is the same size, all appear different on the inside. In the church, eastward windows with morning light frame a marble altar and lectern with a crucifix above it. Oaken pews sit inside for the faithful under suspended wooden columns hanging from the ceiling.The synagogue has similar pews, with the Ten Commandments inscribed in Hebrew at the front. A room for the Torah is located behind the front. Bronze netting hangs from the ceiling, playing with the light from the windows and a skylight above.The mosque has shelves for the Quran and also outside, for the faithful to remove their shoes, hidden behind Islamic geometric designs. Gray carpeting covers the floor, with two microphones under and one above on the minbar, the platform where the imam stands for Friday prayers. Moveable walls separate the men's and women's sections.Officials gave no figure for the cost of construction of the site, though the materials alone likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars.Still, proselytizing outside of the Islamic faith remains illegal in the UAE and Islam is enshrined as the official religion in the country’s constitution, with government websites even offering online applications to convert. Conversion from Islam to another religion, however, is illegal, as is witchcraft and sorcery, the U.S. State Department has warned.Blasphemy and apostasy laws also carry a possible death sentence — though no such execution is known to have been carried out since the UAE became a nation in 1971.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817217,"Family, fellowshipping still a core of CIAA hoops tournament","Friends, families and alumni who continue to make the trek to the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association Tournament often say they remember more about what they did and who they saw during the event than which school won the basketball championship.

            The family reunion vibe and opportunities to fellowship have been a foundation for one of college basketball’s most popular events, which kicks off Tuesday in Baltimore.

            Whether the tournament is in Maryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia or North Carolina, a loyal and proud contingent of fans show up and show out.











            “It’s a packed weekend, and you’re trying to get it in,” Theophilus Woodley of Charlotte, North Carolina, said recently in a Zoom interview with his family.

            It doesn't matter that there hasn't been a player from the CIAA to reach the NBA since Ronald “Flip” Murray (2002-10) and that fans don't get to see the likes of Hall of Famers Earl Monroe or Bobby Dandridge. The 22 men's and women's contests figure to be intense, but the trick is finding a way to watch basketball amid an off-court menu of events, not to mention connecting with schoolmates and friends.

            Woodley, a Winston-Salem State graduate, began attending the CIAA in 1971 and had gone 45 consecutive years until missing last year’s debut in Baltimore. Health reasons will keep him away again this week, but his daughter Thesha, also a WSSU grad and alumni engagement director, will represent the family.

            “It’s so many different things that you’re going to have to do, everywhere you go,” the 70-year-old Woodley recalled. “Everybody is there basically for the same thing. And so, everywhere you go, there’s something to do. Just a welcome experience.”

            Amaya Woodley, his daughter-in-law, added, “This is definitely a marathon, not a sprint.”

            That’s been a core of the CIAA Tournament since 1946 and continues for the league composed of 12 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in NCAA Division II. It began in Washington, D.C., with an overflow crowd, and interest has remained high through stops in Virginia and North Carolina before returning to Baltimore last year for the first time since 1952.

            But to think of the CIAA Tournament solely in basketball terms would be a disservice to its history, born out of segregation.

            Generations of alumni, students and casual fans plan for it. The Woodleys’ attendance is just one example of how its tradition and legacy is passed down.

            “When you think about CIAA, it’s just a part of my Black History Month, how I celebrate my culture and connect with people,” Thesha Woodley said. “Everywhere you go, somebody’s wearing something and it just sparks conversation and friendship.

            “Even if we’re competing on the court, it’s still like HBCU love. So, it’s a really good experience.”

            The lineup of events include:

            — Step shows featuring the “Divine Nine” Black Greek sororities and fraternities and local drill teams. The requisite battle of high-energy bands blaring popular tunes as cheerleaders cheer on their schools and perform entertaining, acrobatic moves.

            — Nearby attractions such as concerts starring hip-hop artists like KRS-One, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh.

            — The fanfest is also a huge draw amid a sea of vendors hawking souvenir reminders of the HBCU and African-American experience.

            Of course, that’s not counting the impromptu get-togethers at surrounding hotels, bars or restaurants that often extend well into the night.

            “It’s the biggest HBCU community homecoming in February, ever,” said CIAA Commissioner Jacqie McWilliams, adding that there will be a Title IX celebration as well. “And we invite the entire HBCU community to be a part of this experience. It’s the one time that we can really celebrate Black history together in a community that is a Black community.”

            The CIAA website touts its tournament among the nation’s three highest-attended college basketball events among all NCAA divisions. The NCAA could not verify that ranking, though the governing body's record book shows the CIAA boasting Division II's top four single-game crowds, highlighted by the record 21,786 for Bowie State's 72-71 victory over Virginia Union for the 2003 men's title in Raleigh, North Carolina.

            Last year’s debut amid coronavirus pandemic concerns attracted more than 66,000 visitors to Baltimore and generated a $19.6 million economic impact. President/CEO Al Hutchinson of Visit Baltimore expects those numbers to increase this year with restrictions lifted and a renovated, renamed CFG Bank Arena ready to host its first games.

            Baltimore city/county demographics include an estimated 62% Black population as of July 2022 (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) and is the home of Morgan State and Coppin State universities, Division I members of the historically Black Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). 

            Longtime Baltimore bar owner Ann Winder is ready for the additional business at The Place Lounge, an over-30 jazz, R&B and music bar located a few blocks north of the arena.

            “Everyone I’ve spoken with are pretty excited about it,"" said Winder, who plans to attend tournament games. ""I just go with the flow. ... It’s not like my place is a huge place. But I can guarantee you that I’ll be full.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817218,Israel president urges consensus after judicial changes pass,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's president Tuesday called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition to seek dialogue and compromise after it pushed ahead with a controversial judicial overhaul in a turbulent parliamentary session overnight.

            Isaac Herzog said it was a “difficult morning” following the late-night parliamentary vote that saw two contentious pieces of legislation pass a preliminary hurdle.

            The legislation is part of sweeping changes proposed by the government that have prompted vocal criticism in Israel and abroad, drawn tens of thousands of protesters to the streets and spooked investors and financial markets. 











            On Tuesday, the dollar gained over 2% against the shekel, continuing a monthlong slide that has seen the Israeli currency lose over 5% of its value against the dollar. Several Israeli companies have said they are withdrawing money from the country, while Israeli newspapers have reported even larger withdrawals of cash as investors have grown jittery about the business climate.

            Critics say the judicial overhaul underway will concentrate power in the hands of the ruling coalition in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, and erode the democratic system of checks and balances. 

            Netanyahu and his allies insist the changes will better curb an overly powerful Supreme Court. 

            ""Many citizens across Israeli society, many people who voted for the coalition, are fearful for national unity,” Herzog said at a conference organized by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. He urged Netanyahu and his allies to enable dialogue to reach a consensus on judiciary reform.

            Late on Tuesday, Netanyahu issued an appeal for dialogue, saying he believed that the gaps could be reduced or closed. “Let's talk, here and now, without preconditions or excuses, so together we can achieve a broad agreement for the good of all citizens of Israel,” he said.

            His critics have called on Netanyahu to freeze the legislation and start negotiations. Opposition leader Yair Lapid mocked the premier's appeal. 

            “Citizens of Israel, I have no pleasant way to say this: Prime Minister Netanyahu is lying,” Lapid said in a statement. “We have been trying to hold talks with them for many weeks.”

            Herzog's remarks came the morning after tens of thousands of Israelis protested outside the parliament ahead of the vote, the second mass demonstration in Jerusalem in recent weeks. 

            Israeli Palestinians, a minority that may have the most to lose by the overhaul, have mostly stayed on the sidelines, due to discrimination they face at home and Israel’s ongoing 55-year occupation of their Palestinian brethren in the West Bank.

            After more than seven hours of debate that dragged on after midnight, Netanyahu and his allies passed two clauses in the package of proposed changes that seek to weaken the country's Supreme Court and further empower ruling parliamentary coalitions.

            With a 63-47 vote, the Knesset approved measures that give the governing coalition control over judicial appointments and curtail the Supreme Court’s ability to review the legality of major legislation known as “Basic Laws.” The bills still require two additional readings in parliament to pass into law. 

            Also planned are proposals that would give the parliament the power to overturn Supreme Court rulings and control the appointment of government legal advisers. The advisers currently are professional civil servants and critics say the new system would politicize government ministries.

            The United States has called for restraint, and on Tuesday, the United Nations human rights chief called on Israel “to pause the proposed legislative changes and open them up for wider debate and reflection.”

            ""Such issues at the heart of rule of law deserve the fullest consideration in order to ensure that any changes promote, rather than diminish, the ability of the judiciary — and other branches of Government — to protect the rights of all people in Israel,” Volker Türk, the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement.

            German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann appeared to express concerns about the Israeli plan after a two-day visit that included a meeting with the overhaul’s architect, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and two of the people targeted by the changes, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and Supreme Court President Esther Hayut.

            It is “clear for me that we must fundamentally protect and strengthen the institutions of our liberal democracies,” Bushmann said in a statement, “because fundamental rights are, by their nature, minority rights and the majority must never have the last word.”

            According to a survey by the Israel Democracy Institute think tank published Tuesday, 66% of respondents think the Supreme Court should have the authority to strike down laws incompatible with the Basic Laws, and 63% think the current system for picking judges — a panel made up of politicians, judges and attorneys — should be maintained. 

            Almost three-quarters of the 756 respondents — 72% — said there should be compromise between the opposing political camps about proposed judicial changes.

            Herzog, who serves as the largely symbolic head of state, has tried to broker dialogue between the increasingly polarized camps and has called on Netanyahu and his allies to delay the contentious judicial overhaul. 

            Netanyahu's governing coalition is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties and took office in late December, after the country's fifth parliamentary elections in less than four years. The political deadlock was largely over the long-time leader's fitness to serve as prime minister while on trial for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes, charges Netanyahu has denied.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817219,Gonzaga and Saint Mary's on collision course for WCC title,"The challenge that faces Gonzaga coach Mark Few is the same one facing Saint Mary's counterpart Randy Bennett this week: Avoid looking past must-win mid-week games to their showdown on Saturday night in Spokane, Washington.

            The Bulldogs first have to play San Diego on Thursday night; the Gaels take on Pacific an hour earlier.

            “I hope we're feeling that his thing is winding down and we're getting closer,” Few said. “We've got three games left.”











            None bigger than that one Saturday, though.

            No. 12 Gonzaga (23-5, 12-2) is a game back of No. 15 Saint Mary's (24-5, 13-1) in what is shaping up to be one of the most hotly contested races in the West Coast Conference in years. It will be the 11th time the two teams have played when both were ranked, the Gaels got the better of the last meeting with a 78-70 overtime victory earlier this month.

            The Bulldogs have won six straight regular-season titles since sharing with Saint Mary's in 2016. But assuming the Gaels get past the Tigers on Senior Night, they will have an opportunity to not only sweep Gonzaga but clinch their first outright conference championship since 2012, when they went on to beat the Bulldogs for the league tournament title.

            “It's all about compartmentalizing,” the Gaels' Logan Johnson said. “We talked about it a lot last year — we had BYU, San Francisco, San Diego, Gonzaga to finish at home. That's a tough stretch. And this is no different here. It's all about taking it piece by piece, possession by possession. You can't think about the next game or what's around the corner.”

            The first matchup between Gonzaga and Saint Mary's this season was epic: The Bulldogs led by eight at halftime, Mitchell Saxen's layup for the Gaels with 8 seconds left forced overtime, and freshman phenom Aidan Mahaney dominated the extra session as Saint Mary's pulled away for its 10th win over its rival since the 2009-10 season.

            “We are making this a thing now where we want to be able to rival with them every time,"" Mahaney said afterward. ""This isn’t an upset or anything like that. We’re not going to just talk about it. We’re going to put in the work.”

            BIG GAMES IN THE BIG 12

            The Big 12 has been the toughest league in the country by almost any metric this season. Six teams are in the Top 25 this week, and according to various projections, anywhere from seven to nine teams could land NCAA Tournament bids.

            Third-ranked Kansas headed to No. 24 TCU on Monday night to kick off another brutal week in the Big 12. Ninth-ranked Baylor visits No. 14 Kansas State and No. 23 Iowa State visits No. 8 Texas on Tuesday night. Then on Saturday, Texas and Baylor highlight a slate that includes the Wildcats visiting NCAA bubble team Oklahoma State, fellow bubble team West Virginia visiting the Jayhawks, Oklahoma heading to Iowa State and the Horned Frogs visiting Texsa Tech.

            BIG EAST BUSINESS

            The toughest race besides the Big 12 might belong to the Big East, where No. 10 Marquette has one-game lead on No. 16 Xavier, No. 19 Creighton and No. 20 Providence. And the Golden Eagles and Bluejays face off Tuesday night in Milwaukee in a game that could go a long way toward determining the champion.

            The Friars have a tough game Wednesday night against No. 19 UConn, which has fallen four games behind Marquette and will try to play spoiler down the stretch. Xavier plays Villanova and Seton Hall this week.

            SEC SUCCESS

            Tennessee has been one of the standard-bearers in the SEC all season, but Texas A&M returned to the poll this week for the first time since November. The No. 11 Volunteers face the No. 25 Aggies on Tuesday night in College Station.

            No. 2 Alabama leads the Aggies by a game in the league standings. The Crimson Tide visits South Carolina on Wednesday night before a tough game against Arkansas on Saturday in Tuscaloosa. 

            OTHER GAMES TO WATCH

            No. 3 Purdue leads the Big Ten by 1 1/2 games over No. 21 Northwestern with a showdown coming Saturday against No. 14 Indiana, which is another game back. The Hoosiers have to get by Michigan State on Tuesday night.

            In the ACC, sixth-ranked Virginia has a half-game lead over No. 13 Miami with trips to Boston College and North Carolina this week. The Hurricanes visit Virginia Tech before facing Florida State on Saturday.

            Fourth-ranked UCLA has a 1 1/2-game lead in the Pac-12 over No. 7 Arizona — the teams meet in their regular-season finales on March 4. But first, the Bruins visit Utah and Colorado this week while the Wildcats face Arizona State.

            AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25The challenge that faces Gonzaga coach Mark Few is the same one facing Saint Mary's counterpart Randy Bennett this week: Avoid looking past must-win mid-week games to their showdown on Saturday night in Spokane, Washington.The Bulldogs first have to play San Diego on Thursday night; the Gaels take on Pacific an hour earlier.“I hope we're feeling that his thing is winding down and we're getting closer,” Few said. “We've got three games left.”None bigger than that one Saturday, though.No. 12 Gonzaga (23-5, 12-2) is a game back of No. 15 Saint Mary's (24-5, 13-1) in what is shaping up to be one of the most hotly contested races in the West Coast Conference in years. It will be the 11th time the two teams have played when both were ranked, the Gaels got the better of the last meeting with a 78-70 overtime victory earlier this month.The Bulldogs have won six straight regular-season titles since sharing with Saint Mary's in 2016. But assuming the Gaels get past the Tigers on Senior Night, they will have an opportunity to not only sweep Gonzaga but clinch their first outright conference championship since 2012, when they went on to beat the Bulldogs for the league tournament title.“It's all about compartmentalizing,” the Gaels' Logan Johnson said. “We talked about it a lot last year — we had BYU, San Francisco, San Diego, Gonzaga to finish at home. That's a tough stretch. And this is no different here. It's all about taking it piece by piece, possession by possession. You can't think about the next game or what's around the corner.”The first matchup between Gonzaga and Saint Mary's this season was epic: The Bulldogs led by eight at halftime, Mitchell Saxen's layup for the Gaels with 8 seconds left forced overtime, and freshman phenom Aidan Mahaney dominated the extra session as Saint Mary's pulled away for its 10th win over its rival since the 2009-10 season.“We are making this a thing now where we want to be able to rival with them every time,"" Mahaney said afterward. ""This isn’t an upset or anything like that. We’re not going to just talk about it. We’re going to put in the work.”BIG GAMES IN THE BIG 12The Big 12 has been the toughest league in the country by almost any metric this season. Six teams are in the Top 25 this week, and according to various projections, anywhere from seven to nine teams could land NCAA Tournament bids.Third-ranked Kansas headed to No. 24 TCU on Monday night to kick off another brutal week in the Big 12. Ninth-ranked Baylor visits No. 14 Kansas State and No. 23 Iowa State visits No. 8 Texas on Tuesday night. Then on Saturday, Texas and Baylor highlight a slate that includes the Wildcats visiting NCAA bubble team Oklahoma State, fellow bubble team West Virginia visiting the Jayhawks, Oklahoma heading to Iowa State and the Horned Frogs visiting Texsa Tech.BIG EAST BUSINESSThe toughest race besides the Big 12 might belong to the Big East, where No. 10 Marquette has one-game lead on No. 16 Xavier, No. 19 Creighton and No. 20 Providence. And the Golden Eagles and Bluejays face off Tuesday night in Milwaukee in a game that could go a long way toward determining the champion.The Friars have a tough game Wednesday night against No. 19 UConn, which has fallen four games behind Marquette and will try to play spoiler down the stretch. Xavier plays Villanova and Seton Hall this week.SEC SUCCESSTennessee has been one of the standard-bearers in the SEC all season, but Texas A&M returned to the poll this week for the first time since November. The No. 11 Volunteers face the No. 25 Aggies on Tuesday night in College Station.No. 2 Alabama leads the Aggies by a game in the league standings. The Crimson Tide visits South Carolina on Wednesday night before a tough game against Arkansas on Saturday in Tuscaloosa.OTHER GAMES TO WATCHNo. 3 Purdue leads the Big Ten by 1 1/2 games over No. 21 Northwestern with a showdown coming Saturday against No. 14 Indiana, which is another game back. The Hoosiers have to get by Michigan State on Tuesday night.In the ACC, sixth-ranked Virginia has a half-game lead over No. 13 Miami with trips to Boston College and North Carolina this week. The Hurricanes visit Virginia Tech before facing Florida State on Saturday.Fourth-ranked UCLA has a 1 1/2-game lead in the Pac-12 over No. 7 Arizona — the teams meet in their regular-season finales on March 4.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817220,Nuggets' Jokic has a chance to join some exclusive clubs,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The clubs that Nikola Jokic might be on the cusp of entering are highly exclusive.

            There’s the three-consecutive-MVP club, with only Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Larry Bird as its current members. Then there’s the averaged-a-triple-double club, which includes only Oscar Robertson and Russell Westbrook.

            Jokic doesn’t care about being added to either of those lists. It might happen anyway.











            The best team in the Western Conference so far has been the Denver Nuggets, and the biggest reason why they’re atop the standings coming out of the All-Star break is the 28-year-old Serbian big man who was the league’s best player two years ago, was the league’s best player last year and very well might be the best again this year.

            “I can’t lie,” Cleveland guard Donovan Mitchell said. “I don’t know if you all have been watching what Jokic has been doing. It’s ... outrageous, to be honest. I don’t know how many people have won it three times in a row. I definitely feel like I’m in that conversation as well, but he’s otherworldly right now.”

            Jokic’s numbers: 24.7 points, 11.5 rebounds and 10.1 assists per game, on 63% shooting from the field, 39% from 3-point range. Such a collection of stats is unprecedented; others have scored more, assisted more, rebounded more and shot better, but nobody has ever had all those averages and percentages in one season — especially not a big man.

            Westbrook is a guard. Robertson was a guard. In their average-a-triple-double years — four for Westbrook, one for Robertson — they didn’t shoot better than 48%. Jokic is making almost two of every three shots he takes, and that’s with him as the top priority for every defense Denver faces.

            “I just think that he just plays at his own pace,” Toronto’s Pascal Siakam said. “You can’t really disrupt what he does. He just plays at his own pace. He does what he wants. His passing ability, the scoring, how smart he is on the basketball court. Yeah, it’s dope to watch.”

            The Nuggets are five games ahead of Memphis — Denver has 23 games left, the Grizzlies have 25 — for the top spot in the Western Conference. They're well on their way to securing the No. 1 seed and home-court advantage throughout at least the first three rounds of the playoffs. 

            And that would be huge, given that Denver’s 27-4 home record is the best in the NBA. Evidently, teams don’t like playing at 5,280 feet above sea level. And they can’t match the way Jokic thinks, with his brain in home games at 5,287 feet above sea level. He’s played in 51 games; the Nuggets are 38-13 in those contests, 3-5 when he doesn’t play.

            Denver coach Michael Malone was asked how he would create a pie chart to show the components that make Jokic great.

            “Athleticism, 1%. I’ll start there,” Malone said. “Then I would say the big pieces of that Serbian pie would be IQ and unselfishness, the ability to make every one of his teammates better. What I marvel at, having coached Nikola for eight years now, the thing that I’m just blown away by is the consistency to being great. I mean, there are a lot of great players in this league. But for Nikola to win the MVP, to win it again, and now he’s putting together an even better season ... it just speaks to the fact that he is so damn consistent.”

            Conventional wisdom would have been that Jokic’s numbers, good enough to win him the last two MVP awards, would take a dip this season simply because the Nuggets were getting two of their best players — Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. — back from injury. 

            It hasn’t happened, or at least, not much. His scoring is down slightly. Rebounds, down slightly. Assists, up slightly. Murray and Porter are getting their numbers — largely because Jokic looks for them every chance he gets — and he’s still finding the way to fill all the columns next to his name on the stat sheet as well.

            “That, and the ability to make everyone around him better, is what allows Nikola to be a historically great player in this league,” Malone said.

            And it should be noted that the player who is least impressed by Jokic is, well, Jokic.

            If he had his way, he’d show up, play games, hop on YouTube to watch horse racing — he owns harness horses, and was even driving one when the Nuggets’ brain trust showed up in Serbia to surprise him with last year’s MVP award — and live very quietly.

            The West should be an absurd race down the stretch. Phoenix just got Kevin Durant. The Los Angeles Lakers have LeBron James trying to make a playoff push. The defending champion Golden State Warriors could have Stephen Curry back from his injury before too long. Dallas got Kyrie Irving to play with Luka Doncic. The Los Angeles Clippers will be adding Westbrook. Sacramento is poised to end its long playoff drought.

            If nobody is talking about the Nuggets, Jokic won’t complain.

            “We don’t need it,” Jokic said. “We know what we’re doing. We know what we’re trying to do. We believe in the basketball system that we have built over the years, so it works. It’s still working. Nothing can affect us from outside. We are thinking about ourselves and just how to get better.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817221,Macron champions pension plan as key to French economy,"PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron advocated Tuesday for his contested plan to increase the pension eligibility age as part of the pro-business policies he has promoted since he took office in 2017, saying people need to work “a little longer” to make the system financially sustainable. 

            Macron visited the Rungis International Market in the southern suburbs of Paris for his first public discussion with French workers since lawmakers started debating the government's pension-reform legislation earlier this month, prompting series of strikes and protests. 

            The bill, which the Senate expects to start considering on March 2, would push back the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64 and require people to have worked for at least 43 years to be entitled to a full pension, amid other measures.











            “People know that yes, on average, you have to work a little longer, all of them, because otherwise we won’t be able to finance our pensions properly,” Macron said. 

            All French retirees receive a state pension. The system is projected to go into a deficit in the coming decade as France’s population ages.

            Macron argued that the proposed changes would “create more wealth for the country because we will have more hours worked.” He said the plan would allow early retirements for people who started working at a young age or in jobs with difficult conditions, such as working at night or in the cold and carrying heavy loads.

            “I believe in work. I’ve been fighting for that as president for almost six years now, and all the reforms we’ve made are going in that direction,"" the French leader said. ""Because work is what gives you a salary, it is what gives you the possibility to support your family.”

            Macron made the pension plan a key priority of his second term when he campaigned for reelection last year. 

            During his first term as president, Macron's government made other changes that it said would make France's labor market more flexible and revitalize the country's economy. They include making it easier to hire and fire workers, cutting business taxes, and making it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.

            Critics argue the changes fray an important social safety net.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817223,Treasury deputy: Russia sanctions are degrading its military,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American and allied sanctions and export controls are constraining Russia’s ability to wage war on Ukraine by degrading its military, a top Treasury Department official said Tuesday, adding that more sanctions will be imposed on the Kremlin in the coming days.

            Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington that as the war on Ukraine nears the one-year mark, U.S. sanctions are effectively resulting in military losses for Russia by straining its military machine.

            Russia is the world’s second-largest arms producer after the United States, but Adeyemo asserted that “today, Russia can’t produce enough arms to meet their basic needs and to be a supplier to the countries that rely on them.”











            The financial penalties imposed by the U.S. and its allies “have degraded Russia’s ability to replace more than 9,000 pieces of military equipment lost since the start of the war,” he said, adding, “Russia has also lost up to 50% of its tanks.”

            More than 30 countries, including the U.S., the EU nations, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and others — representing more than half the world’s economy — have imposed price caps on Russian oil and diesel, instituted export controls, frozen Russian Central Bank funds and restricted access to SWIFT, the dominant system for global financial transactions.

            Adeyemo said the U.S. plans to announce additional sanctions on Russia this week targeting its military manufacturing industry. President Joe Biden reiterated the need for additional sanctions in a speech Tuesday in Poland.

            U.S. officials say Moscow has turned to North Korea and Iran to resupply the Russian military with drones and surface-to-surface missiles. 

            “Our view is that it is a sign of weakness, not strength, that Russia today is forced to rely on Iran and North Korea for their military arms, from countries that have already been cut off from the international financial system,” he said.

            “While we have far more to do, we are succeeding in reversing the course of Russia’s budget and undercutting its military-industrial complex,” Adeyemo says. 

            As the invasion enters its second year, the U.S. will intensify its efforts to boost sanctions, Adeyemo said, including cracking down on sanctions evasion and putting economic pressure on countries and firms that continue to do business with Russia. 

            “The cost of doing business with Russia in violation of our policies is a steep one, and companies and financial institutions should not wait for their governments to make the decision for them,” he said.

            He acknowledged recent reports that Russia's economy is performing better than expected. This year, its economy is projected to outperform the U.K.’s, growing 0.3%, while the U.K. faces a 0.6% contraction, according to the International Monetary Fund.

            “While Russia’s economic data appears to be better than many expected early in the conflict,"" Adeyemo said, “our actions are forcing the Kremlin to use its limited resources to prop up their economy at a time where they would rather be investing every dollar in their war machine.”

            “The Russian economy you see today is nothing like the Russian economy you saw before the invasion.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817225,Wreckage of missing plane confirmed on Philippine volcano,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The wreckage of a small plane carrying two Filipino pilots and two Australian passengers was identified Tuesday on one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes, officials said.

            An aerial search found no sign of those aboard the Cessna 340, which crashed into a gully on the slope of Mayon volcano in Albay province, where it went missing after taking off Saturday enroute to Manila, aviation officials said.

            “The condition of the crew and passengers are not yet known as the exact site has not yet been reached by the search and rescue team due to bad weather,” the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said. It said investigators spotted the wreckage after three failed aerial searches Tuesday morning due to thick clouds.











            Only the tail section of the plane remained intact, said Eric Apolonio, spokesperson of the civil aviation agency.

            The Australians were working as consultants for Energy Development Corp., a large geothermal power company. The company said it has deployed teams backed by helicopters and drones to help in the search.

            Mayor Carlos Baldo of Camalig town said four teams of government personnel and volunteers, including mountaineers with satellite phones, began scaling the 8,077-foot (2,462-meter) volcano on Tuesday morning after the weather cleared. They should be able to reach the crash site on Wednesday, he said.

            “It’s a difficult mission,” said Baldo, who is overseeing the search and rescue, citing Mayon’s restiveness, steep slope and the fickle weather.

            Villagers are normally prohibited from entering a permanent danger zone 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) around Mayon, which last erupted in 2018, displacing tens of thousands of residents. But the government's volcano monitoring agency allowed the search for the plane.

            Security has also become a concern after two soldiers helping in the search were fatally shot Monday by five suspected communist New People’s Army guerrillas in a market where they were buying supplies, military officials said.MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The wreckage of a small plane carrying two Filipino pilots and two Australian passengers was identified Tuesday on one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes, officials said.An aerial search found no sign of those aboard the Cessna 340, which crashed into a gully on the slope of Mayon volcano in Albay province, where it went missing after taking off Saturday enroute to Manila, aviation officials said.“The condition of the crew and passengers are not yet known as the exact site has not yet been reached by the search and rescue team due to bad weather,” the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said.

The practice has kept hired workers from paying large amounts of money to employment agencies and was praised in a BBC report.Ignacio led a delegation to visit Taiwan on Friday (Feb. 17), and visited I-Mei’s Nankan plant on the last day of his visit to get a grasp of the company’s Filipino employees’ work and life there.They welcomed the OWWA head, who live-streamed his interaction with his overseas compatriots. Many of the workers took photos with Ignacio. Later, Ignacio said during an address that he was very proud of the people of his country who work hard overseas.Senior quality control worker Arana Dahlia Lorenzo, who has been working for I-Mei for 13 years, told Ignacio that I-Mei has been treating Filipino workers very well. Lorenzo said her sister also came to work for I-Mei. Lorenzo expressed her gratitude to I-Mei for the care she received and hoped to continue working for the company into the future.Ignacio said he saw Filipino workers were happy with I-Mei and that the company’s friendly attitude toward them was beyond his expectations.",2023/2/21,2061,Business

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817250,Russia suspends only remaining major nuclear treaty with US,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin declared Tuesday that Moscow was suspending its participation in the New START treaty — the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the United States — sharply upping the ante amid tensions with Washington over the fighting in Ukraine.

            Speaking in his state-of-the-nation address, Putin also said that Russia should stand ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the U.S. does so, a move that would end a global ban on nuclear weapons tests in place since the end of the Cold War.

            Explaining his decision to suspend Russia's obligations under the 2010 New START treaty, Putin accused the U.S. and its NATO allies of openly declaring the goal of Russia's defeat in Ukraine.











            “They want to inflict a ‘strategic defeat’ on us and try to get to our nuclear facilities at the same time,"" he said, declaring his decision to suspend Russia’s participation in the treaty. He later sent a draft bill on the pact’s suspension to the Kremlin-controlled parliament, which is expected to quickly rubber-stamp it Wednesday. The document says that it will be up to the Russian president to resume Moscow’s participation in the pact.

            Putin emphasized that Russia was not withdrawing from the pact altogether, and hours after his address, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the caps on nuclear weapons set under the treaty. 

            Russia also will continue to exchange information about test launches of ballistic missiles per earlier agreements with the United States, the ministry said.

            Noting that the decision to suspend Russia's participation in New START could be reversed, the Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to deescalate tensions and create a proper environment for the treaty's implementation. 

            The New START treaty envisages caps on the number of nuclear weapons and broad inspections of nuclear sites. Putin said such inspections don’t make sense after the U.S. and its allies declared the goal of dealing Russia a military defeat in Ukraine and helped the Ukrainian military mount strikes on Russian nuclear facilities.

            U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken deplored Putin's move as “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible,” noting that “we’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does.”

            He said that “we’ll, of course, make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies,” but emphasized that “we remain ready to talk about strategic arms limitations at any time with Russia irrespective of anything else going on in the world or in our relationship.”

            ""I think it matters that we continue to act responsibly in this area,"" Blinken told reporters on a visit to Greece. “It’s also something the rest of the world expects of us.”

            NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also voiced regret about Putin’s move, saying that “with today’s decision on New START, full arms control architecture has been dismantled.” 

            ""I strongly encourage Russia to reconsider its decision and respect existing agreements,” he told reporters.

            Putin argued that while the U.S. has pushed for the resumption of inspections of Russian nuclear facilities under the treaty, NATO allies had helped Ukraine mount drone attacks on Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.

            The Russian military said that it shot down the Soviet-built drones that struck two bomber bases deep inside Russia in December, but acknowledged that several servicemen were killed by debris that also damaged some aircraft.

            Putin on Tuesday mocked NATO's statement urging Russia to allow the resumption of the U.S. inspections of Russian nuclear weapons sites as “some kind of theater of the absurd.”

            “The drones used for it were equipped and modernized with NATO's expert assistance,” Putin said. “And now they want to inspect our defense facilities? In the conditions of today's confrontation, it sounds like sheer nonsense.”

            Putin described the U.S. push for access to Russian nuclear sites as ""the height of hypocrisy and cynicism.” 

            “They want to inflict a ‘strategic defeat’ on us and at the same time, they keep trying to get to our nuclear facilities,” he charged.

            He noted he signed an order a week ago to deploy new land-based strategic missiles and asked: “Are they also going to poke their noses there?”

            The Russian leader also alleged that a NATO statement on New START raised the issue of the nuclear weapons of Britain and France, which are part of the alliance's nuclear capability but aren't included in the U.S.-Russian pact.

            “They are also aimed against us. They are aimed against Russia,” Putin said of the European weapons. “Before we return to discussing the issue, we need to understand what are the aspirations of NATO members Britain and France and how we take it into account, their strategic arsenals that are part of the alliance's combined strike potential.""

            Then-presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev signed the New START treaty in 2010. The pact limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The agreement envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify compliance.

            Just days before the treaty was due to expire in February 2021, Russia and the United States agreed to extend it for another five years.

            Russia and the U.S. have suspended mutual inspections under New START since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Moscow last fall refused to allow their resumption, raising uncertainty about the pact’s future. Russia also indefinitely postponed a planned round of consultations under the treaty.

            The U.S. State Department has said that Russia’s refusal to allow the inspections “prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control.” It noted that nothing prevents Russian inspectors from conducting inspections of U.S. facilities.

            Putin on Tuesday challenged the U.S. assertion, alleging that Washington has rejected some Russian requests for visits to specific U.S. facilities.

            “We aren't allowed to conduct full-fledged inspections under the treaty,"" he said. “We can't really check anything on their side.” 

            He alleged that the U.S. was working on nuclear weapons and some in the U.S. were pondering plans to resume nuclear tests banned under the global test ban that took effect after the end of the Cold War. 

            “In this situation, Rosatom (Russia's state nuclear corporation) and the Defense Ministry must ensure readiness for Russian nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said. “We naturally won't be the first to do it, but if the U.S. conducts tests we will also do it. No one should have dangerous illusions that the global strategic parity could be destroyed.”

            U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for Russia and the U.S. to immediately return to dialogue because “a world without nuclear arms control is a far more dangerous and unstable one with potentially catastrophic consequences,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817251,"Amaro, former Real Madrid and Spain player, dies at 83","MADRID (AP) — Amancio Amaro, who helped Real Madrid win the European Cup and nine Spanish league titles in the 1960s and 70s, died on Tuesday. He was 83.

            Real Madrid, where Amaro was an honorary president, announced the news without giving a cause of death. It called Amaro “one of the greatest legends of our club and of world football. Always an example for Real Madrid and for the whole sporting world.”

            Amaro was a midfielder who also played for Spain when it won its first European Championship in 1964. He made 42 appearances for his country.











            He arrived from Deportivo La Coruña in 1962 and played 14 seasons for Madrid. In his 471 games, he scored 155 times and was the Spanish league top scorer twice.

            He starred when Madrid won the European Cup in 1966, scoring in the first round, quarterfinals, and the decider in the semifinals at Inter Milan. In the final, Amaro scored the equalizer as Madrid came from behind to beat Partizan 2-1.

            In 1984, Amaro coached Madrid B to the second division title, the only reserve team in Spanish soccer to achieve the feat. He also briefly coached the first team in 1984-85.

            Amaro is survived by a wife and six children.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817252,Thailand's PM suggests he will dissolve Parliament in March,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Tuesday that he will dissolve Parliament in March, paving the way for a general election to be held in May.

            The government’s four-year term expires on March 23, but in remarks to reporters after a Cabinet meeting, Prayuth suggested he would dissolve the House of Representatives before that. Prayuth also set May 7 as the election date, though details still need to be worked out. 

            Prayuth has headed a coalition government and is seeking another term. He originally came to power in 2014 when, as army commander, he led a military coup that ousted an elected civilian government. He did not run in the general election in 2019, but was the prime minister candidate of the military-backed Palang Pracharath party, which cobbled together a coalition government.











            Palang Pracharath for this year’s election has named Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan — also a retired general — its candidate for prime minister, while Prayuth has joined a new party, the Ruam Thai Sang Chart Party, or United Thai Nation Party, which has named him its candidate. 

            
                The opposition Pheu Thai party has been making a strong showing in early polls, and there is no clear front-runner in the race so far.

            Under Thailand’s Constitution, prime ministers do not have to be elected lawmakers. A joint session of the lower house and the Senate -- an appointed body generally representing the conservative views of the Thai establishment — selects the prime minister.

            Prayuth, under a constitutional provision affirmed last year by the courts, can serve only two more years under an eight-year limit.

            Government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said that if the election is held as expected in early May, the Election Commission will ratify the results in early July. The new session of Parliament would then convene and appoint a chair by mid-July and the selection of the new prime minister would be expected around the end of the month.

            Dissolving Parliament before the end of the government’s term would allow an official campaign period of 45-60 days.BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Tuesday that he will dissolve Parliament in March, paving the way for a general election to be held in May.The government’s four-year term expires on March 23, but in remarks to reporters after a Cabinet meeting, Prayuth suggested he would dissolve the House of Representatives before that. Prayuth also set May 7 as the election date, though details still need to be worked out.Prayuth has headed a coalition government and is seeking another term. He originally came to power in 2014 when, as army commander, he led a military coup that ousted an elected civilian government. He did not run in the general election in 2019, but was the prime minister candidate of the military-backed Palang Pracharath party, which cobbled together a coalition government.Palang Pracharath for this year’s election has named Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan — also a retired general — its candidate for prime minister, while Prayuth has joined a new party, the Ruam Thai Sang Chart Party, or United Thai Nation Party, which has named him its candidate.The opposition Pheu Thai party has been making a strong showing in early polls, and there is no clear front-runner in the race so far.Under Thailand’s Constitution, prime ministers do not have to be elected lawmakers. A joint session of the lower house and the Senate -- an appointed body generally representing the conservative views of the Thai establishment — selects the prime minister.Prayuth, under a constitutional provision affirmed last year by the courts, can serve only two more years under an eight-year limit.Government spokesperson Anucha Burapachaisri said that if the election is held as expected in early May, the Election Commission will ratify the results in early July. The new session of Parliament would then convene and appoint a chair by mid-July and the selection of the new prime minister would be expected around the end of the month.Dissolving Parliament before the end of the government’s term would allow an official campaign period of 45-60 days.",2023/2/21,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817253,Japanese startup unveils balloon flight space viewing tours,"TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese startup announced plans Tuesday to launch commercial space viewing balloon flights that it hopes will bring an otherwise astronomically expensive experience down to Earth. 

            Company CEO Keisuke Iwaya said passengers do not need to be billionaires, go through intense training or have the language skills needed to fly in a rocket.

            “It’s safe, economical and gentle for people,” Iwaya told reporters. “The idea is to make space tourism for everyone.” He said he wants to “democratize space."" 











            The company, Iwaya Giken, based in Sapporo in northern Japan, has been working on the project since 2012 and says it has developed an airtight two-seat cabin and a balloon capable of rising up to an altitude of 25 kilometers (15 miles), where the curve of the Earth can be clearly viewed. While passengers won't be in outer space — the balloon only goes up to roughly the middle of the stratosphere — they'll be higher than a jet plane flies and have an unobstructed view of outer space.

            The company teamed up with major Japanese travel agency JTB Corp., which announced plans to collaborate on the project when the company is ready for a commercial trip. Initially, a flight would cost about 24 million yen ($180,000), but Iwaya said he aims to eventually bring it down to several million yen (tens of thousands of dollars). 

            While Japanese space ventures have fallen behind U.S. companies like SpaceX, Iwaya said his aim is to make space more reachable. 

            SpaceX launched three rich businessmen and their astronaut escort to the International Space Station in April for $55 million each — the company's first private charter flight to the orbiting lab after two years of carrying astronauts there for NASA.

            But unlike a rocket or a hot air balloon, the Iwaya Giken vessel will be lifted by helium that can be largely reused, company officials said, and flights will safely stay above Japanese territory or airspace. The first trip is planned as early as later this year.

            The balloon, which can carry a pilot and a passenger, would take off from a balloon port in Hokkaido, rise for two hours to as high as 25 kilometers (15 miles) and stay there for one hour before a one-hour descent. The drum-shaped plastic cabin is 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in diameter and has several large windows to allow a view of space above or the Earth below, the company said.

            Applications for a space viewing ride opened Tuesday and will continue through the end of August. The first five passengers selected will be announced in October, company officials said, and flights will be approximately a week apart, depending on the weather.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817254,"Home Depot says it will raise pay for US, Canadian workers","Home Depot said Tuesday it’s investing $1 billion in wage increases for its U.S. and Canadian hourly workers.

            The Atlanta-based home improvement chain said every hourly employee will get a raise starting this month. Starting pay will be at least $15 per hour in all markets.

            Home Depot is one of many big retailers who have raised pay to attract workers in a strong U.S. job market, where unemployment is at its lowest level since 1969. Walmart announced in January that it would be raising its hourly wage to an average of $17.50, while Target invested $300 million in hourly wage increases last year.











            The pay raises could also help Home Depot head off a fledgling campaign to unionize its stores, which it opposes. Workers at a Home Depot in Philadelphia filed to hold a union election last September, saying workers weren’t benefiting from Home Depot’s strong sales and stores were understaffed. Workers at the store voted to reject the union in November.

            Home Depot employs 437,000 people in the U.S. and 34,000 in Canada. The vast majority are hourly employees, the company said. The company operates 2,000 stores in the U.S. and 182 stores in Canada. 

            “This investment will help us attract and retain the best talent into our pipeline,” Home Depot’s Chairman, President and CEO Ted Decker wrote in an email to employees. Decker noted that 90% of the chain’s store leadership started as hourly workers.Home Depot said Tuesday it’s investing $1 billion in wage increases for its U.S. and Canadian hourly workers.The Atlanta-based home improvement chain said every hourly employee will get a raise starting this month.

The Geotechnical Engineering Office (GEO) said in a press release on Friday (Feb. 17) that it had planted over 400 cherry blossom trees in the Zhinan Scenic Area over the years, and they were blooming.The office also said that it had recently completed a trail and its design was inspired by religious prayer. The new trail connects with other existing trails in the back mountain area.GEO Forest Recreation Section chief Pan Hsin-yuan (潘信元) said this year’s cherry blossoms bloom for roughly three weeks, from the second half of February to the first half of March, turning the scenic area into a romantic forest. He invited the public to pay a visit and enjoy the natural scenery.He recommended that Taipei residents take the Maokong Gondola, get off at Zhinan Temple Station, take the new trail up the mountain to enjoy the cherry blossoms, and later visit the Zhinan Temple.(GEO photos)",2023/2/21,1714,Travel & Cuisine

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817304,Pope intervenes again to restrict celebration of Latin Mass,"ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has intervened for the third time to crack down on the celebration of the old Latin Mass, a sign of continued friction with Catholic traditionalists.

            Francis reasserted in a new legal decree published Tuesday that the Holy See must approve new celebrations of the old rite by signing off on bishops’ decisions to designate additional parish churches for the Latin Mass or to let newly ordained priests celebrate it.

            The decree states that the Vatican’s liturgy office, headed by British Cardinal Arthur Roche, is responsible for evaluating such requests on behalf of the Holy See and that all requests from bishops must go there.











            For weeks, Catholic traditionalist blogs and websites have reported a further crackdown on the old Latin Mass was in the works, following Francis’ remarkable decision in 2021 to reimpose restrictions on its celebration that were relaxed in 2007 by then-Pope Benedict XVI.

            Francis said at the time that he was acting to preserve church unity, saying the spread of the Tridentine Mass had become a source of division and been exploited by Catholics opposed to the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church and its liturgy.

            Roche’s office followed up a few months later to double down on the Vatican’s position with a series of questions and answers that made clear that celebrating some sacraments according to the old rite was forbidden.

            The new decree doesn’t restrict the celebration further but merely repeats what was previously declared. Its insistence on Roche’s authority in the process appeared aimed primarily at quashing traditionalist claims that the cardinal had exceeded his mandate. Francis signed off on the decree Monday during a private audience with Roche.

            Francis’ crackdown on the old Mass outraged his conservative and traditionalist critics, many of whom have also attacked him for his focus on the environment, social justice and migrants. 

            Francis says he preaches the Gospel and what Jesus taught, and has defended the restrictions by saying they actually reflect Benedict’s original goal while curbing the way his 2007 concession was exploited for ideological ends.

            Joseph Shaw, chairman of the Latin Mass Society in Britain, which promotes the old Mass, called the new document “grave” since it confirmed that bishops need explicit permission from Roche’s office to use parish churches for Tridentine Masses.

            In a series of tweets, Shaw noted that when the office has been asked for such permissions to date, the office “has typically been restricting the number of locations and giving the permission for only two years.”

            He said that would lead to uneven access to the old Mass, where it would be easy to find alternative locations in some places but impossible in others.ROME (AP) — Pope Francis has intervened for the third time to crack down on the celebration of the old Latin Mass, a sign of continued friction with Catholic traditionalists.Francis reasserted in a new legal decree published Tuesday that the Holy See must approve new celebrations of the old rite by signing off on bishops’ decisions to designate additional parish churches for the Latin Mass or to let newly ordained priests celebrate it.The decree states that the Vatican’s liturgy office, headed by British Cardinal Arthur Roche, is responsible for evaluating such requests on behalf of the Holy See and that all requests from bishops must go there.For weeks, Catholic traditionalist blogs and websites have reported a further crackdown on the old Latin Mass was in the works, following Francis’ remarkable decision in 2021 to reimpose restrictions on its celebration that were relaxed in 2007 by then-Pope Benedict XVI.Francis said at the time that he was acting to preserve church unity, saying the spread of the Tridentine Mass had become a source of division and been exploited by Catholics opposed to the Second Vatican Council, the 1960s meetings that modernized the church and its liturgy.Roche’s office followed up a few months later to double down on the Vatican’s position with a series of questions and answers that made clear that celebrating some sacraments according to the old rite was forbidden.The new decree doesn’t restrict the celebration further but merely repeats what was previously declared.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817305,Home Depot's strong quarter overshadowed by 2023 outlook,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Home Depot posted strong profits in its final quarter of 2022 but said it expects profits to slip this year, sending shares of the home improvement retailer skidding at the opening bell Tuesday.

            Home Depot has excelled over the past several year with so many people hunkered down at home, or searching for a new home in a pandemic. That boom has eased for a number of reasons and Americans are spending more on services outside the home now, diminishing some of the supercharged ring-ups of recent years at Home Depot. 

            The Atlanta company had a fourth-quarter profit of $3.36 billion, or $3.30 per share, which is 3 cents better than Wall Street had expected, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.











            Quarterly revenue of $35.83 billion was just shy of forecasts, but the focus was on the retailer’s expectations for 2023.

            Home Depot expects a decline in annual per-share earnings in the mid-single-digit percentage, which caught industry analysts off guard. Wall Street was also projecting a slight uptick in sales, but Home Depot said that would likely be flat.

            The company also said Tuesday that it would spend $1 billion on wage increases for its U.S. and Canadian hourly workers, starting this month.

            Starting pay will be at least $15 per hour in all markets.

            Shares fell almost 4% when markets opened. 

            Home Depot posted huge numbers during the pandemic as millions stuck at home either reworked the space where they lived, or found more spacious accommodations. All of that put the world's largest home improvement retailer in high demand, both for home owners, and on Wall Street. 

            The global economy, however, has been distorted as it tries to put the pandemic behind it, with inflation elevated everywhere and the booming housing market cooling down, partly due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve to cool inflation, namely raising interest rates. 

            U.S. home sales tumbled to the slowest pace in nearly a decade as soaring mortgage rates and sky high prices in 2022 pushed homeownership out of reach for many Americans.

            “After a year of defying gravity, the slowing economy and pressures on consumers have finally caught up with Home Depot,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. “To be fair, the final quarter results are not terrible – especially as they come off the back of a long period of extremely good growth – but they nevertheless represent a material slowdown and are the worst quarterly performance in two years.”

            The company also said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 10%, to $2.09, for an annual dividend of $8.36 per share.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817306,Millennial Money: How to avoid points and miles hoarding,"Most personal finance advice boils down to this: Save as much as you can, and spend as little as you can. That’s the simplest way to accumulate wealth, build investment income and achieve financial independence (even if it’s not so simple in practice).

            Yet when it comes to travel rewards — those points and miles earned through airline, hotel and credit card programs — this conventional wisdom is turned on its head. Saving a million miles might sound impressive, but it’s generally a poor financial decision.

            “I hear all the time from business travelers who ‘saved their miles for retirement,’ and are devastated to learn that the purchasing power of their miles isn’t what it would have been five, ten, fifteen years ago,” Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of travel rewards booking search tool Point.me, said in an email. “Programs have successfully made loyalty currencies feel so valuable that people are often reluctant to use them because they are afraid they are giving up too much value.”











            Several factors explain why hoarding travel rewards isn’t a great idea:

            — POINTS DEVALUE OVER TIME. Although 2022 was a rare exception where many points became more valuable because of the relative cost of cash fares, rewards generally lose their value over time.

            — THEY’RE UN-INVESTABLE. Unlike dollars, which can be invested to reap the benefit of compound interest over time, travel rewards just sit there.

            — SOME POINTS EXPIRE, AND PROGRAMS CAN ALWAYS GO BELLY UP. There’s nothing guaranteeing the value of points and miles except the companies offering them.

            Yet, despite these facts, the saving habit can be hard to undo. Especially for those with a psychological bias toward “maximization.”

            CAN’T GET NO SATISFACTION

            Analysis paralysis can pose one of the biggest challenges to inveterate points and miles hoarders. Making the decision to spend that pile of rewards accumulated during the pandemic is one thing. Actually spending them is another.

            “Airline revenue systems are intentionally opaque,” Funk said. “So even if your credit card offers the ability to transfer points to partners, your bank literally doesn’t have the mechanisms to guide you through which partner makes sense for a given trip, what the expected pricing should be or even how to book flights with that program.”

            This opacity freezes many would-be spenders in their tracks, making them second-guess whether a given redemption offers the best value. This bias toward getting the most value, while positive on its surface, can lead to a spiral of comparison shopping and waiting for the perfect redemption.

            “I just give the advice not to overthink it,” says Adam Nubern, a certified public accountant who specializes in serving digital nomads. “Don’t get caught up in the maximizing the redemption value rat race. Then you have to keep up with the program changes and all that. How many hours do you spend researching that? Do you want a part-time job as a points maximizer?”

            Not only does this “maximizer” mentality lead to more hoarding, it can also make you unhappier. A 2018 study by the Department of Psychology of Chengdu University in China found that maximizers tend to score lower on scores of overall well-being than those who accepted “good enough” options.

            In other words, those who obsessed over the best purchase were less happy with the outcome than those who took a more relaxed approach, so-called satisficers. The term “satisficing,” a combination of “satisfy” and “suffice,” is a decision-making process that involves collecting enough information to make an acceptable choice. It’s a great way to overcome travel reward overaccumulation.

            TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR POINTS

            Travel rewards bloggers have long hyped those redemptions that offer the absolute best value. Taking a first-class flight to Asia, for example, might offer 5 cents per mile in value, while an economy flight within the U.S. could yield only 1 or 2 cents per mile. This creates an incentive to use miles for the most lavish, luxurious options.

            But think about it this way: Those high-end redemptions only offer more value because the cash equivalent is so high. A round-trip flight to Asia can easily cost $10,000 when paying cash, which makes points and miles redemptions seem like a great value — but only by comparison.

            Instead, travelers sitting on a cache of points should keep it simple. Taking a flight to visit family? Use airline miles. Looking for a hotel during a road trip? Use credit card or hotel points. These redemptions might not get many likes on Instagram, but they’ll burn through those quickly depreciating rewards.

            Just make sure the redemption you choose doesn’t offer value too far below baseline. Use an online calculator to compare the value of using rewards or paying cash.

            But, when in doubt: Use those points.

            “I think, ’Well, dang, I don’t have to use actual money, so let’s go,” Nubern says. “I try not to get caught up in that decision fatigue. In my mind, I’m not using a dollar, so any kind of redemption is great, and I just go for it.”

In my mind, I’m not using a dollar, so any kind of redemption is great, and I just go for it.”This column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817307,EU climate czar: Putin's war accelerated green transition,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin unwittingly accelerated the European Union's green transition with his war in Ukraine, with the 27-nation bloc reducing its dependency on Russian fossil fuels and increasing its renewable energy use over the past year, the EU's climate czar said Tuesday.

            “The European Union now understands that if we want to increase our energy sovereignty, it can only go through renewables because we have very little gas left, we have almost no coal left, and we have no oil, Frans Timmermans, the commissioner in charge of the European Green Deal, said. 

            Speaking during an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Friday's one-year anniversary of the Russian invasion, Timmermans said Putin completely underestimated the EU's resilience when Moscow cut off most natural gas flows to Europe amid the war, a strategy European leaders have called energy blackmail. 











            “He’s been saying publicly that this winter Europeans would freeze and starve,"" Timmermans said. “Well, we neither froze nor starved because our food production was at high levels. There were no shortages. And our energy: We managed to make sure he didn’t use this weapon in the effective way.""

            The war, however, fueled an energy price crisis in the EU that sent the bills of households and businesses through the roof.

            “Our citizens did have to bear the brunt of his manipulations,"" Timmermans added. “But he didn’t get us. He didn’t divide us and he certainly didn’t get us on our knees.""

            In response to reduced supplies of Russian energy, the EU introduced last year counter measures that included launching a nearly 300 billion-euro ($320 billion) program to promote more efficient fuel use and a faster rollout of renewable power. 

            The EU also introduced embargoes on Russian coal and oil, accompanied by a price cap on Russian oil exports. In addition, the bloc diversified its energy sources by sealing deals for liquefied natural gas to compensate for the loss of Russian gas and fill its stocks for the winter while reducing its use of gas and electricity.

            As Putin continues to justify his invasion of Ukraine by accusing Western countries of threatening Russia, Timmermans said the Russian leader's use of energy as a weapon has backfired. In January, gas prices on the European spot market were back to their prewar level. 

            “He’s losing a lot of income because of this,"" Timmermans said. “He’s selling his oil and cut prices to India and China. He has to reduce the sale of gas. He thought he could use that as a weapon. But the weapon turned against him, and it has sped up.""

            Some EU member countries reduced their natural gas consumption by more than 20% this year, Timmermans said. The war ""is changing the way we relate to energy and it’s helping us understand that we need to move quicker in terms of renewable energy,"" he added.

            According to the bloc’s data, gas consumption in the EU dropped by 19.3% in the period August 2022-January 2023, compared with the average gas consumption for the same months between 2017 and 2022.

            To meet the EU's goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050, the European Commission supports a target of 45% renewable energy sources in the bloc’s energy mix by 2030 as countries look to wind and solar power to bolster their energy security.

            According to a review by global energy think tank Ember, “a massive scale-up in clean energy is on its way"" in Europe. Wind and solar in 2022 generated a record 22% of the bloc's electricity and for the first time overtook gas, which accounted for 20%. Coal power accounted for 16%. 

            “We have a unique opportunity to move toward clean technologies that will need no emissions, that will be circular, so you don’t have to keep digging up primary materials,"" Timmermans said. “If we move in that direction, clean growth is possible. I am optimistic about the potential of that, but we have to move quicker than we’re moving now.""

            Timmermans insisted that time is running out to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C. 

            “And we need to make sure that our policies will keep us well below 2 degrees of temperature increase,"" he added. “If we continue with the policies of today, we will overshoot 2 degrees and we will be in a completely different territory.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817308,"Border, Bidens, COVID: House GOP casts wide net in probes","WASHINGTON (AP) — The security at the U.S. border with Mexico. The origins of COVID-19. The treatment of parents who protest “woke” school board policies. 

            These are among the far-reaching and politically charged investigations House Republicans are launching, along with probes of President Joe Biden and his family, an ambitious oversight agenda that taps into the concerns of hard-right conservatives but risks alienating other Americans focused on different priorities.

            Republicans have tasked every House committee with developing an oversight budget, and GOP leaders are educating rank-and-file lawmakers — many have never had subpoena powers — with how-to courses including “Investigations 101.” They are planning to take their investigations on the road to stir public interest, including a border hearing this week in Yuma, Arizona.











            “We have a constitutional duty to do oversight,"" Rep. Jim Jordan told The Associated Press in an interview. He is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and its powerful new select subcommittee on what Republicans call the “weaponization” of the federal government.

            Jordan, R-Ohio, said his goal is “to figure out what legislative changes need to be made to help stop the egregious behavior that we discovered.”

            The approach is all part of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s effort to steer his new majority to one of the core roles of the legislative branch, oversight of the executive, as he promised voters ahead of the fall election. But powered by some of the more firebrand figures in the GOP, the investigations pose a high-risk, high-reward proposition that is quickly drowning out much of the other House business.

            The first hearing of the “weaponization” of the federal government, perhaps the signature panel of the new House majority ostensibly modeled after the post-Watergate Church Commission, devolved into a litany of allegations and theories about the Bidens, the FBI and the coronavirus, among others. The far-flung ideas are familiar to consumers of conservative media, and often linked, but may not necessarily be top of mind for the wider public. 

            Timothy Naftali, a professor at New York University and a scholar of the Nixon era, said congressional oversight is one of the functions of good governance, but he warned that “one of the possible downsides is you end up with paralysis.”

            “Oversight is healthy,” Naftali said. “Then it’s a question of what the goal of oversight is.”

            Naftali said that while Americans may share many of the same questions and concerns Republicans are raising on topics like the origins of COVID-19 or the ability of the FBI to investigate Americans, he warned against a rising ”performative nature"" of Congress that results in political grandstanding without concrete legislative or policy solutions.

            “It's potentially very healthy if these investigations are animated by an empiricism — an ability to get to the facts,” he said. “But I’m not convinced of that.”

            Rather than focus on a singular mission — as happened with the impeachment probes of President Donald Trump by Democrats or the Republican investigations of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya — Republicans have cast a net both deep and wide.

            McCarthy, of California, laid out a road map last year and gathered key congressional staff for training sessions even before Republicans won the House majority in the fall election, according to a senior GOP leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private machinations.

            Some of the investigations underway into the U.S. border with Mexico are focused on potentially building an impeachment case against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

            
                A coronavirus committee will dig into the work of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former National Institutes of Health official who served both Republican and Democratic presidents but came under scrutiny during the Trump era for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

            The workings of the Justice Department and particularly the FBI are under deep scrutiny, particularly as federal law enforcement works to stamp out the alarming rise of domestic extremism in the U.S., which Republicans argue is a heavy-handed and overblown infringement of Americans' First Amendment rights. 

            The Justice Department's prosecutions of Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to overturn Biden's election victory and its investigations of parents making menacing and even threatening protests at school boards over the teaching of Black history or other “woke” policies are part of the GOP's probe of the FBI's handling of extremists.

            Subpoenas have already been issued by Jordan’s committee to the five largest technology companies — Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon — to appear for questioning about what Republicans assert is widespread corporate censorship of conservative voices.

            There will be national security investigations by two committees surrounding Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, which ending the 20-year war, as well as the U.S. approach to China.

            Since last summer, the White House has ramped up its ability to respond in real time to the House investigations, positioning personnel in various executive branch agencies to handle the onslaught of letters — and potential subpoenas — demanding information. 

            Inside the West Wing is a small team of lawyers and communications experts, some hand-picked and appointed by Biden, positioned to defend the Democratic president in what could shape up to be the biggest political battles in his career. 

            The Biden war room streams news outlets including Newsmax and Fox News Channel as aides prepare for attacks by House Republicans targeting the president's family, his administration and, ultimately, his legacy.

            Outside the White House, various groups of Biden allies known for crisis management and battles with Congress have formed to churn out opposition research on the Republican lawmakers leading these investigations and provide real-time fact-checks of the GOP lawmakers' claims.

            The White House sees the far-reaching Republican investigations as potentially overlapping and even interfering with one another and argues that the GOP priorities are not in line with those of the American people.

            “Peddling debunked conspiracy theories through stunt investigations may make good fodder for Fox News primetime, but it won’t help make a dozen of eggs or a gallon of milk cheaper for American families,” Ian Sams, White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations, said in a statement to the AP. 

            In many ways, the oversight agenda stands in for legislative action as McCarthy is forced to steer a slim House majority whose ranks are often divided, which makes it difficult to pass his party’s bills.

            Already the panels run by Jordan, a pugilistic politician and a former wrestling coach, have issued hundreds of letters and begun taking private transcribed interviews from people with information about the FBI that may or may not be made public.

            Jordan said he hopes to eventually offer legislation that would change some ways the federal government operates.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817309,How Section 230 helped shape speech on the Internet,"Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today. 

            A case the U.S. Supreme Court heard Tuesday, Gonzalez v. Google, challenges this law — namely whether tech companies are liable for the material posted on their platforms. 

            Justices will decide whether the family of an American college student killed in a terror attack in Paris can sue Google, which owns YouTube, over claims that the video platform’s recommendation algorithm helped extremists spread their message. 











            They seemed unlikely to side with the family, but indicated they are wary of Google’s claims that the law gives it and other companies immunity from lawsuits.

            A second case being heard Wednesday, Twitter v. Taamneh, also focuses on liability, though on different grounds. That case involves the family members of a man killed in an Istanbul nightclub attack for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. 

            The family accuses Twitter, Facebook and YouTube parent Google of assisting in the growth of IS by recommending extremist content through their algorithms. The platforms argue that they can’t be sued because they did not knowingly or substantially assist in the attack.

            The outcomes of these cases could reshape the internet as we know it. Section 230 won’t be easily dismantled. But if it is, online speech could be drastically transformed. 

            WHAT IS SECTION 230? 

            If a news site falsely calls you a swindler, you can sue the publisher for libel. But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can’t sue the company — just the person who posted it.

            That’s thanks to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”

            That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted — whether their complaint is legitimate or not.

            Politicians on both sides of the aisle have argued, for different reasons, that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity — or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government. 

            Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”

            WHERE DID SECTION 230 COME FROM? 

            The measure’s history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing “obscenity,” which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a “chilling effect” to hold someone liable for someone else’s content.

            That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of “The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,” a book about Section 230.

            Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.

            CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that “they exercised editorial control — so you’re more like a newspaper than a newsstand,” Kosseff said.

            That didn’t sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.

            “Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any claims for moderating content,” Kosseff said.

            WHAT HAPPENS IF SECTION 230 GOES AWAY?

            “The primary thing we do on the internet is we talk to each other. It might be email, it might be social media, might be message boards, but we talk to each other. And a lot of those conversations are enabled by Section 230, which says that whoever’s allowing us to talk to each other isn’t liable for our conversations,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University specializing in internet law. “The Supreme Court could easily disturb or eliminate that basic proposition and say that the people allowing us to talk to each other are liable for those conversations. At which point they won’t allow us to talk to each other anymore.”

            There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” Craigslist quickly removed its “personals” section, which wasn’t intended to facilitate sex work, altogether. But the company didn’t want to take any chances.

            “If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump’s lies, defamation, and threats,” said Kate Ruane, former senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union who now works for PEN America.

            Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lowest common denominator prevail.

            Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, a site that was infamous for graphic and extremist content.

            Any change to Section 230 is likely to have ripple effects on online speech around the globe. 

            “The rest of the world is cracking down on the internet even faster than the U.S.,” Goldman said. “So we’re a step behind the rest of the world in terms of censoring the internet. And the question is whether we can even hold out on our own.”Twenty-six words tucked into a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications have allowed companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google to grow into the giants they are today.A case the U.S. Supreme Court heard Tuesday, Gonzalez v.

But if someone posts that on Facebook, you can’t sue the company — just the person who posted it.That’s thanks to Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which states that “no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”That legal phrase shields companies that can host trillions of messages from being sued into oblivion by anyone who feels wronged by something someone else has posted — whether their complaint is legitimate or not.Politicians on both sides of the aisle have argued, for different reasons, that Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity — or at least have to earn it by satisfying requirements set by the government.Section 230 also allows social platforms to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services’ own standards, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”WHERE DID SECTION 230 COME FROM?The measure’s history dates back to the 1950s, when bookstore owners were being held liable for selling books containing “obscenity,” which is not protected by the First Amendment. One case eventually made it to the Supreme Court, which held that it created a “chilling effect” to hold someone liable for someone else’s content.That meant plaintiffs had to prove that bookstore owners knew they were selling obscene books, said Jeff Kosseff, the author of “The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet,” a book about Section 230.Fast-forward a few decades to when the commercial internet was taking off with services like CompuServe and Prodigy. Both offered online forums, but CompuServe chose not to moderate its, while Prodigy, seeking a family-friendly image, did.CompuServe was sued over that, and the case was dismissed. Prodigy, however, got in trouble. The judge in their case ruled that “they exercised editorial control — so you’re more like a newspaper than a newsstand,” Kosseff said.That didn’t sit well with politicians, who worried that outcome would discourage newly forming internet companies from moderating at all. And Section 230 was born.“Today it protects both from liability for user posts as well as liability for any claims for moderating content,” Kosseff said.WHAT HAPPENS IF SECTION 230 GOES AWAY?“The primary thing we do on the internet is we talk to each other. It might be email, it might be social media, might be message boards, but we talk to each other. And a lot of those conversations are enabled by Section 230, which says that whoever’s allowing us to talk to each other isn’t liable for our conversations,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University specializing in internet law. “The Supreme Court could easily disturb or eliminate that basic proposition and say that the people allowing us to talk to each other are liable for those conversations. At which point they won’t allow us to talk to each other anymore.”There are two possible outcomes. Platforms might get more cautious, as Craigslist did following the 2018 passage of a sex-trafficking law that carved out an exception to Section 230 for material that “promotes or facilitates prostitution.” Craigslist quickly removed its “personals” section, which wasn’t intended to facilitate sex work, altogether. But the company didn’t want to take any chances.“If platforms were not immune under the law, then they would not risk the legal liability that could come with hosting Donald Trump’s lies, defamation, and threats,” said Kate Ruane, former senior legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union who now works for PEN America.Another possibility: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms could abandon moderation altogether and let the lowest common denominator prevail.Such unmonitored services could easily end up dominated by trolls, like 8chan, a site that was infamous for graphic and extremist content.Any change to Section 230 is likely to have ripple effects on online speech around the globe.“The rest of the world is cracking down on the internet even faster than the U.S.,” Goldman said. “So we’re a step behind the rest of the world in terms of censoring the internet. And the question is whether we can even hold out on our own.”",2023/2/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817325,Traders troubled after Taliban shut Afghan-Pakistan crossing,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — The main crossing on the Afghan-Pakistan border remained shut Tuesday for the third straight day, officials said, after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers earlier this week closed the key trade route and exchanged fire with Pakistani border guards. 

            The closure has added to increasing tensions between the two neighboring countries and concerns for traders, for whom the Torkham crossing is a key commercial artery. Trucks carrying various items also travel to Central Asian countries from Pakistan, through Torkham crossing point and Afghanistan.

            On the Pakistani side of the border, in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, many merchants watched their trucks on Tuesday, loaded with fresh produce that could soon spoil, and waited for the crossing to reopen. 











            The Taliban closed Torkham on Sunday, angered by Pakistan’s alleged refusal to allow Afghan patients and their caretakers to enter Pakistan for medical care without travel documents. On Monday, Taliban fighters and Pakistani guards exchanged fire. There was no word on casualties on either side.

            According to Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, a director at the Pakistan-Afghanistan joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, nearly 7,00 trucks carrying various goods — including perishable fruit and vegetables — were stuck and lined up, waiting at the Pakistani side. 

            Hundreds of Pakistanis with valid travel documents were also waiting near Torkham for the crossing to reopen, he added. “It is causing problems for traders on both sides.” 

            There were also vehicles waiting on the other side of the border, in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province, but the Taliban have not commented on the issue. 

            Siddiqullah Quraishi, the Taliban’s appointed official at the Nangahar’s information and culture department, said Pakistan has not been abiding by its “commitments, so the crossing point was shut down.” He did not elaborate but advised Afghans to avoid traveling to the crossing until further notice. 

            Closures, cross-border fire and shootouts are common along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Each side has in the past closed Torkham, and also the Chaman crossing in southwestern Pakistan, over various reasons. 

            The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were withdrawing from the country after 20 years of war. Like the rest of the world, Pakistan has so far not recognized Afghanistan’s Taliban government. The international community has been wary of the Taliban’s harsh measures, imposed since their takeover, especially in restricting the rights of women and minorities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817326,Grealish's impact growing at Man City ahead of Leipzig match,"Jack Grealish might never put up the kind of cold, hard numbers that justify his status as English soccer’s first 100-million-pound player.

            For Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, weighing up the impact of Grealish goes far beyond simply counting up his goals and assists — though they are obviously welcome.

            It’s the control and balance Grealish brings to the City team which really stand out and it’s why, at the moment, the England winger is Guardiola’s go-to guy amid a turbulent period on and off the field for the club.











            City resumes its bid for a first Champions League title with a round-of-16 matchup with Leipzig, which hosts the first leg on Wednesday.

            Grealish was never a lock to play in these kind of big matches in his first season at City following that 100 million pound (then $139 million) move from Aston Villa in the offseason of 2021. Indeed, in the team’s run to an agonizing elimination by Real Madrid in the semifinals, Grealish played in just two of City’s six knockout-stage matches — both times as a second-half substitute. 

            Now, he appears to be one of the first names on Guardiola’s team sheet.

            Grealish has started in City’s last seven games in the Premier League and the last nine games in all competitions, having cemented his place on the left wing. His goal output remains modest — three in 28 games, all in the league — but two of them have come in the past month and in big games against Manchester United and Arsenal.

            It was notable last season how tentative Grealish was at times, maybe afraid of making a mistake and primarily concerned with retaining team shape out on the left.

            Now he is attacking the opponent’s area more, being more bold with his dribbling and making late runs into the box off the ball.

            And it’s not been lost on Guardiola, who has been impressed by Grealish’s improved “ambition and aggression.”

            “His commitment to take a risk and important decisions right now makes the difference,” Guardiola said. “He has to continue (doing this).”

            His ability to retain and recycle the ball has always been strong and, according to teammate Bernardo Silva, “helps us breathe.”

            For City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne, it has been important for Grealish to forget about the critics and focus on adapting to City’s way of playing under Guardiola. Grealish was the main man at Villa, but is just one of many top players at City.

            “People look at the stats all the time but he does very important things for us,” De Bruyne said. “We’re winning a lot of games and he’s a big part of that.”

            Grealish might have some more competition on the left, however, as Phil Foden is back in favor after missing matches since the World Cup because of concerns about his fitness and form. Foden made his first start in a month in the 1-1 draw with Nottingham Forest, a match that saw Grealish set up the goal by Silva.

            Still, Guardiola’s front three of Grealish, Erling Haaland and Riyad Mahrez looks set in stone for the big games. Grealish said a big part of his decision to move to City was so he could play in the Champions League and he is finally getting that opportunity. 

            NKUNKU’S RETURN

            Christopher Nkunku made an appearance as a second-half substitute against Wolfsburg in the German league on Saturday, for his first game since sustaining a left knee injury in training just before flying out to the World Cup with France.

            The forward is expected to be on the bench again against City, though fellow attacker Dani Olmo remains out with a hamstring problem.

            LITTLE PEP

            It’ll be Pep vs. Little Pep in Red Bull Arena.

            Leipzig center back Joško Gvardiol is nicknamed “Little Pep” because of the similarities of his last name with that of City’s manager.

            Gvardiol, a Croatia international, was one of the best defenders at the World Cup and might be treating the Champions League as something of a shop window ahead of a potential move at the end of the season.

            PEDIGREE

            Leipzig, which is fifth in the German league and has lost only once in its last 20 games in all competitions, has pedigree in the Champions League after reaching the semifinals in 2020. Last year, the team lost at City 6-3 in the group stage and won the return match 2-1 when City was already sure of advancing.

            City lost in the Champions League final to Chelsea in 2021 in the team’s best run in the competition.

Indeed, in the team’s run to an agonizing elimination by Real Madrid in the semifinals, Grealish played in just two of City’s six knockout-stage matches — both times as a second-half substitute.Now, he appears to be one of the first names on Guardiola’s team sheet.Grealish has started in City’s last seven games in the Premier League and the last nine games in all competitions, having cemented his place on the left wing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817328,Trial opens for former Kosovo fighter accused of war crimes,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A former fighter with the Kosovo Liberation Army was responsible for the murder of one person and the illegal detention and torture of nearly 20 more during his country's war for independence from Serbia, an international prosecutor said Tuesday at the start of a war crimes trial.

            The defendant, Pjetёr Shala, insists he is innocent and has pleaded not guilty to four charges of war crimes at the European Union-backed Kosovo Specialist Chambers, a court that is part of the Kosovo legal system but based in the Netherlands.

            Later this year, the court is scheduled to begin the trial of Kosovo ex-President Hashim Thaci on charges including murder for his alleged role in atrocities as a guerrilla leader during the 1998-99 war. He denies all charges.











            Alex Whiting, an American lawyer who leads a prosecution office linked to the court, told a three-judge panel that there is enough evidence to convict Shala, despite what he described as a pervasive climate of witness intimidation in Kosovo.

            “We are confident that the evidence that will be presented during this trial will establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Shala is criminally responsible for the crimes charged in the indictment.”

            Shala, who was arrested nearly two years ago in Belgium, told judges: “Everything is fabricated” as he insisted he was “fully not guilty.”

            He is accused of mistreating ethnic Albanian Kosovars who were perceived as spies or collaborators with Serb forces at a makeshift detention center at a metal works in Kukёs, northern Albania, in May and June 1999.

            Whiting said that Shala took part in the brutal beating of detainees, leaving them “covered in blood, suffering from broken bones or unable to walk.” 

            Shala, 59, also was ""part of the group that murdered one of the detainees by beating him repeatedly and severely and shooting him in the leg causing him to bleed to death over a period of many hours,” Whiting said.

            Most of the people who died in the 1998-1999 war in Kosovo were ethnic Albanians. A 78-day NATO air campaign against Serbian troops ended the fighting, but tensions between Kosovo and Serbia remain tense.THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — A former fighter with the Kosovo Liberation Army was responsible for the murder of one person and the illegal detention and torture of nearly 20 more during his country's war for independence from Serbia, an international prosecutor said Tuesday at the start of a war crimes trial.The defendant, Pjetёr Shala, insists he is innocent and has pleaded not guilty to four charges of war crimes at the European Union-backed Kosovo Specialist Chambers, a court that is part of the Kosovo legal system but based in the Netherlands.Later this year, the court is scheduled to begin the trial of Kosovo ex-President Hashim Thaci on charges including murder for his alleged role in atrocities as a guerrilla leader during the 1998-99 war.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817331,Azpilicueta out of hospital after being kicked in head,"LONDON (AP) — Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta has been discharged from the hospital and is “recovering well” after being kicked in the head during an English Premier League game, the club said on Tuesday.

            Azpilicueta was taken off on a stretcher wearing a neck brace and breathing from an oxygen mask following a 10-minute stoppage after being hit in the face by an attempted overhead kick by Southampton player Sékou Mara in Chelsea's 1-0 loss at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.

            Chelsea said Azpilicueta sustained a concussion and was back at the club training ground.











            “The club’s medical team are closely monitoring Cesar’s condition, adhering to the important concussion protocols in place to ensure his safety,"" Chelsea said.

            “Cesar observed training today, before he starts working towards returning to the pitch.”

            The 33-year-old Azpilicueta joined Chelsea in 2012 and has helped the club win two Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2021. He was named captain in 2019.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817350,Democratic governors form alliance on abortion rights,"Democratic governors in 20 states are launching a network intended to strengthen abortion access in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court decision nixing a woman’s constitutional right to end a pregnancy and instead shifting regulatory powers over the procedure to state governments.

            Organizers, led by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, described the Reproductive Freedom Alliance as a way for governors and their staffs to share best practices and affirm abortion rights for the approximately 170 million Americans who live in the consortium’s footprint — and even ensuring services for the remainder of U.S. residents who live in states with more restrictive laws.

            “We can all coalesce,” New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in an interview ahead of a Tuesday announcement. She added that the court’s Dobbs decision that ended a national right to abortion “horrified” and put pressure on governors to act. “This is leveraging our strengths ... to have more of a national voice.”











            That includes, organizers said, sharing model statutory language and executive orders protecting abortion access, ways to protect abortion providers from prosecution, strategies to maximize federal financing for reproductive health care such as birth control, and support for manufacturers of abortion medication and contraceptives that face potential new restrictions from conservatives.

            Lujan Grisham noted the launch comes as a federal court in Texas considers a challenge to the nationwide availability of medication abortion, which now accounts for the majority of abortions in the U.S.

            In a statement, Newsom called the effort, which he and his aides spent months organizing, “a moral obligation” and a “firewall” to protect “fundamental rights.”

            The group includes executives of heavily Democratic states like California, where voters overwhelmingly approve of abortion rights, but also involves every presidential battleground state led by a Democrat, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tony Evers of Wisconsin.

            The alliance has secured its initial funding from the California Wellness Foundation and the Rosenberg Foundation, not-for-profits that often steer money to public health efforts focused on disadvantaged communities.

            While the organization is billed as national and nonpartisan, the makeup underscores that abortion access since Dobbs has settled essentially into two Americas that broadly track the platforms of the nation’s two major parties. That means greater access in states controlled by Democrats, tighter restrictions or practically outright bans in those controlled by Republicans.

            For example, 22 Democratic-run states have weighed in on the Texas challenge to medical abortions that was filed by many of the same litigant states that worked together to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. A similar contingent of Republican-led states has filed briefs in the Texas case urging a judge to reverse a decades-old approval by the Food and Drug Administration of medical abortions.

            Still, Newsom aides said the group would welcome Republicans, though they declined to name any GOP executives that Newsom or other Democratic governors might be recruiting to the consortium. Indeed, a handful of Republican governors support abortion rights broadly. 

            Lujan Grisham mentioned New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who has sent mixed messages on the issue. Sununu signed a state budget in 2021 that included a ban on abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy but also said after the Dobbs decision that abortion would remain legal in his state. He endorsed candidates in the November elections who favored further restrictions but also supports adding exemptions to the current law for victims of rape and incest.

            Lujan Grisham acknowledged that the alliance cannot make national policy or even impose policy across state lines. But she said there’s practical value in having executives and their staffs have a formal framework to communicate.

            She noted that New Mexico lawmakers now are considering how to affirm abortion access with a statute, even though she and others believe the state’s constitution already establishes the right.

            “The problem is everyone keeps challenging those constitutional interpretations,” she said. “We’re going to codify equality on abortion rights, reproductive rights and care in as narrow as possible way.” New Mexico’s process, she said, could become a model for other similarly situated states. 

            Governors’ offices in the alliance also have started working with advocacy groups that back abortion access.

            Jeanné Lewis, the interim CEO of Faith in Public Life, a progressive multistate faith-based organization, said having states work together to ensure abortion access is essential as states and federal lawmakers continue to consider bans and deeper restrictions.

            “It is important for governors to be in conversations now about shared solutions across state lines,” she said.

            Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Foundation of America, said states should be working together to protect abortion access, especially given the pending Texas case.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817352,Alligator kills 85-year-old Florida woman as she walked dog,"FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) — An 85-year-old woman was killed by an alligator while walking her dog in a senior living community on Florida's Atlantic Coast, officials said.

            The woman was walking her dog on Monday afternoon beside a canal in Spanish Lakes Fairway near Fort Pierce when the nearly 11-foot (3.3-meters) gator attacked the dog, St. Lucie Sheriff Ken Mascara said.

            A trapper from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission later tracked down the gator and deputies helped get it on a truck. It was taken from the scene.











            “FWC is in charge of the investigation, however we assisted with a helicopter and manpower,” Mascara said.

            The woman's name has not been released. Officials said the dog survived the attack, but its condition wasn't immediately known.

            Fatal alligator attacks are rare, but they do happen. In 2016, 2-year-old Lane Graves was killed by alligator as he was vacationing with his family from Nebraska at Walt Disney World. Since then hundreds of gators have been relocated from the area.

            According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, between 1948 and 2021 there have been 442 unprovoked alligator bites on humans, including 26 fatalities. The chances of a person in Florida being injured in an unprovoked alligator attack is about one in 3.1 million, according to the commission.

            Once on the endangered species list, the alligator has recovered to the point that wildlife officials estimate the Florida population at more than 1.3 million animals.

            Officials warn people to be careful around bodies of water, as well as against feeding alligators.

            “Although alligators can move quickly on land, they are not well adapted for capturing prey out of the water,” the agency's website said. “However, they can lunge at prey within a few feet of the shoreline.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817353,US Navy Mideast chief says Iran has 'attention of everyone',"ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iranian attacks in the waterways of the Middle East and elsewhere in the region “have the attention of everyone” as tensions rise over Tehran's advancing nuclear program, the head of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet said Tuesday. 

            Vice Adm. Brad Cooper also told The Associated Press that he's seen a rise in what he described as Iran's “malign activities” in the region over his two years leading the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. 

            While Cooper pointed to recent seizures of weapons by American and allied forces in the region as a success, he acknowledged that Iran has been able to carry out drone attacks targeting shipping in the Mideast and other assaults in the region. 











            “We’re focused on expanding our partnerships,"" Cooper said on the sidelines of Abu Dhabi's International Defense Exhibition and Conference. ""The short answer is the Iranian actions have the attention of everyone.”

            Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over Cooper's remarks. 

            The 5th Fleet patrols the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil transits. Its region also stretches as far as the Red Sea up to the Suez Canal, the waterway in Egypt linking the Mideast to the Mediterranean Sea, and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait off Yemen. 

            Under Cooper's command, which will end with the upcoming arrival of Rear Adm. George Wikoff in Bahrain, likely later this year, the 5th Fleet vastly expanded its use of drones and artificial intelligence to patrol those waterways. 

            Cooper said the Navy has reached the halfway mark of his goal to have 100 unmanned drones, both sailing and submersible, operating in the region with America's allies. The Navy also conducted a drill Monday with the United Arab Emirates with the systems, he added.

            But concerns about Iran have only grown in recent months as Tehran enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels and has enough fissile material for several nuclear bombs if it chooses to build them. 

            There have been several Iranian attacks on commercial shipping the region, including a still-murky drone assault on the tanker Campo Square on Feb. 10 that's been cited by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Iran carried out that attack, which wounded no one on board, according to a U.S. defense official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. 

            Iran has denied targeting the vessel, though it has denied other attacks attributed to it since the collapse of the nuclear deal following America's withdrawal from the accord in 2018. 

            “Obviously the nuclear component is all being handled via diplomatic means,"" Cooper said. ""I think over a two-year period, we have for sure seen an increase in the number of malign activities, much of which we’ve been catching just in the last 60 to 90 days.”

            The United States has, however, interdicted a number of ships carrying weapons bound for Yemen's Houthi rebels from Iran, and France as well as seized one. A United Nations arms embargo has prohibited weapons transfers to the Iranian-backed Houthis since 2014. 

            Cooper declined to say whether the increase in seizures represented new intelligence obtained by the U.S. or an increasing number of vessels heading to Yemen.

            “I won’t be able to get to the intelligence piece of it other than to say it’s an area that we’re clearly focused on with our partners,"" Cooper said. ""We’ve had a lot of success and we’re our job is to just remain vigilant and keep at the mission.”

            Iran also has briefly seized several of the American drones being tested in the region in late August and early September. However, Cooper said Iran hadn't made an attempt to do so again. 

            “The Iranian attempted seizures were flagrant. They were unwarranted. They were certainly unprofessional, but most importantly, they were a gross violation of international law,” Cooper said. 

            “Since then, we’ve had six exercises of varying scale, bilaterally and multilaterally. We’ve had no issues with Iran attempting to do anything with the drones.”

            Cooper added that with Israel now working directly with the U.S. military’s Central Command — as Arab nations in the region do — also offered additional support to counter Iran.

            “The perspective among regional leaders that the No. 1 threat, or the most-serious threat, is from Iran has allowed us to work more closely with Israel,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817354,"Global Citizen conference to unite political leaders, celebs","NEW YORK (AP) — Advocacy group Global Citizen will convene political, philanthropic, business and cultural leaders for a thought leadership conference in New York to tackle extreme poverty more quickly.

            The group announced Tuesday that Global Citizen NOW will be a two-day conference beginning April 27, co-chaired by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, as well as leaders of Barbados and Ghana, along with Coldplay’s Chris Martin and Tony winner and “Wolverine” star Hugh Jackman. Executives from Verizon, Cisco, Citi, and Procter & Gamble will join philanthropic leaders from Ford, Open Society, PepsiCo and Rockefeller foundations.

            “We’re bringing together this extraordinary group of amazing leaders, and everything is focused on action taking, and on impact,” said Hugh Evans, Global Citizen CEO. “We’re not going to host a single panel, a single session, unless there’s an action to be taken out of it.”











            The conference plans to create collaboration between various sectors to spur “urgent action” to end extreme poverty. 

            According to a Nature Energy report published last week, the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could push 141 million people globally into extreme poverty because of increased costs for fuel and the higher prices for goods and services.

            That would be on top of the 100 million people who COVID-19 returned to extreme poverty that the inaugural Global Citizen NOW tried to help last year. 

            “We see an opportunity to disrupt the model of global forums where world leaders get in a closed room and have private conversations that affect our planet and the next generation,” Evans said in a statement. “Money and solutions are on the table but aren’t deployed. Nothing changes and there’s no one to hold them accountable. We’re focused on turning ideas into impact.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817355,Iran sentences detained US-based opposition figure to death,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A senior member of a U.S.-based Iranian opposition group held by Iran and accused of orchestrating a deadly 2008 mosque bombing has been sentenced to death, authorities said Tuesday.

            Iran says Jamshid Sharmahd, a 67-year-old Iranian-German national and U.S. resident, is the leader of the armed wing of a group advocating the restoration of the monarchy that was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

            His family has said he was merely the spokesman for the opposition group and denied he was involved in any attacks. They accuse Iranian intelligence of abducting him from Dubai in 2020. His hometown is Glendora, California.











            German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the death sentence is “absolutely unacceptable"" and that there would be a “clear reaction,” without elaborating.

            She said Sharmahd did not have “even the beginning of a fair trial” and that consular access and access to the trial had been “repeatedly denied.” She also said he had been arrested “under highly questionable circumstances,” without elaborating.

            The death sentence — which can be appealed — comes against the backdrop of months of anti-government protests in Iran and a fierce crackdown on dissent. Monarchists based outside Iran support the protests, as do other groups and individuals with different ideologies. 

            The official website of Iran's judiciary said Sharmahd was convicted of plotting terrorist activities. He was tried in a Revolutionary Court, where proceedings are held behind closed doors and where rights groups say defendants are unable to choose their lawyers or see the evidence against them.

            Iranian authorities have accused him of planning a series of attacks, including the 2008 bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada Mosque in Shiraz, in which 14 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded. He has also been accused of working with U.S. intelligence and spying on Iran's ballistic missile program.

            State TV has said his group was also behind a 2010 bombing at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s mausoleum in Tehran that wounded several people.

            Iran says Sharmahd is the leader of Tondar, the militant wing of the opposition group known as the Kingdom Assembly of Iran. He had been previously targeted in an apparent Iranian assassination plot on U.S. soil in 2009.

            
                His family says he was passing through Dubai on his way to India for a business deal in July 2020 when he abruptly stopped responding to calls or messages from them. Location data showed his phone leaving a hotel near the airport and traveling south, across the border into neighboring Oman and to the port of Sohar, where the signal stopped.

            Two days later, Iran announced that Sharmahd had been captured in a “complex operation” and the Intelligence Ministry published a photo of him blindfolded.

            His family says he was held in solitary confinement for more than 18 months before being put on trial in February of last year.

            A Middle East expert with Amnesty International’s German branch, Katja Müller-Fahlbusch, said the organization is “appalled by the death sentence.”

            She said in a statement that the proceedings were “a show trial” and that “Iran withheld numerous rights from him, including the free choice of a lawyer.”

            Müller-Fahlbusch added that Sharmahd’s family has had “as good as no contact” with him for over two years, no one knows what prison he is in and “we have to assume that he has been a victim of torture.” In addition, his health has “worsened dramatically” in custody and Iranian authorities have “systematically denied him access to appropriate medical care,” she said.

            Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in Dubai and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living in the cosmopolitan city in the United Arab Emirates, which is a U.S. ally. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement.

            The U.S. State Department runs its Iran Regional Presence Office in Dubai, where diplomats monitor Iranian media reports and talk to Iranians.

            Iran has been rocked by more than five months of anti-government protests ignited by the death of a 22-year-old woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating Iran's strict Islamic dress code. The protesters have called for the overthrow of the country's ruling clerics.

            Security forces have attacked the demonstrators with live ammunition, bird shot and batons, rights groups say. At least 530 protesters have been killed and nearly 20,000 people have been arrested, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group monitoring the unrest.

            Iranian authorities have blamed the protests on hostile foreign powers, without providing evidence, and have not released official figures for those killed or arrested.

            Iran has executed four men accused of violence linked to the protests, and activists say at least 16 others have been sentenced to death.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817356,Walmart beats Q4 expectations but is cautious on guidance,"NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart on Tuesday reported strong sales during the holiday season as budget-conscious consumers looking for better deals on groceries and other items flocked to its stores. 

            The report was a good showing for the company, considering consumers had cut back on their overall spending during the traditional November-December shopping period. Though sales rebounded at stores and restaurants last month, showing shoppers are still spending despite higher prices and several interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in an effort to curb the problem. 

            The nation’s largest retailer also delivered full-year sales of $611.3 billion, up 6.7% compared to the prior year. But it gave cautious guidance for the next fiscal year, saying it expects sales to increase between 2.5% to 3% and U.S. sales to jump 2% to 2.5%. And it forecast adjusted earnings per share ranging from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel. Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast $6.52 per share, on average. Shares rose less than 1% in early morning trading. 











            Also on Tuesday, Home Depot posted strong profits in its final quarter of 2022, but a muted outlook for this year sank its shares before markets opened. Amazon, which reported strong fourth quarter sales earlier this month, has also warned about a slower growth period for the coming months. 

            Walmart executives told analysts on a call that their guidance reflects the unknowns in the economy as consumers face rising interest rates, delinquencies and are putting less money in their savings.

            “While the supply chain issues have largely abated, prices are still high and there is considerable pressure on the consumer,” said Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey on the call.

            Rainey said the company’s earnings projections are also based on other factors, such as expenses from more interest payments and its planned buyouts of South African retailer Massmart and the robotics firm Alert Innovation. 

            Walmart saw a boost during the pandemic as homebound shoppers spent more on discretionary items like décor to beautify their houses. But consumers are now focusing more on necessities like groceries, which left the company with a glut of excess inventory and dented profits it could make from high-margin discretionary merchandise.

            The big-box retailer has noted shoppers have been watching how they spend and trading down to private brands in categories such as baking goods in order to save costs. That shift, which began last March, accelerated more during the fourth quarter, executives said on the call Tuesday.

            High-income shoppers looking for deals on groceries have also been flocking to its stores, and the company has said its looking to retain them by offering fresh food and clothing assortments. December was the largest sales month in Walmart's history, led by food sales, Rainey said. Meanwhile, the company saw a slight decline in general merchandise sales, such as toys, electronics, apparel and home items. 

            Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted the retailer also ended the quarter with its once-bloated inventory flat compared to last year, which he said was better than they anticipated. 

            The company reported revenue of $164 billion in the quarter that ended on January 27, up 7.3% compared to the same period last year. Profits reached $6.28 billion, up from $3.56 billion last year. Meanwhile, per-share earnings adjusted for one-time costs and benefits were $1.71, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.52. 

            Overall, holiday sales in November and December rose a weaker-than-expected 5.3%, a slowdown from 13.5% in 2021, according to the National Retail Federation. Major retailers, including Walmart and Target, began offering discounts in October to help consumers spread out their spending. And Black Friday doorbusters, which typically drew massive crowds, were also exchanged for weeks-long discount events. 

            At Walmart, comparable sales — those from established stores and online operating over the past 12 months -- rose 8.3%, slightly higher than 8.2% from the previous quarter. Online sales rose 17%.

            Sam's Club, which is owned by Walmart, reported sales growth of 12.2%.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817365,6 Nations: Wales-England match under threat of strike action,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — The Six Nations rugby match between Wales and England looked increasingly under threat of a players' strike after the Wales team announcement was delayed on Tuesday amid contract talks.

            Wales coach Warren Gatland held off announcing his team for Saturday's game at Principality Stadium, raising the stakes in a standoff between the country's top players and Welsh rugby authorities that has been simmering for months.

            Talks between negotiators of a new six-year financial agreement — the Professional Rugby Board — and Wales' professional players are scheduled to take place on Wednesday.











            The players are mostly unhappy they are being offered contracts that would see them receive 80% of their salary, with the remaining 20% comprising bonuses.

            They also want Wales' minimum 60-cap selection rule for players playing outside the country to be scrapped, and a voice at meetings of the Professional Rugby Board.

            No long-form agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and Wales’ four professional rugby regions — Cardiff, Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets — has yet been agreed in writing. That means players whose contracts expire at the end of this season currently cannot be offered new deals.

            Gatland said at a news conference on Tuesday there had been “half a dozen” meetings over the last few days and felt it would be best to delay the team announcement because of “the uncertainty of what's happening.”

            “I am confident that from the discussions that are taking place, something will get resolved today,” Gatland said.

            The New Zealander said a training session planned for after his news conference has been canceled to allow for further talks.

            “It's a been a bit of a challenge,” he said, “but sometimes that galvanizes people.

            “In fairness to the players, they are training. Even this morning, they put their training heads on and trained well. We had a good week last week. There have been things going on behind — we are well aware of that — but everyone who has come to training has applied themselves well.”

            Gatland said he hadn’t made any contingency plans in case an agreement is not reached.

            Wales has lost the first two matches of the Six Nations — against Ireland then Scotland — for the first time in 16 years.

            The Welsh haven't started with three straight losses since 2003.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817367,Leeds hires Javi Gracia as manager to replace Marsch,"LEEDS, England (AP) — Spanish coach Javi Gracia got a second chance to manage in the Premier League after being hired by Leeds on Tuesday as the replacement for Jesse Marsch at the relegation-threatened team.

            Gracia previously had a spell at Watford from 2018-19, keeping the team in England's top flight in back-to-back seasons before being fired after 20 months in charge.

            It has taken more than two weeks for Leeds to replace Marsch, who was fired on Feb. 6 after nearly a year in charge. Since then, the club has dropped into the relegation zone and is currently in next-to-last place.











            The 52-year-old Gracia has been out of work since leaving Qatari team Al Sadd in June.

            His first game in charge will be against last-place Southampton on Saturday provided he gets a work permit in time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817368,Japan bids teary farewell to pandas sent to reserve in China,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese panda fans bid teary farewells to their idols Xiang Xiang, “super papa” Eimei and his twin daughters who were sent to China on Tuesday to swap their home at the zoo for a protected facility in Sichuan province. 

            Hundreds of people who waited outside Tokyo's Ueno Zoo took photos, wiped tears with handkerchiefs and waved at a white truck carrying Xiang Xiang as it slowly drove past them on its way to the airport. Others trooped to Narita International Airport to wave their last goodbyes as a plane carrying Xiang Xiang took off.

            The last public viewing of Xiang Xiang on Sunday was limited to 2,600 lucky ones who won their tickets in an extremely competitive lottery of more than half a million applicants. 











            Xiang Xiang was escorted by two zoo staff on the flight to Chengdu. She was in good health and relaxed during her departure proceedings at the airport, where she ate her favorite snacks of bamboo shoots and apples, the Ueno Zoo tweeted. 

            Ueno Zoo Director Yutaka Fukuda said he will miss her as he had seen her grow since her birth in 2017. “I want to thank her for making so many people happy,” he said. “I hope she will contribute to panda conservation research after safely completing her journey.""

            Xiang Xiang, the first naturally conceived panda at the zoo, was originally set to be returned to China in December 2020, but her trip was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

            China sends pandas abroad as a sign of goodwill but maintains ownership over the animals and any cubs they produce. The animals are native to southwestern China and are an unofficial national mascot.

            At the Adventure World, another zoo in a central Japanese coastal town of Shirahama, three other pandas appeared before the public for the last time on Tuesday, one day before they head back to China. They are elderly male Eimei, who was sent from China in 1994 and has since fathered 16 cubs, earning him the nickname “super papa,” as well as two of his Japanese-born daughters Ouhin and Touhin. 

            The reproductive-age twin sisters will move to Sichuan to find suitable partners. They did not show interest in males at the Japanese zoo. Four other female pandas will stay behind, and the park is seeking a male panda for them to be sent from China.

            Visitors signed messages for their favorite pandas. “Thank you Eimei, stay health and live long!” one of them said. Local media carried their profiles and history along with their cuddly photos of them growing up. 

            Despite strained political ties between Japan and China, pandas have connected people in both countries and contributed to the friendship, Japanese fans say. The Chinese Embassy called them “the cutest messengers of friendship” who have bonded people's hearts in both countries, and said it hopes that Japanese will continue to follow their progress after their return to China. 

            Pandas, which reproduce rarely in the wild and rely on a diet of bamboo, remain among the world’s most threatened species. An estimated 1,800 pandas live in the wild, while another 500 are in zoos or reserves, mostly in Sichuan.TOKYO (AP) — Japanese panda fans bid teary farewells to their idols Xiang Xiang, “super papa” Eimei and his twin daughters who were sent to China on Tuesday to swap their home at the zoo for a protected facility in Sichuan province.Hundreds of people who waited outside Tokyo's Ueno Zoo took photos, wiped tears with handkerchiefs and waved at a white truck carrying Xiang Xiang as it slowly drove past them on its way to the airport.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817396,"EU urges members to offer stockpiles, contracts to Ukraine","BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union on Tuesday urged its member countries to provide more ammunition to Ukraine from their stockpiles and from any orders that they might have already placed with the defense industry to help defeat invading Russian forces.

            According to some estimates, Ukraine is firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells daily — about the same amount that a small European country orders in a peace-time year — but this is only around a third of the number of rounds that Russia is using, one year into the war.

            “We have to act with a sense of urgency,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters at NATO headquarters in Brussels. Borrell said that he had written to the bloc’s 27 defense ministers urging them to “give Ukraine priority” when it comes to weapons and ammunition.











            “What we have to do is measured in weeks, not in months,” he added.

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has appealed to his Western allies to quicken their military support, warning that delays would play into Russia’s hand as the invasion approaches its anniversary on Feb. 24.

            Debate at the EU has been focused on ways to make joint purchases of ammunition and use a special joint fund to provide extra financing. However, the defense industry requires solid, long-term orders to stand up and expand production lines and cannot simply ramp up supplies overnight.

            Speaking at a news conference with Borrell and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the world’s biggest security organization will set up a scheme to help Ukraine get the supplies that it needs.

            “We have agreed that NATO should assist Ukraine to develop a procurement system that is effective, transparent and accountable,” Stoltenberg said. He said a panel of experts would meet soon to discuss how best to proceed.

            “Key capabilities must reach Ukraine before Russia can seize the momentum,” he said.

            NATO believes that Russia has launched a long-anticipated offensive in recent weeks, raising the intensity of attacks in eastern Ukraine while building up forces in the south. Officials have said that Ukraine is likely to launch its own counteroffensive in the spring.

            NATO and the EU have been aware of the likelihood of shortfalls for several months. Asked whether he thinks that Ukraine’s Western partners are acting quickly enough, Kuleba said that “not enough has been done and this is why we’re standing here.”

            But he noted: “no one expected this war would last so long. Therefore, at a certain moment the situation was reached when it became apparent that production has to be rolled out.” 

            Estonia, which shares a border and long history with Russia, is driving the EU and its NATO allies to provide 1 million artillery shells, at an estimated cost of 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817397,Rights group: Mideast governments target LGBTQ people online,"BEIRUT (AP) — Security agencies and government officials in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa have been using social media platforms and mobile dating apps to crack down on LGBTQ people, a rights group said Tuesday.

            The findings of a new report by Human Rights Watch exposed digital methods of clamping down on the LGBTQ community in the region. For years the community has relied on online platforms for safety and privacy to sidestep oppression and discrimination due to social stigma and laws that criminalize their expression.

            The report, “'All This Terror Because of a Photo': Digital Targeting and Its Offline Consequences for LGBT People in the Middle East and North Africa,"" documents dozens of cases of security agencies in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Tunisia extorting, harassing, publicly outing, and detaining LGBTQ people based on their activities on Facebook and Instagram, as well as queer dating app Grindr. The publication also questions major tech companies for not investing sufficiently in Arabic language content moderation and protection.











            “This type of social media frenzy really had implications on people’s lives,” Rasha Younes, senior researcher with the LGBT Rights Program at HRW, said at the press conference.

            One case the report documents is a 27-year-old gay man from Egypt named Yazid who said he was arrested and beaten in prison until he would sign papers that said he was “practicing debauchery” and publicly outing himself. He said one of the officers was someone impersonating a gay man who he met on Grindr. Human Rights Watch documented several cases of ill-treatment and sexual assault among other detainees. 

            In some cases, private individuals and gangs were involved in the extortion. In Lebanon, some people who were extorted online told HRW that they were threatened with being outed to their families and the authorities if they did not pay them a certain amount of money.

            Younes added that many of the victims lost their jobs, faced violence and deleted their online accounts, while some opted to leave the country. Many of the victims say they suffered depression, anxiety and distress, while some reportedly attempted suicide.

            Mohamad Najem, executive director of the Beirut-based digital rights organization SMEX, accused tech companies of a lack of transparency on their content moderation process. Content moderation is when a company monitors what is published on their platforms to ensure they are not abusive, illegal or in violation of their rules and guidelines.

            “The problem with these tech companies is that you start a process with them and they disappear in the middle of it (and) you don't know what happened with them,” he said at the news conference.

            While Human Rights Watch called on governments to respect LGBTQ rights and end the criminalization of their expression, they also called on major tech companies, notably Meta, Twitter and Grindr, to invest in stronger Arabic-language content moderation and respond more proactively to these incidents, as many of the victims who reported harassment and threats say they received no answers from the companies. 

            Younes said it was unclear whether tech companies are doing the best they can to protect users from online harassment and other abusive practices, especially in the Middle East and North Africa.

            “In my brief engagement with platforms there is a repetition of how policies are meant to account for hate speech for everyone,” she said, but that there is “inequity in moderating content.""BEIRUT (AP) — Security agencies and government officials in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa have been using social media platforms and mobile dating apps to crack down on LGBTQ people, a rights group said Tuesday.The findings of a new report by Human Rights Watch exposed digital methods of clamping down on the LGBTQ community in the region. For years the community has relied on online platforms for safety and privacy to sidestep oppression and discrimination due to social stigma and laws that criminalize their expression.The report, “'All This Terror Because of a Photo': Digital Targeting and Its Offline Consequences for LGBT People in the Middle East and North Africa,"" documents dozens of cases of security agencies in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Tunisia extorting, harassing, publicly outing, and detaining LGBTQ people based on their activities on Facebook and Instagram, as well as queer dating app Grindr. The publication also questions major tech companies for not investing sufficiently in Arabic language content moderation and protection.“This type of social media frenzy really had implications on people’s lives,” Rasha Younes, senior researcher with the LGBT Rights Program at HRW, said at the press conference.One case the report documents is a 27-year-old gay man from Egypt named Yazid who said he was arrested and beaten in prison until he would sign papers that said he was “practicing debauchery” and publicly outing himself. He said one of the officers was someone impersonating a gay man who he met on Grindr. Human Rights Watch documented several cases of ill-treatment and sexual assault among other detainees.In some cases, private individuals and gangs were involved in the extortion. In Lebanon, some people who were extorted online told HRW that they were threatened with being outed to their families and the authorities if they did not pay them a certain amount of money.Younes added that many of the victims lost their jobs, faced violence and deleted their online accounts, while some opted to leave the country. Many of the victims say they suffered depression, anxiety and distress, while some reportedly attempted suicide.Mohamad Najem, executive director of the Beirut-based digital rights organization SMEX, accused tech companies of a lack of transparency on their content moderation process. Content moderation is when a company monitors what is published on their platforms to ensure they are not abusive, illegal or in violation of their rules and guidelines.“The problem with these tech companies is that you start a process with them and they disappear in the middle of it (and) you don't know what happened with them,” he said at the news conference.While Human Rights Watch called on governments to respect LGBTQ rights and end the criminalization of their expression, they also called on major tech companies, notably Meta, Twitter and Grindr, to invest in stronger Arabic-language content moderation and respond more proactively to these incidents, as many of the victims who reported harassment and threats say they received no answers from the companies.Younes said it was unclear whether tech companies are doing the best they can to protect users from online harassment and other abusive practices, especially in the Middle East and North Africa.“In my brief engagement with platforms there is a repetition of how policies are meant to account for hate speech for everyone,” she said, but that there is “inequity in moderating content.""",2023/2/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817405,Bayer Leverkusen's new strategy to curb sexual harassment at football matches,"Incidents like those described by Twitter user Sarah in a recent post often go unreported:""Before the game, a strange man grabbed my butt without saying a word. After the game, someone reached under my shirt as I walked by. Where are we, that people still think something like this is acceptable?"" she asked on Twitter following a recent Bayer Leverkusen home game. She is one of the few willing to speak out publicly about such incidents of sexual harassment.""The topic is naturally very shameful for the women affected,"" says Andrea Frewer of the counseling center for victims of sexual harassment in Leverkusen.""Five percent of women have already experienced sexual violence,"" she says. ""Sixty percent have even experienced sexual harassment.""Such incidents are certainly not unique to Leverkusen's BayArena – but occur in stadiums all over the world.""There is an awareness about this issue at our stadium,"" says Bayer Leverkusen fan representative Andreas Paffrath. Four to five cases of sexual harassment against both women and men, against spectators, stewards or hostesses are reported surrounding Leverkusen matches every year. The number of unreported cases may be even higher.After looking into how other clubs such as Borussia Dortmund or Arminia Bielefeld approach the problem, Paffrath and his colleagues at Leverkusen Fan Support decided to join an already established project in Leverkusen called ""Luisa is here."" Before Bayer got on board, the project had been active mainly in pubs and bars in the city, offering an emergency number to call – as well as extensive assistance.In the BayArena victims of sexual harassment can now reach out to stadium staff for help by using the code word ""Luisa."" Staff then seek to assist the victim in question through conversation, taking them to a safe retreat or simply escorting them away from the unpleasant situation.""We help on a very individual basis,"" says Paffrath. The initial focus, he says, is simply on helping the victim. Investigating the incident or trying to bring the perpetrator to justice doesn't happen until later, Paffrath says.""The fact that Bayer Leverkusen have joined this project is quite remarkable, because there is still a lot amiss on this issue,"" Jürgen Mittag, head of the Institute for European Sports Development and Leisure Research at the Sport University Cologne, tells DW.It's only been recently – between 2005 to 2015 – that the issue of ""harassment of women in stadiums"" was selectively included in the more comprehensive anti-racism and anti-violence studies. From 2015 onwards, the issue has come under greater scrutiny in the wake of the safe sport debate, according to the sports scientist. There is also the ""International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women,"" marked each November 25, ""which has recently been taken up by sports,"" Mittag says.""There is still no talk of a comprehensive strategy, training, education and also counter-reaction in this country,"" says Mittag. ""But the first steps in the right direction have been taken, including in Bayer Leverkusen's commitment.""Mittag says English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, are ahead of German in terms of dealing with sexual harassment, although their focus has been more on the behavior of players and coaches rather than people in the stands..""There are now training courses, anonymous contact points, awareness campaigns and a lot more. And that then spills over to those who are in the sports-related space as fans, spectators, companions,"" Mittag says. A preventive approach would also be desirable in the stadiums.Over the past six months, all the 800 employees who work at the BayArena on matchdays have been schooled in how to come to the aid of victims a part of the ""Luisa"" program. Now they're spreading the word through stickers, flyers, and posters that have been put up around the stadium. There will also be PA announcements during matches to let spectators know how they can get help if needed.""When women know that 'Luisa' exists, they feel safer,"" says social worker Andrea Frewer.This article was adapted from German.",2023/2/21,,

Today, India's economy is the fifth largest, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), overtaking the UK's.At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos last month, corporate chiefs put the growth down to a combination of a stable political environment and significant government investments in infrastructure were fostering a positive environment for growth in India.Though India bounced back strongly from the coronavirus pandemic, the country is grappling with the same headwinds buffeting the global economy, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) thinktank.""India is large and diverse and during the pandemic, India's agricultural sector did quite well where the government interventions were measured and well directed,"" Mahesh Vyas, the CEO of CMIE, told DW.""The corporate sector did very well in a protected environment, although medium and small scale industries suffered. What's more, controls and interventions have helped keep inflation in check,"" said Vyas.The World Bank stated in its ""Navigating the Storm"" report in November 2022 that India's economy is ""relatively insulated from global spill overs compared to other emerging markets. This is partly because India has a large domestic market and is relatively less exposed to international trade flows.""Sri Lanka for instance is still in the midst of an economic crisis. The IMF provided the island nation with a loan of $2.9 billion (€2.7 billion) in September.The cash-strapped Pakistani government, meanwhile, increased petrol and gas prices to a historic high this week to appease the IMF for an early release of a $1.1 billion loan tranche of a $6.5 billion bailout deal.The World Bank has warned the global economy will come ""perilously close"" to a recession this year, led by weaker growth in all the world's top economies including the US and China.""India's economy has been remarkably resilient to the deteriorating external environment, and strong macroeconomic fundamentals have placed it in good stead compared to other emerging market economies,"" said Auguste Tano Kouame, the World Bank's country director in India.""However, continued vigilance is required as adverse global developments persist.""India, like many other countries in the world, has not been exempted from multiple external shocks in the form of COVID related global supply chain disruptions, a food and energy crisis following the ongoing war in Ukraine, and financial market volatility.Lekha Chakraborty, professor and chair at India's National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), told DW that India's ""macroeconomic fundamentals are strong.""According to Chakraborty, India is facing a challenge as its current account deficit (CAD) is rising. CAD is a measurement of a country's trade where the value of the goods and services it imports exceeds the value of the products it exports.""So far, we have been financing CAD with capital inflows,"" she said.The current account includes net income, such as interest and dividends, and transfers, such as foreign aid.""Now with the increase in interest rates by US Fed Reserve, there is capital flight. However, the Reserve Bank of India has increased the interest rate to tackle the capital flight and mounting inflation,"" said Chakraborty.Rumki Majumdar, director of Deloitte India, believes India has huge potential as an export hub and as an investment destination in the manufacturing and services sector. Recent trade agreements have been aimed at integrating the manufacturing sector with the global supply chain.""Consequently, there has been a healthy rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) equity flows from Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates in the fiscal year 2022–23, even as FDI from the United States fell,"" Majumdar told DW.""This points to a rising confidence among global investors to invest in India and the inflows are becoming more diversified.""Majumdar also pointed out that high goods and services tax (GST) and direct tax collections have provided the government ammunition to cushion the impact of the impending global slowdown and keep the economy buoyant.However, Chakraborty of NIPFP stressed that despite economic growth, India still has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world.""The post COVID fiscal and monetary strategies are crucial for sustained growth recovery. When we say India is doing well, we must ask the question for whom? The widening inequality is a matter of grave concern and requires immediate policy attention,"" she said.Edited by: Sou-Jie van BrunnersumEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817408,Ukraine's health care on the brink after hundreds of attacks,"KRASNOHORIVKA, Ukraine (AP) — Valentyna Mozgova sweeps shattered glass and other debris from the vacant halls of the bombed-out hospital where she began her career. Living in the basement, the 55-year-old lab technician now works as its solitary guard.

            Russian artillery strikes targeted Marinskaya Central District Hospital in 2017 and again in 2021. But numerous barrages over the last seven months forced the hospital's medical staff to flee, destroying key departments such as neurology and gynecology, as well as a general medical clinic in the process.

            Mozgova chose to stay. Having worked in the hospital's laboratories since graduating from medical school in the late 1980s, she agreed to act as the hospital's security guard for 10,000 hryvnia ($250) a month. She and her husband were soon joined in the basement shelter by five others who had lost their homes to bombing, a dog and a cat. 











            Mozgova picks up the broom at 8 a.m. sharp every three days to inspect the hallways, carefully avoiding the fragments of Russian Grad rockets strewn across the floors for fear of yet another explosion.

            “Everything is decaying and falling apart,” she told The Associated Press. “But I’m so sick of it. I want to live my life normally, sleep in my bed, watch my TV, not jump at the sound of an explosion, go to work calmly and do my job.”

            
                A year into Russia’s war in Ukraine, hundreds of attacks against the health care system have begun to take a toll. More than 700 attacks have targeted health care facilities and staff since the Feb. 24 Russian invasion , according to data verified by five organizations working inside Ukraine. 

            
                The World Health Organization has similarly documented more than 750 attacks and 101 deaths, and Ukraine’s health minister said recently that more than 1,200 facilities have been damaged either directly or indirectly, with 173 hospitals damaged beyond repair.

            The report released Tuesday, which was shared in advance with the AP, said Russia has targeted the Ukrainian health care system “deliberately and indiscriminately” — an allegation that the organization said amounted to a war crime.

            
                The attacks were at their most ferocious early in the war, according to the report, which found a total of 278 attacks in the last four days of February and all of March — an average of eight per day. 

            The report defines attacks not just as weapons strikes, but also threats aimed at forcing doctors to keep working in occupied territories, and incidents of theft in areas that Russian forces failed to hold on to.

            In the city of Kherson, residents said retreating Russian forces took most of the ambulances with them. As they captured the city of Mariupol, the Russians took over the city's last functioning hospital, days after a Russian airstrike devastated a maternity ward.

            “Russian soldiers were on all the floors. They counted the patients, counted the employees, so that no one would leave. They said that if the doctors left, they would shoot,” Maryna Gorbach, a nurse from Mariupol Hospital No. 2, told the AP in an interview in December.

            Gorbach, like most of the staff, managed to flee a few days later.

            In Izium, explosives ripped through the main hospital's walls in March, shredding its wiring and forcing doctors and patients into the basement.

            “Before we went to the basement we covered our patients with mattresses because we thought they would protect patients from shrapnel,"" said Dr. Yurii Kuznetsov, a trauma surgeon who for a time was the only doctor still at the hospital. At this point, three of the four floors are functional. Water drips from the roof. But patients have already seen how much repair has been accomplished. 

            For a year, AP journalists across Ukraine have also witnessed the result of attacks on hospitals, ambulances and medical staff firsthand. 

            “They follow specific patterns, and it is those patterns that are important, not even the number,” said Pavlo Kovtoniuk of the Ukrainian Health Care think tank, which was among the groups gathering data. “Because patterns mean that that most likely was a deliberate policy, not just a coincidence or separate events.”

            Russia claims Ukraine has also hit hospitals in territory it occupies. But Kovtoniuk said there's a vast difference between the huge number of systematic attacks recorded and what he described as accidents that happen in the course of a war for survival. 

            The international organization Physicians for Human Rights long documented Russian attacks on medical facilities in Syria and said the war in Ukraine indicated a continuation of that policy. The U.K. defense mnistry said that Russian attacks on medical and educational facilities intensified in January.

            The attacks show keen awareness of “the cascading effects that attacks on health have on the civilian population,” said Christian De Vos, director of research and investigation for Physicians for Human Rights, who contributed to the report. “It’s part of a destabilizing tactic to sow fear in the wider population.”

            In the short term, attacks have forced many hospitals to shut down or sharply reduce services. In Izium, which was liberated by Ukrainian troops last fall, around 200 people from a staff of 500 have returned to work, and one of the damaged wings is operating again after repairs. At least one pharmacy has reopened as well, enabling people whose medication ran out during six months of occupation to be resupplied. 

            Ukraine had the second-highest number of HIV infections in Europe and Central Asia and one of the highest rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis. But since the invasion, the number of people being treated for these ailments has dropped precipitously. Drug quantities aren't an issue thanks to a steady supply from donations. But it's harder to follow-up or track new infections because of the mass displacement of Ukrainians within the country and across Europe.

            Andriy Klepikov runs the Alliance for Public Health, an organization whose mobile clinics reach towns near the front lines. He worries about cases of tuberculosis or HIV that are going undiagnosed, but remains optimistic about his country's capacity to overcome.

            “The health system is (not about) walls or buildings or even equipment. It is about people,” he said. “The Ukrainian military are known for their strength and resilience, but in the area of public health, we are equally strong and resilient.""

            Back in Krasnohorivka, a tank shell took out the signal for a Russian television show about the lives of doctors that Mozgova enjoyed. Despite the loss of what little made life comfortable for her, Mozgova said neither she nor her husband have any plans of permanently rejoining their adult children in the western city of Lviv, considered among the safest in Ukraine.

            “They tell us to come and they have space, but what will I do? I’ll be a guest there. So I’ll be here as long as I have work. I’m trying to be useful here,” she said. “However good it was with my children and grandchildren I still think about this place because it’s my home.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817409,California beach city OKs balloon ban to protect coast,"Environmental advocates are celebrating in Laguna Beach — but it won't be with balloons.

            The hilly seaside city known for stunning ocean views and rolling bluffs is banning the sale and public use of balloons to curtail the risk of devastating wildfires and eliminate a major source of trash floating near the community's scenic shores.

            The Laguna Beach City Council voted Tuesday night to ban in public the popular mainstay of birthday and graduation parties, whether inflated with helium or not. Beginning in 2024, the balloons cannot be used on public property or at city events.











            The move in the community of 23,000 people 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles comes as several California beach cities have limited balloons and the state enacted a law to regulate the types made of foil.

            “This is the beginning,” Chad Nelsen, chief executive of the nonprofit environmental organization Surfrider Foundation, said before the vote. 

            Nelsen said he sees momentum to weed out balloons that tangle with turtles and sea lions much like he did with the effort to phase out single-use plastic bags. “We’re chipping away at all these things we find and trying to clean up the ocean one item at a time.”

            Environmental advocates are taking aim at balloons, arguing they're a preventable cause of coastal pollution that threatens animals and seabirds. Balloon debris can tangle wildlife or be ingested by animals that mistake it for food, and more than 3,000 pieces of balloon litter were picked up on ocean beaches by volunteers in Virginia over a five-year period, according to the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration.

            In California, fire officials have long warned against foil balloons that can tangle with power lines, causing a power outage and potential fire hazard. Southern California Edison, one of the state's major utilities, reported more than 1,000 foil balloon-related power outages in 2017, affecting more than 1 million customers, according to a state legislative analysis.

            But coastal advocates want legislation that addresses balloon litter in addition to fire risk. Coastal communities in Florida, Delaware and New York have adopted rules aimed at curtailing balloon pollution. Several in Southern California have taken similar steps. The city of Manhattan Beach has banned foil balloons on public property and the mass release of latex balloons, while two San Diego County beach cities have barred balloons filled with a gas lighter than air. 

            Officials in Laguna Beach, which has miles of pristine shoreline and hilltop neighborhoods at risk of wildfires, have long discussed the idea. Lawmakers held an initial, unanimous vote in January to phase out the public use of all balloons. The second and final vote took place Tuesday. The penalty would be a $100 fine for a first violation, $200 for a second and $500 for each additional violation within a year.

            In addition, a business that repeatedly violates the ordinance could lose its business license.

            Balloons can still be used by residents at home, said Mayor Bob Whalen.

            “Even the balloon advocates and balloon industry was not opposed to banning them on the beach,” Whalen said, adding that the city moved on the issue both to reduce the risk of fires and to protect marine life along the city's roughly six miles (10 kilometers) of shoreline. “There is going to be some impact on the local distribution of balloons, but as I say, people will still find places to buy balloons.”

            Treb Heining, who began selling balloons at Disneyland when he was 15 years old and now, more than 50 years later, works internationally in the balloon industry, said balloons bring happiness to the world.

            “All my life, I’ve seen children thrilled – of all ages. You can still be a child at 90 years old,” he said.

            Heining said Laguna Beach officials would not come to the table for a compromise. He suggested banning portable helium tanks for the public, barring balloon releases and prohibiting balloons on the beach, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.

            “They’re doing anything they can to make balloons into this evil, horrible thing. And they’re not,” he said.

            Those who support the move include environmental advocates, whale watching groups and a marine mammal organization, which reported seeing a sea lion die of starvation after trash, including balloon fragments, lodged in her digestive tract. 

            “Here is another opportunity to be bold and on the right side of an issue,” resident Mark Christy wrote in a letter to the council last month.

            Cheryl McKinney, who owns a party supplies company, opposed the idea, saying it would wallop the state economically and that responsible business owners encourage patrons to add weights to balloons and properly dispose of them.

            Associated Press writer Stefanie Dazio contributed to this report.Environmental advocates are celebrating in Laguna Beach — but it won't be with balloons.The hilly seaside city known for stunning ocean views and rolling bluffs is banning the sale and public use of balloons to curtail the risk of devastating wildfires and eliminate a major source of trash floating near the community's scenic shores.The Laguna Beach City Council voted Tuesday night to ban in public the popular mainstay of birthday and graduation parties, whether inflated with helium or not. Beginning in 2024, the balloons cannot be used on public property or at city events.The move in the community of 23,000 people 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles comes as several California beach cities have limited balloons and the state enacted a law to regulate the types made of foil.“This is the beginning,” Chad Nelsen, chief executive of the nonprofit environmental organization Surfrider Foundation, said before the vote.Nelsen said he sees momentum to weed out balloons that tangle with turtles and sea lions much like he did with the effort to phase out single-use plastic bags. “We’re chipping away at all these things we find and trying to clean up the ocean one item at a time.”Environmental advocates are taking aim at balloons, arguing they're a preventable cause of coastal pollution that threatens animals and seabirds. Balloon debris can tangle wildlife or be ingested by animals that mistake it for food, and more than 3,000 pieces of balloon litter were picked up on ocean beaches by volunteers in Virginia over a five-year period, according to the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration.In California, fire officials have long warned against foil balloons that can tangle with power lines, causing a power outage and potential fire hazard. Southern California Edison, one of the state's major utilities, reported more than 1,000 foil balloon-related power outages in 2017, affecting more than 1 million customers, according to a state legislative analysis.But coastal advocates want legislation that addresses balloon litter in addition to fire risk. Coastal communities in Florida, Delaware and New York have adopted rules aimed at curtailing balloon pollution. Several in Southern California have taken similar steps. The city of Manhattan Beach has banned foil balloons on public property and the mass release of latex balloons, while two San Diego County beach cities have barred balloons filled with a gas lighter than air.Officials in Laguna Beach, which has miles of pristine shoreline and hilltop neighborhoods at risk of wildfires, have long discussed the idea. Lawmakers held an initial, unanimous vote in January to phase out the public use of all balloons. The second and final vote took place Tuesday. The penalty would be a $100 fine for a first violation, $200 for a second and $500 for each additional violation within a year.In addition, a business that repeatedly violates the ordinance could lose its business license.Balloons can still be used by residents at home, said Mayor Bob Whalen.“Even the balloon advocates and balloon industry was not opposed to banning them on the beach,” Whalen said, adding that the city moved on the issue both to reduce the risk of fires and to protect marine life along the city's roughly six miles (10 kilometers) of shoreline. “There is going to be some impact on the local distribution of balloons, but as I say, people will still find places to buy balloons.”Treb Heining, who began selling balloons at Disneyland when he was 15 years old and now, more than 50 years later, works internationally in the balloon industry, said balloons bring happiness to the world.“All my life, I’ve seen children thrilled – of all ages. You can still be a child at 90 years old,” he said.Heining said Laguna Beach officials would not come to the table for a compromise. He suggested banning portable helium tanks for the public, barring balloon releases and prohibiting balloons on the beach, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.“They’re doing anything they can to make balloons into this evil, horrible thing. And they’re not,” he said.Those who support the move include environmental advocates, whale watching groups and a marine mammal organization, which reported seeing a sea lion die of starvation after trash, including balloon fragments, lodged in her digestive tract.“Here is another opportunity to be bold and on the right side of an issue,” resident Mark Christy wrote in a letter to the council last month.Cheryl McKinney, who owns a party supplies company, opposed the idea, saying it would wallop the state economically and that responsible business owners encourage patrons to add weights to balloons and properly dispose of them.“We always refer our customers to this motto: 'Don't let go. Weight. Inflate. Enjoy.'” she wrote.___Associated Press writer Stefanie Dazio contributed to this report.",2023/2/22,,World

            — Adult dramas have generally been having a hard time in theaters in recent months, but one notable exception has been “A Man Called Otto."" The film stars Tom Hanks as a despondent and ornery widower whose suicide plans keep getting foiled by the needs of his neighbors. After having made nearly $100 million in ticket sales worldwide, “A Man Called Otto” arrives on video on demand Tuesday. Marc Forster’s adaptation of Fredrik Backman’s bestseller and a remake of the 2016 Swedish film “A Man Called Ove,” “A Man Called Otto” is well tailored to Hanks' screen presence while subtly tweaking it.

            — Since its prize-winning debut at the Cannes Film Festival last May, Polish filmmaking legend Jerzy Skolimowski's “EO” has been moving audiences like few other recent films. Skolimowski made “EO,” nominated for best international film at the Academy Awards, from the perspective of a circus donkey on a spiritual journey as it experiences cruelty and kindness while traveling through Poland and Italy. “The idea was from the very beginning that we don’t want to tell the story about the donkey, but that we want the audience to feel like it is a donkey,” Ewa Piaskowska, Skolimowski's wife and co-writer told AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr. “ EO"" begins streaming Tuesday on the Criterion Channel and is also available for digital rental.

            MUSIC

            — Adam Lambert offers his takes on some great past pop songs with “High Drama,” an album of covers of such hitmakers as Duran Duran, Bonnie Tyler and Culture Club. The frontman for Queen takes on Sia’s “Chandelier,” Kings of Leon’s “Sex on Fire” and even Noël Coward’s “Mad About the Boy.” His version of Tyler’s “Holding Out For a Hero” is a showcase for Lambert’s vocal fireworks, while he turns Duran Duran’s “Ordinary World” into a lush, moody ballad and he turns in a glam rendition of Billie Eilish’s “Getting Older.” It drops Friday.

            — If you missed “KPOP” on Broadway, there’s still the chance to hear what you missed. The original cast recording out Friday features music, lyrics, music production and arrangements by Helen Park and music and lyrics by Max Vernon. It was the first Broadway musical to celebrate Korean culture with Korean, Korean-American and API representation on and off-stage. The musical is a backstage look at some K-pop performers as they get ready for their debut show in New York City. Conflicts break out and get resolved, ending in a concert-like performance.

            — After writing and recording two albums over the past four years that he later scrapped, Dierks Bentley is poised to release a third, one he says he “had to get right.” The 14-track “Gravel & Gold” has songs featuring Ashley McBryde and Billy Strings. The single “Gold” is all about freedom, with the lyrics: “I got some rust on my Chevy but it’s ready to roll/I got a rhinestone sky and a song in my soul.” Bentley promises a diverse album, “from the arena shaker to the barroom weeper to the bluegrass fireballer.”

            TELEVISION 

            — FX’s critically-acclaimed series “Snowfall,” about the crack cocaine boom in Los Angeles in the 1980s kicks off its sixth and final season on Thursday. The final episodes are high-stakes for all the characters including Damson Idris as Franklin Saint, who rose to drug kingpin status throughout the series and had declared war on everyone around him.

            — It’s been 13 years since we last saw the cater waiters of “Party Down” suffer through another event thrown by the rich and sometimes famous of Los Angeles. Original cast members including Adam Scott, Ken Marino, Ryan Hansen and Megan Mullally reprise their characters in a third season debuting Friday on Starz. This new batch of episodes sees the characters older and (somewhat) at different places in their lives but they’re still just as funny. Jennifer Garner, Tyrel Jackson Williams and Zoë Chao also join the cast. Original player Lizzie Caplan was unavailable for season three but the cast has said they’re game for another season, especially to work with her again.

            — Netflix’s “Outer Banks” returns for its third season on Thursday and JJ, Sarah, and the gang have discovered a deserted island they’ve named Poguelandia. If we’ve learned anything from “Lord of the Flies” and “Yellowjackets,” teens on a deserted island equals trouble. And that’s just how the third season begins, promising more action, romance and of course, hidden treasures.

            VIDEO GAMES

            — The big news in games this month is the arrival of Sony’s PlayStation VR2 virtual reality headset. It’s pricey at $550 and you need a PlayStation 5 to use it, but there will be a healthy software lineup ready for launch. The marquee title is Horizon: Call of the Mountain, which allows the player to climb mountains and hunt cyborgs in the franchise’s lively, postapocalyptic setting. Owners of the racing game Gran Turismo 7 and the horror epic Resident Evil Village will be able to download free VR versions, and there are dozens of other games — some new, some old — in the pipeline. You can begin exploring Sony’s updated take on the metaverse on Wednesday.

            — Square Enix’s Octopath Traveler drew some flak for its goofy name when it debuted in 2018, but it found a big enough audience to warrant a sequel. Like its predecessor, Octopath Traveler II tells eight separate stories of eight intrepid adventurers — a warrior, a thief, a merchant, a cleric, a dancer, a hunter, a scholar and an apothecary — as they explore a magical land. And if the formula holds true, they’ll team up at the end to fight off some world-threatening cataclysm. With its retro, semi-2D pixel art, it’s bound to appeal to admirers of old-school Japanese role-playing games. The journeys begin Friday on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5/4 and PC.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817411,Pay-Per-Chew: More restaurants trying subscription programs,"Consumers are willing to pay monthly subscription fees for streaming services, pet food and even toilet paper. And now some restaurants are betting they'll do the same for their favorite meals.

            Large chains like Panera and P.F. Chang’s as well as neighborhood hangouts are increasingly experimenting with the subscription model as a way to ensure steady revenue and customer visits. Some offer unlimited drinks or free delivery for a monthly fee; others will bring out your favorite appetizer each time you visit.

            They’re following a trend: The average American juggled 6.7 subscriptions in 2022, up from 4.2 in 2019, according to Rocket Money, a personal finance app. 











            “This is just another way for customers to provide a level of support and joy and love for our offerings,” said Matt Baker, the chef at Gravitas, a Michelin-starred restaurant in Washington.

            For $130 per month, Gravitas Supper Club subscribers get a three-course takeout meal for two. Baker said Gravitas shifted to takeout during the pandemic but saw demand fizzle once its dining room reopened. The Supper Club — which serves about 60 diners per month — keeps that revenue flowing. 

            The upscale Chinese chain P.F. Chang’s also saw an opportunity to increase to-go orders with its subscription plan, which launched in September. For $6.99 per month, members get free delivery, among other perks.

            Other restaurants are experimenting with memberships, which let diners pre-pay toward their visits.

            El Lopo, a San Francisco bar, has 26 members in its Take-Care-Of-Me Club. They pay either $89 per month for $100 in dining credits or $175 per month for $200 in credits. When members come in, El Lopo starts bringing out their favorite dishes. Each visit, they can gift a free drink to anyone in the bar. 

            El Lopo owner Daniel Azarkman started the club in March 2021 to encourage patrons to return as the pandemic eased. Now, he’s hearing from restaurants all over the country who are interested in starting similar programs.

            “What it really achieves is getting them in more often,” he said. 

            Rick Camac, executive director of Industry Relations at the Institute of Culinary Education, said he expects many more restaurants to offer subscriptions in the coming years. Consumers are accustomed to them, he said, and the regular monthly income helps restaurants manage their cash flow.

            But not all subscription programs have had success. In 2021, On the Border Mexican Grill introduced its Queso Club, which offered free cheese dip for a year for $1. The program stopped taking new subscribers a year later.

            Edithann Ramey, On the Border’s chief marketing officer, said more than 150,000 people signed up for the Queso Club, and members visited seven times more often than the average guest. But the Dallas-based chain wasn’t making enough to cover the cost of the dip. 

            On the Border is now retooling the program and expects to reintroduce it later this year. It may charge more or move to a monthly model, Ramey said, but the subscription element will remain.

            “It’s becoming kind of a hot trend and we want to stay as a leading brand,” Ramey said. 

            Taco Bell is also tinkering with its $10 Taco Lover’s Pass, which lets subscribers get a taco every day for a month. The pass was introduced in January 2022 and again in October; it generated buzz, but the chain is trying to think of ways to make it more valuable to consumers, said Dane Mathews, Taco Bell’s chief digital officer. A subscription could promise faster service, for example, or unlock unique menu items.

            Other restaurants have dropped subscriptions, saying they have their hands full just running the kitchen. 

            In late 2020, SheWolf, an upscale Italian restaurant in Detroit, started sending subscribers a box of pasta, sauces and other treats for $80 per month. But when its dining room fully reopened six months later, it was too much work to put together hundreds of boxes. 

            Still, SheWolf is keeping one foot in the subscription space. Dan Reinisch, the restaurant’s beverage director, sends Italian wines to about 80 subscribers who pay $60 or more each month.

            Other businesses have had better luck. St. Louis-based Panera had nearly 40 million members in its loyalty program in early 2020, but it wanted to convince them to drop in more often. So it launched a subscription program that offered unlimited coffee and tea for $8.99 per month. Customers started coming in several times a week, and about one-third of the time they bought food.

            Last year, Panera expanded the subscription. Now, members can pay $11.99 per month or $119.99 per year for unlimited hot and cold drinks. Annual subscribers also get free delivery.

            Eduardo Luz, Panera’s chief brand and concept officer, won’t share exact numbers but he said members now make up 25% of the chain’s transactions. 

            “It’s a huge traffic driver,” Luz said.

            The idea quickly spread overseas. Pret A Manger, a sandwich chain owned by the same private company as Panera, launched its own coffee subscription in the U.K. in 2020. As of November, it was being used 1.2 million times per week. Pret also offers subscriptions in France and the U.S.

            Chris Hosford, a communications consultant in southern California, joined Panera’s subscription plan a year ago. He passes four or five Paneras on his regular routes and often stops to grab a coffee and a bite to eat.

            “It’s not a huge amount of savings for me — probably $5-10 in the average month,"" Hosford said. ""But I’m good with that.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817413,Former US Rep. Adam Kinzinger to release book in October,"NEW YORK (AP) — 

            Former U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, the Illinois Republican who broke with his party two years ago after the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol, has a book deal. 

            The Open Field, a Penguin Random House imprint overseen by Maria Shriver, announced Tuesday that Kinzinger's “Renegade: My Life in Faith, the Military, and Defending America from Trump’s Attack on Democracy” is scheduled for release on Oct. 17.











            “Ever since my final falling-out with the GOP, on the day of the deadly January 6 attack on the Capitol by Donald Trump’s followers, I have wanted to tell the inside story of how my party and also my faith have been hijacked by extremists who represent a real danger to our democracy,” Kinzinger said in a statement. 

            “This book is the result, a full telling of my experience from a pilgrim with genuine values to a conservative who has no home but is determined to play a role in our recovery from a devastating political war,” he added.

            Kinzinger, an Iraq War veteran first elected to Congress in 2010, became a leading GOP critic of Trump and his Republican colleagues after Jan. 6. He denounced Trump for inciting “an angry mob” with false claims the 2020 election was stolen and voted to impeach the then-president. He was later one of two Republicans, along with Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who joined the House committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attack. 

            Last fall, he announced he would not seek reelection after the Democrat-controlled Illinois Legislature approved new congressional maps that would have forced Kinzinger and a fellow Republican incumbent, Rep. Darin LaHood, into a primary matchup. 

            Kinsinger ""examines the forces that allowed such an attack to happen in the first place, from the misinformation campaign waged by Fox News and partisan media to the inculcation of extremism in families and faith communities,"" according to his publisher. 

            The publisher described the book as “part memoir, part searing examination.” 

            The book will offer ""an inside account of one of the most tumultuous events in recent American history and sounds the alarm on the devastating consequences of letting extremism go unchecked,” the publisher said.NEW YORK (AP) —Former U.S. Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817414,"Protasiewicz, Kelly advance in Wisconsin high court primary","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A liberal Milwaukee judge and a conservative former state Supreme Court justice won Tuesday’s primary to face off in a pivotal Wisconsin Supreme Court race that will determine majority control with major issues looming.

            Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Janet Protasiewicz and ex-Justice Dan Kelly were the top two vote-getters in a four-candidate field and advance to the April 4 general election. 

            Conservatives currently hold a 4-3 majority on the court and have controlled the court for 15 years. But an open seat this year gives liberals a chance to take the majority with issues like abortion access, gerrymandered legislative districts and voting rights heading into the 2024 presidential election at stake.











            The court came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden’s win in the state in 2020, and both major parties are preparing for another close margin in 2024. With so much on the line, spending on Wisconsin's state Supreme Court race is expected to shatter national records for such contests.

            Protasiewicz won with about 46% of the vote, while Kelly came in second with about 24%. Protasiewicz and the other liberal candidate combined for nearly 54% compared with about 46% for the two conservatives, a worrisome sign for Republicans heading into April.

            Protasiewicz said afterward that voters knew how high the stakes were.

            “We’re saving our democracy in the state of Wisconsin,” she said. “That’s what I’m explaining to people. I’m talking about the ability to vote, to have a vote that counts about women’s rights, reproductive freedoms, the fact that the 2024 presidential election results could likely come into our Supreme Court chamber, just everything people care about.”

            Kelly said the campaign was now “starting all over at ground zero and having a conversation with people all across the state.”

            “I think they are going to be passionate about supporting their constitution and protecting it from being overturned by someone who is trying to put her thumb on the scales of justice,” he said in a dig at Protasiewicz.

            Democrats coalesced around Protasiewicz over Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell, allowing her to break fundraising records and secure hundreds of endorsements. 

            All three of the court's current liberal justices endorsed her, while only one of the four current conservative justices endorsed Kelly. The state Democratic Party also endorsed Protasiewicz after her win Tuesday.

            Protasiewicz campaigned as a supporter of abortion rights and said legislative maps drawn by Republicans and approved by the current Supreme Court were “rigged.” She also made her support for abortion rights a focus of her campaign. Mitchell, who would have been the first Black justice elected to the court, also called the maps unfair and expressed support for abortion rights.

            Both conservative candidates were supported by Wisconsin anti-abortion groups and spoke to GOP groups across the state during the primary campaign. 

            Kelly held off a challenge on the right from Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow, who gained national attention for presiding over the trial last year of a man convicted of killing six people when he drove his SUV through a Waukesha Christmas parade.

            Kelly cast himself as the only tested conservative in the race.

            He said Tuesday that voters “don’t want to gamble on who the next Supreme Court justice is. They want to have someone who has a proven public record of being faithful to the constitution and to the people of Wisconsin. And I see my record as doing that. And I think that’s what makes the difference.”

            The next court is likely to issue key rulings on Wisconsin’s 1849 abortion ban law, legislative maps, union rights and challenges to election results.

            Republicans also fear that laws they enacted over the past decade could be in jeopardy under a liberal court, such as a 2011 law signed that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public employees, a voter ID law, a ban on absentee ballot drop boxes, and a host of others.

            Kelly was endorsed by Trump during his unsuccessful run two years ago and did work for both the state and national Republican parties the past two years, including advising on the scheme in Wisconsin to have fake electors cast ballots for Trump. 

            Dorow has been active in local Republican Party politics and became nationally known after presiding over the trial of Darrell Brooks Jr., who was convicted of killing six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in 2021.

            Outside groups have already spent about $9.2 million on the Supreme Court race as of Tuesday, about evenly split between the two sides, according to AdImpact Politics, which tracks advertising.

            “People know what this race means,” Protasiewicz said Tuesday night, “and they are contributing likewise.”MADISON, Wis.

It is important for Hong Kong companies to capitalize on cross-border opportunities by leveraging on the unique positioning and reap the benefits of the immense market of the GBA.   The Hon Chun-ying Leung, Vice-Chairman of The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR said, ""The nine Guangdong cities are huge and diverse, each offering Hong Kong its own special prospects. For Hong Kong to effectively work with the GBA, we need to prioritize geographical advantages. Hong Kong cannot cover all nine cities fully and equally in one go. In the initial cooperation stages between the nine cities, we need to establish a Hong Kong bridgehead. We need to establish a forward base and then a cluster for Hong Kong to acclimatize. This will allow us sharpen our skills, to build networks and grow a critical mass from which we can in due course more fully engage all the Guangdong-GBA cities. In the Guangdong area, Hong Kong brings to the table the capabilities as a financial trade, innovation and technology and professional service centre. Hong Kong additionally brings its international connection with the rest of the world. Hong Kong is the super connector.""   In his opening remarks at the Summit, The Hon John KC Lee, GBM, SBS, PDSM, PMSM, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR shared, ""With the support of the National 14th Five-Year Plan, Hong Kong is determined to develop into an international innovation and technology (I&T) centre. The Northern Metropolis is linked with Shenzhen and will take up an area about one-third the size of Hong Kong. It will not only provide much-needed land for the advancement of innovation and technology, but also create a platform that pools together local talents and experts from other GBA cities and overseas. To meet the strong construction output, we will uplift our overall productivity and sustainability by adopting high productivity construction methods such as Modular Integrated Construction, or MiC. For that, we have established a steering committee to strengthen the MiC supply chain, and to foster collaboration with the strong manufacturing bases in the GBA. My thanks to the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences for organising this dynamic and rewarding Summit. I am certain that you will all enjoy the invaluable opportunity to share insights on bay area development from around the world.""   Prof. Guangjun Zhang, Vice Minister of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Video) said, ""The Hong Kong SAR Government has invested more than HKD150 billion to support the development of innovation over the past five years, and published the 'Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Development Blueprint' in December 2022 which outlined four broad major directions and eight major strategies that establish a clear development path and formulate systematic strategic planning for Hong Kong's innovation and technology (I&T) development over the next five to 10 years. The Blueprint is a testament to the Government's determination and actions on the development of innovation and technology. As we stand in a new onset in history, the Technology Division will work closely with the Hong Kong SAR Government, as we have always been, with building a top-quality Great Bay Area as our major goal and supporting the establishment of Hong Kong as a global innovation and technology hub as our key theme, and promote the collaboration of innovation and technology effort in the two regions. Thank you.""   Ms Xinning Lu, Deputy Director of The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong SAR said,"" At the start of the new year, the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences seizes the opportunity to focus on hot topics of innovation from the Greater Bay Area, bringing together elites from all walks of life to share their insights. This is a timely and historic moment, the GBA serves as a model for high-quality development in the new era and plays a critical role in realizing China's modernization and achieving the two centennial goals. The Greater Bay Area takes on the important mission of leading high-quality development in China's new era, and strive for continuous, high-quality progress and breakthroughs in national development.""   Ir Dr Otto Poon, BBS, Immediate Past President of the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences and Chairman of ATAL Engineering Group mentioned in his welcome speech, ""GBA offers a unique opportunity for people from all parts of the world to work together in an undisturbed environment where culture, education, professional practice and economy converge. It is a space where three borders, cultures, languages, legal systems, standards and currencies meet, an exemplar of how differences are overcome, and institutions and businesses co-exist in harmony. GBA is open to everyone from various professionals and jurisdictions. We meet challenges and opportunities in a global scale. Standing at the crossroad of globalization and deglobalisation, this is an opportunity where global citizens of the 21st century like us cannot miss.""   The Summit has showcased a powerful line-up of speakers. Experts, government officials, scholars and market leaders from Hong Kong, mainland China and other regions gather to share their views on the development and operation of Bay Area economies.   On day 1 of the Summit,  Dr Victor Fung, Group Chairman of Fung Group shared his views on how local and global businesses can leverage on Hong Kong to enter the vast and growing consumer market in the GBA, while taking advantage of the thriving digital production base in Peal River Delta to get a share in the global market.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817416,Danish former minister charged with revealing state secrets,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A Danish former defense minister who had publicly claimed that Denmark's secret service helped U.S. intelligence spy on several European leaders said Tuesday he has been charged with divulging state secrets.

            Denmark’s prosecution authority said the country's justice minister has agreed to the recommendation that charges be brought against a former lawmaker, whom it did not name, for “divulging or passing on secrets of importance to the state.” 

            “The case includes highly classified information that cannot be presented openly,” prosecutor Jakob Berger Nielsen said in a statement. “Regardless of the great public interest, in the opinion of the public prosecutor’s office, there is clearly a heavier consideration to be given to the work of the intelligence service.”











            Danish media named the suspect as Claus Hjort Frederiksen, a 75-year-old former defense minister who retired from politics last year, and he later confirmed that on Facebook.

            “I have not revealed alleged state secrets. Period,” he wrote on Facebook. “This was not how I had dreamed my retirement would be.”

            In several interviews in 2020 and 2021, Hjort Frederiksen alleged that the Danish Defense Intelligence Service — which is responsible for overseas activities — had helped the NSA eavesdrop on leaders in Germany, France, Sweden and Norway, including former German chancellor Angela Merkel. He later said he faced preliminary charges for revealing the secret cable cooperation with the U.S.

            In an interview with public DR broadcaster in December 2021, Hjort Frederiksen said “I must risk a prison sentence” for making the allegations.

            In June 2021, DR said that the Danish military intelligence service had in 2014 conducted an internal investigation into whether NSA had used its cooperation with the Danes to spy against Denmark and neighboring countries. The probe, codenamed “Operation Dunhammer,” concluded that NSA had eavesdropped on political leaders.

            The alleged setup between the United States and Denmark reportedly allowed the NSA to obtain data by using the telephone numbers of politicians as search parameters. The military agency allegedly helped the NSA from 2012 to 2014.

            Reports in 2013 that the NSA had listened in on German government phones, including Merkel’s, prompted a diplomatic spat between Berlin and Washington, and French President Emmanuel Macron said that if correct ”this is not acceptable between allies.”

            Then-Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg called it “unacceptable” and said that spying on others “creates more mistrust than it creates collaboration.”

            In 2022, the government asked lawmakers to remove the parliamentary immunity of Hjort Frederiksen but a majority opposed the move because it was not known what he was suspected of.

            “I did not run again for the election (in late 2022) and my parliamentary immunity has thus lapsed,” Hjort Frederiksen wrote on his Facebook profile on Feb. 18. “So the path is clear for the justice minister to decide to follow the prosecution's recommendation to bring charges."" 

            Hjort Frederiksen was defense minister from November 2016 to June 2019, and earlier held the finance and employment portfolios. For years, he was a senior member of the Liberal Party and left parliament in November to retire.

            No trial date has been set. If tried and convicted of the charges, Hjort Frederiksen faces up to 12 years in jail.COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A Danish former defense minister who had publicly claimed that Denmark's secret service helped U.S. intelligence spy on several European leaders said Tuesday he has been charged with divulging state secrets.Denmark’s prosecution authority said the country's justice minister has agreed to the recommendation that charges be brought against a former lawmaker, whom it did not name, for “divulging or passing on secrets of importance to the state.”“The case includes highly classified information that cannot be presented openly,” prosecutor Jakob Berger Nielsen said in a statement. “Regardless of the great public interest, in the opinion of the public prosecutor’s office, there is clearly a heavier consideration to be given to the work of the intelligence service.”Danish media named the suspect as Claus Hjort Frederiksen, a 75-year-old former defense minister who retired from politics last year, and he later confirmed that on Facebook.“I have not revealed alleged state secrets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817418,Pettersen to stay as Europe's Solheim Cup captain for 2024,"DENHAM, England (AP) — Suzann Pettersen will captain Europe at the next two Solheim Cups.

            The Norwegian was selected on Tuesday to lead the team for the 2024 event at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., having already been appointed as captain for this year's Solheim Cup at Finca Cortesin in Spain from Sept. 22-24.

            Pettersen said the decision “makes perfect sense” with the event being held in back-to-back years.











            “This will allow us to build a strategy and a philosophy for the team that we can keep, which will offer more consistency for the players and enable them to focus on their performance,” Pettersen said. ""My focus is on getting the team around the players and the atmosphere right and then taking that up to the next level.”

            Pettersen represented Europe on nine Solheim Cup teams — in 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2019.

            In 2019, she holed the winning putt at Gleneagles in Scotland and immediately announced her retirement.

            Pettersen was vice-captain when the Europeans retained the title at the Inverness Club in Ohio in 2021, under Catriona Matthew.

            Stacy Lewis has already been selected as the United States captain for the 2023 and '24 competitions.

One of the highlights was the  #EmpowerHerDance challenge, where 16 KOLs across 15 geographies in the world have led the charge in this dance challenge to gain the attention of more than 158m followers globally, to support and empower fellow females. The infectious beat of the song also saw top Grammy-Award-winning female DJ duo  NERVO coming onboard in support of the #EmpowerHerMusic campaign, creating an electrifying remix of the record-breaking  Goodbye Princess. Together, these female powerhouses around the world have pushed the song to great heights, enabling Tia to become the fastest artist to break 100M views on YouTube with a Chinese pop song.   With an empowered mission and vision, redefining her career as a musician and fashion icon, Tia is stepping out of her comfort zone and saying goodbye to her past self.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817422,Column: LIV resumes after break that was anything but loud,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — LIV Golf decides when to hold tournaments by avoiding what its leader, Greg Norman, calls heritage events. That's another way of saying it will find holes in the PGA Tour schedule with weak fields or marginal interest.

            He got that part right.

            More attention should have been given to what LIV Golf has to follow, and what's ahead, that might make the start of its second season have a hard time living up to its moniker.











            Golf, but louder — louder than the WM Phoenix Open?

            No amount of music can match the volume and energy of a party so raucous in the Arizona desert that it’s easy to forget there’s a tournament going on.

            Louder than Riviera?

            That's where Tiger Woods was just as easily heard as seen because of thousands of delirious fans who followed every one of his 283 shots at the Genesis Invitational.

            Phoenix delivered Masters champion Scottie Scheffler returning to No. 1 in the world. At Riviera, it was Jon Rahm winning for the third time in five tournaments. Woods presented him the trophy and said to crowd: “Please understand and respect how good this guy is. He’s just getting started in his career, and we all get a chance to watch it.”

            Your turn, LIV.

            It all unfolds Friday at Mayakoba along Mexico’s Gulf coast, where the PGA Tour played from 2007 without attracting much of a gallery.

            And then after it's over, golf attention returns to the PGA Tour for the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, followed by The Players Championship with its $25 million purse and one of the most dramatic tests at the TPC Sawgrass.

            The hope for LIV Golf rests on its concept of team golf. 

            “In less than a year, LIV Golf has reinvigorated the professional game and laid the foundation for the sport’s future. In 2023, the LIV Golf League comes to life,” Norman said Monday in releasing the rosters of 12 four-man teams.

            Some of the newcomers don't exactly cause a rush to buy tickets or download The CW Network app to watch.

            The biggest addition based on the world ranking is Thomas Pieters of Belgium at No. 35. He shined in a losing cause in the 2016 Ryder Cup at Hazeltine, though he failed to make the next two Ryder Cup teams.

            The surprise was Brendan Steele, a three-time PGA Tour winner who joins the team of chief LIV recruiter Phil Mickelson. Both have the same agent, and Mickelson took him under his wing during Steele's rookie season in 2013, involving him in some of Lefty's money games.

            This is a different kind of money game. The stakes are high in so many ways.

            LIV Golf introduced Steele as a “10-time professional champion."" That includes his four Golden State Tour wins and one pro-am known as the Straight Down Fall Classic. He joins Mickelson, former U.S. Amateur champion James Piot and Cameron Tringale. 

            Other additions include Mito Pereira of Chile, Sebastian Munoz of Colombia, former U.S. Amateur champion Danny Lee and Dean Burmester of South Africa, whose rookie season on the PGA Tour ends after eight tournaments.

            “The most popular sports in the world are team sports, and our league format has already begun to build connections with new audiences around the globe,” Norman said.

            Dustin Johnson remains the star attraction, with a nod to The Players Championship and British Open titles Cameron Smith won last year. Johnson hasn’t played since the end of October, and more time off was part of LIV Golf’s appeal. He earned more more ($35.6 million) by playing less (eight events) with a big break at the end.

            Making fans miss a sport presumably makes them hungry for its return. But in LIV Golf's case — at least after one year — the nearly four-month break only created skepticism of its future instead of whetting the appetite.

            This wasn't a great offseason.

            There is talk, but no hard evidence, of team sponsorship and ownership. But then Matt Goodman, the director of franchises, in January became the fourth LIV executive to leave. He joined the chief operating officer (Atul Khosla), the chief communications officer (Jonathan Grella) and the chief marketing officer (Kerry Taylor).

            Majed Al Sorour, the CEO of Golf Saudi and managing director of LIV Golf, was transitioned out of that role last month.

            And late last week, a federal magistrate dealt LIV and its Saudi Arabian backers a setback by ruling the head of the Public Investment Fund — the financial supporter of LIV — must sit for depositions and produce documents in the antitrust lawsuit against the tour.

            The upside was having a television partner, The CW Network, instead of fans going to YouTube or LIV's website for live streaming. This is more about revenue sharing than lucrative broadcast rights, and still unclear is the commercial aspect to this.

            Then again, it was only a year ago when Rory McIlroy declared LIV Golf to be “dead in the water.” It's still afloat.

            No doubt LIV Golf was disruptive — still is — and the benefits have crossed battle lines by making both sides a little (or a lot) richer. 

            The PGA Tour responded to the threat by creating elevated events that average $20 million purses. The PGA Tour record for a season was set last year by Scheffler at nearly $12.9 million. Rahm already has just over $9.8 million, and it's still February.

            LIV marches on to the beat of its music. It made its debut last June, a week before the U.S. Open, and now has a full year of going up against the PGA Tour.

            Norman talks about LIV as a “new platform for world-class competition as the sport evolves for the next generation."" That's still to be seen. One thing that hasn't changed is that much like the game so many know, everything is earned inside the ropes.

He joins Mickelson, former U.S. Amateur champion James Piot and Cameron Tringale.Other additions include Mito Pereira of Chile, Sebastian Munoz of Colombia, former U.S. Amateur champion Danny Lee and Dean Burmester of South Africa, whose rookie season on the PGA Tour ends after eight tournaments.“The most popular sports in the world are team sports, and our league format has already begun to build connections with new audiences around the globe,” Norman said.Dustin Johnson remains the star attraction, with a nod to The Players Championship and British Open titles Cameron Smith won last year. Johnson hasn’t played since the end of October, and more time off was part of LIV Golf’s appeal. He earned more more ($35.6 million) by playing less (eight events) with a big break at the end.Making fans miss a sport presumably makes them hungry for its return. But in LIV Golf's case — at least after one year — the nearly four-month break only created skepticism of its future instead of whetting the appetite.This wasn't a great offseason.There is talk, but no hard evidence, of team sponsorship and ownership. But then Matt Goodman, the director of franchises, in January became the fourth LIV executive to leave. He joined the chief operating officer (Atul Khosla), the chief communications officer (Jonathan Grella) and the chief marketing officer (Kerry Taylor).Majed Al Sorour, the CEO of Golf Saudi and managing director of LIV Golf, was transitioned out of that role last month.And late last week, a federal magistrate dealt LIV and its Saudi Arabian backers a setback by ruling the head of the Public Investment Fund — the financial supporter of LIV — must sit for depositions and produce documents in the antitrust lawsuit against the tour.The upside was having a television partner, The CW Network, instead of fans going to YouTube or LIV's website for live streaming. This is more about revenue sharing than lucrative broadcast rights, and still unclear is the commercial aspect to this.Then again, it was only a year ago when Rory McIlroy declared LIV Golf to be “dead in the water.” It's still afloat.No doubt LIV Golf was disruptive — still is — and the benefits have crossed battle lines by making both sides a little (or a lot) richer.The PGA Tour responded to the threat by creating elevated events that average $20 million purses. The PGA Tour record for a season was set last year by Scheffler at nearly $12.9 million. Rahm already has just over $9.8 million, and it's still February.LIV marches on to the beat of its music. It made its debut last June, a week before the U.S. Open, and now has a full year of going up against the PGA Tour.Norman talks about LIV as a “new platform for world-class competition as the sport evolves for the next generation."" That's still to be seen. One thing that hasn't changed is that much like the game so many know, everything is earned inside the ropes.___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/21,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817425,Enfamil maker recalls potentially contaminated baby formula,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The maker of Enfamil announced a recall of about 145,000 cans of infant formula due to the possibility of cross-contamination with a bacteria that can cause serious illness or death.

            Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health and nutrition company, said over the weekend that is voluntarily recalling two batches of Enfamil ProSobee Simply Plant-Based Infant Formula, but that no illnesses or “adverse events” have been reported. The company said it identified the cause of the potential cronobacter contamination and are no longer using the supplier.

            According to the the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and prevention, cronobacter infections in infants can be deadly. The bacteria occurs naturally in soil, water and other parts of the environment and can live in dry foods, such as powdered milk, herbal teas, starches and baby formula.











            Almost all previous outbreaks in the U.S. have been linked to powdered baby formulas, which don’t undergo the same high temperatures used to kill germs in many other foods. Cronobacter typically causes fever in infants and can sometimes lead to dangerous blood infections or swelling of the brain.

            Last year, a nationwide baby formula shortage was triggered by an Abbott Nutrition plant that had to be closed for months because of contamination problems.

            Abbott recalled various lots of three powdered infant formulas from the plant, after federal officials began investigating rare bacterial infections in four babies who were fed formula. Two of the infants died. But it’s not certain the bacteria came from the plant; strains found at the plant didn’t match the two available samples from the babies.

            For the most recent recall, consumers should check the packaging of their formula to make sure they didn't purchase the recalled product. The product is Enfamil ProSobee Powder, 12.9 ounce can with a UPC number of 300871214415; global batch number of ZL2HZF or ZL2HZZ; lot number of 0670975 or 0670979 and an expiration date of March 1, 2024. 

            Consumers can return the product to wherever they bought it for a full refund. They can also call Reckit at 1-800-479-0551 or email the company at consumer.relations (at) rb.com.WASHINGTON (AP) — The maker of Enfamil announced a recall of about 145,000 cans of infant formula due to the possibility of cross-contamination with a bacteria that can cause serious illness or death.Reckitt, a U.K.-based consumer health and nutrition company, said over the weekend that is voluntarily recalling two batches of Enfamil ProSobee Simply Plant-Based Infant Formula, but that no illnesses or “adverse events” have been reported.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817427,"Explosion at Ohio metals plant kills 1 worker, injures 13","OAKWOOD VILLAGE, Ohio (AP) — A maintenance worker was killed in explosion at an Ohio metals plant that sparked a large fire and sent more than a dozen people to hospitals, with at least two in critical condition, authorities said.

            Emergency crews were called to the I. Schumann & Co. copper alloy company in the Cleveland suburb of Oakwood Village shortly before 3 p.m. Monday. The blast shook the ground and scattered debris for a couple of hundred yards, damaging several vehicles, while smoke billowed into the sky in a cloud visible for miles.

            Steven Mullins, 46, of North Ridgeville, who had been with the company for nearly 30 years, was killed in the explosion, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office. Thirteen others were being treated at hospitals, mostly for burns and related injuries, authorities said.











            The cause of the explosion remained under investigation Tuesday. But fire officials said the explosion likely happened in the building’s foundry, where molten metals are held in kettles. The state Fire Marshal's Office, which is leading the probe, said Tuesday the blast did not appear to be “the result of a criminal act.” 

            I. Schumann & Co. LLC, which calls itself a fourth-generation family-owned and managed business, “recycles and trades a wide variety of scrap and produces brass and bronze alloys in ingot and pellet forms,” according to its website.

            The company issued a statement Tuesday in which it mourned Mullins' death and thanked emergency responders for their efforts. 

            “We intend to cooperate with OSHA and other officials in their investigation as we search for answers in this tragic accident,” the company said. “We are working with our employees regarding their needs while the facility is idle and hope to have clarity on our operations in the near future.”OAKWOOD VILLAGE, Ohio (AP) — A maintenance worker was killed in explosion at an Ohio metals plant that sparked a large fire and sent more than a dozen people to hospitals, with at least two in critical condition, authorities said.Emergency crews were called to the I.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817428,"Jill Biden heads to Namibia, Kenya; part of US-Africa push","WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden headed for Africa on Tuesday, first stop Namibia, declaring as she departed Washington that she had “a lot to accomplish” during a five-day visit focused on empowering women and young people and addressing food insecurity.

            The first lady's visit to Namibia and Kenya is part of a push by the United States to step up engagement with Africa as a counterweight to China's influence on the continent.

            Biden, who teaches English and writing at a community college, said she dashed home from class with only an hour to spare before she needed to depart on the trip. She headed out a day before her husband gets back from his surprise trip to Ukraine and a scheduled visit to Poland.











            “This whole trip will be exciting and we have a lot to accomplish,” she said. 

            Granddaughter Naomi Biden is accompanying the first lady on the trip. 

            President Joe Biden told African leaders who came to Washington for a summit last year that the U.S. is “all in” on the continent's future and announced that he, his wife, the vice president and several members of his Cabinet would travel to Africa this year. He joked that the leaders would get tired of hosting everyone.

            Jill Biden will be the third U.S. official to visit Africa this year, following Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield. 

            The first lady will highlight issues around women, youth and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa, which includes Kenya, that was caused by severe drought and other factors. She will also focus on deepening U.S. relations with the two countries that are hosting her. 

            She will be the most senior U.S. official to visit Namibia since a brief stop there by Vice President Al Gore in 1996, the White House said. 

            Through renewed engagement with the countries of Africa, the U.S. aims to catch up with its economic rival, China, which has outpaced the U.S. in terms of trade in some of the 54 nations on the continent, the second most-populous.

            Trade between the U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa totaled $44.9 billion in 2021, a 22% increase from 2019. But direct investment fell by 5.3% to $30.3 billion. Trade between Africa and China in 2021 surged to $254 billion, up about 35% as Chinese exports increased to the continent.

            Jill Biden is not a stranger to Africa. The trip will be her sixth to the continent, her third time in Kenya and her first visit to Namibia. 

            It will also be her fourth solo trip abroad in the two years since the president took office.

            She traveled to Tokyo in 2021 to cheer Team USA at the delayed Olympic Games.

            For Mother's Day last year, she traveled to Romania and Slovakia to meet with Ukrainian women who fled with their children after Russia's military invasion. The trip included a clandestine drive across Slovakia's border a short distance into western Ukraine, where she spent several hours meeting with Olena Zalenska, the wife of Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 

            Jill Biden also traveled solo to Costa Rica, Ecuador and Panama in 2022. 

            She has accompanied her husband on trips to Europe and Mexico, where he participated in summit meetings with other world leaders. 

            During the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December, the first lady hosted two days of events for the spouses, including her counterparts from Kenya and Namibia.

            
                President Biden is expected to visit Africa later this year, though the White House has not announced his travel dates. He was in Poland on Tuesday following the surprise visit to Ukraine on Monday to meet with Zelenskyy.WASHINGTON (AP) — Jill Biden headed for Africa on Tuesday, first stop Namibia, declaring as she departed Washington that she had “a lot to accomplish” during a five-day visit focused on empowering women and young people and addressing food insecurity.The first lady's visit to Namibia and Kenya is part of a push by the United States to step up engagement with Africa as a counterweight to China's influence on the continent.Biden, who teaches English and writing at a community college, said she dashed home from class with only an hour to spare before she needed to depart on the trip. She headed out a day before her husband gets back from his surprise trip to Ukraine and a scheduled visit to Poland.“This whole trip will be exciting and we have a lot to accomplish,” she said.Granddaughter Naomi Biden is accompanying the first lady on the trip.President Joe Biden told African leaders who came to Washington for a summit last year that the U.S. is “all in” on the continent's future and announced that he, his wife, the vice president and several members of his Cabinet would travel to Africa this year. He joked that the leaders would get tired of hosting everyone.Jill Biden will be the third U.S. official to visit Africa this year, following Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield.The first lady will highlight issues around women, youth and food insecurity in the Horn of Africa, which includes Kenya, that was caused by severe drought and other factors. She will also focus on deepening U.S. relations with the two countries that are hosting her.She will be the most senior U.S. official to visit Namibia since a brief stop there by Vice President Al Gore in 1996, the White House said.Through renewed engagement with the countries of Africa, the U.S. aims to catch up with its economic rival, China, which has outpaced the U.S. in terms of trade in some of the 54 nations on the continent, the second most-populous.Trade between the U.S. and sub-Saharan Africa totaled $44.9 billion in 2021, a 22% increase from 2019. But direct investment fell by 5.3% to $30.3 billion. Trade between Africa and China in 2021 surged to $254 billion, up about 35% as Chinese exports increased to the continent.Jill Biden is not a stranger to Africa. The trip will be her sixth to the continent, her third time in Kenya and her first visit to Namibia.It will also be her fourth solo trip abroad in the two years since the president took office.She traveled to Tokyo in 2021 to cheer Team USA at the delayed Olympic Games.For Mother's Day last year, she traveled to Romania and Slovakia to meet with Ukrainian women who fled with their children after Russia's military invasion.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817429,Prolonged low tides see smaller canals dry up in Venice,"VENICE, Italy (AP) — Some of Venice’s smaller canals have practically dried up due a prolonged spell of low tides, frustrating boat crews and bewildering tourists.

            The prolonged stretch of ebb tides is linked to a lingering high-pressure weather system over much of Italy, experts say.

            Since the canals essentially serve as streets in car-less Venice, the phenomenon of the last days has added to the challenges of every-day life in the lagoon city. Ambulance boats in some cases have had to tie up farther from their destination, forcing medical crews to sometimes hand carry stretchers over long distances since their vessels can't progress up canals reduced to a trickle of water and muck.











            For tourists, it meant gondolas couldn't navigate some secondary waterways that run under Venice's many picturesque bridges.

            In mid-winter, high atmospheric pressure combined with the lunar cycle produces the ultra-low water levels during ebb tide, noted Jane Da Mosto, an environmental scientist and sustainable development analyst with We Are Here Venice, an environmental advocacy group.

            She added that the phenomenon highlights lack of attention to the overdue need for cleaning Venice's inner canal network.

            Navigation continued on the wider, main waterways, including the Grand and Giudecca canals. 

            Separately, the same high pressure system compounded by scarce Alpine snow melt this year has been a factor for the shriveling of lakes and rivers in northern Italy in recent weeks. This month, an isthmus linking the shores of Lake Garda to a small island has re-emerged, delighting visitors who were able to, in effect, walk part-way across the middle of the lake.VENICE, Italy (AP) — Some of Venice’s smaller canals have practically dried up due a prolonged spell of low tides, frustrating boat crews and bewildering tourists.The prolonged stretch of ebb tides is linked to a lingering high-pressure weather system over much of Italy, experts say.Since the canals essentially serve as streets in car-less Venice, the phenomenon of the last days has added to the challenges of every-day life in the lagoon city.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817434,Analysis warns of food insecurity for 5.4 million Kenyans,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — More than 5.4 million people in Kenya will likely experience acute food insecurity beginning in March and almost 1 million children are likely to suffer malnutrition this year as East Africa faces the worst drought in decades, an international initiative reported Tuesday. 

            The analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification predicted an increase in the 4.4 million Kenyans currently facing high levels of food insecurity in a country with a population of about 47.5 million. The current figure represents a 43% increase compared to the same period last year.

            Kenyan President William Ruto last week led a national prayer day for rain and promised to institute policies that would ensure the country's people have enough to eat. 











            Rain is forecast for March but the Kenya Meteorological Department said there would be delayed start of rainy season in northern Kenya, which is mostly arid and semi-arid.

            The region has had six failed rainy seasons, with less than usual rainfall in some areas and no rain in others.NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — More than 5.4 million people in Kenya will likely experience acute food insecurity beginning in March and almost 1 million children are likely to suffer malnutrition this year as East Africa faces the worst drought in decades, an international initiative reported Tuesday.The analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification predicted an increase in the 4.4 million Kenyans currently facing high levels of food insecurity in a country with a population of about 47.5 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817441,Supreme Court won't upset Arkansas anti-Israel boycott law,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to step into a legal fight over state laws that require contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel.

            The justices rejected an appeal on behalf of an alternative weekly newspaper in Little Rock, Arkansas, that objected to a state law that reduces fees paid to contractors that refuse to sign the pledge.

            The full federal appeals court in St. Louis upheld the law, overturning a three-judge panel's finding that it violated constitutional free speech rights.











            Similar measures in Arizona, Kansas and Texas were initially blocked by courts, prompting lawmakers to focus only on larger contracts. Arkansas’ law applies to contracts worth $1,000 or more.

            Republican legislators in Arkansas who drafted the 2017 law have said it wasn’t prompted by a specific incident in the state. It followed similar restrictions enacted by other states in response to a movement promoting boycotts, divestment and sanctions of Israeli institutions and businesses over the country’s treatment of Palestinians. Israeli officials said the campaign masked a deeper goal of delegitimizing and even destroying their country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817443,"US Rep. Cicilline to step down, lead nonprofit foundation","Rhode Island congressman David Cicilline said Tuesday he will step down this summer to lead his home state's largest funder of nonprofits.

            The Democrat, who is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Committee on the Judiciary, was named president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, effective June. 1.

            “Serving the people of Rhode Island’s First Congressional District has been the honor of my lifetime,” said Cicilline, who is serving his seventh term. “As President and CEO of one of the largest and oldest community foundations in the nation, I look forward to expanding on the work I have led for nearly thirty years in helping to improve the lives of all Rhode Islanders.”











            
                Cicilline, 61, said the opportunity to lead the foundation was unexpected, but gives him the opportunity to “have an even more direct and meaningful impact on the lives of residents of our state.”

            The Rhode Island Foundation, founded in 1916, focuses on supporting economic security, affordable health care, as well as education and job training. With $1.3 billion in assets, it raised $98 million in 2021, the most recent year for which data are available, and awarded $76 million in grants to 2,300 nonprofits, according to its website.

            Cicilline takes over for Neil Steinberg, who will continue as president and CEO until Cicilline starts. The congressman has “the experience, the skills, the passion, and the network to ably lead the Foundation,” Steinberg said.

            Cicilline was selected after a national search.

            “Congressman Cicilline’s career-long fight for equity and equality at the local, national and international level, and his deep relationships within Rhode Island’s communities of color are two of the many factors that led us to this decision,” said Dr. G. Alan Kurose, chair of the foundation’s board of directors, said in a statement.

            Cicilline has represented Rhode Island in the U.S. House since 2011. 

            The news of his retirement comes months after he withdrew his bid for a leadership post in the House this Congress. Cicilline, who is openly gay, had challenged Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina for the Democrat’s assistant role, arguing that it was time the party’s leadership table included LGBTQ voices.

            But Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black American in Congress, received unanimous support from the caucus in closed-door elections in December to stay in leadership.

            The challenge to Clyburn was a surprise, but Cicilline said at the time that he felt the need to act to ensure the Democratic leadership “fully reflect the diversity” of the caucus and of the country.

            During his tenure he was a frequent critic of big tech and the amount of power the nation's tech companies held. He was a House impeachment manager during former President Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, and a lead sponsor of the legislation that gave federal recognition to same-sex marriages.

            Cicilline previously served as mayor of Providence from 2003 to 2011, and in the state legislature from 1995 until 2003. He has degrees from Brown University and Georgetown University Law Center.

            Rhode Island's other longtime Democratic representative, Jim Langevin, served his last day in office earlier this year after announcing in January 2022 that he would not seek reelection to the seat he has held since 2001. He was replaced by another Democrat, Seth Magaziner.

            Under state law, Rhode Island's governor can set a date for a special election to find Cicilline's successor.

            The justices on Tuesday left in place a lower court ruling against Anthony Novak, who was arrested after he spoofed the Parma, Ohio, police force in Facebook posts. 

            After his acquittal on criminal charges, Novak sued the police for violating his constitutional rights. But a federal appeals court ruled the officers have “qualified immunity” and threw out the lawsuit.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817446,Wagner owner blasts 'treason' of Russian military chiefs,"The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner accused Russia's defense minister and chief of general staff on Tuesday of starving his fighters in Ukraine of ammunition, which he said amounts to an attempt to “destroy"" the force.

            Yevgeny Prigozhin, a millionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in an emotional audio statement released through his spokespeople that “direct resistance” from the Russian military “is nothing other than an attempt to destroy Wagner.""

            Emotional statements from Prigozhin and his fighters highlighted long-brewing tensions between the Russian military and Wagner, which has unclear legal status because Russian law prohibits private military companies.











            Prigozhin said in a raised voice that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov are handing out orders “left and right” not to supply Wagner with ammunition and or air transport. The company has been involved in heavy fighting in the east of Ukraine.

            This “can be likened to high treason in the very moment when Wagner is fighting for Bakhmut, losing hundreds of its fighters every day,” Prigozhin said.

            His claims could not be independently verified.

            In a statement, Russia’s Ministry of Defense denied “excited declarations” that ammunition had been held up for volunteers in “assault detachments” fighting around Bakhmut, and said priority had been given to making sure those groups were well equipped. The ministry did not identify whose declarations it was responding to. 

            It concluded: “Attempts to create a split in the tightknit machinery of cooperation and support between subdivisions of the Russian forces are counterproductive and only benefit the enemy.”

            The millionaire Prigozhin and his fighters have been alleging for weeks that the military doesn't provide them with enough ammunition. Wagner's push to take over Bakhmut, a city in Ukraine's partially occupied eastern Donetsk region, has stalled and turned into a grinding battle. 

            Prigozhin also has repeatedly accused Russia's top military brass in recent months of incompetence. He has raised his public profile, issuing daily statements that boast about Wagner’s purported victories and mock his opponents.

            His criticism, however, appears to have fallen on deaf ears. Last month, Putin reaffirmed his trust in Gerasimov by putting him in direct charge of Russian forces in Ukraine, a move that some observers also interpreted as an attempt to cut Prigozhin down to size. 

            On Tuesday, in his long-anticipated state-of-the-nation address, Putin profusely thanked his military, but he made no mention of Wagner.The owner of the Russian private military company Wagner accused Russia's defense minister and chief of general staff on Tuesday of starving his fighters in Ukraine of ammunition, which he said amounts to an attempt to “destroy"" the force.Yevgeny Prigozhin, a millionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in an emotional audio statement released through his spokespeople that “direct resistance” from the Russian military “is nothing other than an attempt to destroy Wagner.""Emotional statements from Prigozhin and his fighters highlighted long-brewing tensions between the Russian military and Wagner, which has unclear legal status because Russian law prohibits private military companies.Prigozhin said in a raised voice that Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov are handing out orders “left and right” not to supply Wagner with ammunition and or air transport.

            The justices left in place an appeals court ruling against the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia. The organization said that the National Security Agency’s “Upstream” surveillance program violates free-speech rights and protections against unreasonable search and seizure.

            Details of the Upstream program are classified, but it collects data from transmissions over high-speed cables that carry electronic communications into and out of the country.











            The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, had ruled that the lawsuit must be dismissed after the government invoked the “state secrets privilege” against the possible damage to national security that might result from a court case.WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to revive an ACLU lawsuit challenging a portion of the National Security Agency’s warrantless surveillance of Americans’ international email and phone communications.The justices left in place an appeals court ruling against the Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817450,US home sales fell again in January; prices edged higher,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The nation's housing slump dragged on into January as home sales fell for the 12th consecutive month to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years. 

            The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that existing U.S. home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million properties last month. That's the slowest annual pace since October 2010, when the housing market was still reeling from the 2008 foreclosure crisis. 

            January’s sales cratered by nearly 37% from a year earlier and slipped 0.7% from December. Economists had projected a modest monthly rise in sales, according to FactSet.











            The median U.S. home price edged up 1.3% from January last year to $359,000. That’s the slowest annual increase in home prices since February 2012. The median home price is down around 13% since it peaked in June last year.

            The modest monthly sales drop and small increase in home prices suggests the housing market downturn may be nearing an end, said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.

            “We have to wait until things develop, but perhaps home sales are bottoming out right now,” he said.

            The path to homeownership was still largely unsurmountable for many Americans in January, as mortgage rates eased from their November highs, but remained roughly double what they were a year earlier. As rates rise, they can add hundreds of dollars to monthly mortgage payments.

            Consider, the monthly mortgage payment on a typical U.S. starter home priced at $321,900, after factoring in a 10% down payment, was $1,931 in the fourth quarter, or 57% higher than a year earlier, according to data from the NAR. 

            Still, some market trends have begun shifting in buyers' favor. The number of homes for sale remains tight by historical standards, but increased 2.1% in January from the previous month to 980,000 properties, snapping a five-month skid, and was up 15.3% from January last year, the NAR said.

            That amounts to a 2.9-month supply at the current sales pace, up from 1.6% in January last year. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 5- to 6-month supply.

            “Inventory remains low, but buyers are beginning to have better negotiating power,” Yun said. “Homes sitting on the market for more than 60 days can be purchased for around 10% less than the original list price.”

            While home prices rose overall, they fell in roughly half the country last month, Yun noted.

            On average, homes sold in 33 days of hitting the market in January. That’s up from 26 days in December and 19 days in January last year. The increase reflects more properties sitting on the market longer, though more than half of all homes sold last month were snapped up in less than a month of being put up for sale, the NAR said.

            Having more homes to choose from likely helped out first-time homebuyers, which accounted for 31% of January’s home sales, unchanged from the previous month, but up from 27% a year earlier.

            Overall, the market remains competitive, though not as frenzied as it was a year ago, when multiple offers and buyers paying well above asking prices were more common.

            “Buyers can anticipate some good negotiating power for those homes that are sitting on the market for a long period,” Yun said.

            Existing home sales sank nearly 18% in 2022 as mortgage rates climbed to a two-decade high of 7.08% by the fall. 

            The average weekly rate on a 30-year mortgage has been hovering above 6% since mid-November, but jumped last week to 6.32%, its highest level in five weeks, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. A year ago it was 3.92%.

            Mortgage rates have been rising as the Federal Reserve continues to boost its key lending rate in a quest to cool the economy and tame inflation. Investors’ expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Fed does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.

            Home loan rates are likely to remain a significant hurdle as long as the Fed keeps raising its key interest rate. At its first meeting of 2023 earlier this month, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points, its eighth increase in less than a year. That pushed the central bank’s key rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%, its highest level in 15 years.

            Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that some measures of inflation have eased, but he appeared to suggest that he foresees two additional quarter-point rate hikes this year.LOS ANGELES (AP) — The nation's housing slump dragged on into January as home sales fell for the 12th consecutive month to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that existing U.S. home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million properties last month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817463,Rep. Barbara Lee joins race for California US Senate seat,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee on Tuesday formally launched her campaign for the Senate seat held by the retiring Dianne Feinstein, joining two fellow House Democrats in the race in the nation's most populous state.

            In a video posted on Twitter, Lee ran through a list of the personal and professional battles she has taken on in her life, including fighting to be her school's first Black cheerleader, championing protections for survivors of domestic violence and being the only member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

            “Today I am proud to announce my candidacy for U.S. Senate. I’ve never backed down from doing what’s right. And I never will,"" Lee said in the video. “Californians deserve a strong, progressive leader who has delivered real change.”











            Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, filed federal paperwork last week to enter the campaign shortly after the 89-year-old Feinstein announced she would step down after her term ends next year. Feinstein, the oldest member of Congress, has held the seat since 1992.

            Democratic U.S. Reps. Katie Porter, who is known for her use of a whiteboard during congressional hearings, and Adam Schiff, the lead prosecutor in then-President Donald Trump’s first impeachment trial, announced their Senate campaigns last month.

            The three Democratic candidates occupy much of the same political terrain, so the race could be shaped by other factors that distinguish them.

            Lee's district in the San Francisco Bay Area is one of the most liberal in the country and includes Berkeley and Oakland. Porter represents a politically divided district in Orange County, southeast of Los Angeles, that was once a conservative stronghold. Schiff's district runs north from Los Angeles and includes Hollywood and Burbank, where he lives.

            Lee is the highest-ranking Black woman appointed to House Democratic leadership, serving as co-chair of the Policy and Steering Committee. Schiff and Porter are white. Lee, at 76, is the oldest of the group. Porter is 49, and Schiff is 62.

            In a nod to her age, Lee said she was the same fighter she has always been.

            “For those who say my time has passed, well, when does making change go out of style?"" she said in the video. ""I don’t quit. I don’t give up.”

            There are no Black women in the Senate, and there have been only two in the chamber’s history: Vice President Kamala Harris, who was California’s first Black senator, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, who served one term.

            None of the candidates has run statewide before. They face the challenge of becoming more widely known, though they each have established political reputations. 

            Lee and Porter have been leaders in the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Schiff describes himself as a progressive champion but was once a member of the House's centrist Blue Dog Coalition.

            Lee has long been on outspoken defender of abortion rights. In 2021, she was one of several members of Congress who shared personal testimony about their own abortions during a congressional hearing.

            She became pregnant at age 16 in the mid-1960s. Abortion in California was illegal at the time, so a family friend helped send her to a back-alley clinic in Mexico, she said at the time.

            She had no ill effects from the procedure, but she said many other women weren’t so lucky in that era.

            Democrats are expected to dominate the contest in the liberal state. A Republican hasn’t won a statewide race in California since 2006, and the past two U.S. Senate elections had only Democrats on the November ballot.LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S. Rep.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817464,Nets give coach Jacque Vaughn multiyear contract extension,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jacque Vaughn, who has coached the Brooklyn Nets into playoff position despite the trades of Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving during another turbulent season for the franchise, has agreed to a multiyear contract extension.

            
                Vaughn replaced Steve Nash early in the season and the Nets announced Tuesday they were extending his deal. Terms were not disclosed, though general manager Sean Marks said the Nets looked forward to Vaughn leading the team “for years to come.”

            “Jacque has made an immediate and immeasurable impact on our entire organization since assuming the role of head coach earlier this season,” Marks said in a news release.











            The Nets (34-24) are fifth in the Eastern Conference and have gone 32-19 under Vaughn, the fifth-best record in the league.

            He replaced Nash on an interim basis on Nov. 1 and took the full-time position on Nov. 9 — after the Nets had discussed the position with former Boston Celtics coach Ime Udoka.

            Vaughn quickly steadied the team and the Nets surged to a franchise-best 12-1 record in December, earning coach of the month honors in the East.

            The Nets climbed all the way to second in the East before Durant was hurt in January. He never played for the team again before being traded to Phoenix, days after Irving was dealt to Dallas.

            Vaughn has continued to preach that the Nets still have enough that they should expect to win even despite the departure of the All-Stars.

            “On the court, he’s clearly demonstrated his leadership through his ability to connect and communicate at a very high level while displaying tremendous instincts for the game,” Marks said. “As a person, they don’t come any better than Jacque. His character is impeccable, and there is not a better representative for our team and our borough.”

            Vaughn is in his second stint coaching the Nets. He led them to a 7-3 record in 2020, including a playoff appearance during the restart at World Disney World, before the Nets hired Nash that fall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817465,Brazil deluge toll hits 44 as search continues for missing,"SAO SEBASTIAO, Brazil (AP) — The death toll from flooding and landslides in Brazil’s southern state of Sao Paulo reached 44 on Tuesday as searches continued for dozens still missing.

            Most of the search was concentrated in the mountainous coastal municipality of Sao Sebastiao where 43 deaths have been recorded. Firefighters still hoped to find people alive in the rubble of houses slammed by landslides during a weekend deluge, said Sao Sebastiao city hall worker Pedro de Rosario. 

             “Hope is the last thing that dies, so we have a lot of hope,"" de Rosario said. “There are still people buried.”











            Seven bodies have been identified and released for burial, while nearly 800 people are homeless and 1,730 people have been displaced, the Sao Paulo state government said in a statement.

            Members of the armed forces joined the search and rescue efforts, and starting Thursday the Navy will build a hospital with up to 300 beds to help relief efforts, Gov. Tarcisio de Freitas said at a news conference in Sao Sebastiao on Tuesday. 

            Authorities are digging through the mud and clearing roads, but parts of the highway connecting Rio de Janeiro state with Sao Paulo’s port city of Santos are still blocked by landslides. Another road connecting the city of Bortiga to inland Sao Paulo remains completely blocked. 

            Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva visited the region on Monday. In remarks to reporters, he called for people living in the hillside areas to be relocated to safer regions.

            Precipitation in Sao Sebastiao surpassed 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) during a 24-hour period over the weekend, among the largest such downpours ever in such a short period in Brazil.

            Around 7.5 tons of aid items including food, water and hygiene kits have already been distributed to the victims, the state government of Sao Paulo said. 

            The affected area, on the northern coast of Sao Paulo state and famous for beach resorts flanked by mountains, is a frequent Carnival destination for wealthy tourists who prefer to stay away from massive street parties in big cities.SAO SEBASTIAO, Brazil (AP) — The death toll from flooding and landslides in Brazil’s southern state of Sao Paulo reached 44 on Tuesday as searches continued for dozens still missing.Most of the search was concentrated in the mountainous coastal municipality of Sao Sebastiao where 43 deaths have been recorded.

            Playa del Carmen has long had a reputation for rough and dangerous bars, but what allegedly happened at the city’s La Cueva bar on Feb. 11 appears to set a new standard of violence.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817467,Cleveland Browns fire special teams coordinator Mike Priefer,"CLEVELAND (AP) — Mike Priefer's shining moment with the Browns came when he coached them to a memorable playoff win.

            The rest of his four seasons were underwhelming.

            Priefer was fired Tuesday following a 7-10 season, capping a tenure filled with inconsistency and too many breakdowns by his units.











            The move came six weeks after coach Kevin Stefanski fired defensive coordinator Joe Woods shortly after a loss to Pittsburgh in the finale. Woods has since been hired as a coordinator with New Orleans.

            Priefer spent three seasons on Stefanski's staff and filled in for him when the first-year coach had COVID-19 and missed the Browns' 48-37 AFC wild-card win over Pittsburgh in the 2020 season.

            It was Cleveland's first postseason win since 1994, and Priefer, a Cleveland native, relished the chance to lead the Browns.

            However, the team's issues on special teams throughout this past season led to his dismissal with one year left on his contract.

            “I appreciate everything Prief has done for this team in his three seasons as my special teams coordinator, but I have decided to move in another direction in the best interest of our organization,"" Stefanski said. “I know this city will forever be grateful for the job he did as acting head coach in our AFC wild-card win and for all his contributions while leading the Browns special teams units for the last four seasons.”

            The Browns have requested an interview with Colts special teams coordinator Bubba Ventrone, who was a candidate for Indianapolis' head coaching job. Even though he was passed over in favor of Shane Steichen, Ventrone remains under contract in Indianapolis.

            Ventrone was a special teams star with the Browns from 2009-12 after playing with New England. He retired as a player after the 2014 season in San Francisco.

            Priefer coached with Stefanski in Minnesota and was retained by him after the Browns fired coach Freddie Kitchens following the 2019 season.

            Priefer's dismissal creates another opening on Cleveland's staff. Stefanski also must replace quarterbacks coach Drew Petzing, who left to become Arizona's offensive coordinator. Also, defensive line coach Chris Kiffin moved on to Houston and defensive backs coach Jeff Howard took a position coaching linebackers for the Los Angeles Chargers.

            Stefanski is bringing on former Miami Hurricanes safeties coach and current Utah State defensive coordinator Ephraim Banda to coach Cleveland's safeties.

            Cleveland's special teams had issues all last season, beginning with punt returner Jakeem Grant suffering a knee injury in training camp.

            The Browns' return game had little impact though there was some improvement as the season progressed, with rookie Jerome Ford returning kickoffs and Donovan Peoples-Jones handling punts.

            One of the biggest special teams gaffes under Priefer came in a Week 2 loss to the New York Jets. Cleveland's inability to cover an onside kick helped the Jets overcome a two-touchdown deficit in the final 1:55 to win 31-30.

            Also, rookie kicker Cade York's struggles didn't help Priefer's case. The fourth-round draft pick missed several big kicks — including an extra point in the Jets loss — and had a few blocked because of low trajectory. 

            York finished 24 of 32 on field goals and 35 of 37 on PATs.

            Behind those customer-facing outlets, plant breeders work tirelessly to produce innovative plants with larger flowers; better disease resistance; improved cold-, heat- or shade-tolerance; longer bloom times and even higher nutrition.











            PERENNIALS

            The 2023 season brings us several firsts, including the first-ever groundcover shasta daisy, Leucanthemum “Carpet Angel,” from Green Fuse Botanicals. Named a 2023 All-America Selection by the independent, nonprofit organization of the same name, which tests new introductions and bestows the honors each year, the extremely cold-hardy plant starts blooming earlier than other varieties and keeps going straight through fall in zones 4a-10b.

            Proven Winners has introduced two new native hummingbird mints in their Meant to Bee collection -- “Royal Raspberry” and “Queen Nectarine” -- which, as the group’s name implies, is beloved by bees. I grew the latter in my test garden last year and was impressed with the terracotta-colored flowers that blanketed most of the plant from mid-summer through fall. Hardy in zones 5-9, the mounding perennial should reach 30-36” in two or three years.

            Also from Proven Winners, I tested out the new Upscale “Red Velvet” bee balm, another native that lures pollinators to the garden. Suitable for part-sun to sun in zones 4-8, the tall Monarda variety emerges from dormancy with bronze-tinged foliage before large, cherry-red flowers take center stage in spring and summer. The deer-resistant plants grow to 32” tall.

            The breeder’s Rock’ N Round “Bright Idea” hybrid sedum stonecrop added a burst of yellow to my sunny test garden with its red stems, serrated green leaves and bright yellow, star-shaped blooms. The 10-12” salt-tolerant perennial attracts bees and butterflies, resists rabbit attacks and thrives in hot, dry spots in zones 3-9.

            PanAmerican Seed’s Echinacea “Artisan Yellow Ombre,” another AAS winner, is a bushy, multi-branched coneflower that produced bright yellow flowers in my test garden. Grow it in full sun in zones 4a-10b and watch as the pollinators come.

            The breeder’s new Rudbeckia “Goldblitz” is a strong, 28-inch black-eyed Susan with shiny green leaves and abundant blooms. The sun-lover starts blooming about three weeks earlier than other varieties and continues into fall. It’s hardy in 3a-9b.

            Astilbe “Dark Side of the Moon,” a National Gardening Bureau Green Thumb Award winner, is a long-lived, shade-tolerant perennial that attracts bees and resists deer and rabbits. Foliage starts out yellow with a dark margin before turning a rich chocolate brown, and its raspberry-colored buds open to reveal pinkish-purple flowers. The plant is hardy in zones 4-9 and reaches 22”, including the tall flower spikes.

            ANNUALS

            The shade-tolerant, downy mildew-resistant “Glimmer” double impatiens from Ball Flora Plant are reminiscent of miniature roses and come in an array of colors, including Appleblossom, Bright Red, Burgundy, Dark Red, Hot Pink, Salmon and White. Plants grow to 10-16” tall and 10-12” wide.

            The beautiful tropical “Royal Hawaiian Waikiki” Colocasia elephant ears, bred by University of Hawaii emeritus plant pathologist John J. Cho, Ph.D., was honored with a National Gardening Bureau 2023 Green Thumb Award. Its large, glossy leaves, adorned with creamy white centers and pink veins, are held atop deep burgundy stems on compact plants sturdy enough to withstand wind and rain. Grow it as an annual in zones 7 and under.

            Starflower “Paper Moon” Scabiosa, another Green Thumb Award winner, is a pollinator-friendly annual from Sahin/Takii EU. Its 36-inch stems hold round clusters of pale blue, purple-veined flowers that give way to decorative, papery bronze seed heads, which can be used in fresh bouquets or dry arrangements. For best results, grow it in full sun.

            Snapdragon “Double Shot” Orange Bicolor, from Hems Genetics, has uniquely strong, branched stems that hold white-backed, double orange-red flowers that fade to a dusty hue as the season progresses. The All-America Selection winner grows to 18-20 inches tall in full or part sun.

            EDIBLES

            “Sun Dipper” tomato from PanAmerican Seed was named Best New Edible Plant of 2023 by the National Gardening Bureau. Its peanut-shaped, orange fruits, meant to make dipping easier, are perfectly suited for a crudité platter. I grew the indeterminate plant, bred to resist fusarium wilt, tobacco mosaic virus and root-knot nematodes, in my trial garden last summer. It was the only tomato that performed well during the year’s too-hot, too-dry season.

            Another new tomato, “Vivacious,” available to grow from seed this year, is notable for its enhanced nutritional value. Breeder W. Atlee Burpee claims the roughly 3-inch-long, plum-shaped, orange fruits are high in beta carotene, with just one tomato said to provide 40% of the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A. Each plant promises to produce roughly 70 tomatoes throughout the season.

            How about a seedless pepper? “Pepper Pots Sugar Kick” from Proven Winners is a miniature, sweet orange snacking pepper that grows seedless when isolated from other pepper varieties to prevent cross-pollination. The upright plants grow to 20-30 inches tall and are suitable for growing in both containers and the garden. Harvest green fruits in 54 days or orange ones in 74 days.

            “Sweet Jade” squash, a single-serving-sized kabocha with sea-green skin and dark orange flesh, produces high yields and has a long storage life. The fruit of the All-America Selection winner, harvestable in fall, weighs just 1-2 pounds apiece.

Another student told their parent, who contacted the teacher of the student who made the threat, Lynch wrote. The teacher then notified administrators.

            “I immediately contacted the student's parent and excluded the student from school,” Lynch wrote.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817470,"4-day workweek trial: Shorter hours, happier employees","LONDON (AP) — Work less, get more.

            A trial of a four-day workweek in Britain, billed as the world's largest, has found that an overwhelming majority of the 61 companies that participated from June to December will keep going with the shorter hours and that most employees were less stressed and had better work-life balance.

            That was all while companies reported revenue largely stayed the same during the trial period last year and even grew compared with the same six months a year earlier, according to findings released this week.











            “We feel really encouraged by the results, which showed the many ways companies were turning the four-day week from a dream into a realistic policy, with multiple benefits,"" said David Frayne, research associate at University of Cambridge, who helped lead the team conducting employee interviews for the trial. “We think there is a lot here that ought to motivate other companies and industries to give it a try.""

            The university's team worked with researchers from Boston College; Autonomy, a research organization focused on the future of work; and the 4 Day Week Global nonprofit community to see how the companies from industries spanning marketing to finance to nonprofits and their 2,900 workers would respond to reduced work hours while pay stayed the same.

            Not surprisingly, employees reported benefits, with 71% less burned out, 39% less stressed and 48% more satisfied with their job than before the trial. 

            Of the workers, 60% said it was easier to balance work and responsibilities at home, while 73% reported increased satisfaction with their lives. Fatigue was down, people were sleeping more and mental health improved, the findings show.

            That's just what Platten’s fish and chips restaurant in the English seaside town of Wells-Next-The Sea has found, especially in the hospitality industry where people often work seven days a week.

            “Everyone is focused, everyone knows what they’re doing, everyone is refreshed,"" said Kirsty Wainwright, general manager of the restaurant about a three-hour drive northeast of London. “What it means is that they are coming into work with a better frame of mind and passing that on to obviously the clients and the public that are coming here for their meals. They’re getting a greater service because the team are more engaged.""

            Starting the trial going into the busy season in June, Platten's, which is open seven days a week, found the biggest hurdle was finding a model that worked for everyone, Wainwright said. 

            They constantly communicated with employees to find what worked best, which was having the staff split into two groups, allowing one group to work two days on, and other to have two days off, she said.

            The concept lets people work, have a day to do chores like cleaning the house and “then have two days off, seeing your friends, seeing your family, doing some stuff yourself,"" Wainwright said. “And that’s what this is all about — is actually just working to live and not living to work.""

            For companies that rolled out the shorter work hours — whether it was one less workday a week or longer hours in parts of the year and shorter hours the rest of the time to make an average 32-hour week — revenue wasn't affected, the findings say.

            Revenue grew 1.4% over the course of the trial for 23 companies that provided adequate data — weighted for the size of the business — while a separate 24 companies saw revenue climb more than 34% from the same six-month period a year earlier.

            For Platten's, “I don’t think we were really measuring it in terms of profitability,"" Wainwright said. “That’s not really it for us. We wanted to measure it in productivity. And actually, the productivity has gone through the roof.""

            For all those who participated in the trial, there was a drop in the likelihood of employees quitting, down 57% compared with the same period a year earlier, as well as those calling out sick, down 65% from a year ago, according to the findings.

            Of the companies, 92% reported they would continue with the four-day workweek, with 30% saying it's a permanent change. That includes Platten's, which said it's sticking with the model permanently.

            Charlotte Lockhart, co-founder and managing director of 4 Day Week Global, said “resounding success"" of the U.K. pilot program mirrors earlier efforts in Ireland and the U.S.

            There are, of course, industries that can't institute shorter hours because they need workers round the clock, such as nurses and first responders. Those workers and others have been walking off the job in the U.K. in recent months demanding better working conditions and pay that keeps pace with the high cost of living.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817471,Kremlin official urges deeper ties with China to resist West,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia's security head on Tuesday held talks with the Chinese Communist Party’s foreign policy chief, calling for closer cooperation with Beijing to resist Western pressure.

            Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's National Security Council, said during a meeting with Wang Yi, the party’s most senior foreign policy official who is visiting Moscow, that the West sought to deter Russia and China as part of its attempts to preserve global domination.

            “The bloody events in Ukraine staged by the West is just one example of it,” said Patrushev, a longtime associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “All that is being done against Russia and China and to the detriment of developing nations.”











            Russia has sought to cast what it calls its “special military operation” as an effort to protect Russian speakers and to derail Western efforts to turn Ukraine into an anti-Russian bulwark. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that argument as a bogus cover for an unprovoked act of aggression.

            Wang said Tuesday that the relations between Moscow and Beijing are “solid as a rock” and will “stand the test of the volatile international situation.”

            The Chinese official noted that Russia and China have “excellent opportunity to continue close strategic cooperation and contacts to protect our shared strategic interests.” 

            “Together with the Russian side, we are ready to strongly uphold our national interests and dignity and to expand mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,” he said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies.

            China, which has declared a “no limits” friendship with Russia, has pointedly refused to criticize Moscow’s actions, blaming the U.S. and NATO for provoking the Kremlin, and has blasted the punishing sanctions imposed on Russia. Russia, in turn, has strongly backed China amid tensions with the U.S. over Taiwan. 

            During Tuesday's meeting with Wang, Patrushev emphasized that “amid a campaign by the West to deter both Russia and China, it is particularly important to further deepen the Russian-Chinese coordination and cooperation in the international arena.”

            Patrushev said that the development of “strategic partnership” with China remains a top priority for Russia, and reaffirmed Moscow's “invariable support for Beijing on the Taiwan, Xinjang, Tibet and Hong Kong issues, which the West has exploited to discredit China.”

            The two nations have held a series of military drills that showcased increasingly close defense ties amid tensions with the United States.

            Patrushev on Tuesday invited Wang to discuss international and regional issues, adding that “this will help greater consolidation of our approaches and our unity in addressing shared challenges.”

            Wang’s visit to Moscow follows President Joe Biden's unannounced visit to Ukraine on Monday, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed a strong U.S. support for Kyiv on the eve of the Russian military operation’s one-year anniversary.

            Before heading to Russia, Wang held talks Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the sidelines of an international security conference in Munich. Blinken noted that he reiterated a warning to China against providing assistance to Russia in Ukraine, including helping Moscow with evading sanctions the West has imposed on Moscow.

            Wang is also set to hold talks Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817475,How is the Philippines balancing ties with China and the US?,"The Philippines' foreign policy under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. appears to be moving away from its previous pro-China stance under the Duterte administration and toward tightening its ties with the United States.Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. — the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. — propelled the Marcos family's return to power after winning a landslide victory in the 2022 presidential election.In his first State of the Nation Address in July, Marcos Jr. said the Philippines was a ""friend to all and an enemy to none.""""But we will not waver, we will stand firm in our independent foreign policy, with the national interest as our primordial guide. We commit to maintaining good relations with the rest of the world,"" he added.Under his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, domestic affairs in the Southeast Asian country were marred by the ""war on drugs"", a brutal anti-drug campaign that saw thousands of extrajudicial killings throughout the country.Though Duterte also stated Manila had an independent foreign policy, many political analysts viewed the former president has having a pro-China stance, thereby straining its relationship with Washington.Victor Andres ""Dindo"" Manhit, a political analyst and CEO of the Stratbase Group consultancy in the Philippines, told DW he believes there are stark differences between the former and current president.""Duterte and Marcos used the term independent foreign policy, but in the case of Duterte it was more of an anti-American direction, not really independent because it shifted directions toward China,"" he said.Manhit said China poses a security threat to the ""integrity"" of the Philippines' ""exclusive economic zone and certain areas of maritime territory.""""He [Marcos] is more accepting that we are living in a multipolar world and in this world, he needs to engage with countries that can serve Philippines national interests,"" he added.Tensions have been mounting between the Philippines and China over the South China Sea, which recently saw Marcos Jr.  summoning the Chinese Ambassador, Huang Xilian.The Philippine Coast Guard complained that on February 6, while in the Ayungin Shoal, a disputed area in the South China Sea, the China Coast Guard shone a military-grade laser twice at its ship and caused temporary blindness to its crew.In response, China said the laser was not military grade and was used for ""navigation safety."" The incident took place one month after Marcos Jr. visited Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing.Aries Arugay, professor and chair at the department of political science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said Marcos' reaction is a sign of a different approach toward Beijing.""This is the first sign that China seems to backtrack from scuffles in the South China Sea. Such provocations before were simply downplayed by the Duterte administration, but not by the Marcos administration,"" said Arugay.Maritime altercations between the Philippines and China are nothing new in the South China Sea, with Manila lodging hundreds of diplomatic complaints in the last year alone.But according to Manhit from the Stratbase Group, the publicity that followed the laser incident shows a shift in policy.""It has emboldened mid-level officers in the country to really talk about what's happening in the South China sea. Our coast guards start to report what's really happening,"" he said.The Philippines and the US, who are treaty partners, have recently agreed to restart joint patrols in the South China Sea, while American forces have been granted access to more of the Philippine military bases.Later this year, the two countries are scheduled to conduct the largest military drills in years under the annual Balikatan exercises, Philippine army chief lieutenant general Romeo Brawner told reporters last week.Arugay from the University of the Philippines Diliman said for now, Marcos is putting Philippine security interests at the center of foreign policy.""I think he's trying to balance for now, I'm not completely convinced he's going to be pro-US and anti-China immediately,"" he said.Manhit believes Marcos is being smart about geopolitical relationships.""He will continue to be open with China more so with economy. The Philippines is not anti-China, Chinese companies are here. I think he's an astute politician. I've seen how this works, Marcos was pro-China because when he was governor of his province, Ilocos Norte, it was because the number one tourists were Chinese,"" he said.Marcos is also hoping relations with Japan can grow, having recently visited Tokyo. Manila and Tokyo agreed to strengthen defense ties, and there is now talk of a new trilateral agreement between the two countries and the US.""The trip in Japan was just to open the channels of communication, for further defense cooperation, nothing definite has happened yet, but it might speed up depending on what happens in the [Taiwan] Strait, and if China remains aggressive and if this threatens both Japan and Philippines,"" Arugay said.In a recent dialogue at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Philippine president reiterated his stance.""I don't work for Beijing, I don't work for Washington D.C., I work for the Philippines. I promote the national interests,"" he said.Edited by: Sou-Jie van BrunnersumEvery Friday, DW Asia editors put together a collection of the week’s best stories from around the continent.

            On Tuesday, Everett was one of 19 new members announced for induction this spring into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the honor society that has included luminaries from Mark Twain to Toni Morrison over the past 120 years.

            Everett, the prolific author of the novels “The Trees,” “So Much Blue” and dozens of other works, has been a Pulitzer Prize and Booker Prize finalist in the past two years, is currently a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle fiction award for his novel “Dr. No” and was last year's recipient of a lifetime achievement prize from the critics circle. 











            He will join a wide range of writers, musicians, architects, performing artists and visual artists in the academy, along with honorary inductees Francis Ford Coppola and Frances McDormand, and two foreign honorary artists: Chilean poet Cecilia Vicuña and Andrey Kurkov, the Ukrainian novelist and prominent critic of the Russian invasion.

            The academy was formed in 1898 and currently has 300 core members. New inductees are voted in by current members and remain in the academy for life. They also help out hand out dozens of awards, with prize money for 2023 expected to top $1 million: Everett himself received a literature prize from the academy in 2003.

            “It’s cliche to say that being elected to the Academy is an honor, but that is exactly what it is,” Everett told The Associated Press recently. “I’m excited to be a member and to perhaps influence, if not the direction, then the health of American letters.”

            The academy on Tuesday announced it had also voted in sculptors Huma Bhabha and Arlene Shechet and visual artist Shirin Neshat. 

            Besides Everett, new literary members are the fiction writer and translator Lore Segal, the critic and memoir writer Vivian Gornick, essayist and novelist Phillip Lopate and fiction writer Yiyun Li. 

            Dancer-choreographer Yvonne Rainer and the playwright-actor Anna Deavere Smith also were elected, with Smith saying she was honored to join so many people she admired “in this fine community of arts and letters.”

            Others joining the academy include the architects Merrill Elam, Michael Maltzan and Maurice Cox, the design director of the National Endowment of the Arts under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.

            Musicians voted in include Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Roger Reynolds, experimental composer-performer Pamela Z and jazz orchestra leader Maria Schneider, along with trumpeter-composer Wadada Leo Smith, composer-conductor-critic Carman Moore and composer-educator Adolphus Hailstork.NEW YORK (AP) — The honors keep coming in for fiction writer-poet Percival Everett.On Tuesday, Everett was one of 19 new members announced for induction this spring into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the honor society that has included luminaries from Mark Twain to Toni Morrison over the past 120 years.Everett, the prolific author of the novels “The Trees,” “So Much Blue” and dozens of other works, has been a Pulitzer Prize and Booker Prize finalist in the past two years, is currently a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle fiction award for his novel “Dr. No” and was last year's recipient of a lifetime achievement prize from the critics circle.He will join a wide range of writers, musicians, architects, performing artists and visual artists in the academy, along with honorary inductees Francis Ford Coppola and Frances McDormand, and two foreign honorary artists: Chilean poet Cecilia Vicuña and Andrey Kurkov, the Ukrainian novelist and prominent critic of the Russian invasion.The academy was formed in 1898 and currently has 300 core members.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817478,Spanish league clubs concerned by Barcelona payments,"MADRID (AP) — Spanish league clubs expressed unease on Tuesday about payments by Barcelona to a referees' official for years.

            Barcelona has been under scrutiny since a state prosecutor was revealed to be probing club payments totaling millions of dollars to a company that belonged to the vice-president of the Spanish federation’s refereeing committee. Barcelona has denied any wrongdoing, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.

            The league released a statement saying the majority of clubs showed “deep concern about this case, which they consider to be of the utmost seriousness.”











            League president Javier Tebas said the case damaged the reputation of Spanish soccer and Barcelona president Joan Laporta “should resign if he can’t explain the payments.""

            Laporta said on Tuesday the club will soon explain itself, but attacked what he called a campaign to try and damage Barcelona’s name.

            “Tebas has always showed that he is anti-Barcelona,” Laporta said. “He tries to destabilize us. But I’m not going to give him the satisfaction of resigning.”

            Barcelona said it started its own investigation into the case with outside help.

            The league said the proposal of a joint statement from the clubs against Barcelona received “unanimous support” of all clubs in the first and second divisions with the exception of Barcelona and Real Madrid, “who objected to the joint statement for different reasons.” Madrid president Florentino Pérez has been historically at odds with Tebas.

            The league and the clubs’ executive committee “reject and condemn the facts, and are deeply concerned and actively working to clarify any irregularities that may have occurred.”

            Sevilla and Espanyol released statements on Monday about their worries.

            The league said it was “following this matter very closely and will act firmly within the powers and limits allowed by law.”

            The league said it sent a letter to the prosecutor’s office and offered to help different European bodies that may investigate the case. It said any other actions it took will not be made public to safeguard the investigation.

            The payments, which have yet to be linked to any illegal or improper activity by Barcelona, were being investigated as part of a tax probe into the company by the former vice-president of the refereeing committee.

            The league said sporting sanctions against Barcelona were not possible because the statute of limitations on the possible irregularities expired.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817480,'Night Court' reboot returns favorite but set in modern day,"NEW YORK (AP) — You can forgive John Larroquette for thinking he'd entered a time machine when he stepped onto the sound stage of the rebooted NBC sitcom “Night Court.”

            The sets for the arraignment courtroom, chambers and hallways where he had first made people laugh as prosecutor Dan Fielding starting in the 1980s had been carefully remade and even the green couch in the judge's office and the cafeteria chairs were found in storage and redeployed. It was he who had changed. 

            “Revisiting a character that one played 35 years ago is both an interesting problem as an actor and also a bit disheartening. When I look at my face then and my face now, I’m playing my own grandfather in a way,"" the 75-year-old actor says.











            In the reboot, Larroquette's former prosecutor Dan Fielding is convinced to return as a public defender after years out of the courtroom. He has become a lovable curmudgeon, who says things like: ""This is a court. Not a therapist’s office, no matter how many mental patients march through here.”

            Melissa Rauch plays prior Judge Harry Stone’s daughter, Abby Stone, the new night court judge and the sunshine to Larroquette's gloom. Of the weirdos who show up in her after-hours court, the judge declares: ""It’s hard not to like them once you know what’s going on underneath.”

            A verdict on the new “Night Court” has already been handed down: NBC ordered a second season early after the revival earned the highest ratings for a comedy series on the network since 2017.

            Larroquette suspects some of the interest is due to nostalgia and reruns but also pointed to the popularity of Rauch, a former star of “The Big Bang Theory.” “I’m sure there were millions of people who were very interested in seeing what she would do next,” he says.

            Rauch also produced the show and came up with the revival concept. She was a huge fan of the original, as a youngster using VHS tapes to capture her favorite episodes to watch and re-watch.

            “I think if you would tell the child version of me that I’m getting to do this, my head would have exploded, and I probably would have wanted to fast forward my whole life to get here,” she says. 

            She was drawn to the show's ability to effortlessly shift from heartfelt drama to heightened comedy, a flip she wanted to recreate in the reboot. 

            “First and foremost, it’s a comedy and we’re there to make people laugh. But I always feel that you laugh harder if you’re also able to feel something. And I think ‘Night Court’ did that so brilliantly,” she says. “Our writers, led by our wonderful showrunner, Dan Rubin, have really struck that balance in a beautiful way.” 

            Larroquette is the only actor to return to the series that first aired from 1984 to 1992, starring the late Harry Anderson, the late Markie Post, Marsha Warfield, the late Charles Robinson and Richard Moll.

            The original show’s breakout character was Fielding, both clever and lascivious. Larroquette won four consecutive Emmy Awards playing the part, a record at the time. But he initially resisted a return.

            “I was not interested in revisiting him for many reasons, partially because of the love I have of physical comedy and the fact that I’m almost 40 years older than I was then, that I can’t jump over tables. I can’t quite do the things with my body that I could then so easily. And just what do you do after that amount of time? Who is he now?” says Larroquette.

            “The more I thought about it, the more as an actor it became an interesting sort of problem to figure out —how could I be funny at this age with him now?” 

            The Fielding in the reboot has matured past his sowing-his-wild-oats stage. His character finally found the love of his life between the end of the last show and its return — but lost her. 

            “The Dan Fielding that existed and at that time was very different from the Dan Fielding we’re seeing,” says Rauch. “But he’s still the same person. He still thinks he’s the smartest guy in the room. He’s still a narcissist. And but at the same time, he’s evolved.”

            While the new series is clearly a product of today — with references to Uber and DJ Khaled — there are plenty of callbacks from the original show, like toy, springy snakes in cans that explode and the stuffed armadillo displayed by the previous Judge Stone. 

            Set designer Glenda Rovello recreated the sets from the original blueprints. “We gave it a coat of paint to update it, but we thought a government building wouldn’t have changed that much over the years,” Rauch says. 

            “Walking onto that set just feels so, so special. And I honestly, I pinch myself when I’m walking through those halls. It feels so surreal.”

            “Jen's Sunday show is just a piece of a much bigger puzzle,” said Rebecca Kutler, MSNBC's senior vice president for content strategy. “We want to bring Jen's voice to MSNBC's audience everywhere.”











            That Sunday show, “Inside with Jen Psaki,” puts her at a time of week popular for many television public affairs show. Her show will contain one-on-one interviews with newsmakers, essays and explainers of complicated political issues like the war in Ukraine and debt ceiling talks.

            It will also be available the next day on the Peacock streaming service. Psaki is developing other content for Peacock that will fit into the “Inside” brand the network is developing for her, Kutler said.

            One recurring segment on her new show, “Weekend Routine,” will profile a lawmaker or newsmaker as Psaki follows them as they go about some everyday activities.

            The Sunday show debuts on March 19.

            It's also important that MSNBC viewers get to know Psaki, Kutler said.

            “This is the first time she really gets to speak for herself,” she said, “for the first time in her career. That's liberating and exciting.”

            Psaki has quickly become a presence across MSNBC's schedule, during big news coverage and as a guest commentator on other programs, like “Morning Joe” on Tuesday.

            Psaki was press secretary during the first 16 months of President Joe Biden’s administration, before landing at MSNBC last May.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817482,Opponents describe hideous conditions in Nicaraguan prisons,"MIAMI (AP) — Constant fear. Screams and the sounds of torture. Darkness in a small cell with just a hole in the floor for a toilet. 

            Opposition prisoners from Nicaragua are recounting the months — and sometimes years — they spent in the notorious prisons run by the regime of President Daniel Ortega. 

            “Those were three terrible years. There were threats, and I thought they might kill us at any moment,” recalled Victor Manuel Sosa Herrera, who was held in three separate prisons. He said water was in short supply, and what little food there was, was often rotten beans. 











            Sosa Herrera was among 222 opposition figures recently released by Ortega, as had long been sought by his critics. However, Ortega’s government went a few steps further, deporting them and saying their Nicaraguan citizenship would be revoked and their property confiscated — drawing fire as an example of banishment, in violation of international norms. 

            On Feb. 9, they were flown to the U.S., where they have begun telling stories of the harsh conditions in prison, where visits were strictly limited, or prohibited entirely.

            Sosa Herrera, 60, ran a grain and feed business in the northern Nicaragua city of Matagalpa, when he was arrested in early 2020 and sentenced to 110 years in prison for treason and destabilizing the government. 

            He says he wasn’t an activist in the massive 2018 protests that shook Ortega’s government, but suspects he was arrested for his refusal to join government paramilitary squads that violently put down the protests.

            At one prison, the Modelo penitentiary, he was locked up alone in a sunless cell measuring 6 feet by 9 (2 by 3 meters), in the maximum security section known as “El Infiernillo,” or Little Hell. He says that another prisoner in a similar cell believed he had gone blind from years of living in the dark.

            Sosa Herrera said he was held in isolation with only a concrete platform to sleep on. Water was turned on for an hour at a time, twice a day. The metal cell door had a steel window that opened just three times a day to pass him a ""meal"": a spoonful of rice and rotted beans. That was his only daily contact.

            His wife could visit him for only 15 minutes each month, and they saw each other through a glass partition.

            At night, he said, he could hear other prisoners being tortured.

            “The guards put them into handcuffs and shackles, and then beat them and dragged them,” Sosa Herrera recalled. “We heard them screaming.”

            The Nicaraguan government did not respond to requests for comment on the prisoners’ accounts. 

            Ortega has maintained that his imprisoned opponents and others were behind 2018 street protests that he claims were a foreign plot to overthrow him. Tens of thousands have fled into exile since Nicaraguan security forces violently put down those protests. 

            In some ways, those held in solitary confinement may have been lucky.

            Isaías Martínez Rivas, a milk delivery worker, ran an independent online media outlet, of the kind Ortega’s government hates.

            Martínez Rivas was arrested in late 2021 in front of his wife, their baby and adolescent son. He was dragged off to a maximum security prison without an explanation or a warrant. Six months later he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for supposed antigovernment activity.

            Martínez Rivas, 38, was held at the prison in Chontales, 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Managua and two hours by car from his home. 

            He was tossed into a cell with 13 other inmates, all but one of whom were common criminals.

            “It was terror, we lived in fear,” he said. The other inmates threatened the opposition prisoners and stole their food, clothing and shoes.

            “In prison I was subjected to psychological torture,” he recalled. “They never let me see my family.”

            He has only been able to see his youngest, now 2, on video calls from Miami.

            Another prisoner who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals against her family, said she still doesn’t know why riot police burst into her home in November 2021, and pulled her away from her family as they were about to sit down to dinner.

            A perfume distributor, the 43-year-old woman said she wasn’t a political activist. But she was sentenced to 10 years in prison after prosecutors accused her of plotting to burn ballot boxes and receiving funds from abroad.

            She spent 15 months locked in a cell with nine other female inmates, all of them except her in for homicide or drug trafficking. The guards would subject the opposition prisoners to psychological abuse, she said. 

            “They would try to get at us by telling us we were going to rot in prison, to be eaten by worms,"" she said.

            Indeed, some prisoners didn’t make it out.

            Hugo Torres, a former Sandinista guerrilla leader who once led a raid that helped free then rebel Ortega from prison in the 1970s but who later broke with Ortega, died while awaiting trial. He was 73. 

            Torres was among opposition figures arrested in 2021 as Ortega looked to clear the field ahead of presidential elections in November of that year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817483,Seattle becomes first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination,"SEATTLE (AP) — The Seattle City Council on Tuesday added caste to the city’s anti-discrimination laws, becoming the first U.S. city to ban caste discrimination and the first in the world to pass such a law outside South Asia.

            Calls to outlaw discrimination based on caste, a division of people based on birth or descent, have grown louder among South Asian diaspora communities in the United States. But the movement has been getting pushback from some Hindu Americans who argue that such legislation maligns a specific community.

            Tensions within the community were visible at Seattle City Hall on Tuesday as a noisy hearing culminated with a 6-1 vote with a majority of the council agreeing that caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries and that without such laws, those facing caste discrimination in the U.S. will have no protections.











            The packed room, which overflowed with activists from both sides bearing banners, chanting slogans, challenging speakers and city officials as they made their comments, laid bare stark divisions over this issue within the South Asian diaspora. A majority of those present in council chambers were supporters of the ordinance and those opposed were a vocal minority.

            As council members voted in favor of the ordinance, the chamber erupted into cheers of “Jai Bhim,” which means “victory for Bhim” a rallying cry adopted by followers of B.R. Ambedkar, an Indian Dalit rights icon whose given name was Bhimrao. Dalit groups and their supporters say caste discrimination is prevalent in U.S. diaspora communities, manifesting itself in the form of social alienation and discrimination in housing, education and the tech sector where South Asians hold key roles. 

            Yogesh Mane, a Seattle resident who grew up as an untouchable in India, broke into tears as he heard the council's decision.

            “I'm emotional because this is the first time such an ordinance has been passed anywhere in the world outside of South Asia,” he said. “It's a historic moment.""

            Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Oakland, California-based Equality Labs, whose advocacy work along with community partners continues to push caste discrimination laws forward, called the council vote “a culture war that has been won.”

            “We got the support of over 200 organizations from Seattle and around the country,” she said. “It's a powerful message that Dalit people are not alone. The South Asian community has united to say we want to heal from the trauma of caste.""

            Council Member Kshama Sawant, a socialist and the only Indian American on the City Council, said the ordinance, which she proposed, does not single out one community, but it accounts for how caste discrimination crosses national and religious boundaries. Sawant said the council received over 4,000 emails in support of the ordinance.

            “We've heard hundreds of gut-wrenching stories over the last few weeks showing us that caste discrimination is very real in Seattle,” she said.

            Council Member Sara Nelson who cast the lone dissenting vote agreed with opponents calling the ordinance “a reckless, harmful solution to a problem for which we have no data or research.”

            “This could generate more anti-Hindu discrimination and could dissuade employers from hiring South Asians,” she said. “The community that is being impacted is deeply divided on this issue.”

            Nelson also said the ordinance would also get the city entangled in legal battles to which Sawant responded: “Bring it on.” Sawant said being fearful of lawsuits is not the way to effect progress or change.

            Council Member Lisa Herbold questioned opponents' logic that the law singles out Hindus and people of Indian descent.

            “That's like saying gender discrimination laws single out all men,” she said. “And just because we have a small population that is experiencing (caste discrimination) that doesn't make it any less important.”

            Shobha Swamy, a representative of the Coalition of Hindus of North America said she was disappointed by the council deliberations and line of questioning. The group said they received a show of support from over 100 organizations.

            “Due diligence wasn't done,” said Swami, who flew in from Atlanta. 

            C.H. Srikrishna, a San Francisco Bay Area-based tech worker, said he is worried about the ramifications this ordinance might have for the South Asian community.

            “I too want discrimination to end,” he said. “But we need to first determine that widespread discrimination exists.""

            Srikrishna, who is Hindu, believes the ordinance does target his religion.

            “When you say it originated 2,000 years ago, that is implicitly blaming Hinduism,” he said. ""That bothers me. I feel betrayed.”

            Sanjay Patel, a tech company owner from the Seattle area, said he never felt discriminated against in the U.S. as a member of a lower caste and that the ordinance pained him because it reminded him of a caste identity, which he thought had become obsolete.

            “I fear with this law, businesses will be afraid to hire South Asians,"" he said. 

            Earlier Tuesday morning, several activists braved cold temperatures and wind gusts to line up outside City Hall so they would get a chance to speak to the council before the vote. But the council restricted public comment at the meeting where more than 300 people had requested to speak virtually and in person. They heard about half of the comments before moving on to deliberations and the vote.

            The origins of the caste system in India can be traced back 3,000 years as a social hierarchy based on one’s occupation and birth. It is a system that has evolved over the centuries under Muslim and British rule. The suffering of those who are at the bottom of the caste pyramid — known as Dalits — has continued. Caste discrimination has been prohibited in India since 1948, a year after the nation’s independence from British rule.

            The U.S. is the second most popular destination for Indians living abroad, according to the Migration Policy Institute, which estimates the U.S. diaspora grew from about 206,000 in 1980 to about 2.7 million in 2021. The group South Asian Americans Leading Together reports that nearly 5.4 million South Asians live in the U.S. — up from the 3.5 million counted in the 2010 census. Most trace their roots to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

            Over the past three years, several colleges and university systems have moved to prohibit caste discrimination. 

            In December 2019, Brandeis University near Boston became the first U.S. college to include caste in its nondiscrimination policy. The California State University System, Colby College, Brown University and the University of California, Davis have all adopted similar measures. Harvard University instituted caste protections for student workers in 2021 as part of its contract with its graduate student union.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817485,"Michelle Wie keeping busy with video series, LPGA host","LOS ANGELES (AP) — To ask Michelle Wie West what she is up to these days is not likely to yield a short answer.

            When she is not chasing around 2-year-old daughter McKenna or learning to grow vegetables in her garden, the former U.S. Women’s Open champion is keeping a steady presence in business and in golf, and they don’t always intersect.

            Her latest venture is a project with corporate partner PitchBook and Front Office Sports. It’s called “Driven with Michelle Wie West,” a series of 12-minute videos in which she interviews athletes about their drive and how they choose to invest.











            Her guests so far have featured two-time WNBA All-Star Chiney Ogwumike (they were at Stanford together) and beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings.

            “A lot of them I knew personally,” Wie West said. “It’s a chance to learn about their journey. We’ve known these women and we know what they can do. This is more about the investment side.”

            The first season was filmed in one day.

            “A lot of wardrobe changes, a lot of research,” she said. “It was really fun, really organic.”

            Wie West remains best known for close calls in LPGA majors when she was in high school, missing the cut by one shot on the PGA Tour at age 14, and her five LPGA victories that include the Women’s Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in 2014.

            She also split time as an LPGA Tour player and a college student, and those years at Stanford inspired her.

            “It was an interesting in Silicon Valley,” said Wie West, who graduated with a communications degree in 2012. “One of our classmates started Snapchat. It was an amazing place where cool ideas were coming out, and you were inspired to do the same.”

            She is mostly retired from competition, though she plans to play the U.S. Women’s Open one last time when it goes to Pebble Beach this summer for the first time.

            Wie West also is tournament host of the Mizuho Americas Open, a new LPGA Tour event in which 24 female juniors will compete in their own American Junior Golf Association event while playing alongside a 120-player LPGA field.

            Most telling is the venue, Liberty National across the Hudson River from New York City, a course that prefers to host only special events. It has held a FedEx Cup postseason event and a Presidents Cup.

            WEST COAST MOVES

            The PGA Tour's arrival in Florida marks the unofficial road to the Masters, and two players come with a lot of momentum.

            One of them is Jason Day, a former world No. 1. Day ended last year at No. 112 in the world. In his last four starts, he tied for 18th in The American Express, tied for seventh at Torrey Pines, finished fifth in Phoenix and tied for ninth at Riviera.

            Now the Australian is up to No. 46, making him a lock for the Match Play next week as he tries to stay in the top 50 to get back to the Masters.

            Keith Mitchell tied for fourth at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and then was in the final group at Riviera and wound up alone in fifth. He is at No. 44 in the world and, like Day, will try to stay in the top 50 to return to Augusta National.

            The Masters takes the top 50 on March 26 — after the Match Play — and that 64-man field will go the deepest into the world ranking since 2001.

            That's more a product of Saudi-funded LIV Golf. There currently are 11 players on LIV Golf rosters from among the top 64, and with a few players likely to skip the Match Play, it most likely will go down to nearly 80th in the world to fill the field.

            That bodes particularly well for Matt Kuchar, who had a pair of top 10s during the West Coast swing (tie for seventh in Honolulu, eighth at Riviera) and has gone up to No. 65 after starting the year at No. 87.

            Kuchar has a 36-11-4 record in the WGC-Dell Match Play.

            GOYDOS AT 700

            Paul Goydos used to work as a substitute teacher and had no idea if he would ever make it as a PGA Tour player, or how long he would last.

            That made last week at the Chubb Classic telling. Goydos now has played 700 tournaments on the PGA Tour (511) and PGA Tour Champions (189).

            “For me, it just means that I've been able to grind things out,” Goydos said. ""No one has ever accused me of being a star or a great player, but I’ve been able to stay consistent and do my thing and keep doing my thing, enough to have a nice long career out of it.

            “If you would have asked me if I was 20 years old if I’d have one start, I would have been surprised,” he said. “So having 700 is great. It’s a bonus.”

            Goydos didn't just show up. He won at Bay Hill in 1996 and the Sony Open in 2007. His combined earnings on both tours is over $20 million.

            SWAFFORD OUT

            The biggest surprise when LIV Golf announced its first batch of players was Hudson Swafford, a three-time PGA Tour winner who has gone through his career without making many waves.

            His inaugural season didn’t turn out all that well. Swafford's best result was a tie for 29th against 48-man fields.

            Swafford missed the cut in the Saudi International and then withdrew from the Asian Tour event in Oman. Now, the soft-spoken Swafford will sit out the 2023 season with a hip injury, which he said contributed to the “decline in my on-course performance.”

            He said surgery will require four to six months of rehabilitation.

            “I remain a LIV Golf player and supporter and will be attending events as soon as my recovery allows me to in a non-playing capacity,” Swafford said in a statement posted on the league's website. “I am excited for the year ahead to get healthy again and back to playing the way I know I can and look forward to being back on the course soon.”

            DIVOTS

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsLOS ANGELES (AP) — To ask Michelle Wie West what she is up to these days is not likely to yield a short answer.When she is not chasing around 2-year-old daughter McKenna or learning to grow vegetables in her garden, the former U.S. Women’s Open champion is keeping a steady presence in business and in golf, and they don’t always intersect.Her latest venture is a project with corporate partner PitchBook and Front Office Sports. It’s called “Driven with Michelle Wie West,” a series of 12-minute videos in which she interviews athletes about their drive and how they choose to invest.Her guests so far have featured two-time WNBA All-Star Chiney Ogwumike (they were at Stanford together) and beach volleyball player Kerri Walsh Jennings.“A lot of them I knew personally,” Wie West said. “It’s a chance to learn about their journey. We’ve known these women and we know what they can do. This is more about the investment side.”The first season was filmed in one day.“A lot of wardrobe changes, a lot of research,” she said. “It was really fun, really organic.”Wie West remains best known for close calls in LPGA majors when she was in high school, missing the cut by one shot on the PGA Tour at age 14, and her five LPGA victories that include the Women’s Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in 2014.She also split time as an LPGA Tour player and a college student, and those years at Stanford inspired her.“It was an interesting in Silicon Valley,” said Wie West, who graduated with a communications degree in 2012. “One of our classmates started Snapchat. It was an amazing place where cool ideas were coming out, and you were inspired to do the same.”She is mostly retired from competition, though she plans to play the U.S. Women’s Open one last time when it goes to Pebble Beach this summer for the first time.Wie West also is tournament host of the Mizuho Americas Open, a new LPGA Tour event in which 24 female juniors will compete in their own American Junior Golf Association event while playing alongside a 120-player LPGA field.Most telling is the venue, Liberty National across the Hudson River from New York City, a course that prefers to host only special events. It has held a FedEx Cup postseason event and a Presidents Cup.Wie West, who married Golden State Warriors basketball executive Jonnie West (son of Jerry West) in 2019, still has a sponsorship with Nike and said she travels to Nike headquarters in Oregon to take part in a think tank with other women to talk about issues and initiatives.She also joined the Royal & Ancient to be an ambassador in trying to broaden the game’s appeal.“I am strangely busy,” she said with a laugh.WEST COAST MOVESThe PGA Tour's arrival in Florida marks the unofficial road to the Masters, and two players come with a lot of momentum.One of them is Jason Day, a former world No. 1.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817486,Frankfurt police make arrests after attacks on Napoli fans,"FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Police said violent Eintracht Frankfurt supporters have been trying to provoke Napoli fans in the run-up to the teams’ Champions League game on Tuesday.

            There have been “several attacks on Italian visiting fans by supporters from the Frankfurt high-risk fans' scene,” Frankfurt police said in a statement.

            Nine alleged hooligans were taken into custody and issued entry bans late Monday after police confiscated fighting gloves, balaclavas and face masks. The police said there were “well-known perpetrators of violence” among those arrested. Some 22 other Frankfurt supporters were also told to leave.











            The police are considering Tuesday’s game high-risk and have many more officers on duty in the run-up than for a normal Bundesliga game.

            “I can’t tell you the numbers involved but you won’t find a street corner in Frankfurt where there aren’t any officers,” police spokesman Thomas Hollerbach told The Associated Press.

            It was peaceful around the city Tuesday afternoon, with warm sunshine hinting of spring to come, but Hollerbach said it was still quite early before the evening’s game.

            ”Our main thing is to keep the problem fans apart because if they reach each other it’s fairly certain there will be violence,” Hollerbach said.

            On Monday, a group of between 10-15 violent Frankfurt fans attacked three Napoli fans by slapping them in the face in front of a bar in the district of Sachsenhausen. Later, another group of up to 20 Frankfurt supporters attacked three more Italian fans as they were leaving the same bar, police said. They said the Italian fans were slightly injured but did not need medical attention.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817488,Pirates' guest shagging fly balls requires medical attention,"BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — A guest of the Pittsburgh Pirates required emergency medical attention after suffering cardiac arrest on Tuesday while fielding fly balls on a practice field.

            The Pirates say the guest was shagging balls at the team's spring training complex when he had “a medical event” that required immediate attention and caused practice to stop.

            Jacki Dezelski, president and CEO of the Manatee Chamber of Commerce in Bradenton, confirmed the man is a member of her group, which sometimes is invited to attend practices and retrieve balls near the fence during batting practice.











            Dezelski said the man suffered cardiac arrest and was alert and talking later Tuesday following a procedure. She declined to identify the man until receiving permission from family members.

            “He’s doing great, just come out of a procedure,” Dezelski told The Associated Press. “His wife is back with him now. He’s alert and talking as he was in the ambulance. He was fully alert. ... I guess in some ways, outside of a hospital, he was in the best place he could be to have this happen because he received such immediate medical attention.""

            Pirates manager Derek Shelton praised the response of medical staff at the facility.

            “They did an unbelievable job,” Shelton told reporters. “... Our whole medical staff really jumped into action very quickly. We’re really fortunate we have that group of people in a scary incident they were on top of right away.”

            The Pirates' workouts were delayed about an hour.

            According to observers, Pirates players, coaches and staff members stood in the outfield while the man received medical attention. Kevin Gorman of the Pittsburgh-Tribune Review tweeted that the players, coaches and staffers “politely clapped” as the man was taken off the field on a stretcher.

            Ladarious Marion, 21, fired the rifle in the shootings and was arrested Monday on charges of murder, attempted murder and employment of a weapon during a dangerous felony, news outlets reported, citing a statement from the Memphis Police Department.

            Another man, Julius Michael Freeman, 21, of Memphis, admitted to driving the shooter to and from nightclub the Live Lounge where the gunman opened fire early Sunday and to handing him a rifle from the trunk of Freemen’s Dodge Charger, according to a police affidavit.











            Freeman is charged with facilitation of second-degree murder, five counts of attempted facilitation of second-degree murder and five counts of possession of a firearm to commit a dangerous felony, the Commercial Appeal reported.

            It could not immediately be determined if either man has retained an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

            Five people remained in critical condition on Monday and five had been released from the hospital, police said. 

            Victims were found at two locations in the Whitehaven neighborhood of Memphis, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of downtown and near the Memphis International Airport. 

            Police responded first to the Memphis nightclub, finding seven people injured, two critically.

            While there, police were notified that other victims of the shooting were about a mile away. There, one male victim was pronounced dead. Three more people were critically wounded, according to police.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817490,Romanian court rules to hold Andrew Tate for 30 more days,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A court in Romania's capital agreed Tuesday to extend social media influencer Andrew Tate's detention on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking by another 30 days, an official said.

            Tate, 36, a British-U.S. citizen known for misogynistic views who has 5.1 million Twitter followers, was arrested Dec. 29 when authorities descended on his property north of Bucharest. His brother, Tristan, and two Romanian women also are in custody in the same case. None of the four has been formally charged.

            Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, told The Associated Press that the Bucharest Tribunal approved prosecutors' request to hold the Tates for another 30 days, while the two women will be put under house arrest.











            It was the third 30-day extension granted since the Tates were arrested. The brothers also lost an appeal on Feb. 1 of a judge’s Jan. 20 decision to keep them behind bars while investigations continued.

            A document explaining that earlier decision said the judge took into account the “particular dangerousness of the defendants” and their capacity to identify victims “with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities.”

            Eugen Vidineac, one of the lawyers representing the Tate brothers, told journalists before Tuesday’s ruling that the defense team would challenge another extension, if one were issued. He insisted the defense had “effectively paralyzed the evidence"" in the case so far and that there was not enough to keep the Tates in custody. 

            Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech. He has repeatedly claimed Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a “political” attack designed to silence him.

            A post on Andrew Tate’s Twitter account before Tuesday's decision expressed confidence in his lawyers and his eventual release. A subsequent tweet said, “I can easily think myself into euphoric gratefulness for things as simple as having air to breathe. I can easily think myself into the deepest and darkest depression. I’ve seen hell. I’ve lived hell. I can produce either state.” 

            Romania's anti-organized crime agency said in a statement after the December arrests that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case who were subjected to “acts of physical violence and mental coercion” and were sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.

            The agency said victims were lured with pretenses of love and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics while being coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the crime group. 

            In January, Romanian authorities descended on a compound near Bucharest linked with the Tate brothers and towed away a fleet of luxury cars that included a Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Porsche. They reported seizing assets worth an estimated $3.9 million.

            Prosecutors have said that if they can prove the cars’ owners gained money through illicit activities such as human trafficking, the assets would be used to cover the expenses of the investigation and to compensate victims. Tate also unsuccessfully appealed the asset seizure.

            McGrath contributed from Sighisoara, Romania.BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A court in Romania's capital agreed Tuesday to extend social media influencer Andrew Tate's detention on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking by another 30 days, an official said.Tate, 36, a British-U.S. citizen known for misogynistic views who has 5.1 million Twitter followers, was arrested Dec. 29 when authorities descended on his property north of Bucharest. His brother, Tristan, and two Romanian women also are in custody in the same case. None of the four has been formally charged.Ramona Bolla, a spokesperson for Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, told The Associated Press that the Bucharest Tribunal approved prosecutors' request to hold the Tates for another 30 days, while the two women will be put under house arrest.It was the third 30-day extension granted since the Tates were arrested. The brothers also lost an appeal on Feb. 1 of a judge’s Jan. 20 decision to keep them behind bars while investigations continued.A document explaining that earlier decision said the judge took into account the “particular dangerousness of the defendants” and their capacity to identify victims “with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities.”Eugen Vidineac, one of the lawyers representing the Tate brothers, told journalists before Tuesday’s ruling that the defense team would challenge another extension, if one were issued. He insisted the defense had “effectively paralyzed the evidence"" in the case so far and that there was not enough to keep the Tates in custody.Tate, who has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017, was previously banned from various social media platforms for expressing misogynistic views and hate speech.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817491,Would-be Scottish leader under fire over gay marriage stance,"LONDON (AP) — A front-runner to become Scotland’s next leader fought to keep her campaign alive Tuesday amid a backlash over her opposition to same-sex marriage.

            Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, who belongs to the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, said Monday that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed. 

            Forbes, 32, was not yet a lawmaker when the Scottish Parliament legalized same-sex unions in 2014.











            On Tuesday, Forbes added that having children outside marriage “would be wrong according to my faith.”

            Forbes had been considered a favorite to replace First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her resignation last week after eight years as leader of the governing Scottish National Party. Several SNP lawmakers withdrew their support from Forbes following her marriage comments. 

            Forbes said Tuesdayshe was continuing her campaign “at the moment.”

            “I understand people have very strong views on these matters,” she told the BBC. “I think the public are longing for politicians to answer straight questions with straight answers, and that’s certainly what I’ve tried to do.""

            Forbes said she would “defend to the hilt everybody’s rights in a pluralistic and tolerant society, to live and to love free of harassment and fear.”

            She said she would not seek to change the marriage law if she became leader because “equal marriages is a legal right, and as a servant of democracy, rather than a dictator, I absolutely respect and defend that democratic right.”

            Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, a rival for the leader’s job, was among those criticizing Forbes. 

            “I’m a supporter of equal marriage,” Yousaf told radio station LBC. “I’m a Muslim. I’m somebody who’s proud of my faith. I’ll be fasting during Ramadan in a few weeks’ time. But what I don’t do is, I don’t use my faith as a basis of legislation.”

            Forbes, Yousaf and legislator Ash Regan are running to replace Sturgeon, who has dominated the Scottish National Party for almost a decade but failed realize her dream of leading Scotland to independence from the United Kingdom. A winner of the leadership contest is due to be announced March 27.

            British politicians have often tried to avoid the subject of their personal religious beliefs. 

            Former Prime Minister Tony Blair was reticent while in office about his Christianity. His spin doctor. Alastair Campbell, once shut down a journalist's question about Blair’s faith with a brusque: “We don’t do God.”

            Blair, who converted from the Church of England to Catholicism after leaving office in 2007, said he avoided talking about his faith out of concern people would think we was a “nutter.”

            Tim Farron, who led the centrist Liberal Democrats between 2015 and 2017, was dogged throughout his term by questions from journalists about his attitude to LGBTQ rights after he failed to deny that he considered homosexual sex a sin. He later clarified he does not think same-sex relations are sinful.

            A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the U.K.’s first Hindu leader, said Tuesday that Sunak was “hugely proud of the U.K. being a diverse and tolerant country.”

            Spokesman Max Blain said Sunak didn’t want “anybody in Britain to have to hide who they are or who they love.”LONDON (AP) — A front-runner to become Scotland’s next leader fought to keep her campaign alive Tuesday amid a backlash over her opposition to same-sex marriage.Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, who belongs to the evangelical Free Church of Scotland, said Monday that her faith would have prevented her from voting in favor of allowing same-sex couples to wed.Forbes, 32, was not yet a lawmaker when the Scottish Parliament legalized same-sex unions in 2014.On Tuesday, Forbes added that having children outside marriage “would be wrong according to my faith.”Forbes had been considered a favorite to replace First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who announced her resignation last week after eight years as leader of the governing Scottish National Party.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817492,LuLa back with goals as Inter Milan prepares to face Porto,"MILAN (AP) — The LuLa attack is back for Inter Milan, just in time.

            Both Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martínez scored for Inter in a 3-1 win over Udinese in Serie A, four days before the team faces Porto on Wednesday in the first leg of the round of 16 of the Champions League.

            That was the first time both players had scored in the same match since the final game of the 2020-21 season — also against Udinese. Those goals that season drove Inter to the title and earned the partnership the nickname LuLa, from the first letters of Lukaku’s surname and Martínez’s first name.











            Martínez scored 17 league goals in that title-winning season, while Lukaku had 24. And the duo frequently set up each other’s goals.

            Lukaku’s scoring streak earned him a big-money move to Chelsea, only to return to Inter on loan the following year. But the Belgium forward has seemed a shadow of his former self this season as he struggled with poor form and injury. The goal against Udinese on Saturday was his first league goal since August. His only other goal this season had come in a Champions League match in October, against Viktoria Plzen.

            Lukaku almost didn’t break his drought as his first attempt at a penalty was weak and easily saved by Udinese goalkeeper Marco Silvestri. But it had to be retaken for encroachment and the Inter forward drove his second attempt home much more powerfully.

            “Romelu is improving on a daily basis, training session after training session, game after game,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. “We have real confidence in him.

            “He’s giving all that he can and his condition is already good, but he can still make strides forward. He had an injury that caused him problems for four months, so he’ll only improve the more he plays.”

            There have been no such concerns about Martínez, who helped Argentina win the World Cup in December. He has scored eight goals in 11 matches in all competitions since the Italian league resumed in January. He is second in the Serie A scoring chart, with 13 goals.

            “He always gives his all and is one of our leaders,” Inzaghi said. “He needs to continue to work like he’s doing because he’s been excellent since returning from the World Cup.”

            Lukaku and Martínez will have to be good to get past a strong Porto defense that has only let in two goals in its 11 matches this year.

            Inter and Inzaghi faltered at the same stage last season, eliminated by Liverpool 2-1 on aggregate, despite an impressive 1-0 win at Anfield. Porto failed to make it past the group stage last season but reached the quarterfinals the year before, losing to eventual champion Chelsea. The team got past Juventus in that season’s round of 16.

            “We’re facing a team of quality that we respect a lot because it almost always reaches the round of 16 and sometimes goes further,” said Inzaghi, who was teammates with Porto coach Sérgio Conceição at Lazio during their playing days. “It’s done well against Italian teams in the past and we want to reverse that trend.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817493,On the clock: New timer will affect more than just pitchers,"SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — As one of the game’s top prospects, Grayson Rodriguez will probably make his debut for the Baltimore Orioles pretty soon, and then the 23-year-old right-hander can begin adjusting to the big leagues.

            In one respect, he has a critical head start: Rodriguez has plenty of experience with the pitch clock that was tested in the minors and will now be used in the majors.

            “I was a big fan of it,” he said. “Obviously, it speeds up the game. As a pitcher, it’s kind of what you want. Big league hitters take a long time to get to the plate. That drives me crazy, so this pitch clock kind of expediting the process, I like it a lot.”











            Not everyone is as sanguine about the new timers — and whether you're a pitcher, a catcher, a hitter or a baserunner, there’s no hiding from this rule change. Of all of baseball’s tweaks under Commissioner Rob Manfred, the pitch clock might be the one that affects the most players.

            The clocks will be positioned behind the plate and beyond the outfield, where pitchers and hitters can easily see them. They'll count down from 30 seconds between batters. Between pitches, it will be 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 if there’s a baserunner. The pitcher must start his delivery before the clock expires. After a pitch, the clock starts again when the pitcher has the ball back, the catcher and batter are in the circle around home plate, and play is otherwise ready to resume.

            So efficient communication between the pitcher and catcher is important, because the clock is ticking. The batter has a responsibility, too. He needs to be in the box and alert to the pitcher with at least eight seconds on the clock. Batters can call time once per plate appearance, stopping the countdown.

            “You kind of have to shorten your routine up to the plate, while I guess cleaning out the box or talking to the umpire or the catcher,” said Atlanta outfielder Michael Harris II, last year’s National League Rookie of the Year. “I kind of went through it in Double-A, so I kind of know how that works and how it can speed up the game, but I guess it takes some getting used to.”

            The goal is indeed to speed up play, specifically by limiting the parts of the game fans find particularly tedious. 

            According to Major League Baseball, the pitch timer reduced nine-inning games by a whopping 25 minutes last year in the minors, from 3 hours, 3 minutes in 2021 to 2:38. And other stats like runs per game, batting average and the rate of hit batters were essentially unchanged.

            “The games were shortened, but not at the expense of game play,” said Joe Martinez, a former big league pitcher who is now MLB’s vice president for on-field strategy. “What was really removed from the game was that dead time — pitchers walking around the mound, batters fixing their batting gloves, taking extra pitches in the bullpen, walking in from there.”

            Games early in the season, in the second week, included an average of 1.73 violations. By week 24, that figure was down to 0.41. When surveyed, about 90% of both pitchers and position players said they adjusted to the pitch timer within about a month. If big leaguers get used to it that quickly, they should be ready around the end of spring training.

            Still, there’s a difference between compliant minor leaguers and big league veterans who are used to a certain routine — and the amount of information available to major leaguers can make pitcher-batter showdowns a mental battle in addition to a physical one.

            “In this game, it’s all about strategizing and really finding ways to get guys out. I think that’s the unique thing about baseball nowadays,” Pittsburgh right-hander Vince Velasquez said. “There’s tons of talent that’s spread around the league, and hitters are doing their homework just as much as we’re doing ours, but I think it takes a little bit more time to kind of strategize and find ways to incorporate those things.”

            Velasquez doesn’t like the pitch clock, and his teammate, catcher Kevin Plawecki, has concerns about the punishments.

            “I feel like when you start doing automatic strikes, automatic balls, automatic runners advancing to bases, automatic runs scoring possibly, just based off of a step off, or a pickoff, to me I think that just changes the integrity of the game,” Plawecki said.

            When a pitcher fails to throw a pitch in time, the penalty is an automatic ball. When a batter isn’t ready in time, it’s an automatic strike. The clock would be easy to circumvent if the pitcher could simply step off the rubber or throw a pickoff to stall for time. To eliminate that loophole, pitchers are only allowed two disengagements per plate appearance. Pickoff attempts count toward that limit. 

            The clock resets on a disengagement. After a pitcher has used his two disengagements, he can still attempt a pickoff, but it better be successful. If the baserunner gets back safely, a balk is assessed and the runner advances.

            The restriction on pickoff throws serves two purposes. It limits a tedious aspect of the game — fans sure are quick to boo pickoff attempts — and it encourages aggressive baserunning in a sport that’s increasingly defined by home runs and strikeouts.

            In the minor league test run, stolen base attempts went up from 2.23 per game in 2019 to 2.81 last year. The success rate improved from 68% to 78%.

            “Any time they implement a new rule or something, you think you know what’s going to happen, and then people kind of weaponize it to their advantage,” said Philadelphia shortstop Trea Turner, who has 230 career steals with an 85% success rate. “Hopefully it’s more stolen bases for everybody — just makes it more exciting.""

            MLB has made other changes in recent years to reduce the time fans spend waiting — limiting mound visits, for example, or sending the batter to first base immediately on an intentional walk.

            Those rules, however, affect a limited number of situations. Even the automatic runner on second base — a drastic invention, to be sure — only comes into play in extra innings. The pitch clock, on the other hand, will be in effect from start to finish every game.

            The hope is that players can adjust well enough that obeying the clock becomes second nature. Perhaps some of the more skeptical voices will even start to appreciate it.

            “Maybe I’ll like it, maybe it won’t be as big of a change as I think,” Plawecki said. “I don’t anticipate it really being a huge issue, but it’s something we’re all going to have to be obviously cognizant of.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817505,Roscosmos: Russian spacecraft leak caused by external impact,"MOSCOW (AP) — A coolant leak from an uncrewed Russian supply ship docked at the International Space Station resulted from an external impact and not a manufacturing flaw, Russia's space corporation said Tuesday.

            The leak from the Progress MS-21 cargo ship was spotted on Feb. 11 and followed a similar leak from a Soyuz crew capsule in December.

            Russian space officials said that December's leak was caused by a tiny meteoroid that left a small hole in the exterior radiator and sent coolant spewing into space. But the new leak from another ship raised doubts about that theory, and Russia's state space corporation Roscosmos launched a probe into the incident to check whether it could have resulted from a manufacturing defect.











            NASA said its specialists were assisting their Russian counterparts in the troubleshooting of the leak.

            Following checks at Russian space factories and launch facilities and a close inspection of the cargo ship before it was dumped, Roscosmos concluded that the latest leak resulted from an “external impact” similar to the one that caused December's leak from the Soyuz crew capsule. On Tuesday. Roscosmos posted a close shot of the Progress MS-21 showing a 12-millimeter (0.5-inch) hole in its external radiator, which it said hadn't been spotted before.

            After ruling out the manufacturing flaw, Roscosmos cleared the launch of a new Soyuz crew capsule that should replace the damaged one.

            Russian Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev and Dmitri Petelin, and NASA astronaut Frank Rubio were supposed to ride the Soyuz they used to arrive at the station to return to Earth in March, but Russian space officials decided that higher temperatures resulting from the coolant leak could make it dangerous to use and it will return to Earth next month without a crew.

            Roscosmos announced that the new Soyuz MS-23 capsule to replace it will be launched in automatic mode on Friday and dock at the station on Sunday. 

            Since it will travel in uncrewed mode to expedite the launch, a replacement crew will now have to wait until another Soyuz capsule is ready, meaning that Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio will have to stay at the station until September, pushing their mission to close to a year.

            NASA has said it took part in all the discussions and agreed with the plan.

            Besides Prokopyev, Petelin and Rubio, the space station is home to NASA astronauts Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada; Russian Anna Kikina; and Japan’s Koichi Wakata. The four rode up on a SpaceX capsule last October.

            Roscosmos also announced Tuesday that Russia will extend its participation in the International Space Station until 2028, reversing last year’s statement from Roscosmos chief Yuri Borisov who said that Russia was planning to leave the station after 2024 and to focus on building its own orbiting outpost.

            The International Space Station, which has served as a symbol of post-Cold War international cooperation, is now one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Russia and the West amid the tensions over Moscow’s military action in Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817510,"Woods, McIlroy break ground on high-tech golf league site","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy put the silver-plated shovels into a pile of dirt and left sizable divots.

            With that, their high-tech golf league got a bit closer to launch.

            The ceremonial groundbreaking for the arena that will house the league that’s being called TGL was held Tuesday at Palm Beach State College, with Woods and McIlroy — two of the co-founders of TMRW Sports — there for the first step of actual construction.











            TMRW — pronounced “tomorrow” — says TGL play will begin early next year, and the league will be in partnership with the PGA Tour. Woods and McIlroy, so far, have 11 players committed to the league. Besides them, the league will include world No. 1 Jon Rahm, Justin Thomas, Adam Scott, Collin Morikawa, Matt Fitzpatrick, Max Homa, Billy Horschel, Justin Rose and Xander Schauffele.

            That list includes six players currently ranked 10th or better in the world, plus the game's biggest draw in Woods.

            “In terms of fan experience, it’s going to be nothing like golf has offered before,” McIlroy said.

            The concept is this: six teams of three PGA Tour players, squaring off in match play on a data-driven virtual course that also includes a short-game complex for chipping and putting.

            It’ll be played on Monday nights, and will take only two hours, with in-arena fans all very close to the action. There will be 15 matches in the regular season, followed by semifinals and a final.

            “We’re going to have excitement, we’re going to have something different, something that is is passionate,” Woods said. “We’ve been involved in teams before whether it’s Ryder Cup, President’s Cup, Irish national teams, for me high school, college, whatever it is. You’re going to get home and away, you’re going to get some people that you want to win and not win. We’re going to have that type of excitement.”

            And you can bet on it. Literally, Woods pointed out.

            “Wagering is part of our sport, part of our culture,” Woods said, then turned and looked at McIlroy. “We don’t know how to play golf without it.”

            Access is part of the allure of the concept, along with the technology. Only a handful of fans at typical golf events can get close to the action, and they’re often running from hole to hole to stay with a certain group.

            TGL players will be mic’d-up, and fans won’t have to guess what their thought processes are on certain shots.

            “It’s going to give the viewer at home and also the people in the arena just more of an in-depth of sort of how we do things and how we sort of think through things in our head,” McIlroy said. “It’s just a more in-depth look into that.”

            Mike McCarley, another co-founder and former Golf Channel president, said the arena will be built on a 10-acre (435,600-square feet) parcel of unused land. The partnership includes educational and recreational initiatives that will benefit Palm Beach State students, along with offering paid internships and other opportunities for students in technology, hospitality and administrative services.

            “Think about how cool this will be for this land, this campus, to become a launching pad for future leaders in sports and media and technology as they learn here as part of TGL,” McCarley said. “We are breaking ground on much more than a dream, much more than a prime-time golf league.”

            The church has agreed to pay $1 million and Ensign Peak will pay $4 million in penalties based on the violation.











            Ensign Peak avoided disclosing investments “with the church’s knowledge,” denying the SEC and the public of accurate information required under law, Gurbir Grewal, the agency’s enforcement director, said in a statement.

            Federal investigators said for a period of 22 years, the firm violated agency rules and the Securities Exchange Act by not filing paperwork required that disclosed the value of its assets.

            Instead, they said Ensign Peak filed the forms through 13 shell companies they created, even as they maintained decision-making power. They also had “business managers,” most employed by the church, sign the required shell company filings.

            “The Church was concerned that disclosure of its portfolio, which by 2018 grew to approximately $32 billion, would lead to negative consequences,” the SEC said in a statement announcing the charges.

            Increasingly, the church and its Salt Lake City-based investment arm have faced scrutiny over the fact that tax law largely exempts religious groups from paying U.S. taxes. Ensign Peak is registered as a supporting organization and integrated auxiliary of the church. Investment managers of its size are required to report stockholdings quarterly.

            It gained traction in 2019 when a whistleblower alleged the church had stockpiled nearly $100 billion in funds, rather than directing it toward charitable causes. Ensign Peak has since been a source of intrigue and mystery for the nearly 17-million member Utah-based faith, which encourages members worldwide to give 10% of their income in a what is known as “tithing.”

            Two years later, prominent church member James Huntsman filed a lawsuit against the church alleging it misrepresented how it used donations and, rather than direct them to charitable causes, invested in assets including real estate and an insurance business. A judge dismissed the complaint last year and Huntsman later appealed the decision.

            Earlier this month, the 2019 whistleblower, a former Ensign Peak investment manager named David Nielsen, submitted a 90-page memorandum to the U.S. Senate Finance Committee demanding oversight into the church's finances.

            In a statement, church officials said over the time period investigated, none of their holdings had gone unreported and all had been disclosed through the separate companies. They said they had “relied upon legal counsel regarding how to comply with its reporting obligations while attempting to maintain the privacy of the portfolio"" and noted that Ensign Peak had changed its reporting approach after learning of the SEC's concerns in 2019.

            “We affirm our commitment to comply with the law, regret mistakes made, and now consider this matter closed,” they said.

            Sam Brunson, a church member and tax law professor at Loyola University Chicago, said the $5 million fine differed from past accusations leveled against Ensign Peak because the church appears to have admitted some fault.

            A failure to fill out SEC paperwork may not fuel broader conversations about how the church manages its money, he said, yet it reflects an “incredibly aggressive” strategy to keep certain information from the public.

            “For the last 70 years or so, the Mormon Church has had an ethos of keeping its finances private,” Brunson said.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its investment arm have been fined $5 million for using shell companies to obscure the size of the portfolio under church control, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday.The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, maintains billions of dollars of investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and agriculture.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817516,'Forever a Spartan': Funeral held for Michigan State victim,"DETROIT (AP) — Hundreds of people filled a church Tuesday for the funeral of a 19-year-old Detroit-area woman, an aspiring doctor who was one of three students fatally shot last week at Michigan State University.

            Arielle Anderson's casket was flanked by flowers — one formed an “A” — and large photos of her, from childhood to young adulthood. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer described her as someone with “quiet confidence"" and ""loud compassion.”

            “Her future was robbed from her by a senseless act of violence. It's not fair,” Whitmer told mourners at Zion Hope Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit.











            Whitmer promised Anderson’s family that her death “will not have been in vain.”

            “Actions that we take in response to this will honor your daughter,” the governor said, a reference to gun legislation that Democratic lawmakers in Michigan are pursuing.

            Rema Vassar, chair of Michigan State's governing board, referred to the morning winter weather.

            “Michigan doesn't get many sunny days, but the sun came out today. ... You know diamonds are forever. And she lives forever,” Vassar said.

            Anderson, she added was “smart,” “brilliant” and is “forever a Spartan.”

            The funeral was the last for the three students who were killed Feb. 13 when a gunman fired at Berkey Hall and at the MSU Union. Services were held Saturday for Brian Fraser, 20, who, like Anderson, graduated from a Grosse Pointe high school, and Alexandria Verner, 20, of Clawson.

            Anderson wanted to graduate from college as soon as possible on her way to becoming a surgeon, her family said last week.

            Five students who were wounded remain in a Lansing hospital, including two in critical condition.

            The shooter, Anthony McRae, 43, of Lansing, killed himself when confronted by police about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) from campus. He had no connection to the victims or the university and may have had mental health problems, investigators said, citing a note in his possession.

            Classes resumed Monday at Michigan State in East Lansing, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.

            On Tuesday, Democrats in Michigan’s House announced legislation that they say will help prevent acts of violence like the Michigan State University shooting. The bills parallel gun safety and background check measures that Senate Democrats put forward last week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817517,Mass trial starts in Chad over former ruler Deby's death,"N’DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Authorities in Chad on Tuesday started the mass trial of hundreds of alleged rebels accused of killing longtime President Idriss Deby Itno, who died under murky circumstances in 2021 two days after winning a sixth term in office.

            Apart from the assassination charges, the 454 alleged members of the Front For Change and Concord rebel group are also formally accused of terrorism, using child soldiers and undermining Chad's integrity and security, according to a defense lawyer, Vounsia Vetada.

            Deby ran the country for more than three decades and died of unspecified injuries during an April 21, 2021 visit to troops fighting the rebel group, which was seeking to gain control of the oil-rich Central African nation. No details of his death were made public.











            The suspects were arrested and held at Klessoum prison some 20 kilometers (12 miles) east of the capital N’Djaména, where the trial is being held. The process is expected to last 10 days and is not open to the public. If convicted, the defendants face life imprisonment.

            Members of the rebel group are believed to have been armed and trained in neighboring Libya before crossing into northern Chad in April. Deby was elected to a sixth term in an April 19, 2021 election that top opposition candidates boycotted. He died days later.

            Deby seized power in 1990 when his rebel forces overthrew then-President Hissene Habre, who was later convicted of human rights abuses at an international tribunal in Senegal. 

            Hours after Deby's death, Chad's military named his son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, as the country’s interim leader for what was intended to be an 18-month period. However, last year the government announced it was extending the transition for two more years, which led to protests across the country. 

            An analyst described the mass trial that started Tuesday as a bid by Mahamat Idriss Deby to cement his grip on power and signal to potential challengers that he is a worthy successor to his father.

            “Deby is using repression to consolidate his still-uncertain position,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a risk analysis firm. ""But this method has never stopped rebellions in Chad before and is unlikely to do so now.”N’DJAMENA, Chad (AP) — Authorities in Chad on Tuesday started the mass trial of hundreds of alleged rebels accused of killing longtime President Idriss Deby Itno, who died under murky circumstances in 2021 two days after winning a sixth term in office.Apart from the assassination charges, the 454 alleged members of the Front For Change and Concord rebel group are also formally accused of terrorism, using child soldiers and undermining Chad's integrity and security, according to a defense lawyer, Vounsia Vetada.Deby ran the country for more than three decades and died of unspecified injuries during an April 21, 2021 visit to troops fighting the rebel group, which was seeking to gain control of the oil-rich Central African nation.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817519,EPA orders Norfolk Southern to clean up toxic derailment,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern on Tuesday to pay for the cleanup of the East Palestine, Ohio, train wreck and chemical release as federal regulators took charge of long-term recovery efforts and promised worried residents they won't be forgotten.

            Speaking to reporters near the derailment site, Norfolk Southern's CEO promised to undertake necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of the community and become a “safer railroad.”

            EPA used its authority under the federal Superfund law to order Norfolk Southern to take all available measures to clean up contaminated air and water. It also said the company would be required to reimburse the federal government for a new program to provide cleaning services for impacted residents and businesses. 











            “Norfolk Southern will pay for cleaning up the mess that they created and the trauma that they inflicted on this community,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan vowed at a news conference in East Palestine. “I know this order cannot undue the nightmare that families in this town have been living with, but it will begin to deliver much-needed justice for the pain that Norfolk Southern has caused.”

            He warned that if Norfolk Southern fails to comply, the agency will perform the work itself and seek triple damages from the company.

            EPA planned to release more details on the cleanup service for residents and businesses, which it said would “provide an additional layer of reassurance.""

            The agency said its order marked the end of the “emergency” phase of the Feb. 3 derailment and the start of long-term remediation.

            Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw reiterated promises to restore the site and invest in the community.

            “From day one, I’ve made the commitment that Norfolk Southern is going to remediate the site, we’re going to do continuous long-term air and water monitoring, we’re going to help the residents of this community recover, and we’re going to invest in the long-term health of this community. And we’re going to make Norfolk Southern a safer railroad,"" he told reporters.

            Jeff Zalick, who lives with his 100-year-old mother just blocks from the derailment site, said he’s waiting for the home to be cleaned before moving back. He said there's still a chemical smell inside, though not nearly as bad as a week ago.

            The walls need scrubbing, and he wants air purifiers installed before allowing his mother back.

            “I just want to make sure she’s safe,” he said. “She’s ready to come home. She cries every day.”

            In a tweet sent after the EPA announcement, President Joe Biden said the Trump administration and other elected officials have hampered efforts to improve rail safety.

            “We’ll continue to hold rail companies accountable when they fail to put safety first. But first, we’ve got Norfolk Southern’s mess to clean,” he said. “I want affected residents to know that we’ve got your back.” 

            EPA's move to compel Norfolk Southern to clean up came nearly three weeks after more than three dozen freight cars — including 11 carrying hazardous materials — derailed on the East Palestine outskirts, near the Pennsylvania state line, prompting an evacuation as fears grew about a potential explosion of smoldering wreckage.

            Officials seeking to avoid an uncontrolled blast intentionally released and burned toxic vinyl chloride from five rail cars, sending flames and black smoke high into the sky. That left people questioning the potential health impacts even as authorities maintained they were doing their best to protect people.

            Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine assured residents they will not be left to handle the aftermath on their own once public attention turns elsewhere. 

            “We understand that it’s not just about today, it’s not just about two weeks from now,” he said. “People have long-term concerns, and we’re going to do everything we can to stay at this.”

            Already, 4,600 yards of contaminated soil and 1.1 million gallons of contaminated water have been removed, DeWine said. But he said Norfolk Southern failed to address the contaminated soil underneath its tracks before repairing them and running freight again. He said the company would have to take the tracks back up and remove the soil.

            Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro blasted Norfolk Southern over what he called its “failed management of this crisis,"" saying the company chose not to take part in a unified incident command, and provided inaccurate information and conflicting modeling data.

            “The combination of Norfolk Southern's corporate greed, incompetence, and lack of concern for our residents is absolutely unacceptable,” said Shapiro, speaking at the news conference with Regan, DeWine and other officials.

            Shapiro said his administration had made a criminal referral of Norfolk Southern to the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office. DeWine said Ohio’s attorney general had launched an investigation.

            EPA said it has tested indoor air quality at 550 homes so far, with outside air being monitored via aircraft, mobile vans and stationary instruments. 

            Still, Regan said he is not sure if EPA is testing for dioxin, a carcinogen, as some lawmakers and advocates requested.

            Under the so-called Superfund law, EPA has authority to direct those responsible for contamination or hazardous waste to clean it up. EPA can fine the railway up to $70,000 a day if the work is not completed. EPA can also do the work itself if necessary and bill Norfolk Southern triple its costs.

            Separately, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced a package of reforms Tuesday and called on railroad operators to take immediate steps to improve safety, such as accelerating the planned upgrade of tank cars.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817524,Brittney Griner re-signs with Phoenix Mercury,"Brittney Griner will be back in the WNBA this season, once again playing with the Phoenix Mercury.

            Griner, who was a free agent, re-signed with the team Tuesday.

            The 32-year-old Griner had said she would return to Phoenix in a social media post in December, after she returned home from her 10-month detainment in Russia. Griner had been arrested at an airport just outside of Moscow on drug possession charges a year ago and was brought home in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange in December.











            “We missed BG every day that she was gone and, while basketball was not our primary concern, her presence on the floor, in our locker room, around our organization, and within our community was greatly missed,"" Mercury GM Jim Pitman said. ""We will continue to use the resources of our organization to support her, on and off the floor, and we are thrilled for her that she gets to return to basketball, which she loves so dearly. This is a special signing and today is a special day for all of us.”

            The 6-foot-9 center last played for the Mercury in 2021 and helped the team reach the WNBA Finals. She averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 rebounds that season.

            Griner, who was drafted No. 1 in 2013 by the Mercury, was listed Saturday on Phoenix's roster on the WNBA website.

            Since returning home from Russia, Griner has been out of the public spotlight, with the exception of appearances at the Super Bowl, the Phoenix Open and an MLK Day event in Phoenix, where she lives.

            “I do not think any of us will forget where we were on Dec. 8 when we heard BG was coming home or on Dec. 15 when she announced she intended not only to play basketball in 2023 but that it would be for the Mercury,” Mercury President of Business Operations Vince Kozar said. ""And I know none of us will ever forget what it will feel like to welcome her back onto her home floor on May 21. To know BG is to love and appreciate BG, and we can’t wait to show her that in person with thousands and thousands of her biggest supporters exactly three months from today at our Welcome Home Opener.”

            She skipped a USA Basketball training camp earlier this month, but the organization made it clear she could take all the time she needed to decide if she wanted to play for the U.S. again.

            The WNBA has said it will address getting Griner special travel accommodations, such as charter flights, after she signed. 

            “We are very cognizant of BG’s unique situation,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told the AP earlier this month. “We’ve been planning and we’ve been thinking it through with security experts, BG’s side, our side. We’ll find the right time to comment on it when she signs with a team.”

            AP women’s basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBrittney Griner will be back in the WNBA this season, once again playing with the Phoenix Mercury.Griner, who was a free agent, re-signed with the team Tuesday.The 32-year-old Griner had said she would return to Phoenix in a social media post in December, after she returned home from her 10-month detainment in Russia. Griner had been arrested at an airport just outside of Moscow on drug possession charges a year ago and was brought home in a dramatic high-level prisoner exchange in December.“We missed BG every day that she was gone and, while basketball was not our primary concern, her presence on the floor, in our locker room, around our organization, and within our community was greatly missed,"" Mercury GM Jim Pitman said. ""We will continue to use the resources of our organization to support her, on and off the floor, and we are thrilled for her that she gets to return to basketball, which she loves so dearly. This is a special signing and today is a special day for all of us.”The 6-foot-9 center last played for the Mercury in 2021 and helped the team reach the WNBA Finals. She averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 rebounds that season.Griner, who was drafted No. 1 in 2013 by the Mercury, was listed Saturday on Phoenix's roster on the WNBA website.Since returning home from Russia, Griner has been out of the public spotlight, with the exception of appearances at the Super Bowl, the Phoenix Open and an MLK Day event in Phoenix, where she lives.“I do not think any of us will forget where we were on Dec. 8 when we heard BG was coming home or on Dec. 15 when she announced she intended not only to play basketball in 2023 but that it would be for the Mercury,” Mercury President of Business Operations Vince Kozar said. ""And I know none of us will ever forget what it will feel like to welcome her back onto her home floor on May 21. To know BG is to love and appreciate BG, and we can’t wait to show her that in person with thousands and thousands of her biggest supporters exactly three months from today at our Welcome Home Opener.”She skipped a USA Basketball training camp earlier this month, but the organization made it clear she could take all the time she needed to decide if she wanted to play for the U.S. again.The WNBA has said it will address getting Griner special travel accommodations, such as charter flights, after she signed.“We are very cognizant of BG’s unique situation,” WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told the AP earlier this month. “We’ve been planning and we’ve been thinking it through with security experts, BG’s side, our side.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817526,Russia and West clash over probe of Nord Stream sabotage,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia clashed with the United States and other Western nations Tuesday over the Kremlin’s call for a U.N. investigation of last September’s sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines from Russia to Western Europe.

            Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council that Moscow has “no trust” in the separate investigations being carried out by Denmark, Sweden and Germany, but it does “fully trust” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish an independent international investigation of the explosions.

            The United States, United Kingdom, France and others said authorities from the three countries are still investigating the pipeline attacks and the real reason Russia raised Nord Stream 1 and 2 now was to divert attention from the first anniversary of its invasion of Ukraine and high-level U.N. activities for the next three days including adoption of a General Assembly resolution condemning Moscow's action.











            “Today’s meeting is a blatant attempt to distract from this,” U.S. Minister-Counselor John Kelley told the council. “As the world unites this week to call for a just and secure peace in Ukraine consistent with the U.N. Charter, Russia desperately wants to change the subject.”

            Ahead of the meeting, the ambassadors of Denmark, Sweden and Germany sent a letter to council members saying their investigations have established the pipelines were extensively damaged “by powerful explosions due to sabotage.”

            The letter, circulated Tuesday morning, said further investigations are being conducted in all three countries and that it’s unclear when they will finish. It says Russian authorities have been informed about the investigations.

            But Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Dmitry Polyansky told reporters: “They are claiming that they are informing Russia about it which is not true ... Any attempt for us to get any information was rejected by them or ignored.”

            Russia circulated a draft resolution to council members late last week asking the U.N. secretary-general to urgently establish a commission to investigate the Nord Stream attacks. Security Council experts held closed consultations Monday on the proposed resolution and council diplomats said there was opposition to it.

            Russia’s Nebenzia said Moscow hasn’t been allowed to join investigations by any of the three countries, saying they “are not only not transparent, but it is quite clear that they seek just to cover the tracks and stick up for their ... American brother.”

            Russia has alleged that the U.S. was behind the sabotage, which its proposed resolution says “occurred after the repeated threats to the Nord Stream by the leadership of the United States.”

            Kelley, the U.S. diplomat, responded, telling the council “clearly and plainly: Accusations that the United States was involved in this act of sabotage are completely false. The United States was not involved in any way.”

            Nord Stream 1 carried Russian gas to Germany until Moscow cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. Nord Stream 2 never entered service as Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The explosions on both occurred on Sept. 26.

            U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo briefed the Security Council, saying the U.N. is not in a position to verify any claims relating to the explosions and urging “all concerned to show restraint and avoid any speculation.”

            “While exactly what happened beneath the waters of the Baltic Sea in September 2022 is still unclear, whatever caused the incident, its fallout counts among the many risks the invasion of Ukraine has unleashed,” she said.

            Economist Jeffrey Sachs told the council the consequences of the sabotage were “enormous” not only from the economic losses but in the heightened threat to all cross-border infrastructure, including undersea internet cables and offshore wind farms. 

            “It is the responsibility of the U.N. Security Council to take up the question of who might have carried out the act in order to bring the perpetrator to international justice, to pursue compensation for the damaged parties and to prevent future such actions,” he said.

            Sachs, a Columbia University professor, is also director of the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network and a commissioner of the U.N. Broadband Commission for Development. He was invited to speak by Russia and said he appeared before the council on his own behalf.

            Sachs said the destruction of the pipelines “required a very high degree of planning, expertise and technological capacity,” and to do so in the exclusive economic zones of Denmark and Sweden “adds greatly to the complexity of the operation.”

            “Only a handful of state level actors have both the technical capacity and access to the Baltic Sea to have carried out this action including the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, Poland, Norway, Germany, Denmark and Sweden, either individually or in some combination,” Sachs said. “Ukraine lacks the necessary technologies as well as access to the Baltic Sea.”

            In their letter to the council, Denmark, Sweden and Germany reiterated that acts of sabotage against the pipelines were “unacceptable, endanger international security and give cause for our deep concern.”

            They added that concerns about the indirect effects on greenhouse gas emissions are ”substantial and worrisome.” 

            The Russian draft resolution, expresses serious concern at the “devastating consequences to the environment” from the acts of sabotage which also “pose a threat to international peace and security.”UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Russia clashed with the United States and other Western nations Tuesday over the Kremlin’s call for a U.N. investigation of last September’s sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines from Russia to Western Europe.Russia’s U.N.

            The left-hander, who turns 35 on Feb. 28, is guaranteed $3.75 million under the deal announced Jan. 27.

            Chapman can earn $2.5 million in performance bonuses based on games: $312,500 for 20 and for each additional five through 55. He also can earn $2.5 million based on games finished: $312,500 for 12 and for each additional four through 40.











            He averaged 100.7 mph on his fastball in 2016 but dropped below 100 mph in 2018 and was at a career-low 97.5 last season. He was 4-4 with a 4.46 ERA last season for the Yankees, walking 28 and striking out 43 in 36 1/3 innings. 

            Chapman had spent time on the injured list with Achilles tendinitis in May, then lost the closer job to Clay Holmes. He was on the IL again in August for a leg infection following a tattoo, then missed a mandatory team workout for the playoffs and was left off the Division Series roster.

            He would earn $100,000 for winning an MVP award or a Cy Young Award and $50,000 for finishing second through fifth in the voting. He would get $100,000 for World Series MVP or winning the Mariano Rivera/Trevor Hoffman reliever of the year award, and $50,000 for becoming a Rivera/Hoffman finalist. Chapman would get $50,000 for making the All-Star team, winning a Gold Glove or the League Championship Series MVP. He gets a hotel suite on road trips.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817534,Abortion rights groups submit 2023 ballot measure in Ohio,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Two groups advocating for abortion rights submitted fall ballot language Tuesday for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing Ohioans' access to abortion, an effort that opponents have vowed to fight.

            The measure delivered to Republican Attorney General Dave Yost's office calls for establishing “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" with ""reasonable limits.” In language similar to a constitutional amendment Michigan voters approved in November, it would require restrictions imposed past a fetus' viability outside the womb to be based on evidence of patient health and safety benefits.

            “Our common sense amendment will restore the rights and protections that were destroyed when Roe was overturned,"" said Dr. Lauren Beene, executive director of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights. “It will preserve the doctor-patient relationship and empower all people to make their own reproductive health care decisions without interference from the government, lobbyists and politicians.”











            Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights is joining Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom in advancing the measure, in a campaign they estimate could cost up to $36 million.

            Their effort follows the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last June to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling that protected abortion rights, which shifted the contentious battle over abortion to the states. 

            In the first state test following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, Kansas resoundingly protected abortion rights in August, and four other states in addition to Michigan — California, Kentucky, Montana and Vermont — either enshrined those rights or rejected constitutional restrictions on the procedure in November. Five more states are set to vote either to restrict or guarantee the right to abortion between now and next year, according to the election tracking organization Ballotpedia. 

            Another member of the Ohio physicians' group, Dr. Marcela Azevedo, said that the same enthusiastic support for abortion rights that has been seen in other states was also expressed in Ohio. She said so many people lined up to sign their petitions this weekend that 7,000 signatures were collected in 48 hours, which is a record amount.

            The urgency is driven by the fact that state lawmakers in the Republican-dominated Ohio General Assembly are moving to make it more difficult to amend the Ohio Constitution, by placing an issue of their own on the November ballot raising the threshold of votes necessary to approve changes from 50% to 60%.

            Nationally, 63% of midterm voters said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of over 90,000 voters across the country. Only 8% of voters said that abortion should be illegal in all cases. In Ohio, those figures were similar, with 59% of voters saying abortion should generally be legal and just 7% saying abortion should be illegal all of the time.

            Ohio Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou called the amendment “wildly out-of-step with Ohio values,” and the national group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America slammed its broad wording as a threat to Ohio's parental consent and to “the guardrails preventing vulnerable women from being coerced into unwanted abortions.”

            Groups behind the measure said they represent a broad coalition of patients, doctors, reproductive rights experts, health and justice leaders and grassroots activists who span the political spectrum. They plan a well-funded, nonpartisan campaign with experienced legal counsel, public opinion researchers, strategic and communications consultants and an army of volunteers at the ready.

            Still, the state's powerful anti-abortion lobby was undaunted. 

            The state's oldest and largest anti-abortion organization, Ohio Right to Life, has pledged to launch what it called “the largest grassroots initiative to protect women and children in Ohio’s history.” And Cincinnati Right to Life sent a fundraising and volunteer recruitment email last week saying the state's anti-abortion organizations have been “meeting and planning for months” in anticipation of the amendment's submission. 

            The role of Yost's office is to determine whether the summary is a fair and truthful representation of the proposal. He also happens to have squared off against some backers of the constitutional amendment in court.

            After the ruling overturning Roe said the U.S. Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, Ohio's near-ban on abortions — from the first detection of cardiac activity, around six weeks into pregnancy, before most women know they are pregnant — and others like it were quickly reinstated. 

            A group of Ohio clinics represented by the ACLU of Ohio withdrew their federal constitutional challenge and filed one instead under Ohio's constitution. It argues that abortion falls under provisions of that document that protect privacy and freedom in health care decision-making, among others.

            After a judge again blocked Ohio's near-abortion ban while that lawsuit proceeds, Yost appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court to lift that stay. The high court, newly constituted with a more conservative Republican majority than it had before, has yet to rule on his request.COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Two groups advocating for abortion rights submitted fall ballot language Tuesday for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing Ohioans' access to abortion, an effort that opponents have vowed to fight.The measure delivered to Republican Attorney General Dave Yost's office calls for establishing “a fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" with ""reasonable limits.” In language similar to a constitutional amendment Michigan voters approved in November, it would require restrictions imposed past a fetus' viability outside the womb to be based on evidence of patient health and safety benefits.“Our common sense amendment will restore the rights and protections that were destroyed when Roe was overturned,"" said Dr. Lauren Beene, executive director of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights. “It will preserve the doctor-patient relationship and empower all people to make their own reproductive health care decisions without interference from the government, lobbyists and politicians.”Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights is joining Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom in advancing the measure, in a campaign they estimate could cost up to $36 million.Their effort follows the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last June to overturn the landmark Roe v.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817535,"3 UN peacekeepers killed, 5 wounded by roadside bomb in Mali","BAMAKO, Mali (AP) — Three United Nations peacekeepers were killed and five others wounded by a roadside bomb in central Mali on Tuesday, according to the U.N. 

            The bomb struck a supply convoy near the village of Songobia, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali known as MINUSMA said in a statement. 

            The U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned the attack in separate statements that also said attacks against U.N. peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law.











            Council members called on Mali’s transitional government to swiftly investigate the attack with the support of MINUSMA and bring the perpetrators to justice. 

            The council expressed concern about the security situation in Mali and the transnational dimension of the terrorist threat in the Sahel region. It underlined that peace in the region won’t be achieved without a combination of political, security, peacebuilding and development efforts that benefit all regions of Mali as well as implementation of the 2015 peace agreement.

            Earlier, El-Ghassim Wane, the head of MINUSMA, said: “I strongly condemn this attack and present my heartfelt condolences to the families and brothers in arms of the late blue helmets.” 

            The incident illustrates the complex environment in which the peacekeepers are working, he said. 

            Jihadi violence linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has wracked Mali for a decade and left thousands of people dead. The war-torn West African country is one of the world’s most dangerous places with a peacekeeping mission. 

            For the ninth consecutive year, Mali had the most peacekeepers killed while deployed there, the U.N. reported in January. Including the peacekeepers from Tuesday, 168 have been killed in the country since 2013, according to the U.N. 

            Since Mali’s military seized power in two coups starting in 2020, a junta led by Col. Assimi Goita has had tense relations with the international community and constrained the mission's ability to operate. 

            Countries such as Benin, Germany, Sweden, Ivory Coast and the United Kingdom have announced troop withdrawals, according to the International Crisis Group.

            An internal review of the mission in January said restrictions imposed by the junta have exposed personnel to security risks. The loss of participating countries will put the mission under additional pressure, as it will lose more than 2,250 troops, the report said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817536,Bulls rule Ball out for season because of knee trouble,"CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bulls ruled point guard Lonzo Ball out for the season on Tuesday because of lingering discomfort in his surgically repaired left knee.

            The team said the focus now will be on resolving the discomfort he feels performing “high level basketball-related activities” and making “a full return” for next season.

            Ball hasn’t played since Jan. 14, 2022. He had surgery for a torn meniscus a few weeks later and experienced setbacks when he tried to ramp up basketball activities.











            The Bulls had him rest for 10 days at one point, hoping it would resolve the issue and allow him to return. But he felt pain again when he started preparing to play. 

            Ball was still unable to run at full speed or even walk up stairs without experiencing discomfort when he had another operation in late September. He said at the time he expected to play this season.

            Ball has been able to do some on-court work. He posted a video on Instagram last month of him dunking. But it became more and more clear that probably wouldn’t happen.

            Ball averaged 13 points and 5.1 assists while shooting 42.3% on 3-pointers over 35 games last season — his first in Chicago. He helped set up stars Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and gave the Bulls an elite perimeter defender.

            Chicago is 11th in the Eastern Conference at 26-33. Losers of six straight, the Bulls host Brooklyn on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817538,Police: Capture of 2 teens led to arrest after officer slain,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Authorities say the quick apprehension of two youths after a Temple University police officer was shot and killed near the north Philadelphia campus led to an arrest just hours later in a neighboring county.

            Officer Christopher Fitzgerald, 31, spotted three people dressed in black and wearing masks Saturday night in an area where there had been a series of robberies and carjackings, police said. He chased the trio, and after two of them hid he continued to pursue the third and was fatally shot. 

            A patrol supervisor monitoring the police radio rushed to the scene and captured two fleeing youths, ages 16 and 17, who later gave information that led to the arrest of 18-year-old Miles Pfeffer the following morning in Bucks County, Staff Inspector Ernest Ransom, the homicide unit commander, told reporters Tuesday.











            Fitzgerald was the first Temple University officer killed in the line of duty, said Jennifer Griffin, the university’s public safety director. A father of five children, he joined the school’s police force in October 2021.

            Police said video from the area shows Fitzgerald catching up with Pfeffer and ordering him to the ground, after which they struggle behind a sport utility vehicle. Pfeffer allegedly pulled a handgun, and police say he shot six times, firing the last three bullets into the officer as he lay on the ground.

            “He (Pfeffer) comes back to the officer and then attempts to remove the officer's handgun, which was unsuccessful,"" Ransom said. Running to the next block, Pfeffer allegedly carjacked someone and “is heard on camera saying ‘Give me the car or I will kill you,’” Ransom said.

            He was arrested Sunday morning at a sprawling 18th century farm property in upscale Buckingham, Bucks County, apparently co-owned by his mother. Several weapons were recovered there, but not the murder weapon, police said. 

            Pfeffer, who turned 18 last month, attended New Hope Academy, which describes itself as a private school for adolescents with social, emotional or other problems or those who fail to thrive in traditional settings, a school official said.

            He also spent part of his day at Middle Bucks Institute of Technology, a vocational high school, a spokeswoman said. He had started in that program in September 2020 and last attended on Thursday, she said.

            A retired school bus driver told a local newspaper that Pfeffer rode his bus for two years, spoke of wanting to work on an oil rig and never gave him any trouble.

            “There was never any indication he was a problem,” former driver Thomas Beahm told The Bucks County Courier Times. “It’s so hard to understand.”

            Efforts to reach Pfeffer's family members on Tuesday proved unsuccessful as phone numbers linked to them were either not working or no longer accepting messages. 

            He is charged with murder, criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer, disarming an officer, robbery, theft, evading arrest and weapons crimes. In the subsequent carjacking, he faces robbery, theft, terroristic threatening and other charges.

            Prosecutors said no charges were filed against anyone else and declined to comment on whether such charges might be filed. If investigators find any information on the earlier robberies and carjackings, it would be provided to prosecutors, Ransom said.

            The Defender Association of Philadelphia said Pfeffer's case was assigned to the office Tuesday; a representative declined to comment on the charges. 

            Mayor Jim Kenney and District Attorney Larry Krasner spoke emotionally about the officer's death and renewed their calls for changes to gun laws. Kenney called Pennsylvania “a gun-crazy state” where arguments can turn into fatal shootings.

            University president Jason Wingard said the school cannot fulfill its mission of providing a world-class education if it can't keep students safe.

            “We need help. The systemic violence that plagues this city, that plagues north Philadelphia, can't be solved by Temple alone,” Wingard said.

            Fitzgerald’s father — a former Philadelphia police commander and now chief of another department — spoke about how proud his son was to be an officer, the school’s public safety director said.

            “He was working to change the trajectory of increased violence in Philadelphia, and now it is up to us to continue his work,” Griffin said, her voice breaking.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817539,Lahore crushes Quetta by 63 runs in Pakistan Super League,"KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — Lahore Qalandars handed a crushing 63-run defeat to Quetta Gladiators as the defending champions notched their second win in the Pakistan Super League on Tuesday.

            Lahore batters made amends for their 67-run loss against Karachi Kings in the last game by posting a challenging total of 198-6 after Quetta skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed won the toss and elected to field.

            Quetta continued to look for the right batting combination before finishing at a disappointing 135-8 as the 2019 champions lost their third game this season with the solitary victory so far coming against Karachi.











            Sarfaraz rued the absence of his key spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, who couldn’t get a No Objection Certificate from Sri Lanka Cricket to participate in Pakistan’s premier domestic Twenty20 tournament.

            Young opener Mirza Tahir Baig (30 off 15 balls) dominated a whirlwind opening stand of 49 with Fakhar Zaman, who made 22.

            Shai Hope top scored with 47 while Sikandar Raza (32) and Hussain Talat (26) provided a late flurry in the death overs as Quetta struggled to stem the flow of runs. Strike fast bowler Naseem Shah was wayward and conceded 47 off his four overs without a wicket and West Indian seamer Odean Smith was also expensive with figures of 2-41.

            Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-22), playing after a three-month absence because of knee injury, was at his best with his impeccable lengths as he had young opener Abdul Bangalzai trapped leg before wicket with a brutal yorker in the first over.

            David Wiese (3-23) bowled well in the middle overs and picked up the key wickets of Martin Guptill (15), Mohammad Hafeez (25) and Iftikhar Ahmed (6) as Quetta struggled to put up partnerships.

            Jason Roy (48) briefly challenged by smashing three sixes in Haris Rauf’s one over before he was undone by Lahore’s ace leg-spinner Rashid Khan (1-17), playing his first game of the season before Afridi returned and picked two wickets in the death overs.

            Multan Sultans, which are at the top of the table in the six-team event with six points from four games, will take on Karachi in Wednesday’s game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817540,North Macedonia seeks to stop spate of crippling bomb hoaxes,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — North Macedonia’s government on Tuesday vowed to improve its online security in response to a spate of emailed bomb hoaxes that have caused widespread disruption since mid-October. Officials have described the threats as an act of terrorism, suggesting a possible link to the NATO member’s pro-Ukrainian stance.

            Police on Tuesday evacuated more than 30 locations in the capital Skopje and the southern town of Prilep, including the presidential residence, shopping malls, schools, hotels, museums and sports venues, after receiving what ultimately turned out to be fake bomb threats — the latest in a series of similar incidents.

            For more than four months and almost on a daily basis, bomb threats emailed to authorities have triggered searches by the police's anti-terrorism squad at schools, public institutions and shopping malls.











            Police spokesperson Toni Angelovski told The Associated Press that anti-terrorism teams have searched a total of 469 locations, mainly schools, in response to threats received between mid-October and February 15. No explosives were found.

            On Tuesday, emailed bomb threats were sent for the first time to President Stevo Pendarovski’s residence, as well as to shopping malls, museums, sports venues, residential complexes and schools in Skopje and Prilep. Other targets included two prominent hotels, the country’s soccer federation, the main railway station in Skopje and the administrative court, police said.

            Local media reported that the most recent bomb threats were sent from a hoaxer who identified himself as “Graham Klein.” Previous threats have purportedly been made by other fictitious individuals, the reports said.

            The latest bomb threats were accompanied by texts accusing Macedonians of being “complicit in the destruction of my country,” without naming the country, and included a demand to lift unspecified sanctions.

            Interior Minister Oliver Spasovski last week described the threats as “hybrid terrorist attacks” originating from abroad, and said they were aimed to causing widespread disruption and intimidating members of the public.

            “This is an act of terrorism. Whatever the reason, it brings such disruption and insecurity among the people, it should be severely punished,” Spasovski said.

            He said police had strong indications where the threats had originated from, adding that his ministry was “working with maximum dedication, with the help of our partners (in NATO).” He did not elaborate. 

            North Macedonia’s center-left government said in a statement Tuesday that the the cabinet had adopted a set of measures aimed “to improve the security of information systems in institutions, which will be implemented in the shortest possible time.” 

            Prime Minister Dimitar Kovachevski had earlier suggested the threats were tied to the country’s stance on the war in Ukraine, after it participated in sanctions against Russia.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817542,"Discarded cigarette butt, DNA tests solve 52-year-old murder","BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — A discarded cigarette found near the body of a 24-year-old Vermont school teacher in her apartment nearly 52 years ago helped lead investigators to an upstairs neighbor who they say strangled her after having a fight with his wife, police said Tuesday. 

            Burlington Police DNA evidence collected from the cigarette butt and dogged investigative work led authorities to the man they say killed Rita Curran within a 70-minute window on a July night in 1971. 

            The suspect, identified as William DeRoos, who was 31 at the time, had left his apartment that night for “a cool down walk.” After he returned he told his wife of two weeks not to say that he had been out. 











            Since the investigation was renewed in 2019, detectives re-interviewed DeRoos' former wife, and she told them he had left their apartment for a brief period within a window of time when Curran's roommates were out of her Burlington apartment. 

            “We’re all confident that William DeRoos is responsible for the aggravated murder of Rita Curran, but because he died in a hotel room of a drug overdose he will not be held accountable for his actions, but this case will be closed,” Burlington Police Detective Lt. James Trieb, the commander of the Detective Services Bureau, said during a Tuesday morning news conference. 

            After Curran's death DeRoos, who was known to some as a guru, moved to Thailand and became a monk, but he later returned to the United States. In 1986 DeRoos died of a drug overdose in San Francisco, police said.

            Curran's parents died without learning who had killed their daughter, but the victim's brother and sister attended the event held at Burlington police headquarters.

            “I don't think so much about the guy who did this as I do about Rita, my parents and what they went through,"" Curran's brother Tom said during the event. “I pray to Rita and I pray to my parents.""

            In the early morning hours of July 20, 1971 Burlington police were called to the Brooks Avenue apartment after Curran's roommate arrived home to find her body in their shared bedroom.

            Police say Curran resisted fiercely, but she was strangled. The murder shook Burlington.

            The case remained open and investigators never let it go, but in 2019, Trieb and a team of detectives, officers, technicians and others began working the case as though it had just happened.

            A key piece of evidence was a cigarette butt that had been found near Curran's body. In 2014, previous investigators had sent the butt and other evidence off for DNA analysis. The test did compile a DNA profile of whoever had smoked the cigarette, but it did not match any samples in DNA databases compiled by law enforcement. 

            The detectives who picked up the case in 2019 contracted with a DNA testing company and the samples were compared with genetic material submitted to commercial DNA testing companies by members of the public. Last August, Burlington detectives were told the sample, which had been traced through relatives on both sides of DeRoos's family, was pointing at DeRoos, even though he had no DNA profile on record.

            Detectives then determined DeRoos and his wife Michelle had been living upstairs at the time of Curran's death. They had spoken with investigators after Curran's death, but at the time they said they had not seen or heard anything.

            DeRoos and his wife, who no longer uses the name DeRoos, left Vermont shortly after Curran's death. Their marriage ended after DeRoos went to Thailand. DeRoos married again after moving back to the United States.

            In a recent interview, DeRoos's ex-wife, who lived with him in Burlington and now lives in Eugene, Oregon, told investigators she had lied about her husband leaving their apartment that night. Burlington detectives later interviewed a subsequent wife who told them DeRoos had a penchant for sudden outbursts of violence.

            Detective Thomas Chennette, who interviewed DeRoos's first ex-wife, said Tuesday he didn't believe she knew he had killed Curran, but was protecting him because he had a criminal record. 

            “I think she lied at the time because she was young. She was naive. She was newly married. She was in love,"" Chennette said. 

            Now-retired U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who was the Chittenden County State's Attorney when Curran was killed and went to the crime scene that night, attended the Tuesday event. Asked if he felt the case would ever be solved, he said that he had hoped it would.

            “I must admit after 20 and 30, 40 years I figured it never would. ... It was a terrible thing,"" he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817543,New START: last US-Russia arms control treaty in jeopardy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement Tuesday that Moscow is suspending its participation in the last remaining U.S.-Russia arms control treaty will have an immediate impact on U.S. visibility into Russian nuclear activities, but the pact was already on life support.

            Putin's decision to suspend Russian cooperation with the treaty's nuclear warhead and missile inspections follows Moscow's cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that both sides have accused the other of violating.

            In his state-of-the-nation address to the Russian people, Putin said Russia was withdrawing from the treaty because of U.S. support to Ukraine, and he accused the U.S. and its NATO allies of openly working for Russia’s destruction.











            The U.S. had previously walked away from the treaty. During the Trump administration, the U.S. declined to engage in negotiations to extend it, accusing Moscow of flagrant violations. But when President Joe Biden took office in 2021, his administration signed a five-year extension.

            Here is a look at New START and what Russia's announcement means for keeping U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons in check: 

            WHAT IS THE RUSSIA-US NUCLEAR TREATY? 

            New START, formally known as the The Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, was signed by the Obama administration in 2010 and took effect in February 2011 as a 10-year agreement. The treaty obligated both Russia and the U.S. to commit to regular communications on the status of their nuclear arsenals, allow regular on-site inspections and abide by caps on the number of deployed and non-deployed warheads each would maintain. 

            Those caps include: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and deployed nuclear bombers; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs and deployed bombers; 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and bombers. 

            Hours after Putin’s address, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would respect the caps on nuclear weapons, even though Putin suspended participation in the pact.

            Russia also will continue to exchange information about test launches of ballistic missiles per earlier agreements with the United States, the Foreign Ministry said.

            WHAT WILL THE SUSPENSION MEAN FOR NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS, INFORMATION SHARING?

            Since New START was signed, Russia and the U.S. have allowed each other's compliance teams to conduct 328 on-site inspections of their stockpiles, and importantly the two nations have provided data exchanges and 25,311 notifications on the status of their programs, the State Department said.

            Putin's announcement and the subsequent clarification from the Foreign Ministry seemed to indicate the inspections are on a permanent suspension — but they left unclear what data sharing and notifications might be continued. 

            The U.S. will get its first clues on March 1, the day both parties are supposed to exchange data on the aggregate numbers of their nuclear forces, said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists.

            The U.S and Russia also have been exchanging daily messages on movements and exercises, which has helped keep both nuclear powers clear on the other's actions, both Kristensen and William Alberque, director for strategy, technology and arms control for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said. 

            “There are notifications that come through every single day,” Alberque said. On the U.S. side, those formatted computer messages are processed by a military-civilian team at the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center inside the State Department. 

            If Russia decides not to provide the notifications, “we’re immediately going to start losing data, to be able to track exactly how many strategic weapons they have, and whether or not they’re in the place that they’re supposed to be, and whether or not they’re acting the way they’re supposed to,” Alberque said.

            WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE PUTIN'S ANNOUNCEMENT?

            Inspections of U.S. and Russian military sites under New START were paused by both sides in March 2020 because of the spread of coronavirus. The U.S.-Russia commission overseeing implementation of the treaty last met in October 2021, but Russia then unilaterally suspended its cooperation with the treaty’s inspection provisions in August 2022 to protest U.S. support for Ukraine.

            Those discussions were supposed to have resumed in Egypt in late November, but Russia abruptly canceled them without offering a specific reason, according to U.S. officials.

            In late January, the Biden administration reported to Congress that Russia was not complying with the terms of the agreement by refusing to allow inspections on its territory and refusing to agree to new talks on resuming those checks.

            At the time, the State Department said “Russia has a clear path for returning to full compliance” and that all it needed to do was to agree to new inspections.

            HOW WILL THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REACT?

            Now it will be up to the Biden administration to decide how to react — whether to continue to comply with the treaty. 

            On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Russian move “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible.”

            “We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does,” he said. “We’ll, of course, make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.”

            Last month, the State Department reported it could not certify that Russia was in compliance with New START because of its refusal to allow on-site inspectors last year. Now that the treaty has been rejected altogether by Russia, there’s a risk of an arms buildup.

            “Both the U.S. and Russia have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that neither country will exceed the force levels currently dictated by New START,” the Federation of American Scientists said in a February report that looked at the risks if the two sides failed to renew the treaty.

            “Without a deal after 2026, that assumption immediately disappears; both sides would likely default to mutual distrust amid fewer verifiable data points, and our discourse would be dominated by worst case thinking about how both countries’ arsenals would grow in the future.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin's announcement Tuesday that Moscow is suspending its participation in the last remaining U.S.-Russia arms control treaty will have an immediate impact on U.S. visibility into Russian nuclear activities, but the pact was already on life support.Putin's decision to suspend Russian cooperation with the treaty's nuclear warhead and missile inspections follows Moscow's cancellation late last year of talks that had been intended to salvage an agreement that both sides have accused the other of violating.In his state-of-the-nation address to the Russian people, Putin said Russia was withdrawing from the treaty because of U.S. support to Ukraine, and he accused the U.S. and its NATO allies of openly working for Russia’s destruction.The U.S. had previously walked away from the treaty.

The treaty obligated both Russia and the U.S. to commit to regular communications on the status of their nuclear arsenals, allow regular on-site inspections and abide by caps on the number of deployed and non-deployed warheads each would maintain.Those caps include: 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and deployed nuclear bombers; 1,550 nuclear warheads on deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs and deployed bombers; 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and bombers.Hours after Putin’s address, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would respect the caps on nuclear weapons, even though Putin suspended participation in the pact.Russia also will continue to exchange information about test launches of ballistic missiles per earlier agreements with the United States, the Foreign Ministry said.WHAT WILL THE SUSPENSION MEAN FOR NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS, INFORMATION SHARING?Since New START was signed, Russia and the U.S. have allowed each other's compliance teams to conduct 328 on-site inspections of their stockpiles, and importantly the two nations have provided data exchanges and 25,311 notifications on the status of their programs, the State Department said.Putin's announcement and the subsequent clarification from the Foreign Ministry seemed to indicate the inspections are on a permanent suspension — but they left unclear what data sharing and notifications might be continued.The U.S. will get its first clues on March 1, the day both parties are supposed to exchange data on the aggregate numbers of their nuclear forces, said Hans Kristensen, director of the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists.The U.S and Russia also have been exchanging daily messages on movements and exercises, which has helped keep both nuclear powers clear on the other's actions, both Kristensen and William Alberque, director for strategy, technology and arms control for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said.“There are notifications that come through every single day,” Alberque said. On the U.S. side, those formatted computer messages are processed by a military-civilian team at the National and Nuclear Risk Reduction Center inside the State Department.If Russia decides not to provide the notifications, “we’re immediately going to start losing data, to be able to track exactly how many strategic weapons they have, and whether or not they’re in the place that they’re supposed to be, and whether or not they’re acting the way they’re supposed to,” Alberque said.WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE PUTIN'S ANNOUNCEMENT?Inspections of U.S. and Russian military sites under New START were paused by both sides in March 2020 because of the spread of coronavirus. The U.S.-Russia commission overseeing implementation of the treaty last met in October 2021, but Russia then unilaterally suspended its cooperation with the treaty’s inspection provisions in August 2022 to protest U.S. support for Ukraine.Those discussions were supposed to have resumed in Egypt in late November, but Russia abruptly canceled them without offering a specific reason, according to U.S. officials.In late January, the Biden administration reported to Congress that Russia was not complying with the terms of the agreement by refusing to allow inspections on its territory and refusing to agree to new talks on resuming those checks.At the time, the State Department said “Russia has a clear path for returning to full compliance” and that all it needed to do was to agree to new inspections.HOW WILL THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION REACT?Now it will be up to the Biden administration to decide how to react — whether to continue to comply with the treaty.On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Russian move “deeply unfortunate and irresponsible.”“We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does,” he said. “We’ll, of course, make sure that in any event we are postured appropriately for the security of our own country and that of our allies.”Last month, the State Department reported it could not certify that Russia was in compliance with New START because of its refusal to allow on-site inspectors last year. Now that the treaty has been rejected altogether by Russia, there’s a risk of an arms buildup.“Both the U.S. and Russia have meticulously planned their respective nuclear modernization programs based on the assumption that neither country will exceed the force levels currently dictated by New START,” the Federation of American Scientists said in a February report that looked at the risks if the two sides failed to renew the treaty.“Without a deal after 2026, that assumption immediately disappears; both sides would likely default to mutual distrust amid fewer verifiable data points, and our discourse would be dominated by worst case thinking about how both countries’ arsenals would grow in the future.”",2023/2/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817544,Graphic videos show inmate's pain as officers strap him down,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Graphic videos filed in a Tennessee court on Tuesday show a death row inmate who has just returned from the hospital repeatedly telling officers that he is in pain as they strap him so tightly to a bed that his arms turn purple.

            
                Henry Hodges is suing the Tennessee Department of Correction over his treatment by prison staff after what his attorney has said was a psychotic episode last October. Hodges slit his wrists and then cut off his penis after he was put on suicide watch Oct. 7. He was hospitalized for about two weeks, and his penis was reattached. However, weeks later, Hodges’ penis had to be surgically removed after necrosis set in, according to court records. 

            When Hodges returned to the prison infirmary after his initial hospital stay, he was placed naked on a thin vinyl mattress and strapped down to a concrete slab underneath. The room where he was housed had no TV, radio or other mental stimulation, and the lights were always on, according to court records. Lawyers for the state have argued that he was provided with appropriate around-the-clock care.











            Three videos were filed as evidence in Hodges' case by his attorneys on Tuesday after media including the Nashville Banner and The Associated Press intervened to protect public access to records in the case. 

            The videos made public on Tuesday were taken upon Hodges' return from the hospital. 

            The first shows him being wheeled into the prison infirmary. Officers spend nearly all of the 17-minute video strapping him by wrists and ankles to large metal bolts in the slab, using restraints similar to car seat belts. They also place large soft mitts over his hands.

            Hodges initially appears somewhat disoriented and is mostly silent, but gradually grows agitated. At one point he asks to speak to his lawyer, but is ignored. He screams several times, seemingly in frustration. 

            The second video that lasts about 8 minutes picks up with the officers still applying the restraints. A nurse checks the straps and asks for one to be tightened. Hodges tells her, “I refuse all medical treatment. All food. All water. All medical treatment.” He becomes more agitated as she touches him. He screams several more times. The officers take away his socks and hospital gown, leaving him with only a black square of cloth that covers him from about his abdomen to his calves. 

            A new person then enters the room saying she is from the prison's mental health program. “You’re not here to help me,” Hodges says, then telling her to leave repeatedly.

            When she tries to continue talking with him, asking him why he is refusing food and “What's troubling you?” Hodges becomes belligerent, cursing at her and insulting her with crude language before she leaves and officers shut the cell door.

            In the longest video, Hodges is still strapped to the bed and has defecated on himself, including on his bandages. Over the course of 45 minutes, several officers laboriously move his limbs between restraints as infirmary workers clean up some of the mess with what appear to be baby wipes. One gives him a shot without his permission, causing Hodges severe agitation.

            Hodges asks what was in the injection and repeats that he wants no medical treatment. He is told that it will calm him down. 

            Previously strapped down by his wrists and ankles, the officers now strap down his biceps as well. One officer can be heard instructing another to pull the restraints “as tight as you can.”

            Attorneys for the state have said that Hodges was put in 6-point restraints because he removed his catheter.

            Hodges repeatedly tells the officers, “I'm in pain” and “You're hurting me.” He indicates that he is in pain at least 50 times in the 45-minute video. The officers make some effort to reposition Hodges' limbs in response to his complaints, but his arms below the bicep straps are visibly purple, and Hodges says they are numb. 

            Hodges warns them that he has blood circulation problems and asks repeatedly to have his blood pressure checked. That does not happen during the video. At one point, he asks why he has to be restrained. “I was in the hospital for two weeks and cooperating with everything they want me to do,” he tells them. 

            The video ends with Hodges left in the 6-point restraints, feces still visible on his body as officers close the door to the cell and lock it. Hodges' penis was surgically removed weeks following that recorded infirmary visit. 

            Hodges was sentenced to death for the 1990 killing of a telephone repairman. 

            His lawsuit filed in Chancery Court in Nashville was put on hold in December in order to allow Hodges time to exhaust the administrative grievance procedure at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. However, Davidson County Chancellor I’Ashea Myles agreed to hear arguments from The Associated Press and the Nashville Banner that photos, videos and other documents in the case should be open to the public.

            Myles originally ordered the state to redact the videos and turn them over to the defense by Jan. 27, but the state repeatedly asked for extensions.NASHVILLE, Tenn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817545,Mississippi governor vows to sign limit on transgender care,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves confirmed Tuesday that he plans to sign a bill to ban gender-affirming care in the state for anyone younger than 18 — part of a broad effort in conservative states to restrict transgender athletes, gender-affirming care and drag shows.

            House Bill 1125 won final approval Tuesday in the Republican-controlled Mississippi Senate, and it will be sent in the coming days to Reeves, a Republican who is running for reelection.

            “Sterilizing and castrating children in the name of new gender ideology is wrong,” Reeves wrote on Twitter. “That plain truth is somehow controversial in today's world.""











            Reeves signed a law in 2021 to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls’ or women’s sports.

            The Republican governor of Utah recently signed a ban on gender-affirming care into law, and judges have temporarily blocked similar laws in Arkansas and Alabama. In Arkansas on Tuesday, the state Senate approved legislation that tries to effectively reinstate that state’s ban on gender affirming care for minors by making it easier to sue providers of such medical care. 

            The vote in the Mississippi Senate came less than a week after transgender teenagers, their families and others who support them protested against the bill.

            Jensen Luke Matar, executive director of the Mississippi-based Transgender Resources Advocacy Network and Services Program, denounced the bill in a statement.

            “Mississippi lawmakers are insisting that they know what’s best for transgender youth and ignoring the recommendations of every major medical association,"" Matar said. ""Patients, along with their health care providers — not politicians –- should decide what medical care is in the best interest of a patient. I know from years of working directly with trans youth in Mississippi that they need support, love, and affirmation – not this brazen political attack that cuts off their access to life-saving care.”

            Republican Sen. Joey Fillingane of Sumrall said during the Senate debate that he has received questions “about how we’re telling people what they can and can’t do with their bodies.”

            “I just want everyone to be very crystal clear: Once you’re 18 if this bill becomes law ... this bill would recognize you can have any procedure on your body you want to,"" Fillingane said. ""So what we’re really talking about here are these procedures for persons 17 years of age and under.”

            The Senate rejected an amendment by Democratic Sen. Rod Hickman of Macon, which specified that mental health care would remain available for transgender people younger than 18. Fillingane said the bill would not prohibit such care.

            Hickman said transgender people have “elevated” rates of suicide.

            “This is not because they have gone through particular surgeries or procedures,” Hickman said. “This is because they live in a society that has continually rejected them.”

            Hickman said the bill “furthers the narrative that these individuals are not human beings deserving of the same rights that we all have.”

            House Bill 1125 passed the Senate 33-15. It passed Republican-led Mississippi House 78-30 on Jan. 19.

            Heritage Action, a national group affiliated with the Heritage Foundation in Washington, praised passage of the bill.

            “Dangerous cross-sex hormones and experimental surgeries are not a compassionate solution for children struggling with gender dysphoria,"" Heritage Action's executive director, Jessica Anderson, said in a statement. “These dangerous procedures both fail to address underlying mental health issues and also leave children suffering with irreversible psychological and physical damage for the rest of their lives.”

            The ACLU of Mississippi urged Reeves to veto the measure.

            ""This care was already too difficult to access across the state for transgender people of any age, but this law shuts the door on best-practice medical care and puts politics between parents, their children, and their doctors,” McKenna Raney-Gray, the group's LGBTQ Justice Project staff attorney, said in a statement.

            In Arkansas, the bill approved Tuesday by the majority-Republican Senate on in a party-line vote would allow someone who received gender affirming care as a minor to file malpractice claims for up to 15 years after they turn 18. Under current Arkansas law, medical malpractice claims must be filed within two years of what the law refers to as an “injury.”

            Legal experts said the proposal would be a major shift in malpractice law and could make it nearly impossible for doctors who provide gender affirming care to minors to get malpractice insurance. The bill now heads to the majority-Republican Arkansas House.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817546,Activists urge Jamaica to nix anti-sodomy laws amid violence,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Activists demanded Tuesday that Jamaica repeal a colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex, noting that the government still has not heeded a regional rights panel's recommendation two years ago to do so.

            The call comes as a growing number of islands in the conservative Caribbean region strike down similar but rarely invoked laws that often seek life sentences and hard labor. Jamaica has resisted such a repeal, and is considered the Caribbean nation most hostile toward gay people.

            “Jamaica is really an outlier,” said Devon Matthews with Rainbow Railroad, a Canadian group that helps members of the LGBTQ community escape violence. “The situation has gotten significantly worse in the last number of years.”











            Rainbow Railroad released a report Tuesday along with Human Dignity Trust, a U.K. nonprofit legal organization, that found the LGBTQ community in Jamaica faces “horrific violence, discrimination and persecution and lack(s) the most basic protections under the law.”

            Since 2019, Rainbow Railroad has seen an increase in calls for help from gay people in Jamaica, with 411 violent incidents reported last year, compared with 377 the previous year, Matthews said in a phone interview.

            “The data doesn’t even do justice to the degree of violence that we’re seeing,” she said. “It’s truly horrifying.”

            In February 2021, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights found that Jamaica’s government was violating a right to privacy, equal protection, humane treatment and freedom of movement involving two members of the island’s LGBTQ community who were forced to flee Jamaica.

            One defendant, Gareth Henry, is a gay man who was beaten several times by Jamaica police in front of angry crowds and now lives as a refugee in Canada along with his mother, sister and other relatives. The other defendant, Simone Edwards, a lesbian woman, obtained asylum in the Netherlands after she was shot twice in anti-gay violence, according to Human Dignity Trust.

            The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is part of the Organization of American States, recommended at the time that Jamaica repeal its so-called anti-buggery law. This has not yet happened.

            “A lot of beautiful people lost in this violence could have been protected if the state had stepped up,” Matthews said.

            Jamaica’s government has argued that it doesn’t enforce its 1864 anti-sodomy laws, but activists say having them remain on the books encourages homophobia and violent acts against the gay community in the religious country of some 2.8 million people.

            Matthews said the laws sometimes are enforced by communities and families even if they’re not enforced at a state level.

            A spokesperson for the office of Jamaica’s prime minister did not immediately return a message for comment.

            And while it’s legal for women in Jamaica to engage in same-sex intimacy, Rainbow Railroad reported that it’s not uncommon for their families to organize so-called “corrective rapes” of them or their partner.

            Activists also note that gay Jamaicans struggle to access jobs, medical care, education and housing.

            Similar discrimination was reported in other Caribbean islands that have since repealed same-sex laws, with Barbados doing so in December, following in the steps of Antigua & Barbuda and St. Kitts and Nevis. But such laws remain on the books in six other countries in the Americas: Jamaica, Guyana, Grenada, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Activists demanded Tuesday that Jamaica repeal a colonial-era law criminalizing gay sex, noting that the government still has not heeded a regional rights panel's recommendation two years ago to do so.The call comes as a growing number of islands in the conservative Caribbean region strike down similar but rarely invoked laws that often seek life sentences and hard labor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817547,Judge bars public from court in NYC bike path terror trial,"NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge barred the general public and media from a courtroom Tuesday where defense lawyers claim emotional testimony from victims has spoiled the death penalty phase of the trial of a man who admits that he killed eight people on a bike path on behalf of a terrorist group.

            Judge Vernon S. Broderick issued the edict Friday at the trial of Sayfullo Saipov through a court spokesperson, who wrote that courtroom seats would only be available to witnesses or parties considered essential to the trial. The judge announced late Tuesday that a few reporters might be allowed at the trial Wednesday on a “bench all the way in the back"" of the courtroom.

            The public and the media were excluded from the courtroom in part to make room for Saipov's family members and numerous victims and family members of those who were killed. Victims have attended the trial for weeks, providing tearful testimony about how their lives have changed.











            Saipov last month was convicted of killing eight people on Oct. 31, 2017, by driving a rented truck over the bike path along the Hudson River at a high rate of speed. Afterward, prosecutors said, he asked to hang a flag for the Islamic State group in his hospital room while he recovered from a police officer shooting him.

            After hearing witnesses over what is expected to be a two-week period, the jury that convicted him will decide whether he gets death or life in prison. If any of them vote against death, he will automatically serve life in prison.

            The judge directed the public and the media to watch the trial on television monitors elsewhere in the courthouse. Those monitors, however, show only a sliver of the courtroom and rely on lawyers, witnesses and the judge speaking into microphones and on court personnel remembering to switch on video and audio.

            The monitors also do not enable members of the media to observe the courtroom reactions of Saipov's family members or the victims and family members of those who died.

            Their reactions, along with those of witnesses, grew in relevance after defense lawyers argued Friday in court papers that a mistrial should be declared because the volume of emotional testimony seems designed to make jurors choose a death sentence out of anger or spite or to prevent Saipov from communicating with his children, since those he killed can no longer speak with theirs.

            The likelihood of emotional reactions by spectators was anticipated to be so high that Broderick warned them Tuesday that they should leave the courtroom if they become too emotional. Members of the media would be unable to know if anyone walked out.

            The interest in impartial observers to the court proceeding was noted when defense lawyers asked the judge in their letter Friday to request that court stenographers preserve any audio recordings they routinely make to aid their work. Prosecutors called the request unprecedented and opposed it. A recording, though, would aid judges on appeal as they review how emotional testimony became.

            Letters were filed in the case Tuesday to protest the exclusion of media from the courtroom.

            In a letter joined by The Associated Press, New York Times attorney Dana Green urged the judge to recognize that a live video feed providing a narrow view of the courtroom was not an adequate substitute for being in the courtroom. She urged the judge to allow at least a small number of seats for a press pool. The New York Post and the Daily News also supported the request.

            In a separate letter, Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press noted that the presence of the media was “particularly important in capital cases.""

            Broderick's order banning the public and the media was believed to be a first for a public terrorism trial involving Islamic extremists in Manhattan federal court since the trials began months after the Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others.NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge barred the general public and media from a courtroom Tuesday where defense lawyers claim emotional testimony from victims has spoiled the death penalty phase of the trial of a man who admits that he killed eight people on a bike path on behalf of a terrorist group.Judge Vernon S. Broderick issued the edict Friday at the trial of Sayfullo Saipov through a court spokesperson, who wrote that courtroom seats would only be available to witnesses or parties considered essential to the trial. The judge announced late Tuesday that a few reporters might be allowed at the trial Wednesday on a “bench all the way in the back"" of the courtroom.The public and the media were excluded from the courtroom in part to make room for Saipov's family members and numerous victims and family members of those who were killed. Victims have attended the trial for weeks, providing tearful testimony about how their lives have changed.Saipov last month was convicted of killing eight people on Oct. 31, 2017, by driving a rented truck over the bike path along the Hudson River at a high rate of speed. Afterward, prosecutors said, he asked to hang a flag for the Islamic State group in his hospital room while he recovered from a police officer shooting him.After hearing witnesses over what is expected to be a two-week period, the jury that convicted him will decide whether he gets death or life in prison. If any of them vote against death, he will automatically serve life in prison.The judge directed the public and the media to watch the trial on television monitors elsewhere in the courthouse. Those monitors, however, show only a sliver of the courtroom and rely on lawyers, witnesses and the judge speaking into microphones and on court personnel remembering to switch on video and audio.The monitors also do not enable members of the media to observe the courtroom reactions of Saipov's family members or the victims and family members of those who died.Their reactions, along with those of witnesses, grew in relevance after defense lawyers argued Friday in court papers that a mistrial should be declared because the volume of emotional testimony seems designed to make jurors choose a death sentence out of anger or spite or to prevent Saipov from communicating with his children, since those he killed can no longer speak with theirs.The likelihood of emotional reactions by spectators was anticipated to be so high that Broderick warned them Tuesday that they should leave the courtroom if they become too emotional.

            Neither were present at City's open training session Tuesday and they did not travel to Germany for the round-of-16 first-leg matchup.

            They reported felling ill after playing in Saturday’s game at Nottingham Forest in the Premier League.











            “During the season, unfortunately sometimes that happens,"" Guardiola said. “(De Bruyne) didn’t feel good right after the game against Nottingham. Yesterday, Aymer didn’t feel well.”

            De Bruyne played 88 minutes in the 1-1 draw at Forest, and defender Laporte completed the full match.

            Guardiola said he was unsure if either player will be available for the Premier League game at Bournemouth on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817566,Saudi Arabia deposits $1 billion into Yemen’s central bank,"SANAA, Yemen (AP) — Saudi Arabia deposited $1 billion into the central bank of Yemen’s internationally recognized government Tuesday in a bid to bolster the country’s ailing economy, state media said. 

            In a brief statement, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the $1 billion deposited into the Aden-based central bank will help the Riyadh-backed administration implement economic reforms. 

            Yemen’s ruinous civil war, now entering its ninth year, has wrecked the country’s economy and pushed half of the population to the brink of famine. Over 150,000 people have been killed in the conflict.











            The war began in 2014 when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized Yemen’s capital Sanaa, along with much of the north of the country, forcing the government into exile. A Saudi coalition, including the United Arab Emirates, intervened the next year to try to restore the internationally recognized government. The country’s central bank has since been divided between the warring sides, with the Houthis operating its monetary authority from Sanaa

            Rashad al-Alimi, head of the internationally recognized presidential council, thanked the Saudi government for Tuesday’s economic aid in a series of posts on Twitter. Al-Alimi said the money would go toward funding new projects and stabilizing the currency. No further details were given. 

            Yemen has been hit hard by the fallout of the Ukraine war, with the country having imported 40% of its grain from Ukraine until supply channels were cut following Russia’s invasion. Food prices in Yemen have since surged.

            Over past years, the Aden branch of Yemen's central bank has driven inflation by printing new banknotes to finance debts and cover the cost of public sector salaries. Houthi-controlled areas do not accept notes printed by Aden's central bank.

            Two officials from the internationally recognized government told The Associated Press that the $1 billion aid package will help compensate for the sharp decline in oil revenues in recent months. Oil exports have slowed drastically following several Houthi drone attacks on tankers and other facilities late last year. Both spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not briefed to speak with the media.

            The Arab Monetary Fund, an Abu Dhabi-based group and sub-organization of the 22-member Arab League, will help oversee the use of the $1 billion, the SPA said. 

            In April 2022, Saudi Arabia and the UAE promised $3 billion worth of aid to the internationally recognized president. It remains unclear whether Tuesday's deposit is part of that pledge. 

            Yemen has seen a lull in front-line fighting in recent months, despite the country’s six-month-long formal cease-fire agreement expiring last October. During this period, Houthi and Saudi officials have been engaged in talks seeking to reach a negotiated end to the civil war.SANAA, Yemen (AP) — Saudi Arabia deposited $1 billion into the central bank of Yemen’s internationally recognized government Tuesday in a bid to bolster the country’s ailing economy, state media said.In a brief statement, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said the $1 billion deposited into the Aden-based central bank will help the Riyadh-backed administration implement economic reforms.Yemen’s ruinous civil war, now entering its ninth year, has wrecked the country’s economy and pushed half of the population to the brink of famine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817569,Alex Murdaugh's surviving son takes stand at murder trial,"Alex Murdaugh's defense called his surviving son to the stand Tuesday to poke holes in evidence prosecutors have presented in the disgraced South Carolina attorney's double murder trial.

            Buster Murdaugh answered questions in a matter-of-fact tone, ranging from how he found out about the killings to how his brother would steal his ID and use it to buy alcohol while underage to how his dad coached his baseball teams as a kid.

            During his testimony, Buster Murdaugh explained points that prosecutors emphasized as potentially sinister during the trial's first four weeks, like Alex Murdaugh parking behind his mother's home or not using his cellphone for an hour the night of the killings.











            Buster Murdaugh said he was around his father almost all the time in the 10 days after the killings, and described him as devastated and confused, living and sleeping anywhere other than where his wife and son were killed.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the murders of his wife Maggie, 52, who was killed by four or five rifle shots; and their 22-year-old son Paul, who died from two shotgun blasts on June 7, 2021, near kennels on their sprawling property in Colleton County. Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if he is convicted.

            Buster Murdaugh was one of the most anticipated witnesses. He has been in the audience behind his father every day of the trial. Alex Murdaugh smiled at him as he took the stand.

            He testified that cell service at the family's Colleton County home was spotty and that his father sometimes misplaced his phone. Prosecutors have suggested Alex Murdaugh left the device behind so it wouldn’t be where the killings took place. 

            Buster Murdaugh also said the family frequently parked near his grandparent’s back door in Hampton, which is where Alex Murdaugh parked when he visited his ailing mother the night his wife and son were killed. Investigators have suggested he parked behind the house to get rid of evidence that has never been found, like both guns or bloody clothing.

            After visiting his mother the night of the murders, Alex Murdaugh returned home, called 911 and reported that he had found the bodies of his wife and son.

            There were no tears from Buster Murdaugh on Tuesday. He talked about getting a phone call from his dad on June 7, 2021, who asked if he was sitting down and then told him his brother and mother had been shot.

            “He was destroyed. He was heartbroken. I walked through the door, I saw him and I gave him a hug,"" Buster Murdaugh said.

            He also testified that his father took a lot of showers during the hot, steamy South Carolina summers, a point apparently meant to address testimony from a housekeeper who found a damp towel the morning after the killings.

            Buster Murdaugh also testified that guns were left around the property “with the safety on"" and that he never loaded one shell of larger buckshot and a second shell of smaller birdshot in his shotguns. That combination killed Paul Murdaugh, investigators said.

            Neither gun used in the killings has been found. A state agent testified last week he incorrectly told the grand jury which indicted Alex Murdaugh that several shotguns were found on the property loaded the way the weapon was that killed Paul Murdaugh.

            Another agent testified that bullet casings found around the Murdaugh property had markings similar to those that held the ammunition killing Maggie Murdaugh.

            Prosecutor John Meadors asked gentle questions of Buster Murdaugh in his cross examination, clarifying and emphasizing a few discrepancies in the testimony. He didn't ask him if he thought his father was the killer.

            After Buster Murdaugh testified, the defense called a forensic engineer who said that bullet casing locations and the angles of two shots fired at Maggie Murdaugh show the shooter was about 5-foot-2 (1.57 meters) tall or else holding the gun below their kneecap. Alex Murdaugh is 6-foot-4.

            “It’s just trigonometry,” Mike Sutton said.

            During cross examination, prosecutors asked why Sutton didn’t use the same ammunition believed to be used in the killings to test whether shots could be heard from 1,150 feet (350 meters) away, where Alex Murdaugh told police he was napping in the house when investigators think his wife and son were shot elsewhere on the property.

            Prosecutors asked Sutton if he considered whether a shooter could have been kneeling. They also asked if he considered whether bullets or pellets could have ricocheted. Sutton said he depended on reports and photos from state agents for that information.

            “What if any opinion do you have as to whether that person could be Alex Murdaugh shooting?” defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian asked.

            “It can’t be,” Sutton replied.

            The defense started its case Friday with Colleton County Coroner Richard Harvey, who testified he estimated the time of death for Murdaugh's wife and son at around 9 p.m., give or take an hour. He made the estimate based on the warmth felt when he put his hand under the victims' armpits.

            The prosecution had suggested the death happened at 8:50 p.m., based on when the victims stopped using their cellphones.

            Also on Tuesday, another person was dismissed from the jury because of an unspecified illness. That leaves two alternates.

            Before testimony began, Judge Clifton Newman admonished defense attorney Jim Griffin for tweeting a Washington Post opinion piece, repeating the headline “Alex Murdaugh trial reveals a sloppy investigation.”

            Newman said it at least violated the spirit of a rule that lawyers involved in a case shouldn't criticize witnesses or other attorneys.

            “I understand your honor,"" Griffin said. ""I will not retweet anything or tweet anything until this trial is over.”Alex Murdaugh's defense called his surviving son to the stand Tuesday to poke holes in evidence prosecutors have presented in the disgraced South Carolina attorney's double murder trial.Buster Murdaugh answered questions in a matter-of-fact tone, ranging from how he found out about the killings to how his brother would steal his ID and use it to buy alcohol while underage to how his dad coached his baseball teams as a kid.During his testimony, Buster Murdaugh explained points that prosecutors emphasized as potentially sinister during the trial's first four weeks, like Alex Murdaugh parking behind his mother's home or not using his cellphone for an hour the night of the killings.Buster Murdaugh said he was around his father almost all the time in the 10 days after the killings, and described him as devastated and confused, living and sleeping anywhere other than where his wife and son were killed.Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial in the murders of his wife Maggie, 52, who was killed by four or five rifle shots; and their 22-year-old son Paul, who died from two shotgun blasts on June 7, 2021, near kennels on their sprawling property in Colleton County.

Alex Murdaugh is 6-foot-4.“It’s just trigonometry,” Mike Sutton said.During cross examination, prosecutors asked why Sutton didn’t use the same ammunition believed to be used in the killings to test whether shots could be heard from 1,150 feet (350 meters) away, where Alex Murdaugh told police he was napping in the house when investigators think his wife and son were shot elsewhere on the property.Prosecutors asked Sutton if he considered whether a shooter could have been kneeling. They also asked if he considered whether bullets or pellets could have ricocheted. Sutton said he depended on reports and photos from state agents for that information.“What if any opinion do you have as to whether that person could be Alex Murdaugh shooting?” defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian asked.“It can’t be,” Sutton replied.The defense started its case Friday with Colleton County Coroner Richard Harvey, who testified he estimated the time of death for Murdaugh's wife and son at around 9 p.m., give or take an hour. He made the estimate based on the warmth felt when he put his hand under the victims' armpits.The prosecution had suggested the death happened at 8:50 p.m., based on when the victims stopped using their cellphones.Also on Tuesday, another person was dismissed from the jury because of an unspecified illness. That leaves two alternates.Before testimony began, Judge Clifton Newman admonished defense attorney Jim Griffin for tweeting a Washington Post opinion piece, repeating the headline “Alex Murdaugh trial reveals a sloppy investigation.”Newman said it at least violated the spirit of a rule that lawyers involved in a case shouldn't criticize witnesses or other attorneys.“I understand your honor,"" Griffin said. ""I will not retweet anything or tweet anything until this trial is over.”",2023/2/22,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817571,Southern Baptists oust Saddleback Church over woman pastor,"The Southern Baptist Convention on Tuesday ousted its second-largest congregation — Saddleback Church, the renowned California megachurch founded by pastor and best-selling author Rick Warren — for having a woman pastor.

            The vote by the convention's Executive Committee culminates growing tension between the nation's largest Protestant denomination — which officially opposes women as pastors — and a congregation whose story has been one of the biggest church-growth successes of modern times.

            The committee cited Saddleback's having “a female teaching pastor functioning in the office of pastor,"" an allusion to Stacie Wood, wife of the current lead pastor of Saddleback, Andy Wood.











            But the controversy began in 2021, when Warren ordained three women as pastors, prompting discussions within the denomination about possibly expelling the megachurch.

            
                Warren retired last year after more than 42 years at Saddleback. He made an emotional speech in June 2022 at the Southern Baptists’ annual convention in Anaheim, standing by his ordination of women. He told delegates who debated the issue, “We have to decide if we will treat each other as allies or adversaries.” 

            But the Executive Committee took the vote Tuesday without public discussion after meeting in executive session.

            It voted to approve a recommendation from the denomination's Credentials Committee that Saddleback be deemed “not in friendly cooperation with the Convention"" — the terminology used for ousting a church. While Southern Baptists' statement of faith officially opposes women as pastors, each congregation is self-governing, so the main enforcement mechanism is to oust it from membership.

            The Executive Committee's motion said that Saddleback “has a faith and practice that does not closely identify with the Convention’s adopted statement of faith, as demonstrated by the church having a female teaching pastor functioning in the office of pastor.”

            In a statement late Tuesday, the church didn’t indicate whether it planned to exercise its right to appeal the decision at the Southern Baptists' next annual meeting, scheduled for New Orleans in June.

            “We love and have always valued our relationship with the SBC and its faithful churches,” Saddleback elders said in a statement. ""We will engage and respond through the proper channels at the appropriate time in hopes to serve other like-minded Bible believing SBC churches. Meanwhile, we remain focused on following God’s leadership to love and serve our church family and the communities around our campuses.""

            Mike Keahbone, an Executive Committee member and Oklahoma pastor, said an appeal “appears likely.”

            “This was the heart of the room; to let the messengers (delegates) of the SBC decide,” Keahbone tweeted Tuesday.

            With its main campus in Lake Forest, south of Los Angeles, Saddleback Church has grown over four to 14 locations in Southern California, with an average weekly attendance of 30,000. There are four international campuses —in Hong Kong, Germany, the Philippines and Argentina.

            Wood told The Associated Press last year that the Bible “teaches that men and women were given spiritual gifts by God.” His wife has served as teaching pastor for Saddleback.

            “The church should be a place where both men and women can exercise those spiritual gifts,” Wood said. “My wife has the spiritual gift of teaching and she is really good. People often tell me she’s better than me when it comes to preaching, and I’m really glad to hear that.”

            The Executive Committee also voted to oust five other congregations -- four over the issue of women as pastors and one over the issue of sexual abuse.

            When Southern Baptists last updated their official statement of belief — The Baptist Faith and Message — in 2000, they added this clause: “While both men and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.”

            The five churches ousted for having women as pastors “have been valued, cooperating churches for many years, and this decision was not made lightly,” Committee Chairman Jared Wellman said in a statement. ""However, we remain committed to upholding the theological convictions of the SBC and maintaining unity among its cooperating churches.”

            Warren, with a social media following in the millions, has written multiple books, including the widely successful “The Purpose Driven Life.” In 2005, Time magazine named Warren one of the “100 Most Influential People in the World,” and he delivered the invocation at President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009. 

            The church grew from a startup by Rick Warren and his wife, Kay Warren. With his charisma and easy, informal preaching style, Warren attracted thousands to the megachurch. Over the past decade, Warren also launched an ambitious plan to expand the church’s reach across Southern California as well as globally, a vision his successor has promised to complete.

            Warren, in a tweet, said he and Kay would “respond to #SBC in OUR time & way thru direct channels"" such as social media and newsletters. 

            Warren remains listed as founding pastor on the Saddleback website. 

            The SBC has in recent years authorized the ouster of churches that don't conform to its statement of faith. This includes churches with women pastors, LGBTQ-inclusive polices, support for racism or failure to respond adequately to child sexual abuse, such as employing offenders as pastors.

            In some cases, the committee has ousted churches for allegedly failing even to cooperate in answering to such allegations, as reflected in some of the motions approved on Tuesday.

            It deemed Freedom Church in Vero Beach, Florida, to be not in friendly cooperation “based on a lack of intent to cooperate in resolving concerns regarding a sexual abuse allegation."" The denomination has been roiled by allegations in recent years of sexual abusers remaining in ministry, prompting the convention to vote for stricter policies. A task force focused on the issue this week announced the hiring of a firm to oversee a new database of credibly accused ministers.

            Freedom Church's pastor, Richard Demsick, told the AP that the SBC has sent conflicting messages to the church. In a letter to national, state and local Southern Baptist entities, church leaders disputed any allegation of abuse, asked for additional information and said they planned to appeal any ouster. 

            The Executive Committee ousted New Faith Mission Ministry of Griffin, Georgia, and St. Timothy’s Christian Baptist in Baltimore, citing their “lack of intent to cooperate in resolving a question” arising from the churches having women senior pastors.

            And it ousted Fern Creek Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky, and Calvary Baptist Church in Jackson, Mississippi, both for having female lead pastors, indicating they have a “faith and practice” at odds with the convention's.

            The SBC has 13.7 million members, but has seen net declines over more than a decade in members and baptisms, its key metric for spiritual vitality.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817577,Lindy La Rocque leads homegrown UNLV to new heights,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — UNLV women's basketball coach Lindy La Rocque might be the exception as the coach who stays and tries to build a program at a mid-major even if Power Five athletic directors try to lure her away with offers of more money and greater access to the NCAA Tournament.

            Las Vegas is La Rocque's hometown, and three of her starters — and two leading scorers — are from the area. Even more importantly, her family is nearby and helps watch her 3-month-old daughter while she coaches the 24th-ranked Lady Rebels.

            “I think if anything it’s shown me that I need to be here in Las Vegas,"" La Rocque said. ""... if I didn’t have (her parents), raising my child during the season would be really difficult. Not just my parents, I’ve got family and friends that helped raise me when I was a kid. I’ve always had that vision (of) raising my family around family, and obviously this job gives me the luxury of doing both.”











            La Rocque is in her third season at UNLV and she keeps taking the program up a step each year. The Lady Rebels went 15-9 in her first season, turning around a team that was 13-17 the previous year. Last season, La Rocque guided the Lady Rebels to their first NCAA Tournament appearance in 20 years.

            This season? They are repeat Mountain West regular-season champions, 25-2 and ranked in the AP poll for the first time in 29 years.

            As well as UNLV has played, however, there is no guarantee the Lady Rebels will make the NCAA Tournament should they stumble in next month's conference tournament. UNLV is 53nd in the NET rankings, a factor the tournament committee uses when considering at-large teams.

            For La Rocque, improving the team's resume in future seasons is her next priority once this one ends. That is evident with next season's nonconference schedule, which includes Arizona at home and Oklahoma on the road. Oklahoma is ranked 13th and Arizona 14th.

            That is down the road, and for now La Rocque is using a roster that is largely home grown. Three of the team's top five scorers are from Las Vegas. Their success has helped shine a light on the quality of girls' high school basketball in the area.

            “There’s local talent here in Las Vegas, and I feel like it’s slept on,” said senior guard Essence Booker, who previously played at Nevada and Ball State. “I originally didn’t get recruited from UNLV, so being able to play for Lindy La Rocque and this group and with Justice (Ethridge) and Desi(-Rae Young) all being from Vegas, it’s the best of both worlds.”

            Young, a 6-foot-1 junior center, leads UNLV with 18.1 points and 10.3 rebounds a game.

            “I think a lot of women here in Las Vegas don’t get seen as much as people on the East Coast,” Young said. “So I think now we've made it known that we actually have great talent here.”

            La Rocque herself played high school basketball in Las Vegas and as a freshman at Durango she also competed on a boys' AAU team because there wasn't one for girls. She even started at guard over Pierre Jackson, who had an eight-game stint with the Dallas Mavericks in the 2016-17 NBA season.

            Her dad, Al, was a longtime successful high school coach, including at Durango from 1993-2007. The coach's daughter would play herself into a scholarship offer from traditional power Stanford, which appeared in the Final Four each season she was there.

            Now she's home and building a winner with every intent to see the job through as well as be a wife and mother. La Rocque was coaching UNLV in an exhibition Nov. 2 when her water broke in the third quarter.

            It was quite stressful at the time, but she got a baby girl and a great story to tell.

            “They tell you you get this weird mother intuition,” La Rocque said. “I didn’t think she would come that early, but I just had a feeling that it was going to happen early. It was going to be something in the gym.”

            Las Vegas is La Rocque's home, and maybe she will build UNLV into a national power. No doubt there will be suitors, though, and Al La Rocque knows his daughter might have some choices to make at some point.

            “But I also know her family is the most important thing to her,” Al La Rocque said. “Mom and I are certainly enjoying (being grandparents), but we also want her to have the best career that she can as well.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817578,Reich to call offensive plays for Panthers for now,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers head coach Frank Reich said he plans to be the team’s offensive play-caller — at least for now.

            Reich, who called plays the past four seasons as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, said it's something he feels comfortable doing and enjoys, but that he eventually plans on handing the role over to offensive coordinator Thomas Brown.

            When that will be, he doesn't know.











            “I know that is going to be hard,” Reich said. ""I've laughed with Thomas about that already, saying ‘I’m going to pass it off at some point, I don't know when.' There will be a time and a place and I think that will become apparent when that is.""

            Still, Reich added he will “lean heavy” on Brown for his input on play-calling.

            Brown, who spent the 2022 season as the assistant head coach/tight ends coach for the Los Angeles Rams, is one of the few assistants Reich hired that he didn't have a previously relationship with in the league.

            So while Reich feels strongly about Brown's skills, calling him a coach with “wisdom, conviction and strength,"" there may still need to be a level of comfort that needs to be cultivated.

            Brown last served as an offensive coordinator and play-caller from 2016-18 for the Miami Hurricanes.

            “I think the right thing for me to do for our team and for our offense right now is for me to continue to use my experience there,” Reich said.

            Reich has some work to do.

            Carolina went 7-10 last season and finished 29th in the NFL in overall offense and passing amid inconsistent quarterback play. Exactly who'll be lining up under center in 2023 for the Panthers remains to be seen.

            Sam Darnold and P.J. Walker are free agents, leaving last year's third-round draft pick Matt Corral as the only returning QB on the roster. 

            However, Corral didn't play at all as a rookie after going down with a season-ending foot injury in the preseason.

            Reich wouldn't say if the Panthers plan to bring in former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr for a visit, saying the staff is just beginning to discuss potential free agents and no decisions have been made.

            However, the general feeling among the Panthers front office is they'd like to build around a young quarterback. General manager Scott Fitterer was a member of the Seattle Seahawks personnel staff when they selected Russell Wilson in the third round and later went on to win a Super Bowl and multiple division titles.

            Defensively, Reich confirmed the Panthers will employ a 3-4 base defense, a change from last year's base 4-3 scheme.

            That doesn't come as much of a surprise given defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero used the 3-4 scheme while serving in the same role with the Denver Broncos last season. 

            Reich has assembled an experienced staff that includes two former head coaches in Dom Capers and Jim Caldwell, who'll serve as senior assistants and advisers.

            The Panthers were also able to land Brown and Evero — two highly sought-after coordinators that both had interviews for head coaching openings this cycle — while keeping successful special teams coordinator Chris Tabor. 

            Some of the team's assistant coaches bring a wealth of experience, including Shawn Jefferson (wide receivers), Duce Staley (running backs), James Campen (offensive line) and Todd Wash (defensive line). 

            The Panthers also added a game management coach in George Li.

            Panthers owner David Tepper has made it clear he planned to use his deep pockets — he's the second-wealthiest owner in the NFL per Forbes — to assemble the best coaching staff money could buy, given there is no salary cap for coaches.

            In some cases, the Panthers were able to outbid other teams to land assistants such as Evero.

            “To Mr. Tepper's credit, he never flinched on that statement,” Reich said. “He's been around the block a few times. That doesn't mean it's an open checkbook, that just means that we are willing to do what it takes to get the right coaches and put the right team together. He backed up what he said, I can tell you that.

            AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers head coach Frank Reich said he plans to be the team’s offensive play-caller — at least for now.Reich, who called plays the past four seasons as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts, said it's something he feels comfortable doing and enjoys, but that he eventually plans on handing the role over to offensive coordinator Thomas Brown.When that will be, he doesn't know.“I know that is going to be hard,” Reich said. ""I've laughed with Thomas about that already, saying ‘I’m going to pass it off at some point, I don't know when.' There will be a time and a place and I think that will become apparent when that is.""Still, Reich added he will “lean heavy” on Brown for his input on play-calling.Brown, who spent the 2022 season as the assistant head coach/tight ends coach for the Los Angeles Rams, is one of the few assistants Reich hired that he didn't have a previously relationship with in the league.So while Reich feels strongly about Brown's skills, calling him a coach with “wisdom, conviction and strength,"" there may still need to be a level of comfort that needs to be cultivated.Brown last served as an offensive coordinator and play-caller from 2016-18 for the Miami Hurricanes.“I think the right thing for me to do for our team and for our offense right now is for me to continue to use my experience there,” Reich said.Reich has some work to do.Carolina went 7-10 last season and finished 29th in the NFL in overall offense and passing amid inconsistent quarterback play. Exactly who'll be lining up under center in 2023 for the Panthers remains to be seen.Sam Darnold and P.J. Walker are free agents, leaving last year's third-round draft pick Matt Corral as the only returning QB on the roster.However, Corral didn't play at all as a rookie after going down with a season-ending foot injury in the preseason.Reich wouldn't say if the Panthers plan to bring in former Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Derek Carr for a visit, saying the staff is just beginning to discuss potential free agents and no decisions have been made.However, the general feeling among the Panthers front office is they'd like to build around a young quarterback. General manager Scott Fitterer was a member of the Seattle Seahawks personnel staff when they selected Russell Wilson in the third round and later went on to win a Super Bowl and multiple division titles.Defensively, Reich confirmed the Panthers will employ a 3-4 base defense, a change from last year's base 4-3 scheme.That doesn't come as much of a surprise given defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero used the 3-4 scheme while serving in the same role with the Denver Broncos last season.Reich has assembled an experienced staff that includes two former head coaches in Dom Capers and Jim Caldwell, who'll serve as senior assistants and advisers.The Panthers were also able to land Brown and Evero — two highly sought-after coordinators that both had interviews for head coaching openings this cycle — while keeping successful special teams coordinator Chris Tabor.Some of the team's assistant coaches bring a wealth of experience, including Shawn Jefferson (wide receivers), Duce Staley (running backs), James Campen (offensive line) and Todd Wash (defensive line).The Panthers also added a game management coach in George Li.Panthers owner David Tepper has made it clear he planned to use his deep pockets — he's the second-wealthiest owner in the NFL per Forbes — to assemble the best coaching staff money could buy, given there is no salary cap for coaches.In some cases, the Panthers were able to outbid other teams to land assistants such as Evero.“To Mr. Tepper's credit, he never flinched on that statement,” Reich said. “He's been around the block a few times. That doesn't mean it's an open checkbook, that just means that we are willing to do what it takes to get the right coaches and put the right team together. He backed up what he said, I can tell you that.“We were able to compete against other teams who were vying for similar candidates where we came out on top because of that (financial) backing.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/2/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817579,"Astros' Alvarez has sore hand, won't take BP for a few days","Houston Astros All-Star Yordan Alvarez has a sore left hand that will keep him out of batting practice for a few days in spring training.

            Alvarez told reporters on Tuesday that soreness in the hand was an issue at times last year and continued to “flare up a bit at times” during the offseason.

            Despite the soreness, Alvarez hit .306 with 37 homers and 97 RBIs and finished third in the AL MVP voting for the World Series champion Astros.











            Speaking through a translator, Alvarez said he told team officials about the sore hand when he reported to camp.

            “It’s just something we’re going to monitor,” said Alvarez, a native of Cuba. “I felt a little bit of discomfort but it’s something we’re going to monitor and work on. I’m going to take the next couple days off here like I did in the offseason and prepare but it’s not something that’s going to be an issue during the season.”

            Alvarez had only three hits in the World Series, including a 450-foot, three-run homer that powered the Astros to a 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Phillies in the decisive Game 6.

            BIG YEAR FOR BELLINGER

            Cody Bellinger is getting a fresh start with the Chicago Cubs, and manager David Ross said the two-time All-Star has a “good energy about him.”

            “He feels really good. He talks it. He hit an absolute missile yesterday in the live BPs down on the back fields,” Ross said. “It was nice to see. ... It’s a big year for him and he’s got something to prove, but it’s not a pressure-type thing. It’s just like I want to go out there and play baseball and can’t wait to get started.”

            The 27-year-old Bellinger spent his first six seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers, winning the NL MVP award after he batted .305 with 47 homers and 115 RBIs in 2019. But he hasn’t been the same since that monster performance, hitting just .210 last year with 150 strikeouts in 144 games.

            Bellinger signed a $17.5 million, one-year deal with Chicago in December, and Ross said the center fielder is working on adjustments at the plate.

            “I think everybody has a little bit of tweaks in their game when they go into the offseason, things they want to improve on. He’s no different,” Ross said. “It’s all about some of the stuff for him to get ready to hit and some of the way he loads and making sure we’re training that in the weight room and drilling that in the cages.”

            FRANCONA'S JITTERS PROVE PAINFUL

            Even after all these years, Terry Francona gets nervous before delivering the first speech of spring training to his players.

            This season, it came with a price for Cleveland’s manager.

            Francona broke a tooth while preparing to speak to the Guardians in Goodyear, Arizona. Because he wanted to work on his remarks, Francona skipped dinner with his staff on Monday night to prepare. He made some pasta, but it was undercooked.

            “It was frozen at the bottom and I broke part of my tooth,” he said following his speech. “At first I didn’t think I did. Then I started chewing and said, ‘That tastes awful.’ Not only did I swallow the tooth, I chewed it.”

            Then, when he arrived at the team’s facility, Francona spilled coffee over his speech.

            The hiccups aside, Francona, who is entering his 11th season with Cleveland, felt good about it afterward.

            “I felt like I said what I wanted to say,” he said. “That’s the goal. I don’t want to just talk. Everybody has meetings. I want to help.”

            DONALDSON DOINGS

            Yankees manager Aaron Boone fully expects a comeback season for third baseman Josh Donaldson.

            The 37-year old former AL MVP hit .222 last season, 43 points under his career average. He finished with 15 homers and 62 RBIs in 132 games.

            “First of all we’re talking about a great player,” Boone said. “This has been a star player, and consistently for a long time. He’s not far removed from 2021 where he was still a wrecking ball”

            GUEST REQUIRES MEDICAL HELP

            A guest of the Pittsburgh Pirates required emergency medical attention after suffering cardiac arrest while fielding fly balls on a practice field.

            Ernie Withers, 69, was shagging balls at the team’s spring training complex when he had “a medical event” that required immediate attention and caused practice to stop.

            Jacki Dezelski, president of the Manatee Chamber of Commerce in Bradenton, Florida, confirmed Withers is a member of her group which sometimes is invited to attend practices and retrieve balls near the fence during batting practice. 

            Dezelski said Withers suffered a cardiac arrest and was alert, talking and “doing well” following a procedure. 

            ‘WILD THING’ NUMBER CHANGE FOR STRIDER

            Atlanta Braves right-hander Spencer Strider has changed his number from 65 to 99 for his second season.

            The hard-throwing Strider finished second to teammate Michael Harris II in the NL Rookie of the Year voting and then plotted a uniform number change. He was inspired by the hard-throwing fictional star of the baseball movie “Major League.”

            “Picking your jersey number in baseball to me has always been something of importance and my favorite movie is Major League and I like Rick Vaughn, so I see some similarities between Wild Thing and myself,” Strider said.

            Strider, 24, was signed to a $75 million, six-year contract after posting an 11-5 record and 2.67 ERA in 31 games, including 20 starts. 

            AILING ROYALS

            Royals prospect Drew Waters, expected to compete with Kyle Isbel for the starting center field job, will miss six weeks with a strained left oblique, according to manager Matt Quatraro. Waters hit .240 with five homers and 18 RBIs in 32 games after he was acquired in a trade with Atlanta last season.

            Quatraro said that Isbell will have “every opportunity to grab that spot.” Nate Eaton and Edward Olivares also will get a look as the Royals seek to replace Michael A. Taylor, who was traded to Minnesota last month.

            The Royals also announced that left-hander Angel Zerpa has minor shoulder pain that is not expected to keep him out long. Outfielder Brewer Hicklen, a non-roster invitee, will miss about two months with a right elbow strain.

            BREWERS SIGNINGS

            First baseman Luke Voit and outfielder Tyler Naquin agreed to minor league contracts with the Milwaukee Brewers and will report to major league spring training.

            Voit, 32, hit .226 with 22 homers and 69 RBIs in 135 games with San Diego and Washington last season. He became a free agent when the Nationals failed to offer a 2023 contract.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817582,House GOP meet with Zelenskyy as far right opposes more aid,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A handful of congressional Republicans met Tuesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a signal of continued U.S. support even as hard-right members of the party vow to block future aid to the embattled country. 

            The newly appointed chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee led a small delegation to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy for the first time since the start of the war a year ago and since Republicans won the majority in the House of Representatives in November.

            Chairman Mike McCaul and four other Republican lawmakers said they discussed at length what Ukraine's military needs to fight off Russian aggression. Zelenskyy provided them with a list of weapons, including longer-range artillery and air-to-surface missile systems.











            The meeting came one day after President Joe Biden made an unannounced trip to Kyiv to reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine as the war heads into its second year. 

            Biden has been trying to keep the allies unified in their support for Ukraine as the war is expected to intensify with spring offensives. The biggest hurdle facing the president is House Republicans. McCaul's visit Tuesday is the latest in a series of efforts by the Texas Republican to make the case to his party for why the U.S. should continue spending billions of dollars on the war effort.

            “We have seen time and again the majority of Republicans and Democrats support our assistance to Ukraine. But the Biden administration needs to layout their long-term strategy,” McCaul said in a statement. “There are some Members who would be more supportive if they saw a long-term strategy that was based on a Ukrainian victory rather than sending just enough support to prolong the war but not win it.” 

            A spokesperson for McCaul noted the delegation has been focused on oversight and ensuring there are guardrails in place for any future aid to Ukraine. 

            A far-right faction of the Republican Party has been expressing its opposition to continued U.S. support to Ukraine since last spring. That campaign intensified this month when a group of 11 House Republicans led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida put forward a “Ukraine Fatigue” resolution. It stated that the U.S. “must end its military and financial aid to Ukraine” and urged the combatants to “reach a peace agreement.”

            “America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war,” Gaetz said.

            Thus far, the U.S. has provided four rounds of aid to Ukraine in response to Russia’s invasion, totaling about $113 billion, with some of the money going toward replenishment of U.S. military equipment that was sent to the front lines.

            Congress approved the latest round of aid in December. While the package was designed to last through the end of the fiscal year in September, much depends upon events on the ground.

            For his part, Zelenskyy has been working with both Democrats and Republicans to ensure their support once the country runs out of aid, likely to happen in late summer. “It’s really very important. We’re thankful for the U.S., for its people,” Zelenskyy said in an video posted by his office after the meeting.

            In comments later on social media, Zelenskyy added, “Thank you, American congressmen, for supporting Ukraine and understanding the importance of stepping up aid to help us achieve victory over the aggressor.”

We’re thankful for the U.S., for its people,” Zelenskyy said in an video posted by his office after the meeting.In comments later on social media, Zelenskyy added, “Thank you, American congressmen, for supporting Ukraine and understanding the importance of stepping up aid to help us achieve victory over the aggressor.”___Associated Press reporter Kevin Freking contributed to this report.",2023/2/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817583,"Despite GOP rift, Kansas lawmakers target ballot drop boxes","TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Conservative Kansas lawmakers pushed ahead Tuesday with trying to eliminate most ballot drop boxes in elections, despite a split among top Republicans that could doom the conspiracy-driven effort.

            A Kansas Senate committee voted 5-4 to approve a bill that would limit each of the state's 105 counties to only one drop box, only inside its election office and only when two people from different political parties are constantly monitoring the box. Counties currently can have as many drop boxes as elections officials want, and the secretary of state's office said 167 boxes were in use in 85 counties in last year's election, or one box for every 11,700 registered voters.

            The bill's backers argue that restricting drop boxes will restore public confidence in Kansas elections, though there have been no reports of problems with them. Some Republicans continue to circulate baseless election conspiracy theories following former President Donald Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.











            The Kansas effort comes after Republicans' disappointing showing in last year's elections, particularly for election conspiracy promoters. State Sen. Jeff Longbine, an eastern Kansas Republican who opposed the drop-box limits, said he doesn't understand why the GOP is attacking something that voters find helpful. 

            “We have a certain segment of the Republican Party that's voting either as an independent or as a Democrat, and it's because of issues like this,” Longbine told reporters after the committee's vote.

            Republicans have long enjoyed an advantage among registered voters in Kansas, and the Legislature has GOP supermajorities. But supporters of restricting or eliminating drop boxes altogether are likely to need two-thirds majorities to override an expected veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who narrowly won reelection in November.

            Earlier this month, election conspiracy promoters showed their clout within the Kansas GOP when its state committee narrowly elected election conspiracy promoter Mike Brown as state chairman through the 2024 elections. Brown wants to ban all ballot drop boxes and unsuccessfully challenged Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a vocal drop box supporter, in last year's Republican primary. 

            “Voter confidence in the integrity of our elections has definitely decreased over the years, and anything that we can do to create sort of a firewall against fraud — ahead of it, before it happens — I think is a good thing,” said state Sen. Alicia Straub, a Republican from central Kansas.

            Republicans have a 7-2 majority on the Senate committee, but Longbine and GOP state Sen. Ron Ryckman Sr., from southwestern Kansas, joined the committee's two Democrats in voting no.

            Schwab is backing another bill before the House to allow him to set standards for counties' use and monitoring of drop boxes. He told the Senate committee Monday during a hearing that its bill could force voters to rely on U.S. Postal Service delivery of mail-in ballots. 

            “Why in God’s green earth would you want the federal Post Office or the federal government in charge of your ballot?” Schwab said. “I got a Christmas card last week.”

            However, the bill has strong support from Schwab's predecessor as secretary of state, Kris Kobach, who was elected Kansas attorney general last year. Kobach has long promoted the idea that election fraud is potentially widespread and argued in Monday's hearing that the bill would help stop “ballot harvesting.”

            When Kansas Republicans use that term, they mean having one person deliver multiple ballots for other people to election offices. In 2021, GOP legislators limited people to returning 10 ballots for others, overriding a Kelly veto of the measure.

            There haven't been reported cases of fraud in Kansas tied to third-party ballot deliveries, and voting-rights advocates believe the law hinders poor, older and disabled voters in getting their ballots delivered and counted.

            But Kobach told the Senate committee Monday: “You have to decide, do we want to keep our crime against ballot harvesting? And if you do, do you want it to be enforceable or unenforceable?”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817585,"West Virginia passes campus carry, bill heads to governor","CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A bill that would allow people with concealed carry permits to bring firearms on West Virginia public college and university campuses is heading to the desk of Republican Gov. Jim Justice after passing the final hurdle in the GOP-dominated Legislature. 

            The state House of Delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of the legislation Tuesday. Justice has not said publicly whether he will sign the bill, passed last month by the Senate, where half of the entire chamber — all Republicans — were listed as sponsors.

            At the House session, a lawmaker who supported the measure shared an emotional story about responding to the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech as a state trooper. 











            Republican Del. Mike Honaker, who represents a county near the Virginia border, said he will never forget the sight of the blood that covered the floor of Norris Hall, nor the sound of cell phones ringing as people frantically tried to reach loved ones who could not answer. 

            Honaker and other officers were responsible for the harrowing task of notifying parents their children had been killed. The massacre, in which 32 people were killed, remains the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. 

            ""Please hear me: Years ago, I sat on the foot of my bed with Windex and paper towels and I washed the blood of almost 30 kids off of my shoes because of an active shooter on a college campus,"" he said. 

            “I fear that if I do not support this legislation, and it happens again, washing their blood off my shoes will not compare to trying to wash the blood off of my hands,"" he continued. 

            The bill strictly prohibits the open carry of a firearm on a college or university campus and allows institutions of higher learning to implement exceptions. It also prohibits people from bringing guns into areas with a capacity of more than 1,000 spectators — stadiums for football games, for example — or to on-campus daycare centers. 

            Similar legislation has already passed in 11 other states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas and Oregon. If signed into law, West Virginia's bill would go into effect in July 2024. 

            Honaker said he understands the concerns of people opposed to the bill, but that he feels people should have the right to defend themselves. He said he hopes no one at a West Virginia college or university ever has to.

            “What makes this issue even more weighty for me is this isn’t just a policy issue, even though it is a policy issue,” he said. “What makes it even more weighty is it is in fact a constitutional issue. We cannot escape that.” 

            As the bill moved through the legislative process, the presidents of West Virginia's largest institutions of higher learning urged lawmakers to reconsider. They said decisions about whether or not to allow guns on campus should be left to the institutions to decide and voiced concerns about students struggling with mental health challenges. 

            Before the legislation advanced to the House floor, around 40 people — many of them West Virginia higher education students or faculty members — came to speak at a public hearing against the proposal last week. The two people who spoke in support both represented organizations that advocate for gun-owner rights.

            Republican Del. Larry Kump said Tuesday he's heard critics of the bill say as Republicans, he and his colleagues should support the university's right to local control. He said the best local control is the individual rights protected under the U.S. Constitution. 

            “The Second Amendment is my gun permit and that's all I have to say about that,” he said. 

            But Minority Leader Doug Skaff said lawmakers should be spending more time and attention on legislation to provide mental health support to university students — not guns. He said he's introduced legislation to help address the mental health of higher education students and ""it hasn’t seen the light of day.” 

            “Just because we have a supermajority here, just because you can pass whatever you want, doesn't mean you should,"" he said. 

            Democratic Del. John Williams said people carrying guns on campus with good intentions could make law enforcements' work more difficult. He said it takes a lot of training to respond to and de-escalate a violent situation involving a deadly weapon, something most college students don't have. 

            “A false assumption that I think we’re making is that every single one of these folks that’s going to be carrying a gun on campus is going to be Clint Eastwood, ready to fight,” he said. 

            The bill would allow exceptions in rooms where a student or employee disciplinary proceeding is being held, and says guns can be restricted in specifically designated areas where patient care or mental health counseling is being provided.

            Schools would be permitted to regulate firearms in residence halls, but not in common areas, including lounges, dining areas and study areas. The bill requires colleges and universities to provide a secure location for storage of a pistol or revolver in at least one on-campus residence hall — or to make safes available in residence rooms, which could come with a fee.CHARLESTON, W.Va.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817586,Microsoft makes case for Activision merger amid EU scrutiny,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Microsoft's Xbox video game division on Tuesday announced new partnerships with Nintendo and chipmaker Nvidia as it tries to persuade European regulators to approve its planned $68.7 billion takeover of game publishing giant Activision Blizzard.

            A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of its competitors, including Sony and Google.

            Microsoft announced a 10-year agreement with chipmaker Nvidia to bring Xbox games to Nvidia's cloud gaming service. Microsoft also said it has now signed a similar deal with Nintendo, formalizing a commitment it revealed late last year.











            What it does not have is an agreement with Xbox's chief rival, PlayStation-maker Sony, which has sought to convince antitrust regulators around the world to stop the Activision Blizzard merger.

            The all-cash deal, which is set to be the largest in the history of the tech industry, faces pushback from regulators in the U.S. and Europe because it would give Microsoft control of popular game franchises such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush.

            The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm, has been investigating whether the merger would distort fair competition to popular Activision Blizzard game titles. It's scheduled to make a decision by March 23.

            Microsoft first announced the agreement to buy the California-based game publisher early last year, but the takeover has also been stalled in the U.S., where the Federal Trade Commission has sued to block the deal, and in Britain, where an antitrust watchdog's provisional report said it will stifle competition and hurt gamers.

            Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Washington, has been counting on getting approval in either the EU or Britain to help advance its case in the U.S.

            Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, said at a Brussels news conference after meeting with regulators Tuesday that he was “not in a position to say exactly what was said in the hearing room” but emphasized that Xbox has a much smaller share of the market than PlayStation does in Europe, and asserted that the deal would be good for the industry by bringing more games to more people. 

            “For us at Microsoft, this has never been about spending $69 billion so that we could acquire titles like Call of Duty and make them less available to people,” Smith said. “That’s actually not a great way to turn a $69 billion asset into something that will become more valuable over time.”BRUSSELS (AP) — Microsoft's Xbox video game division on Tuesday announced new partnerships with Nintendo and chipmaker Nvidia as it tries to persuade European regulators to approve its planned $68.7 billion takeover of game publishing giant Activision Blizzard.A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of its competitors, including Sony and Google.Microsoft announced a 10-year agreement with chipmaker Nvidia to bring Xbox games to Nvidia's cloud gaming service.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817587,Mexico’s ex-public security chief convicted in US drug case,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former Mexican presidential cabinet member was convicted in the U.S. on Tuesday of taking massive bribes to protect the violent drug cartels he was tasked with combating. 

            Under tight security, an anonymous New York federal court jury deliberated for three days before reaching a verdict in the drug trafficking case against ex-Public Security Secretary Genaro García Luna. 

            He is the highest-ranking current or former Mexican official ever to be tried in the United States. 











            “García Luna, who once stood at the pinnacle of law enforcement in Mexico, will now live the rest of his days having been revealed as a traitor to his country and to the honest members of law enforcement who risked their lives to dismantle drug cartels,” Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement. 

            García Luna, who denied the allegations, headed Mexico’s federal police and was later the country's top public safety official from 2006 to 2012. His lawyers said the charges were based on lies from criminals who wanted to punish his drug-fighting efforts and to get sentencing breaks for themselves by helping prosecutors. 

            He showed no apparent reaction on hearing the verdict. His lawyer, César de Castro, said that the defense planned to appeal and that the case lacked “credible and reliable evidence.”

            ""The government was forced to settle for a case built on the backs of some of the most notorious and ruthless criminals to have testified in this courthouse,” de Castro said outside court.

            García Luna, 54, was convicted on charges that include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. He faces at least 20 years and as much as life in prison at his sentencing, set for June 27.

            The case had political ramifications on both sides of the border. 

            Current Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has railed throughout the trial against ex-President Felipe Calderón’s administration for, at a minimum, putting García Luna in charge of Mexico’s security. López Obrador spokesperson Jesús Ramírez tweeted after the verdict that “justice has come” to a Calderón ally and that “the crimes committed against our people will never be forgotten.”

            García Luna's work also introduced him to high-level American politicians and other officials, who considered him a key cartel-fighting partner as Washington embarked on a $1.6 billion push to beef up Mexican law enforcement and stem the flow of drugs. 

            The Americans weren’t accused of wrongdoing, and although suspicions long swirled around García Luna, the trial didn’t delve into the extent of U.S. officials’ knowledge about them before his 2019 arrest. López Obrador has, however, pointedly suggested that Washington investigate its own law enforcement and intelligence officials who worked with García Luna during Calderón’s administration.

            A roster of ex-smugglers and former Mexican officials testified that García Luna took millions of dollars in cartel cash, met with major traffickers in settings ranging from a country house to a car wash and kept law enforcement at bay. 

            He was “the best investment they had,” said Sergio “El Grande” Villarreal Barragan, a former federal police officer who worked for cartels on the side and later as his main job. 

            He and other witnesses said that on García Luna’s watch, police tipped off traffickers about upcoming raids, ensured that cocaine could pass freely through the country, colluded with cartels to raid rivals, and did other favors. One ex-smuggler said García Luna shared a document that reflected U.S. law enforcement’s information about a huge cocaine shipment that was seized in Mexico around 2007. 

            One ex-smuggler, Óscar “El Lobo” Nava Valencia, said he personally heard García Luna and a then-top police official say they would “stand with us” during a meeting with notorious Sinaloa cocaine cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman’s associates amid a cartel civil war. That sit-down alone cost the drug gang $3 million, Nava Valencia said.

            García Luna didn’t testify at the trial, although his wife took the stand in an apparent effort to portray their assets in Mexico as legitimately acquired and upper-middle-class, but not lavish. The couple moved to Miami in 2012, when the Mexican administration changed and he became a consultant on security issues.

            The trial was peppered with glimpses of such narco-extravagances as a private zoo with a lion, a hippo, white tigers and more. Jurors heard about tons of cocaine moving through Latin America in shipping containers, go-fast boats, private jets, planes, trains and even submarines.

            And there were horrific reminders of the extraordinary violence those drugs fueled.

            Witnesses described cartel killings and kidnappings, allegedly including an abduction of García Luna himself. There was testimony about police officers being slaughtered and drug-world rivals being dismembered, skinned and dangled from bridges as cartel factions fought each other while buying police protection.

            Testimony also aired a secondhand claim that Calderón, the former president, sought to shield Guzmán against a major rival; Calderón called the allegation “absurd” and “an absolute lie.”

            García Luna was arrested after allegations of his alleged graft emerged at Guzman’s high-profile trial about four years ago in the same New York courthouse.

            The former lawman also faces various Mexican arrest warrants and charges relating to government technology contracts, prison contracting and the bungled U.S. “Fast and Furious” investigation into suspicions that guns were illegally making their way from the U.S. to Mexican drug cartels. The Mexican government has also filed a civil suit against García Luna and his alleged associates and businesses in Florida, seeking to recover $700 million that Mexico claims he garnered through corruption.

            Anticorruption activists gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate Tuesday's verdict. 

            “My country is a grave. It’s now a cemetery ... thanks to the corruption,” said Carmen Paes, who blamed drug lords in her native Mexico for the disappearance of a nephew decades ago.

            Associated Press writer María Verza contributed from Mexico City.NEW YORK (AP) — A former Mexican presidential cabinet member was convicted in the U.S. on Tuesday of taking massive bribes to protect the violent drug cartels he was tasked with combating.Under tight security, an anonymous New York federal court jury deliberated for three days before reaching a verdict in the drug trafficking case against ex-Public Security Secretary Genaro García Luna.He is the highest-ranking current or former Mexican official ever to be tried in the United States.“García Luna, who once stood at the pinnacle of law enforcement in Mexico, will now live the rest of his days having been revealed as a traitor to his country and to the honest members of law enforcement who risked their lives to dismantle drug cartels,” Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement.García Luna, who denied the allegations, headed Mexico’s federal police and was later the country's top public safety official from 2006 to 2012. His lawyers said the charges were based on lies from criminals who wanted to punish his drug-fighting efforts and to get sentencing breaks for themselves by helping prosecutors.He showed no apparent reaction on hearing the verdict. His lawyer, César de Castro, said that the defense planned to appeal and that the case lacked “credible and reliable evidence.”""The government was forced to settle for a case built on the backs of some of the most notorious and ruthless criminals to have testified in this courthouse,” de Castro said outside court.García Luna, 54, was convicted on charges that include engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. He faces at least 20 years and as much as life in prison at his sentencing, set for June 27.The case had political ramifications on both sides of the border.Current Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has railed throughout the trial against ex-President Felipe Calderón’s administration for, at a minimum, putting García Luna in charge of Mexico’s security. López Obrador spokesperson Jesús Ramírez tweeted after the verdict that “justice has come” to a Calderón ally and that “the crimes committed against our people will never be forgotten.”García Luna's work also introduced him to high-level American politicians and other officials, who considered him a key cartel-fighting partner as Washington embarked on a $1.6 billion push to beef up Mexican law enforcement and stem the flow of drugs.The Americans weren’t accused of wrongdoing, and although suspicions long swirled around García Luna, the trial didn’t delve into the extent of U.S. officials’ knowledge about them before his 2019 arrest. López Obrador has, however, pointedly suggested that Washington investigate its own law enforcement and intelligence officials who worked with García Luna during Calderón’s administration.A roster of ex-smugglers and former Mexican officials testified that García Luna took millions of dollars in cartel cash, met with major traffickers in settings ranging from a country house to a car wash and kept law enforcement at bay.He was “the best investment they had,” said Sergio “El Grande” Villarreal Barragan, a former federal police officer who worked for cartels on the side and later as his main job.He and other witnesses said that on García Luna’s watch, police tipped off traffickers about upcoming raids, ensured that cocaine could pass freely through the country, colluded with cartels to raid rivals, and did other favors. One ex-smuggler said García Luna shared a document that reflected U.S. law enforcement’s information about a huge cocaine shipment that was seized in Mexico around 2007.One ex-smuggler, Óscar “El Lobo” Nava Valencia, said he personally heard García Luna and a then-top police official say they would “stand with us” during a meeting with notorious Sinaloa cocaine cartel kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman’s associates amid a cartel civil war. That sit-down alone cost the drug gang $3 million, Nava Valencia said.García Luna didn’t testify at the trial, although his wife took the stand in an apparent effort to portray their assets in Mexico as legitimately acquired and upper-middle-class, but not lavish. The couple moved to Miami in 2012, when the Mexican administration changed and he became a consultant on security issues.The trial was peppered with glimpses of such narco-extravagances as a private zoo with a lion, a hippo, white tigers and more.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817588,Cyclone Freddy's battering winds make landfall in Madagascar,"ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) — A slightly weakened Tropical Cyclone Freddy made landfall Tuesday on the east coast of Madagascar, with schools, businesses and public transportation shut down as strong winds and rain lashed the island.

            The cyclone packed winds gusting to 180 kilometers per hour (about 111 mph), with waves higher than 15 meters (about 49 feet) battering the coast. The storm was already blamed for at least one death, a 27-year-old man who drowned near the port of Mahanoro, the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management reported.

            “There is rain, but the worst thing is the wind. It blows a lot. We haven’t seen if there’s any damage yet because we’re locked in. We stocked up on vegetables, rice, and oil,” Gérard, a restaurant owner and resident of Nosy Varika, a commune in northern Mananjary, said. 











            “We put all our things up high and left the house this afternoon as it is by the river. The children, the women and the old, like me, we went to more secure houses with a member of our family,” said Gerard, who like many on the island goes by a single name.

            Freddy was striking with the force of a Category 3 hurricane on an island already battered in January by Tropical Storm Cheneso, which killed at least 30 people. Madagascar’s National Office for Risk and Disaster Management prepared food rations and mapped distribution for regions expected to be affected by the cyclone this week.

            The disaster office also secured schools and public buildings, which were converted to temporary storm shelters for residents evacuated from flood-prone areas.

            Meteo-France, the French national meteorological service, said Freddy was following the same path as Cyclone Batsirai, another deadly storm that ravaged Madagascar one year ago. Batsirai and another cyclone, Emnati, killed more than 200 people and affected 460,000 during last year's cyclone season.

            “There are some violent winds. These are less strong than what was forecast in advance,"" Nahdi Hasinjatovo, of the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management, said. He said about 5,000 people in the districts of Ifanadiana, Nosy Varika and Mananjary have been moved to shelters.

            Five regions and four districts on the East Coast and Southeast Madagascar have been placed on red alert by the weather directorate.

            “We fled the cyclone, and we asked the nuns to welcome us because our house is not solid,"" said Christophine Boetia, of Mananjary, a port city of about 25,000 people.

            ""There is no one on the streets anymore. We have been preparing for two days reinforcing the roofs of houses by placing sandbags on them. Currently, the wind is blowing a lot and the electricity has been cut,” Zaonarivelo, another resident, said.

            The humanitarian charity Save the Children projected that Freddy could affect more than 2 million people, including 1 million children. The United Nations' humanitarian office estimated the cyclone will affect more than 3 million people in its path, including mainland Africa, where it is expected to dissipate over the weekend.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817591,Germany eyes tax credits for renewable energy companies,"BERLIN (AP) — A senior German government official is proposing U.S.-style tax credits to boost companies involved in shifting the country's economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels.

            Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Germany and Europe as a whole need to strengthen the production capacity for clean energy, which would also lower electricity prices and help it compete with global rivals.

            “This is important if the energy transition is to succeed and to safeguard jobs and value creation in Germany and Europe,” he said.











            
                European governments fear that huge incentives offered to clean tech companies through the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act could lure manufacturers across the Atlantic.

            There are also concerns that Europe is too dependent on China for supplies of key components needed for renewable energy production, such as solar panels.

            As part of its climate plan the German government wants 80% of the country's gross electricity to come from renewable energy by 2030, despite rising demand. This means roughly doubling Germany's current production of wind and solar power.

            Habeck plans to promote the transition away from fossil fuels with a visit Wednesday to the coal-mining Lausitz region, south of Berlin, that is seeking government help to become a hub for renewable energy.BERLIN (AP) — A senior German government official is proposing U.S.-style tax credits to boost companies involved in shifting the country's economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels.Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Germany and Europe as a whole need to strengthen the production capacity for clean energy, which would also lower electricity prices and help it compete with global rivals.“This is important if the energy transition is to succeed and to safeguard jobs and value creation in Germany and Europe,” he said.European governments fear that huge incentives offered to clean tech companies through the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act could lure manufacturers across the Atlantic.There are also concerns that Europe is too dependent on China for supplies of key components needed for renewable energy production, such as solar panels.As part of its climate plan the German government wants 80% of the country's gross electricity to come from renewable energy by 2030, despite rising demand.

            The Clark County coroner said a cause and manner of Rebels defensive lineman Ryan Keeler's death was pending following his death on Monday. Medical examiner blood toxicology test results can take several weeks.

            Las Vegas police Officer Robert Wicks said an investigation of Keeler's unexpected death remained open pending coroner and detective findings. Wicks said the call was initially handled as a medical call.











            UNLV head coach Barry Odom announced Keeler's death on Monday, saying that since the 6-foot-6, 275-pound defensive lineman arrived by transfer from Rutgers University, he stood out to coaches as ""an incredible person, student and teammate.”

            Keeler played in seven games as a redshirt freshman last season, and he made the academic All-Mountain West team with a 3.8 grade-point average, Odom said.

            UNLV was waiting for more information about Keeler's death, Rebels football spokesman Mark Wallington said. A memorial service was not immediately scheduled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817596,Israel sentences Islamic Jihad member to 22 months in prison,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli military said Tuesday it has sentenced a member of the Islamic Jihad militant group to 22 months in prison after his arrest helped spark three days of heavy fighting in Gaza last year. 

            Bassam al-Saadi's sentence was handed down as part of a plea deal that included suspending an additional sentence and ordering al-Saadi to pay compensation, the army said in a statement. Al-Saadi he had been convicted for illegal association, incitement and impersonation.

            The statement said al-Saadi, 62 at the time of his arrest, worked with other suspects to advance the group's activities “within its student wing” by receiving funding from an Islamic Jihad operative in Gaza. He was arrested in August during a nighttime raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin.











            Palestinians frequently agree to plea deals in Israel, where, critics say, the courts often rely on secret evidence presented by security officials.

            Islamic Jihad had demanded al-Saadi's release. The group is sponsored by Iran and has carried out scores of deadly attacks over the years targeting Israeli civilians. It operates in both the occupied West Bank and Gaza.

            Israel said the group had been planning a revenge attack from Gaza. In response to what it said was an imminent threat, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes in Gaza that killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander. The militants began launching hundreds of rockets at Israel hours later.

            The flare-up left 49 Palestinians dead, including the militant group’s top two commanders and 10 other fighters, before the cease-fire took effect. Gazan militants fired some 1,100 rockets, but no one on the Israeli side was killed or seriously wounded.

            Al-Saadi spent a total of 15 years over several stints in Israeli jails for being an Islamic Jihad member. Israel killed two of his sons, who were also Islamic Jihad militants, in separate incidents in 2002, and destroyed his home during a fierce battle in Jenin that year.

            Israeli forces have carried out regular operations into Jenin in recent months that the military says are aimed at dismantling militant networks in the wake of several deadly attacks inside Israel. The raids often ignite gunbattles with Palestinian militants.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — The Israeli military said Tuesday it has sentenced a member of the Islamic Jihad militant group to 22 months in prison after his arrest helped spark three days of heavy fighting in Gaza last year.Bassam al-Saadi's sentence was handed down as part of a plea deal that included suspending an additional sentence and ordering al-Saadi to pay compensation, the army said in a statement.

The militants began launching hundreds of rockets at Israel hours later.The flare-up left 49 Palestinians dead, including the militant group’s top two commanders and 10 other fighters, before the cease-fire took effect. Gazan militants fired some 1,100 rockets, but no one on the Israeli side was killed or seriously wounded.Al-Saadi spent a total of 15 years over several stints in Israeli jails for being an Islamic Jihad member. Israel killed two of his sons, who were also Islamic Jihad militants, in separate incidents in 2002, and destroyed his home during a fierce battle in Jenin that year.Israeli forces have carried out regular operations into Jenin in recent months that the military says are aimed at dismantling militant networks in the wake of several deadly attacks inside Israel. The raids often ignite gunbattles with Palestinian militants.",2023/2/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817597,MLS expands playoffs to 9 teams from each conference,"Major League Soccer is expanding its playoffs to include the nine top finishers from each of its two conferences, 62% of the league's teams.

            An opening “wild-card” round will feature matches between the eighth- and ninth-seeded teams in the Eastern and Western conferences at the stadium of the higher seed.

            The first round will be a best-of-three series, with the top finisher in each conference facing the winner of the wild-card match. The second seed will play the seventh, No. 3 will play No. 6 and No. 4 will play No. 5. The higher seed will host first, with the series moving to the lower seed for the second game, and then back to the higher seed's home, if necessary.











            If the first round matches are tied at the end of regulation, the game will go directly to a penalty shootout. 

            The conference semifinals, finals and MLS Cup championship will all be single games, hosted by the higher seed. For the final three rounds, tied matches will go to extra time before penalties. 

            Seattle Sounders coach Brian Schmetzer said Tuesday he hadn't looked closely at the playoff changes so he couldn't comment in detail, but understood that Apple TV+, the league's new broadcaster, wanted more postseason games. 

            However, Schmetzer was clear about wanting playoff games to be single elimination: “I like one and done. I am a one-and-done type of guy.”

            LA Galaxy coach Greg Vanney said with the new playoff format, as well as the expanded Leagues Cup competition that included all the MLS and Liga MX teams for the first time, clubs will have a heavier load this season. 

            “In any of the tournaments, whether it’s Open Cup, or Leagues Cup or you go relatively deep in the playoffs, you’re certainly going to be (at) 50-plus games and that type of scenario,"" Vanney said. ""And that’s significantly more than what teams, I think, have generally endured. You’ve seen more from teams that are in Champions League -- and we have teams in Champions League as well -- so it’s a heavy lift.""

            Philadelphia Union coach Jim Curtin was asked about the possibility of an expanded playoff earlier this month, when reports surfaced that more teams would make the cut. Philadelphia played in the MLS Cup final last season, falling to LAFC on penalties after a 3-3 draw. 

            “I can say from the last two years, I think they've been two of the most exciting playoff series we've had as a league, and that's the one difficult thing to move away from now,” Curtin said. “But this is pro sports, and it's certainly bigger than any team or any silly coach's idea, so whatever happens we'll be prepared.”

            In the previous format, only the top seven teams from each conference made the playoffs. The top seeds each had a first-round bye to the conference semifinals.

            Decision Day, the final day of the regular season, is set for Oct. 21, with the wild-card round scheduled for Oct. 25-26. The MLS Cup final will be played on Dec. 9.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817598,"New emergency bid to appeal, block huge Nevada lithium mine","RENO, Nev. (AP) — Conservationists are seeking an emergency court order to block construction of a Nevada lithium mine after a U.S. judge directed a federal agency to revisit part of its approval of the plans but allowed construction to go forward in the meantime.

            Four environmental groups want U.S. District Judge Miranda Du in Reno to temporarily halt any work at a subsidiary of Lithium Americas’ mine near the Oregon border until they can appeal her ruling earlier this month to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

            They filed on Tuesday a formal notice of their intent to appeal to the San Francisco-based circuit court and an emergency motion for injunction in Reno pending the appeal. An Oregon tribe that filed a new, separate lawsuit to block the mine last week joined the notice of appeal.











            “This mine should not be allowed to destroy public land unless and until the Ninth Circuit has determined whether it was legally approved,” said Talasi Brooks, a lawyer for the Western Watersheds Project.

            Du gave the U.S. Bureau of Land Management until the end of Wednesday to respond to the motion or reach an agreement with the conservation groups to postpone any construction until she rules on their request for an emergency injunction.

            “Based on the urgency implied by environmental plaintiffs' representation that Lithium Nevada intends to start construction on February 27 ... the court sets an expedited briefing schedule,” she wrote in a brief order late Tuesday.

            The company said last week that construction at the Thacker Pass Lithium Mine was “imminent” after Du ruled Feb. 6 the bureau had acted legally — with one possible exception — when it approved plans for the mine in January 2021.

            A spokesperson for Lithium Americas said Tuesday they were confident the appellate court would uphold the project's approval.

            “Since we began this project more than a decade ago, we have been committed to doing things right,"" Tim Crowley, the company spokesperson, said in an email to The Associated Press. ""The recent U.S. District Court ruling definitively supported BLM’s consultation process, and we are confident the ruling will be upheld.”

            Du’s earlier ruling was the latest in a series of high-stakes legal battles pitting environmentalists against so-called “green energy” projects the Biden administration is pushing over the objections of conservation groups, tribes and others.

            The White House says the mine planned by Lithium Nevada Corp., a subsidiary of Lithium Americas, is critical to ramped-up efforts to produce raw materials for electric vehicle batteries. Opponents say it would harm wildlife habitats, degrade groundwater and pollute the air.

            “It symbolizes BLM’s wrecking ball approach to 'green’ energy on public lands,” Katie Fite of WildLands Defense said Tuesday.

            Du ordered the bureau Feb. 6 to go back and determine whether the company had established valid mining rights on 1,300 acres (526 hectares) of neighboring land, where it plans to bury millions of tons of waste rock that would be removed from the open pit mine deeper than the length of a football field.

            But she stopped short of granting the opponents' request at that time to block any work at the site until the validity of the claim was established under the Mining Law of 1872 on the adjacent lands about 200 miles (322 kilometers) northeast of Reno.

            “There's no evidence that Lithium Nevada will be able to establish valid mining claims to lands it plans to bury in waste rock and tailings, but the damage will be done regardless,” Brooks said in a statement Tuesday announcing the filing of the emergency request for an injunction.

            Du said in her Feb. 6 ruling it was a rare instance where it was proper to stop short of vacating an agency's approval of an overall project to allow the bureau to re-examine the adequacy of one element of the plan — the disposal of the waste rock.

            She made clear her ruling incorporates part of a recent ruling by the 9th Circuit in a fight over the 1872 law in an Arizona case that could prove more onerous to mining companies that want to dispose of their waste on neighboring federal lands.

            In that case, the San Francisco-based appellate court upheld an Arizona ruling that the Forest Service lacked authority to approve Rosemont Copper’s plans to dispose of waste rock on land adjacent to the mine it wanted to dig on a national forest southeast of Tucson. The service and the Bureau of Land Management long have interpreted the mining law to convey the same mineral rights to such lands.

            
                General Motors Co. announced Jan. 31 it had conditionally agreed to invest $650 million in Lithium Americas in a deal that will give the company exclusive access to the first phase of the Thacker Pass mine. The equity investment in two phases was contingent on the project clearing legal challenges in court in Reno.

            Lithium Americas said last week that Du's Feb. 6 ruling satisfied the completion of the first phase and that as a result, GM had purchased 15 million common shares of Lithium Americas at $21.24 per share on Feb. 16 for a total of $320 million.

            Lithium Americas estimates that the mine can support production of up to 1 million electric vehicles annually. The company expects production to begin in the second half of 2026.

            In the Feb. 6 ruling, Du also denied for the third time relief sought by Native American tribes who argued it could destroy a sacred site where their ancestors were massacred in 1865. Last week, three tribes filed a separate lawsuit claiming that the bureau has misrepresented its claims that it's met its legal obligation to consult with tribes about potential impacts to historical and cultural values near the mine site.RENO, Nev.

            Her onslaught in England's final group game against Pakistan, combined with 59 off 33 from opener Danni Wyatt and 47 off 31 from Amy Jones, set up a score of 213-5 at Newlands in Cape Town.

            England won by 114 runs, another record for the T20 World Cup, as Pakistan labored to 99-9 in its 20 overs.











            Apart from giving England a major confidence boost, the huge victory ensured it qualified top of Group 2 with four wins from four and avoided defending champion and top-ranked Australia in the semifinals.

            England had already qualified for the semis but will now play South Africa on Friday after the host kept its nerve to beat Bangladesh by 10 wickets later Tuesday and make sure it is part of the last four. South Africa would have been out with a loss.

            Australia faces India in the first semifinal on Thursday. Both the semis are at Newlands, as is the World Cup final on Sunday.

            Sciver-Brunt collected 12 fours and a six in her innings, propelling England to the best batting performance at a T20 World Cup and overtaking South Africa's 195-3 against Thailand at the 2020 tournament.

            Pakistan was no match, with No. 9 Tuba Hassan top-scoring with 28. By the time she came to the crease, Pakistan was 54-7 in the 13th over and out of it.

            South Africa had won nine of its 10 previous meetings with Bangladesh but was burdened by the pressure of possibly going out early in its home tournament having already surprisingly lost the opening game to Sri Lanka.

            The South Africans managed to handle that pressure and put themselves in control with a tight bowling display that kept Bangladesh to 113-6 in its 20 overs.

            Opening batters Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits took South Africa sailing home with an opening partnership of 117 in 17.5 overs.

            Wolvaardt finished 66 not out and ended the game by driving back-to-back fours through the off-side. Brits was 50 not out.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817602,Arkansas officer involved in violent arrest back on the job,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — An Arkansas law enforcement officer who held down a man while two others beat him during an arrest recorded on video is back on the job after he did not face any criminal charges.

            Mulberry Police Officer Thell Riddle was reinstated and returned to work Friday, Chief Shannon Gregory confirmed Tuesday. The decision came after a state prosecutor last week said she wouldn't be charging him and a federal grand jury earlier declined to indict him.

            A bystander used a cellphone to record Riddle and two former Crawford County sheriff's deputies during the Aug. 21 arrest of Randal Worcester in the small town of Mulberry, about 140 miles (220 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock, near the border with Oklahoma. 











            A federal grand jury last month charged King and White with civil rights violations.

The grand jury did not charge Riddle, who has been with the Mulberry Police Department since 2017. 

            The state also has been investigating, but special prosecutor Emily White said in a letter dated Feb. 15 that she would not pursue any charges against Riddle. White said the investigation against former deputies Zack King and Levi White remained open.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817603,ESPN's ex-top exec describes how soccer's World Cup was lost,"NEW YORK (AP) — A former ESPN executive underscored how big money corrupted soccer, testifying in U.S. District Court on Tuesday that his company's bid to televise the World Cup might have been sabotaged by two former Fox executives accused of bribing officials to undermine competing offers.

            ESPN's former president, John Skipper, told a federal court in New York that ESPN and Univision had jointly bid $900 million — with $400 million from ESPN — for broadcasting rights to the two most recent World Cups, including the recently completed one in Qatar.

            Prosecutors allege inside information helped Fox secure U.S. English-language rights to the tournament from FIFA.











            Government lawyers say millions of dollars in bribes fed a system of clandestine, no-bid contracts that allowed corrupt soccer executives to profit from the scheme and ultimately allowed Fox to air the matches.

            New York-based Fox Corp., which split from a subsidiary of international channels during a restructuring in 2019, has denied any involvement in the bribery scandal and is not a defendant in the case.

            The company said in a statement that it has cooperated fully.

            Prosecutors allege the payoffs enabled the former Fox executives — Hernan Lopez and Carlos Martinez — to get confidential information from high-ranking soccer officials, including those at FIFA. The information helped Fox secure the U.S. English-language rights with a $425 million bid. Telemundo, a division of Comcast Corp.’s NBCUniversal, won U.S. Spanish-language rights for about $600 million.

            “I was disappointed,” Skipper said. “In fact, I was angry.”

            Skipper said he had assumed the highest bidder would prevail, but the process turned increasingly complicated when ESPN's offer was turned down and soccer officials opened a second round of bidding.

            Under questioning from a defense attorney, Skipper acknowledged that he did not know if anything illegal was going on behind the scenes. 

            The trial is the latest development in a tangled corruption scandal that dates back nearly a decade and has ensnared more than three dozen media and soccer executives as well as associates.

            Skipper's testimony was meant to corroborate statements by the government's star witness, Alejandro Burzaco, who testified over 11 days that he and the former Fox executives conspired to bribe South American soccer officials for TV rights to the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest annual tournament, the Copa Libertadores, and help land broadcasting rights to the World Cup, the sport’s most lucrative competition.

            Lawyers for Lopez and Martinez have asserted that the former executives are being framed, with one defense lawyer accusing Burzaco of masterminding the bribes. 

            Burzaco is a former business partner of Lopez and Martinez, and headed an Argentinian marketing firm. He has cooperated in previous soccer corruption investigations since being arrested in 2015 in a bribery case. Critics contend he's cooperating to avoid prison.

            Burzaco has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other charges. He testified in 2017 that all three South Americans on the FIFA executive council took million-dollar bribes to support Qatar’s bid to host the 2022 World Cup.

            Skipper said ESPN initially bid $250 million in 2011 for U.S. English-language rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The company upped that to $400 million in a second round. Coupled with Univision's proposed contribution, the total came to $900 million.

            “We wanted to blow the bid away,” he said.

            ESPN held U.S. broadcasting rights for the World Cup from 1994 until 2014, first airing soccer's premier sporting event before it caught on with U.S. audiences. FIFA previously had to buy air time to get the tournament broadcast in the country.

            As the sport's audience grew, so did the World Cup's financial cachet.

            ESPN paid $100 million for the rights to broadcast the sporting event in 2010 and 2014.

            The dramatic hike spoke to the sporting event's increasing importance, Skipper said.

            December's World Cup final in Qatar, where Argentina prevailed over France in a dramatic title-clinching shootout, was the most-watched soccer match in the United States, according to television audience estimates.

            As a courtesy for helping FIFA develop a rise in soccer viewership, Skipper had hoped soccer officials would allow ESPN to match or beat competitors' proposals but was not approached to do so.

            So far, more than two dozen people have pleaded guilty and two people have been convicted at trial in connection with a U.S.-led investigation into tens of millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks at soccer’s highest levels. Four corporate entities have also pleaded guilty. Four other companies were charged but reached agreements with the government to avoid prosecution.

            Soccer governing body, FIFA, has said it was not involved in any fraud or conspiracies and was a mere bystander as the scandal unfolded.

            Nevertheless, the scandal thrust the organization under worldwide scrutiny.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817604,"Stanton could play some in right at home, with Judge in left","TAMPA, Fla, (AP) — Giancarlo Stanton may play right field at times in New York Yankees' home games this year and Aaron Judge could be shifted to the more spacious left field in the Bronx.

            “I think I have more of a flow when I'm in the outfield,” Stanton said Tuesday after the Yankees' second full-squad workout. “Being in the outfield, you're kind of more engaged in the game whereas DH you're inside a lot of the time staying warm and hitting, and kind of watching the game from the TV as opposed to being out more engaged.”

            Gold Glove winner Harrison Bader, acquired at last year’s trade deadline, figures to get the bulk of the starts in center.











            “If we need to put Big G in right field at Yankee Stadium, move me to left, I don't mind it,"" Judge said. ""I don't mind switching around, so we can have Bader, me and the Big G out there. We'll get some (game) reps hopefully at spring training and be comfortable out there.”

            Judge played 78 games in center last year and 73 in right. He hasn't played left field since 2016 at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

            “I'm open to things like that, especially in the home ballpark,” Boone said. “We'll just see how that goes in letting that play out. No decision on that yet but it's on my board.”

            Stanton has battled a variety of injuries in four of his five seasons with New York . He was acquired from Miami following a 59-homer season in 2017 with the Marlins.

            Stanton has topped 30 homers three times since but was been limited to 18 games in 2019 and 110 last year. The closest he's come to 59 homers with the Yankees was 38 during his inital season with New York.

            Stanton played 34 games in right last season and four in left — all on the road. He didn't play the outfield after July 21, soon before he went on the injured list with left Achilles tendinitis.

            “You've got to stay healthy, you've got to stay out there,” Stanton said. “You've got be in a good rhythm throughout the months.”

            Stanton still connected for 31 homers and drove in 78 runs during his injury-impacted season last year.

            “He's capable of putting up massive numbers,"" Boone said. That's absolutely still in there.”

            The Yankees haven't reached the World Series since winning the 2009 title. They kept Judge with a $360 million, nine-year contract and added left-hander Carlos Rodón with a $162 million, six-year deal.

            “We have all the pieces to get it done,” Stanton said. “We're laying the foundation, and understand the ultimate goal is a championship and we haven't got there.""

            The 33-year-old Stanton admits pressure has increased to win his first World Series ring.

            “I need to get it, but at the same time we need to get it done,” Stanton said. “That's what I came here for, and that's what I'm here to achieve every year.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817606,Party animal becomes legendary Carnival parade director,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Few Brazilians can claim to dominate their field as much, and at such a young age, as the 39-year-old Carnival showman Leandro Vieira. 

            Vieira has become one of the most decorated leaders of the annual parade competition in Rio de Janeiro. This year, as Carnival director of a samba school that hasn’t won in more than two decades, he could cement his name as one of the greatest since the festivities kicked off almost 100 years ago.

            Rio’s is the nation’s premier Carnival parade, and the contestants compete for money prizes, prestige and fandom. 











            Vieira’s job includes helping to pick his samba school’s theme for the year, its material for costumes and who will feature on the top of majestic floats. Ultimately he decides how his school spends about 10 million Brazilian reals (almost $2 million).

            Vieira’s prestige as an artist — and his fame as a party animal — has stretched well beyond Rio, achieving the kind of celebrity a film director might gain. He was recently interviewed on Roda Viva, a public TV traditional program that often listens to the most respected Brazilians. 

            He is a fixture not only in Carnival's formal parade competitions, but of the informal block parties throughout the city at this time of year.

            “I can’t just work, I need to feel Carnival on the street to be happy,” Vieira told The Associated Press in an interview. “Even more so after a pandemic that made us suffer so much, made us stay home in 2021.""

            Vieira’s job title is carnavalesco. 

            He did it for Mangueira, the most popular samba school in Brazil, where he won the parade titles in 2016 and 2019. Later, he lifted two trophies in the second division, which makes him one of the most successful in recent years.

            This year he is carnavalesco for Imperatriz Leopoldinense — named after a former Empress of Brazil — which recently was relegated to second division and where he hopes to earn the school's first trophy since 2001.

            Vieira says he does not aim merely to shock or thrill an audience, but rather to deliver thoughtful statements.

            “I am not a carnavalesco of surprises. I am not a man of spectacles,” Vieira said in the interview while he simultaneously worked on his group’s radio equipment that they will use to communicate during their parade.

            His school's parade this year focused on the life of 1920s and 30s bandit Virgulino Ferreira da Silva, better known by Brazilians as Lampião. Vieira says he picks his themes with one motto in mind: “It is the history that official history doesn’t tell.""

            Lampião, for example, was not portrayed by the samba school solely as a vicious criminal but also as a brave man who earned the respect of many fellow Brazilians.

            Ahead of this year's parade, Vieira walked through the performers fixing costumes and adjusting details with a smile on his face. He made sure all members were doing their part to sing this year’s theme music — a detail that can make a difference with the judges who sit in the audience in Rio’s Sambadrome.

            A key choice for Imperatriz Leopoldinense this year was who to appoint as queen of the drum section — a role that the school traditionally has given to celebrities and fashion models. Last year it was pop singer Iza.

            This time Vieira helped give the nod to a 21-year-old communications student and dancer named Maria Mariá who is from one of Rio’s low-income favela neighborhoods. She was crowned during an emotional ceremony last December at the samba school’s headquarters with a headpiece designed by Vieira.

            “Leandro is a big inspiration to us all. He shows us we can be the best in any field we like,” Mariá said Tuesday while dressed as a devil who teases the character of Lampião.

            Vieira takes his role in the Carnival parade industry seriously, but says that taking part in the holiday’s street parties is just as important for him. Earlier in the week he joined the Prata Preta street party wearing the costume of Brazilian singer Gal Costa, who died last year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817618,Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar back in concussion protocol,"CENTENNIAL, Colo. (AP) — Colorado Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar is back in concussion protocol after taking contact to his head for a second time in under two weeks, another blow for the defending Stanley Cup champions and their reigning playoff MVP.

            Coach Jared Bednar provided the update on Makar's status Tuesday, ruling out the 24-year-old Norris Trophy and Conn Smythe Trophy winner for at least the team's next two games Friday and Saturday.

            Makar was reinjured early in the third period Saturday in his first game back when St. Louis forward Alexey Toropchenko made contact with his head. He already missed Colorado's game Sunday against Edmonton.











            Bednar said Makar's head injuries were “obviously related” and did not think the play Saturday alone would have caused this development.

            Makar had been out since taking a hit to the head on Feb. 7 from Pittsburgh's Jeff Carter. Bednar said Makar passed all the NHL's concussion testing to clear protocol and told team medical staff that he felt good about returning.

            “He comes back in, he feels better, he takes the time he needs, he’s feeling good to play, he’s passed all the tests, he comes back in and he gets bumped again,” Bednar said. “I don’t think that he goes into protocol on the hit in St. Louis with the glove to the face on any other occasion, likely, except for the fact that he’s just coming out of one.”

            Makar missed four games last month with an unrelated lower-body injury before coming back before the All-Star break. Makar this season is averaging a league-high 26:57 of ice time and producing at a nearly point-a-game level with 13 goals and 32 assists.

            Bednar defended the league's concussion protocol and how the Avalanche handled it with Makar when asked repeatedly on Tuesday.

            “We follow it,” He said. “It’s crystal clear. There’s really no wiggle room in it. Sometimes players get delayed symptoms. He came in the other night and he had a headache and some pressure in his head, and that’s all we have to hear and he’s out. It’s automatic.”

            Bednar confirmed Makar was pulled from the Feb. 7 game against the Penguins by a concussion spotter in place to observe obvious signs of head injuries. NHL protocol also calls for mandatory baseline testing and six stages of progression a player needs to pass through before getting back on the ice in a game.

            “We listen to the player once all the tests are passed,” Bednar said. “The protocol’s in place because they deem it the best protocol to make sure players are safe and able or unable to return to play. And when they are able, then they will return to play.”

            Goaltender Alexandar Georgiev missed practice to undergo dental work and is expected to be full go Thursday, according to Bednar, who also said defenseman Josh Manson was out for maintenance reasons. Bednar said veteran defenseman Erik Johnson is “possibly” done for the season because of a broken ankle.

            The Avalanche have been one of the most banged-up teams in the league this season, missing Makar, top center Nathan MacKinnon and others for long stretches. Captain Gabriel Landeskog, who hoisted the Cup last summer to celebrate the franchise's third championship, still has not made his season debut following knee surgery in October.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsCENTENNIAL, Colo. (AP) — Colorado Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar is back in concussion protocol after taking contact to his head for a second time in under two weeks, another blow for the defending Stanley Cup champions and their reigning playoff MVP.Coach Jared Bednar provided the update on Makar's status Tuesday, ruling out the 24-year-old Norris Trophy and Conn Smythe Trophy winner for at least the team's next two games Friday and Saturday.Makar was reinjured early in the third period Saturday in his first game back when St. Louis forward Alexey Toropchenko made contact with his head. He already missed Colorado's game Sunday against Edmonton.Bednar said Makar's head injuries were “obviously related” and did not think the play Saturday alone would have caused this development.Makar had been out since taking a hit to the head on Feb. 7 from Pittsburgh's Jeff Carter.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817622,Jimmy Carter enters hospice care. What is it?,"Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter entered home hospice care in Plains, Georgia, after a series of short hospital stays.

            The Carter Center said in a statement Saturday that Carter, 98, “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.”

            WHAT IS HOSPICE CARE?











            Hospice care is treatment designed to make patients comfortable and to reduce pain and suffering in their final days. It is usually home-based, but can also be provided in nursing homes, hospitals and hospice centers. It is reserved for those declared by two physicians to be terminally ill, with six months or less to live.

            The average time spent in hospice is about three weeks, said Dr. Arif Kamal, chief patient officer at the American Cancer Society.

            HOW ARE HOSPICE PATIENTS CARED FOR?

            Care may include medicine, but only to reduce symptoms, not with the intent to cure any illness.

            Patients are typically cared for by family members, with supervision from hospice doctors, nurses and social workers. Much of the focus is on making sure family caretakers feels supported, Kamal said.

            The team “addresses everything from physical symptoms to emotional distress, helping think through logistics related to burials, wills and advanced care planning,” he said.

            WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR HOSPICE CARE?

            Under Medicare rules, patients may enroll in hospice if they meet certain criteria depending on their illness. For example, cancer patients must be unable to perform at least two usual activities of daily living without help, such as eating or dressing, with other challenges that may include evidence that the disease has spread widely and their health is declining despite treatment.

            It is unclear what led to Carter’s decision to enter hospice care, but within the past several years he has been treated for metastatic skin cancer and for injuries from falls.

            Modeled after U.K. programs, the hospice movement got its start in the United States in the late 1970s during Carter’s presidency.Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter entered home hospice care in Plains, Georgia, after a series of short hospital stays.The Carter Center said in a statement Saturday that Carter, 98, “decided to spend his remaining time at home with his family and receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention.”WHAT IS HOSPICE CARE?Hospice care is treatment designed to make patients comfortable and to reduce pain and suffering in their final days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817625,Chicago man convicted of shooting Iowa deputy during robbery,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — A Chicago man was convicted Tuesday of shooting and seriously wounding an Iowa sheriff's deputy during a robbery at a convenience store in 2021.

            Stanley Donahue, 38, was convicted of several charges, including attempted murder, stemming from the shooting in Coggon, a town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of Cedar Rapids.

            Prosecutors said Donahue robbed two employees at a Casey's store and confined them in a cooler before shooting Linn County deputy Will Halverson seven times on June 20, 2021. 











            Halverson was seriously injured but has returned to work. He testified during the trial that Donahue was the man who shot him. 

            As he was being led from the courtroom on Tuesday, Donahue looked at Halverson and his family and said “It should of been worse than what it was,"" followed by an expletive, The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported. 

            Donahue fled after the shooting and was later arrested after a more than 12-hour manhunt that ended when he was spotted by a television news crew. 

            During the trial County Attorney Nick Maybacks argued it was clear Donahue meant to kill Halverson. 

            Donahue’s attorney argued DNA was inconclusive and did not rule out the possibility of other suspects. 

            Donahue faces up to 112 years in prison at sentencing. He was convicted of attempted murder, two counts of first-degree robbery, willful injury, attempt to elude, trafficking stolen weapons, disarming a peace officer, being a felon in possession of firearm and two counts of false imprisonment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817627,US to limit asylum to migrants who pass through a 3rd nation,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration said Tuesday that it will generally deny asylum to migrants who show up at the U.S. southern border without first seeking protection in a country they passed through, mirroring an attempt by the Trump administration that never took effect because it was blocked in court.

            
                The measure, while stopping short of a total ban, imposes severe limitations on asylum for any nationality except Mexicans, who don’t have to travel through a third country to reach the U.S.

            The measure is almost certain to face legal challenges. President Donald Trump pursued a similar ban in 2019 but a federal appeals court prevented it from taking effect. 











            The Biden administration rule proposed Tuesday has to first go through a 30-day public comment period before it can be formally adopted. If adopted it would remain in place for two years.

            Administration officials expect the rule will take effect when a pandemic-era rule that denies asylum on grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19 ends. That rule, known as Title 42 authority, is set to expire May 11 but has been delayed twice by legal challenges from Republican-led states.

            The Homeland Security and Justice Departments argued that surging numbers of migrants left them little choice. They anticipate illegal crossings to climb to between 11,000 and 13,000 a day if no action is taken after Title 42 ends; that's even higher than the 8,600 daily crossings in mid-December as anticipation spread among migrants and smugglers that Title 42 was about to end. At the last minute the Supreme Court kept it in place.

            The proposed rule establishes “a rebuttable presumption of asylum ineligibility” for anyone who passes through another country to reach the U.S. border with Mexico without first seeking protection there, according to a notice in the Federal Register. Exceptions will be made for people with an “acute medical emergency,” “imminent and extreme threat” of violent crimes such as murder, rape or kidnapping, being a victim of human trafficking or “other extremely compelling circumstances.” Children traveling alone will also be exempted, according to the rule. 

            The rule largely calls on prospective migrants to follow legal pathways to apply for asylum such as using the CBP One app, through which prospective migrants can schedule an appointment to apply to appear at a border entry point to apply for asylum. The administration portrayed these efforts as a way to protect migrants from the dangerous journeys as they travel north to the U.S. and allow the U.S. border entry points to manage the migrant flows in a “safe and efficient manner.” But critics have said the app has been beset by technical problems and its not clear how many appointments are available every day. 

            U.S. officials insist the measure proposed Tuesday is different from Trump's, largely because there is room for exemptions and because the Biden administration has made other legal pathways available, particularly humanitarian parole for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Ukrainians.

            “We are a nation of immigrants, and we are a nation of laws. We are strengthening the availability of legal, orderly pathways for migrants to come to the United States, at the same time proposing new consequences on those who fail to use processes made available to them by the United States and its regional partners,” said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

            The rule was first mentioned in early January as part of a wider announcement by the administration to let in 30,000 migrants a month from four countries — Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua — provided they apply to come to the U.S. and don't just arrive at the border. In the ensuing weeks, the administration said migrant encounters from those countries plummeted, and they've hailed it as a model for dealing with immigration. 

            But immigration advocates have criticized attempts to limit asylum applications at the southern border, saying some migrants can't wait in their home country and noting that other countries don't have the same asylum protections as the U.S. 

            Four Democratic senators — Bob Menendez and Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California — said they were “deeply disappointed” the administration was moving forward with the rule and urged it to reconsider.

            “We have an obligation to protect vulnerable migrants under domestic and international law and should not leave vulnerable migrants stranded in countries unable to protect them,"" the senators' statement read.

            Anu Joshi of the American Civil Liberties Union, which litigated many of the challenges to Trump's immigration restrictions, sharply criticized the rule, saying it was simply revisiting Trump's asylum ban. 

            The new rule comes as President Joe Biden is facing a Republican-controlled House determined to make immigration a key issue as they attempt to portray the southern border as out of control. 

            For asylum seekers traveling north through Central America and Mexico to the U.S. border, Costa Rica and Mexico have the most robust asylum systems. Both countries, however, have been overwhelmed by the surging number of asylum applications in recent years.

            Costa Rica, a country of only 5 million residents, trailed only the United States, Germany and Mexico in the number of asylum applications it received in 2021. In December, President Rodrigo Chaves decreed changes to the asylum system, alleging that it was being abused by economic migrants.

            Most of those seeking asylum in Costa Rica in recent years are Nicaraguans fleeing repression in that country. In 2012, Costa Rica received barely 900 asylum applications. Last year, the total was around 80,000.

            That has created a tremendous backlog and lengthened the process, something that led more Nicaraguans to look north to the United States last year.

            Mexico has been facing increased asylum applications for years and last year received 118,478, mostly from Honduras, Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela. Many migrants had used the asylum system to legally cross Mexico while in process and then to try to enter the U.S.

            Other countries along the migrant route north have very limited capacity for receiving asylum seekers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817628,"Yes, 'Cocaine Bear' is a real movie. It's also a true story","NEW YORK (AP) — On Dec. 22, 1985, The Associated Press reported the following from Blue Ridge, Georgia: 

            “Investigators searching for cocaine dropped by an airborne smuggler have found a ripped-up shipment of the sweet-smelling powder and the remains of a bear that apparently died of a multimillion-dollar high.”

            Police found a sad scene. A 175-lb. black bear dead near a duffle bag and some $2 million worth of cocaine that had been opened and scattered over a hillside. The parachutist, a former Kentucky narcotics investigator, had fallen to his death in a backyard in Knoxville, Tennessee. His unmanned airplane crashed into a North Carolina mountain. Back in Georgia, the bear, examiners said, had overdosed.











            The story is in many ways too much. Too absurd. Too ’80s. Even the screenwriters of the “Fast & Furious” movies would think it far-fetched. The stranger-than-fiction tale quickly receded from the headlines and, before some began to stoke the myth of “Pablo Escobear,” it mostly stayed buried in news media archives.

            That changed when screenwriter Jimmy Warden delivered to producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller a script titled “Cocaine Bear.” They were on board from page one.

            “When the movie’s pitched, you hear the word ‘Cocaine,’ you’re like I’m not sure what to think of this,” Lord says. “Then when you hear the word ‘Bear,’ you’re like: I’m all in.”

            Yes, “Cocaine Bear” is a real movie. And after it opens in theaters Friday, it might even be a hit. Since the trailer first debuted for Elizabeth Banks’ very, very loosely based-on-a-true-story R-rated comedy has stoked a rabid zeitgeist. At a time when much in Hollywood can feel pre-packaged, the makers of “Cocaine Bear” think it can be an untamed exception.

            “Hopefully the film lives up to the title,” Banks says, smiling. “That was the goal.”

            Little on the movie calendar has captured the public imagination quite like “Cocaine Bear.” Its trailer, watched more than 25 million times, immediately went viral. The movie, itself, is like a meme sprung to life — a kind of spiritual heir to “Snakes on a Plane” crossed with a Paddington Bear fever dream. Everything about it is propelled by a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor and can-you-believe-this-is-a-real-movie wink. “I’m the bear who ate cocaine,” reads one of the film's official tweets. “This is my story.”

            While most studio movies are driven by well-known intellectual property and few original comedies manage to attract audiences in theaters, “Cocaine Bear” is here to strike a blow to business-as-usual in Hollywood. “Cocaine Bear” is here to be bold. “Cocaine Bear” is here to party.

            “You have to demonstrate theatricality to get the greenlight. It just means you have to swing the bat a little harder,” Lord says. “In this world that’s increasingly mechanized, things that don’t feel mechanized have really special value.”

            Miller and Lord have in recent years shepherded some of the most vibrant and irreverent films to the screen, including “The Lego Movie,”“Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and “The Mitchells vs the Machines.” They like to take apart old conventions and give them an absurdist, post-modern spin.

            “Certainly, this movie was not mandated by a corporation,” Miller says, laughing. “It’s a thing we somehow snuck through the system. That’s how we love to make all our movies, like: ‘I can’t believe they let us get away with this.’”

            Warden had been a production assistant on their 2012 action comedy “21 Jump Street."" After hearing about the 1985 story, Warden wrote the script on spec and hoped his old bosses would like it. Intrigued at the screenplay's possibility, the producers found an unexpectedly open reception from Universal Pictures chief Donna Langley.

            “What’s funny is that we thought it would be difficult because of the subject matter. But surprisingly, they were excited right from the jump and didn’t shy away from the movie, its tone or even its title,” says Miller. “We thought at some point, someone was going to say, ‘Well you can’t call it ‘Cocaine Bear.’ You have to call it ‘A Walk in the Woods.’""

            Since her directorial debut in 2015's “Pitch Perfect 2,” Banks has carved out a second career behind the camera. She last helmed 2019's “Charlie's Angels."" With Universal's backing and Lord and Miller producing, “Cocaine Bear” struck her as not just a viable, actually-happening project but one where she could marry a gory animal attack movie with comedy.

            “Most people are surprised that it is a real thing, and very surprised that I’m the person that made it,” says Banks, laughing. “I just got a text from someone who was like, ‘I’ve been hearing about this movie and I had no idea you made it.’”

            Though the title meant “Cocaine Bear” would be limited from some advertising platforms, the filmmakers describe the studio as interested in leaning into what made the film distinct from the all the options viewers are inundated with. Nothing, it turned out, could cut through all the noise like “Cocaine Bear.”

            “They love things with strong flavor. That’s the word I hear a lot in my marketing meetings,"" Banks says. “It’s harder and harder to find things that are theatrically exciting. The hope was that we were making something people needed to leave their house to see.”

            The film, itself, takes the basis of the real story and imagines what might have transpired if the bear didn't quickly die but went on a coke-fueled rampage through a national forest, terrorizing park wardens, campers and drug dealers seeking the lost shipment. After an initial taste, the bear goes after more cocaine with all the zeal of Yogi pursuing a picnic basket.

            The bear, named Cokie, was a CGI concoction created by Weta FX with Allen Henry, a stunt man and student of Andy Serkis, performing motion capture. He wore all black and walked on all fours with prosthetic arms. The rest of the cast includes Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, Alden Ehrenreich, O'Shea Jackson and Ray Liotta. It's one of Liotta's final performances before his death last May, and one that connects back to his similarly cocaine-laced performance in “Goodfellas.""

            “I’ve said that this film felt very risky. The risk was: I was never going to have the lead character of the movie on the set of the movie,” Banks says. “That was truly what scared me the most. If the bear didn’t work, the movie falls apart.”

            Lord and Miller hope that there's a rising realization within the film industry that movies that are audaciously original can pack theaters. Lord points to the Academy Awards favorite ""Everything Everywhere All at Once” as recent proof.

            “It could win best picture and it’s the zaniest idea out there,” Lord says. “For the scale of that movie, it’s a huge hit. What we’re after is demonstrating that these movies can be original and fun and surprising and they can be hits.”

            “I can’t think of a movie that came out last year that wouldn’t have been maybe a little bit better if there had a been a cocaine-fueled bear on a rampage as part of it,"" adds Miller. ""Imagine if ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ had a big bear just running through biting that guy’s fingers off.”

            If it's successful, “Cocaine Bear” could, of course, become a franchise of its own. A sequel isn't out the question. “LSD Armadillo”? “Quaalude Tortoise”? Banks, for now, is deferring.

            “Somebody will put something into the AI chat bot and it will spit out something ridiculous and the internet will write it for us.”

But surprisingly, they were excited right from the jump and didn’t shy away from the movie, its tone or even its title,” says Miller. “We thought at some point, someone was going to say, ‘Well you can’t call it ‘Cocaine Bear.’ You have to call it ‘A Walk in the Woods.’""Since her directorial debut in 2015's “Pitch Perfect 2,” Banks has carved out a second career behind the camera. She last helmed 2019's “Charlie's Angels."" With Universal's backing and Lord and Miller producing, “Cocaine Bear” struck her as not just a viable, actually-happening project but one where she could marry a gory animal attack movie with comedy.“Most people are surprised that it is a real thing, and very surprised that I’m the person that made it,” says Banks, laughing. “I just got a text from someone who was like, ‘I’ve been hearing about this movie and I had no idea you made it.’”Though the title meant “Cocaine Bear” would be limited from some advertising platforms, the filmmakers describe the studio as interested in leaning into what made the film distinct from the all the options viewers are inundated with. Nothing, it turned out, could cut through all the noise like “Cocaine Bear.”“They love things with strong flavor. That’s the word I hear a lot in my marketing meetings,"" Banks says. “It’s harder and harder to find things that are theatrically exciting. The hope was that we were making something people needed to leave their house to see.”The film, itself, takes the basis of the real story and imagines what might have transpired if the bear didn't quickly die but went on a coke-fueled rampage through a national forest, terrorizing park wardens, campers and drug dealers seeking the lost shipment. After an initial taste, the bear goes after more cocaine with all the zeal of Yogi pursuing a picnic basket.The bear, named Cokie, was a CGI concoction created by Weta FX with Allen Henry, a stunt man and student of Andy Serkis, performing motion capture. He wore all black and walked on all fours with prosthetic arms. The rest of the cast includes Keri Russell, Margo Martindale, Alden Ehrenreich, O'Shea Jackson and Ray Liotta. It's one of Liotta's final performances before his death last May, and one that connects back to his similarly cocaine-laced performance in “Goodfellas.""“I’ve said that this film felt very risky. The risk was: I was never going to have the lead character of the movie on the set of the movie,” Banks says. “That was truly what scared me the most. If the bear didn’t work, the movie falls apart.”Lord and Miller hope that there's a rising realization within the film industry that movies that are audaciously original can pack theaters. Lord points to the Academy Awards favorite ""Everything Everywhere All at Once” as recent proof.“It could win best picture and it’s the zaniest idea out there,” Lord says. “For the scale of that movie, it’s a huge hit. What we’re after is demonstrating that these movies can be original and fun and surprising and they can be hits.”“I can’t think of a movie that came out last year that wouldn’t have been maybe a little bit better if there had a been a cocaine-fueled bear on a rampage as part of it,"" adds Miller. ""Imagine if ‘The Banshees of Inisherin’ had a big bear just running through biting that guy’s fingers off.”If it's successful, “Cocaine Bear” could, of course, become a franchise of its own. A sequel isn't out the question. “LSD Armadillo”? “Quaalude Tortoise”? Banks, for now, is deferring.“Somebody will put something into the AI chat bot and it will spit out something ridiculous and the internet will write it for us.”___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",2023/2/25,,World

            NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks tumbled to their worst day in two months, buckling under worries about higher interest rates and their tightening squeeze on Wall Street and the economy. The S&P 500 fell 2% Tuesday for its sharpest drop since the market was selling off in December. The Dow lost 697 points. Home Depot fell to one of the market’s sharper losses after it gave a financial forecast that fell short of expectations. Treasury yields kept climbing on worries that the Federal Reserve will need to stay aggressive on keeping rates high to fight inflation. Higher rates hurt investment prices and raise the risk of a recession.

            Supreme Court wrestles with lawsuit shield for social media

            WASHINGTON (AP) — In its first case about the federal law that is credited with helping create the modern internet, the Supreme Court seems unlikely to side with a family wanting to hold Google liable for the death of their daughter who was killed in a terrorist attack. At the same time, the justices also signaled in arguments lasting two and a half hours that they are wary of Google’s claims that a 1996 law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, affords it, Twitter, Facebook and other companies sweeping immunity from lawsuits over their targeted recommendations of videos, documents and other content. Justice Elena Kagan was among members of the court suggesting Congress, not the court, should make needed changes to a law passed early in the internet age.

            4-day workweek trial: Shorter hours, happier employees

            LONDON (AP) — A trial of a four-day workweek in Britain, billed as the world’s largest, has found that most employees are less stressed, burned out and have better work-life balance. Findings from the University of Cambridge, Boston College and other researchers released this week show that most of the 61 companies that participated from June to December will keep going with the shorter hours. They say revenue largely stayed the same over the trial period and even grew compared with the same six months a year earlier. Employees have reported more job satisfaction, better sleep and improved mental health. There was also a 57% drop in the likelihood of employees quitting from the same period a year earlier.

And now some restaurants are betting they’ll do the same for their favorite meals. Large chains like Panera and P.F.

Some offer unlimited drinks or free delivery for a monthly fee; others will bring out your favorite appetizer each time you visit. They’re following a trend: The average American juggled 6.7 subscriptions in 2022, up from 4.2 in 2019, according to Rocket Money, a personal finance app.

            NEW YORK (AP) — Testimony from a former ESPN executive is underscoring the high stakes and corruption that has enveloped the world of soccer. Former ESPN President John Skipper told a U.S. District Court in New York Tuesday that his broadcasting company bid $450 million for U.S. broadcasting rights to the two most recent World Cups, including the recent one in Qatar. Fox reportedly bid $425 million, but won the rights anyway. The U.S. government is accusing two former Fox executives of bribing soccer officials to undermine competing bids and help Fox win the rights. The Fox network is not a defendant in the case and has denied any wrongdoing.

            Mormon church fined $5M for obscuring size of portfolio

            SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission says The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its investment arm will pay $5 million in fines. The SEC alleges the church used shell companies to obscure the size of the portfolio under the church’s control. Agency investigators said Ensign Peak Advisors, a church portfolio manger, hadn’t filed required paperwork to disclose the value of some assets. The agency fined Ensign Peak $4 million and the church $1 million. The faith, widely known as the Mormon church, maintains billions of dollars of investments. It has faced increasing scrutiny because religious groups are largely exempt from paying U.S. taxes.

            Microsoft makes case for Activision merger amid EU scrutiny

            BRUSSELS (AP) — Microsoft’s Xbox video game division has announced new partnerships with Nintendo and chipmaker Nvidia. The moves come as Microsoft is trying to persuade European regulators to approve its planned $68.7 billion takeover of game publishing giant Activision Blizzard. A key audience for the announcements were the European Union antitrust regulators who held a closed-door meeting Tuesday with executives from Microsoft and some of their competitors, including Sony and Google. Microsoft announced a 10-year agreement with chipmaker Nvidia to bring Xbox games to Nvidia’s cloud gaming service. Microsoft also said it has now signed a similar deal with Nintendo, formalizing a commitment it revealed late last year.

            US home sales fall again in January; prices edged higher

            LOS ANGELES (AP) — The nation’s housing slump deepened in January as home sales fell for the 12th month in a row to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years. The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday that existing U.S. home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million properties last month. January’s sales cratered by nearly 37% from a year earlier, but slipped 0.7% from December, while the median U.S. home price edged up 1.3% from January last year. The latest data suggest home may be “bottoming out,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817630,AP sources: Westbrook could make Clippers debut Friday,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Russell Westbrook could make his debut with the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday once he clears waivers, two people with knowledge of the matter said Tuesday.

            The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Westbrook still needs to clear waivers before he can sign with a new team. 

            The nine-time All-Star was waived by the Utah Jazz on Monday. He is expected to clear waivers Wednesday since no team has the salary cap space to take on the remaining $47 million he is owed on his expiring contract.











            There is an outside chance Westbrook could practice Thursday if he signs and passes his physical. The Clippers — fourth in the Western Conference with a 33-28 record — host Sacramento on Friday in their first game after the All-Star break.

            ESPN was the first to report that Westbrook intended to sign with the Clippers.

            The move keeps Westbrook in Los Angeles. He is from the area, was a standout at UCLA and played less than two seasons for the Lakers before being traded to the Jazz on Feb. 10 as part of a three-team deal.

            The 15-year veteran is averaging 15.9 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 7.1 assists in 28.7 minutes per game.

            Westbrook would also be reunited with Paul George, his former teammate in Oklahoma City. George has been lobbying the front office to add a point guard.

            “It would definitely improve our team if we had that traditional point guard, to kind of get us in things and make the game easy,” George said. “So, hopefully, Russell sees this and we figure something out.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817631,"Osimhen scores, Napoli beats Frankfurt 2-0 in Champs League","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Victor Osimhen scored again Tuesday to help Napoli to a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.

            The Nigeria forward scored his 10th goal in his last eight appearances across all competitions, opening the scoring in the 40th minute after a period of concerted pressure from the visitors.

            Osimhen had just hit the post and teammate Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had a penalty saved by Frankfurt captain Kevin Trapp as he faced deafening whistles from the home supporters.











            Buoyed by Kvaratskhelia’s penalty miss, Frankfurt began pushing forward as the jubilant fans got louder and the game wilder.

            Hirving Lozano capitalized on the extra space, racing down the right wing and crossing for Osimhen’s easy finish at the back post. They repeated the trick a minute later, but this time the goal was chalked out for offside.

            Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo scored the second goal in the 65th by finishing a wonderful team move with a sweeping, curled shot inside the far post after Kvaratskhelia back-heeled the ball into his path. André-Frank Zambo Anguissa had played the Georgian in with a weighted through ball.

            Frankfurt’s hopes of mounting a comeback were dealt a major blow minutes before when star forward Randal Kolo Muani was sent off for catching Anguissa with his open sole as both went for the ball. It means the French forward will be suspended for the second leg in Naples.

            “We tried everything,” Frankfurt midfielder Mario Götze said. “The game flowed against us, also with the red card. It was a killer for us. We didn't do badly in the first few minutes. They played well in the end.”

            Frankfurt coach Oliver Glasner said his team won't give up.

            “We're not going to raise the white flag in Naples. Many things are possible in soccer,” Glasner said. “It hurts today. We made lots of mistakes. We have to learn from that.”

            Counterpart Luciano Spalletti also warned against considering the tie over despite his own team's clear dominance. Napoli had 17 attempts compared to the home team's five.

            “There’s still a match, we still have to play it,” Spalletti said. “Arrogance is the biggest enemy.”

            Frankfurt supporters set off a large pyrotechnic display behind one of the goals at the start of the game, partly in protest against local authorities after failing to reach agreement on a planned choreography due to safety concerns.

            There was a heavy police presence at and around what was considered a high-risk game due to some of the supporters’ urge for violence. Police made nine arrests the night before and were prepared for more trouble later Tuesday.

            Napoli’s supporters were shepherded to the stadium in an attempt to keep them away from the home fans, while there was also a large buffer area around their section in the stadium to ensure no contact between the rivals.

            Napoli, which leads Serie A by 15 points, seemed rattled early on with uncharacteristic mistakes before Osimhen settled the visitors' nerves.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817638,A tale of two number 9s as Napoli crush Frankfurt's dreams,"If it's of any consolation to Frankfurt, they're not the first team Napoli have torn apart this season. The Serie A champions-in-waiting were measured in their defusing of the Europa League winners with a performance that was brutally efficient — notwithstanding a missed penalty by Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the first half.For a few short minutes, Kevin Trapp's big penalty save promised to ignite the hosts but such was Napoli's vast superiority, the Georgian's miss didn't matter after 90 minutes and won't matter after 180. Luciano Spaletti's side looked like a team 15 points clear at the top of Serie A; slick in possession, callous in front of goal.Victor Osimhen was the executioner-in-chief, scoring from close range after a scintillating run and cross by Hirving Lozano after Mario Götze's loose pass was punished. The opener came just four minutes after the penalty miss, which would have rattled lesser teams.Osimhen's transfer from Lille for €70 million in 2020 was a risk at the time but no one is questioning the fee now, given his return of 19 goals in 23 games this season. He has been a revelation at the apex of a Napoli team drilled by Spaletti to play to Osimhen's best attributes: intelligent movement, searing pace and precise finishing.Frankfurt have their own imposing striker too, a player who also cut his teeth in France and shares many of Osimhen's best traits. Kolo Muani has lit up the Bundesliga this season and has seemed to be on the cusp of bigger and better things ever since his €16 million move from Nantes last year. But while his opposite number 9 spearheaded Napoli to victory, Muani's night couldn't have been any different.He spent the evening starved of service and unable to make inroads against Serie A's best defense before being caught up in the game's major flashpoint. Just shy of the hour, he overran the ball and lunged forward to reach it ahead of Andre-Frank Anguissa. He mistimed it though and plunged his studs into Anguissa's ankle. Malicious it wasn't, a red card it was, and Muani's suspension for the return leg on March 15 makes a thankless task almost impossible.Napoli weren't done there though. A beautiful, flowing move was lasered into the bottom corner by Giovanni Di Lorenzo after an impudent back-heel by Kvaratskhelia. That was the killer blow for Frankfurt, whose Champions League journey has seen them scale new heights — but here they were simply outclassed by one of Europe's finest.",2023/2/21,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817639,Hong Kong voids visa of controversial gene-editing scientist,"Hong Kong canceled the work visa on Tuesday of a Chinese scientist who sparked an ethical controversy five years ago after creating the world's first genetically-edited babies.The authorities in Hong Kong made the decision just hours after He Jiankui announced his research plans in the city.In 2018, He had shocked the world through his announcement of altering the embryos of twin girls to confer immunity to HIV.Many in the scientific community criticized his work as unethical. He was convicted of practicing medicine without a license by a mainland Chinese court in the year thereafter and sentenced to spend three years in prison alongside a fine of 3 million yuan  ($445.000, €408.000).Ten months after his release, He announced that Hong Kong was going to grant him a visa and that he was in contact with universities, research institutes and companies in the financial hub.He said he was considering working in Hong Kong if there was an appropriate opportunity. He also said he was planning to research gene therapy for scarce hereditary diseases.""My scientific research will comply with the ethics codes and international consensus on scientific research,'' the scientist said at a short news conference.This original granting of a visa to He Jiankui had raised criticism in the scientific community and had dampened Hong Kong's fresh immigration scheme aimed at attracting top talent from across the world.However, Hong Kong's government said later on Tuesday that it had nullified the visa of an individual who ""made false statements"" when applying. A criminal investigation into the case had been launched.""After the immigration department reviewed the application, it suspected that someone had made false statements to get the visa approval,'' the statement wrote. ""The director of immigration has declared that the visa is invalid in accordance with the law.'While He was not named in the statement, details of his case were mentioned.It added that applicants must declare whether they had a criminal record in future, a requirement that did not exist when He applied for the visa, officials admitted.los/wd (AFP, AP)",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817641,Romanian court keeps Andrew Tate and brother in custody,"A court in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, on Tuesday agreed to extend the detention of social media influencer Andrew Tate on suspicion of organized crime and human trafficking by another 30 days.The 36-year-old British-US citizen, well known for his misogynistic views, was arrested in late December for suspected human trafficking, rape, and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.Former kickboxer Tate, along with his younger brother Tristan and two Romanian women, allegedly coerced female victims into ""forced labour... and pornographic acts"" for ""substantial financial benefits.""As part of the investigation,  Romanian police raided several properties linked to the brothers and seized numerous assets, including a luxury car collection.Tate has reportedly lived in Romania since 2017 and has been previously banned from various social media platforms for hate speech.He says Romanian prosecutors have no evidence and alleged their case is a ""political"" attack aimed at silencing him.Tuesday's decision to keep them behind bars while investigations continue comes after the brothers lost their February 1 appeal of a decision in late January to keep them in custody.The judge in the earlier decision was said to have taken into account the ""particular dangerousness of the defendants"" and their ability to identify victims ""with an increased vulnerability, in search of better life opportunities.""After the December arrests, Romania's anti-organized crime agency said in a statement that it had identified six victims in the human trafficking case. It said they had been subjected to ""acts of physical violence and mental coercion"" and that they had been sexually exploited by members of the alleged crime group.It said victims were lured with pretenses of love and later intimidated, placed under surveillance and subjected to other control tactics. They would then be coerced into engaging in pornographic acts for the financial gain of the criminal enterprise.The latest 30-day extension is the third since the brothers were arrested. The two women, who are currently also held in custody, are to be placed under house arrest from next week.rc/wd (Reuters, AP, AFP)",2023/2/21,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817643,Lawsuit filed over fatal shooting of man by Georgia officer,"ATLANTA (AP) — The family of a man who was fatally shot by a Georgia police officer filed a lawsuit under federal disability discrimination laws, saying he was having a mental health crisis and officers weren't adequately trained to respond.

            In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Atlanta, the family of Matthew Zadok Williams alleges “disability discrimination” and says DeKalb County had a “policy of failing to adequately train police officers to safely arrest persons with mental illness.” A county police officer shot and killed Williams on April 12, 2021, in the townhome community where he lived.

            The lawsuit, filed Friday by Williams' mother and sister, cites the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. A county spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation.











            “DeKalb County has known for years that it is putting officers and citizens at risk by failing to provide proper training and support for custodial arrests of persons in mental crisis,"" Leighton Moore, a lawyer for Williams' family, said in a news release. ""This lawsuit will hold the County responsible for its obligations, and hopefully make change.” 

            DeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston in June declined to pursue criminal charges in the shooting, saying that she found the officers' use of force to be justified. Williams' family opposed that decision.

            DeKalb County police officers encountered Williams when a woman called 911 to report that “a homeless person in an altered state” had been lying in the woods and then was walking aimlessly around the community. She called back a second time to say that when she startled him, the man pulled out a knife and then immediately tried to hide it before walking away.

            The lawsuit says the facts relayed by that woman “put DeKalb County and its officers on notice that Zadok was in mental crisis.” And one of the officers who responded had previously gone to that address about four weeks earlier for a previous mental health incident involving Williams, the suit says.

            Williams was locked outside of his townhome and had rubber gloves, a bucket and a plumber's knife. When officers arrived, they tried to engage him but he didn't respond. Williams ran toward one of the officers with the knife but then ran away when the officer stumbled, the suit says.

            Williams got into his home by breaking a window. Officers ended up kicking open the door several times, with Williams reaching out to close it each time, the lawsuit says. At one point, when Williams reached to close the door, an officer fired three shots as it was closing, the lawsuit says. Williams was shot and the officers did not immediately provide medical aid, allowing him to bleed to death, the lawsuit says.

            The officers failed to follow the county policy for a “barricaded person,” which would have involved calling SWAT and a trained negotiator, and failed to render aid once he’d been shot, the lawsuit says.

            DeKalb County officials have known for years that officers weren't receiving adequate training and resources to recognize and deescalate mental health crises, the lawsuit says. As a result, it says, people with mental illness, “were exposed to a heightened risk of injury or death relative to other arrestees, by reason of their disability.” 

            The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory damages, as well as legal fees and costs, and asks for a jury trial.ATLANTA (AP) — The family of a man who was fatally shot by a Georgia police officer filed a lawsuit under federal disability discrimination laws, saying he was having a mental health crisis and officers weren't adequately trained to respond.In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Atlanta, the family of Matthew Zadok Williams alleges “disability discrimination” and says DeKalb County had a “policy of failing to adequately train police officers to safely arrest persons with mental illness.” A county police officer shot and killed Williams on April 12, 2021, in the townhome community where he lived.The lawsuit, filed Friday by Williams' mother and sister, cites the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817644,Real Madrid routs Liverpool 5-2 in CL stunner at Anfield,"LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — While both Real Madrid and Liverpool are rightly considered Champions League royalty, there can only be one king.

            Down by two goals after 14 minutes at Anfield, defending champion Madrid rallied to win 5-2 on Tuesday and take a commanding lead into the second leg of the round-of-16 matchup.

            Vinicius Jr. and Karim Benzema scored two goals each to stun the hosts — Liverpool conceded four goals in a home European match for the first time — and confirm the Spanish club will take some stopping in its defense of the trophy.











            “We played with personality, we produced goals. We want this Champions League again,” Benzema said. “And that produced a match which was lovely to play in and for those who were watching.”

            If anything, this Madrid team appears more complete than the one that beat Jurgen Klopp's team in last year’s Paris final. Yet this win echoed the memorable comebacks that led to that record-extending 14th Champions League title.

            There was the chaotic defending that allowed Liverpool to race into a 2-0 lead as Darwin Nunez struck with a backheel in the fourth minute and Mohamed Salah doubled the advantage thanks to Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois’ blunder.

            Then came the rousing comeback, led by one of European soccer’s emerging stars in Vinicius and sealed by an aging icon in Benzema.

            Eder Militao was also on the scoresheet when he headed Madrid into a 3-2 lead just after halftime.

            The 22-year-old Vinicius became the youngest player to score two goals against Liverpool at Anfield in one of Europe's leading competitions since Johan Cruyff for Ajax in 1966 when the Dutch great was 19.

            The Brazil international is establishing himself as Madrid’s star player and, in the face of a typically daunting Anfield atmosphere, he rose to the occasion.

            “Vinicius right now in my opinion is the most decisive player in world football, the man who can make the biggest difference, and if he can keep this consistency let’s hope he can continue in this vein,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said.

            Just as the visitors appeared to be in danger of buckling under the pressure, Vinicius produced a moment of magic with his first goal in the 21st.

            Exchanging passes with Benzema just inside the box, there was no obvious danger until he flashed a low shot through a crowd of legs and into the bottom corner.

            Vinicius evened the score in the 36th when Alisson’s attempted kick rebounded straight off him and looped into an empty net.

            While the goal was a moment of good fortune, it was also a measure of the panic he sparked in Liverpool’s defense that Alisson was rushed into making the mistake.

            Two minutes after halftime, Madrid took the lead when Militao headed in Luka Modric’s free kick from the left.

            It went from bad to worse for Liverpool as the 35-year-old Benzema, the inspiration for Madrid’s triumph last year, got in on the act.

            His shot was deflected off Joe Gomez in the 55th to make it 4-2 and he added and fifth when rounding Alisson in the 67th.

            It had all started so well for Liverpool, which went into the game with confidence after back-to-back wins against Everton and Newcastle in the Premier League.

            Those victories had sparked hope of an unlikely run in Europe and came just in time for the ultimate test of trying to halt Madrid.

            Nunez struck early to shock the visitors before Salah capitalized on Courtois’ mis-control to tap in from close range in the 14th.

            The home fans were rocking until Vinicius sparked a comeback that seems likely to propel Madrid to the quarterfinals.

            “I think Carlo thinks the tie is over and I think it as well in the moment,” Klopp said. “But the closer you get to the game, the bigger our chances become. Tonight 5-2 they are pretty good in counter attacking and we have to go there and take some risks to score three goals. We go there to try and win the game.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817645,Arizona rancher murder complaint amended with assault counts,"PHOENIX (AP) — The first-degree murder complaint against an Arizona rancher suspected of killing a Mexican man on his land was amended Tuesday to include two counts of aggravated assault against a pair of other people. 

            The filing in Santa Cruz County Justice Court in the border city of Nogales, Arizona, was the first public mention of the possibility other people may have been hurt in the Jan. 30 incident. The updated complaint used only initials for the two other people suspected of having been assaulted and did not list their nationalities.

            The new counts come of the eve of a preliminary hearing for rancher George Alan Kelly, who faces a first-degree murder charge in the fatal shooting of Gabriel Cuen-Butimea, who lived just south of the border in Nogales, Mexico. U.S. federal court records show Cuen-Butimea was convicted of illegal entry and deported back to Mexico several times, most recently in 2016. 











             Kelly, 73, is set to appear at 9 a.m. MT (11 a.m. ET) Wednesday in Santa Cruz County Justice Court. 

            His attorney, Brenna Larkin, has said Kelly did not shoot and kill the man, but he acknowledges that earlier that day he fired warning shots at smugglers carrying AK-47 rifles and backpacks he encountered on his property.

            “He does not believe that any of his warning shots could have possibly hit the person or caused the death,” Larkin said in a court filing earlier this month. “All the shooting that Mr. Kelly did on the date of the incident was in self-defense and justified.”

            Kelly’s ranch is just outside Nogales, Arizona, city limits in the Kino Springs area.

            The Mexican consulate in Nogales has not publicly commented on the case.

            The shooting has sparked strong political feelings less than six months after a prison warden and his brother were arrested in a West Texas shooting that killed one migrant and wounded another. Michael and Mark Sheppard, both 60, were charged with manslaughter in the September shooting in El Paso County.

            Authorities allege the twin brothers pulled over their truck near a town about 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the border and opened fire on a group of migrants getting water along the road. A male migrant died, and a female suffered a gunshot wound to the stomach.

            GoFundMe campaigns to pay for Kelly’s legal defense have been shut down because of the seriousness of the case and the money was returned to donors, the platform said last week in a statement.

            “GoFundMe’s Terms of Service explicitly prohibit campaigns that raise money to cover the legal defense of anyone formally charged with an alleged violent crime,” it said. “Consistent with this long-standing policy, any fundraising campaigns for the legal defense of someone charged with murder are removed from our platform.”

            GiveSendGo, which describes itself as a Christian fundraising platform, carries at least four campaigns collecting money for Kelly’s legal defense, including one that had gathered more than $300,000 as of Tuesday.

            Kelly apparently drew on his borderlands ranching life in the self-published novel “Far Beyond the Border Fence,” which is described on Amazon.com as a “contemporary novel which brings the Mexican Border/Drug conflict into the 21st century.” 

            Authored by a man with the same name, the 57-page novel focuses on a man named George and his wife, Wanda, also the name of Kelly's real-life wife. 

            “Several times each week illegal immigrants would cross the VMR ranch,” reads one part. “They were led by armed human smugglers called Coyotes.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817646,Petition launched to recognize 1st Black pro hockey coach,"MONTREAL (AP) — A grassroots effort is underway to get professional hockey’s first Black coach, John Paris Jr., into the Hall of Fame.

            Hockey Nova Scotia launched a petition dubbed “Paris to Toronto” on Feb. 1, calling on the Nova Scotia-born Paris to be recognized for his contributions to the game.

            Paris, 76, said Tuesday in an interview from Halifax that all the attention was unexpected.











            ""It’s humbling, I can most certainly say that,” he told The Canadian Press, “just the fact that they took the time to even think of me, regardless of the results.”

            Paris has a number of firsts on his resumé, including the first Black coach in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, the first Black scout in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues, the first Black general manager in professional hockey and the first Black professional hockey coach, leading the Atlanta Knights to a Turner Cup in the now-defunct International Hockey League.

            Despite the long list, he doesn’t see his career as a succession of broken barriers.

            “Well, what I’ve always said is that I’m Black by nature and I’m a coach by choice, and there’s a difference,” Paris said. “I know what color I am, everybody knows it when they see me, that has nothing to do with my participation as a coach — that’s a decision.”

            Paris is still involved in hockey, working as an outside consultant to help some NHL players with their performance.

            Dean Smith, diversity and inclusion chair at Hockey Nova Scotia, says one of the recommendations from a task force created in 2019 to look at racism and discrimination in the sport was to find ways to recognize and highlight contributions from those in under-represented communities.

            Smith said the more he learned about Paris, the more surprised he was that he wasn’t already in the Hall of Fame, calling him “so modest and so humble.”

            “He loves to talk about hockey, he loves to convey his experience to young junior coaches like myself, but he will never sell himself,"" Smith said. ""I think that is our job now — to make sure that his accolades and his accomplishments ... are recognized by the highest levels of hockey.”

            An official with the Hockey Hall of Fame said the deadline for public submissions is March 15. A selection committee meets not long after the Stanley Cup Final ends to consider candidates. Admission requires three-quarters of the 18-member committee to agree.

            Paris acknowledges he’s a little uncomfortable with the attention. On Monday, he was given a standing ovation while attending a QMJHL Halifax Mooseheads game.

            The petition had amassed 2,300 signatures by Tuesday afternoon.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMONTREAL (AP) — A grassroots effort is underway to get professional hockey’s first Black coach, John Paris Jr., into the Hall of Fame.Hockey Nova Scotia launched a petition dubbed “Paris to Toronto” on Feb. 1, calling on the Nova Scotia-born Paris to be recognized for his contributions to the game.Paris, 76, said Tuesday in an interview from Halifax that all the attention was unexpected.""It’s humbling, I can most certainly say that,” he told The Canadian Press, “just the fact that they took the time to even think of me, regardless of the results.”Paris has a number of firsts on his resumé, including the first Black coach in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, the first Black scout in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues, the first Black general manager in professional hockey and the first Black professional hockey coach, leading the Atlanta Knights to a Turner Cup in the now-defunct International Hockey League.Despite the long list, he doesn’t see his career as a succession of broken barriers.“Well, what I’ve always said is that I’m Black by nature and I’m a coach by choice, and there’s a difference,” Paris said. “I know what color I am, everybody knows it when they see me, that has nothing to do with my participation as a coach — that’s a decision.”Paris is still involved in hockey, working as an outside consultant to help some NHL players with their performance.Dean Smith, diversity and inclusion chair at Hockey Nova Scotia, says one of the recommendations from a task force created in 2019 to look at racism and discrimination in the sport was to find ways to recognize and highlight contributions from those in under-represented communities.Smith said the more he learned about Paris, the more surprised he was that he wasn’t already in the Hall of Fame, calling him “so modest and so humble.”“He loves to talk about hockey, he loves to convey his experience to young junior coaches like myself, but he will never sell himself,"" Smith said. ""I think that is our job now — to make sure that his accolades and his accomplishments ... are recognized by the highest levels of hockey.”An official with the Hockey Hall of Fame said the deadline for public submissions is March 15.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817647,US plans to allow Medicaid for drug treatment in prisons,"CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — The federal government is planning to allow states to use Medicaid funds to provide drugs to combat addiction and other medical services for people at state jails and prisons in an effort to help some of those most at risk of dying in the nation's overdose epidemic.

            Dr. Rahul Gupta, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, announced Tuesday that states would be encouraged to submit proposals for how to use money from the joint federal-state low-income health insurance program for incarcerated people. Those that do would be required to provide mental health and drug treatment and would have the option to add some other services.

            Speaking during a visit to New Jersey's Camden County Jail, Gupta said the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will release its full guidance this spring.











            Advocates have long called for such a move and the government last month announced that California was being given approval to use Medicaid for some services for incarcerated people.

            “Treating substance abuse disorder in prison and jails is smart,” said Gupta, who also announced that by summer all federal prisons will be offering medications to treat substance use disorder. “It's a smart move for our economic prosperity, for our safety and health of our nation.”

            The Medicaid plan represents a departure for the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. When it was launched in 1965, it came with a ban on using the funds to help incarcerated people.

            Studies have found that the majority of people incarcerated in jails and state prisons met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse — and that former inmates are far more likely to die in their first weeks after release than the average non-incarcerated person. The leading cause of death for people newly released is overdose, partly because tolerance to drugs decreases for people who don't use them while incarcerated.

            Advocates for allowing Medicaid to fund treatment in lockups say it could keep people alive and reduce crime.

            “We’re really hopeful that this coverage will help people improve their health outcomes and avoid additional involvement in the criminal justice system,” Gabrielle de la Gueronniere, the vice president for health and justice policy at the Legal Action Center, said in an interview Tuesday.

            In some places, the Medicaid change could usher in new drug treatment options.

            But in New Jersey, it's largely a financial change. State Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman said 20 of the state's 21 counties already have medication-assisted treatment programs at their jails.

            The treatment costs are high, particularly for Sublocade, an opioid addiction treatment drug administered through a shot every four weeks. Since 2019, the Camden County Jail has spent more than $528,000 since 2019 to provide the drug to 170 people. It has cost $664,000 to provide a similar drug in a daily pill to about 3,100 people. The funding comes through the state's SAFE program, which uses state allocations and grant money. In the Camden facility, nearly one-fourth of incarcerated people are receiving medication treatment now.

            “It allows us to use those SAFE dollars to go further and to do more,” said Sarah Adelman, the state human services commissioner.

            Some Camden County Jail inmates spoke with Gupta before he made his announcement.

            One, Rachel Parker, said that she was already being treated with Suboxone when she was brought to the jail in early January.

            Past jail stays meant a painful withdrawal, making it even more stressful to be there.

            “It's like you're fearing death,” she said.

            But she said this time, she's been able to keep getting treated and knows that when she's released, she'll have a prescription to continue her treatment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817651,Accused Mississippi mass shooter charged with capital murder,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Authorities have announced an additional charge against the man who they say went on a deadly shooting rampage last week, killing six people that included his ex-wife and stepfather in a tiny rural community in northern Mississippi. 

            Richard Dale Crum, 52, was jailed Friday hours after carrying out the shootings at multiple locations in Tate County, near the Tennessee state line. In a statement Monday night, Tate County Sheriff Brad Lance said that Richard Crum had been charged with one count of capital murder for the death of his ex-wife, Debra McNally Crum. 

            Richard Crum had already been charged with one count of first-degree murder for the death of Chris Eugene Boyce, 59, a Florida resident who was shot and killed while sitting in a pickup truck outside a convenience store in Arkabutla. 











            Besides Boyce and Crum’s ex-wife, authorities identified the others killed as Charles Manuel, 76; John Rorie, 59; George McCain, 73; and Lynda McCain, 78. As of Tuesday, Crum had not yet been charged in the shooting deaths of Manuel, Rorie and the McCains. George McCain was Crum's stepfather and Lynda was McCain's sister. 

            Norma Washington, Boyce's aunt, told The Associated Press that Boyce and his brother had been in town cleaning up a property they inherited from their deceased uncle. It was unclear whether Richard Crum knew either of the brothers.

            The fatal shooting of 60-year-old Debra Crum in the home she shared with boyfriend George Drane in Coldwater came a little more than four years after Richard and Debra Crum's divorce. Drane said the two had been separated for five or six years before they divorced. Drane said he hadn’t seen Richard Crum in seven or eight years.

            “I thought it was a random act. I don’t know about the rest of it,” Drane said. “He left us alone. We left him alone.”

            Drane said Richard Crum busted into their home and smashed him in the head with the butt of a gun before shooting Debra Crum in the head. 

            Richard Crum went to the home after he killed Boyce at the convenience store in nearby Arkabutla where, according to the sheriff, he had shot Boyce.

            Ashley McKinney, a 38-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee, dated Debra Crum’s son, Sid Furniss, when the two were teens and said Richard Crum had displayed signs he was troubled.

            After the divorce, Debra Crum grew uncomfortable working her overnight shifts at the Waffle House restaurant alone, unsure what her ex-husband would do because of his troubling behavior, and asked McKinney to keep her company, McKinney said.

            McKinney said Richard Crum largely worked odd jobs, like cutting firewood. 

            Richard Crum’s initial appearance was held at the Tate County Jail Monday due to “security concerns” connected with the case, Lance said. The judge ordered Richard Crum to be held without bond and set his preliminary hearing for Thursday morning at the Tate County Justice Court. 

            It was not immediately known if Richard Crum had an attorney who could speak on his behalf.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817652,Former pitching coach Regan sues Mets for age discrimination,"NEW YORK (AP) — Phil Regan sued the New York Mets and former general manager Brodie Van Wagenen, alleging age discrimination and wrongful termination when he was moved out as pitching coach after the 2019 season.

            Regan, a former big league pitcher who turns 86 in April, also claimed harassment and hostile work environment in a complaint filed Monday in New York Supreme Court in Queens.

            “Phil came into an underperforming pitching staff and immediately righted the ship,” his lawyer, Matthew J. Blit, said in a statement Tuesday. “He helped lower the team ERA and brought the staff back to where it was supposed to be. Instead of rewarding him for his masterful performance he was tossed aside because of his age.”











            Regan was 96-81 with a 3.84 ERA for Detroit, the Chicago Cubs and White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1960-72 and was an All-Star in 1966. He managed the Baltimore Orioles to a 71-73 record and third-place finish in the AL East during the strike-shortened 1995 season.

            He joined the Mets organization as pitching coach of Class A St. Lucie in 2009 and became minor league pitching coordinator in 2016.

            New York fired pitching coach Dave Eiland on June 20, 2019, when the team was fourth in the NL East at 35-39 with a big league-high 16 blown saves and a 4.67 ERA, 20th among the 30 big league clubs. Regan became interim pitching coach, and the Mets lowered their ERA to 4.24 by the end of the season.

            Regan was replaced on Dec. 8 by Jeremy Hefner, who was 33 at the time and still holds the job. Regan claimed in the suit the Mets offered him a minor league contract at reduced terms. Regan was listed last season as senior adviser, pitching development.

            “BVW specifically informed Mr. Regan that he wasn't being retained because of his age,"" the suit said, referring to Van Wagenen by his initials.

            The Mets declined comment and Van Wagenen, who was fired when Steve Cohen bought the team in November 2020, said he deferred to the team for any comment.

            Regan's suit contends the team “has further harassed and discriminated"" against him by “further decreases in salary, further denials of opportunities which he deserved, and even a reduction in housing allowance.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817658,Minnesota Senate approves restoring voting rights for felons,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota Senate moved Tuesday to restore voting rights to convicted felons as soon as they get out of prison instead of continuing to require them to complete their parole before they can cast a ballot.

            The Senate approved the “Restore the Vote” bill less than a week after the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the state’s current restrictions and left it up to the Legislature to change them. Democrats behind the measure say it will help reintegrate former inmates — who are disproportionately people of color — back into society.

            ""We know that in the state of Minnesota right now we have more than 55,000 of our friends, our neighbors and family members who are not allowed to vote. They should have the right to vote,” Democratic Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, of Minneapolis, told his colleagues.











            The Senate approved the bill 35-30 Tuesday night and sent it to Democratic Gov. Tim Walz for his promised signature.

            Supporters of the bill said it took on an even greater urgency after the Minnesota Supreme Court last week rejected a challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had argued that the state's restrictions were unconstitutional.

            The high court's ruling acknowledged that 1% of white people, 6% of Black people and 9% of Native American people in Minnesota could not vote in 2018 because they had been convicted of a felony but had not completed their parole. If the right to vote was restored upon release from incarceration, it said, those percentages would drop to 0.1%, 1.5% and 2%, respectively. 

            Twenty-one other states restore voting rights when people with felony convictions leave prison, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, including Republican-controlled North Dakota, Indiana and Utah. Some California lawmakers are pushing to allow felons to vote even while they're still in prison, regardless of their crimes, as Maine, Vermont and the District of Columbia already do.

            Champion said residents who would regain the right to vote are often people whom the courts have deemed safe for release, and that they're working, raising families and paying taxes. He noted that groups representing prosecutors, public defenders, probation officers and crime victims support the bill, as does the state Department of Corrections.

            “When individuals are connected to their communities and participating in pro-social activities, recidivism goes down, and the decision to do something to reoffend goes down as well,” he said.

            Attempts by Republicans to weaken the bill failed, including one amendment to exclude people convicted of violent crimes and another that would have kept the requirement to complete parole in place at least for those convicted of child rape.

            GOP Sen. Warren Limmer, of Maple Grove, disputed Champion's assertions that probationary periods often run as long as 20 years in Minnesota. He noted that the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission around three years ago capped parole for most offenses at five years, with exceptions remaining for first-degree murder and rape.

            Limmer told reporters during a break in the debate that felons should not regain their civil rights — in this case the right to vote — until after they've completed their full sentence, both their incarceration and probation. He also accused Democrats of getting weaker and weaker on criminals at a time when crime is already high.

            “There are some offenders that have committed heinous crimes against innocent citizens. I don't think the Senate understands that,"" Limmer said. ""Because this bill treats it as a one-size-fits all — all criminals get the same treatment.”ST. PAUL, Minn.

Tim Walz for his promised signature.Supporters of the bill said it took on an even greater urgency after the Minnesota Supreme Court last week rejected a challenge by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had argued that the state's restrictions were unconstitutional.The high court's ruling acknowledged that 1% of white people, 6% of Black people and 9% of Native American people in Minnesota could not vote in 2018 because they had been convicted of a felony but had not completed their parole. If the right to vote was restored upon release from incarceration, it said, those percentages would drop to 0.1%, 1.5% and 2%, respectively.Twenty-one other states restore voting rights when people with felony convictions leave prison, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, including Republican-controlled North Dakota, Indiana and Utah. Some California lawmakers are pushing to allow felons to vote even while they're still in prison, regardless of their crimes, as Maine, Vermont and the District of Columbia already do.Champion said residents who would regain the right to vote are often people whom the courts have deemed safe for release, and that they're working, raising families and paying taxes. He noted that groups representing prosecutors, public defenders, probation officers and crime victims support the bill, as does the state Department of Corrections.“When individuals are connected to their communities and participating in pro-social activities, recidivism goes down, and the decision to do something to reoffend goes down as well,” he said.Attempts by Republicans to weaken the bill failed, including one amendment to exclude people convicted of violent crimes and another that would have kept the requirement to complete parole in place at least for those convicted of child rape.GOP Sen. Warren Limmer, of Maple Grove, disputed Champion's assertions that probationary periods often run as long as 20 years in Minnesota. He noted that the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission around three years ago capped parole for most offenses at five years, with exceptions remaining for first-degree murder and rape.Limmer told reporters during a break in the debate that felons should not regain their civil rights — in this case the right to vote — until after they've completed their full sentence, both their incarceration and probation. He also accused Democrats of getting weaker and weaker on criminals at a time when crime is already high.“There are some offenders that have committed heinous crimes against innocent citizens. I don't think the Senate understands that,"" Limmer said. ""Because this bill treats it as a one-size-fits all — all criminals get the same treatment.”",2023/2/22,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817659,South Carolina weighs 'Yankee tax' on newcomer driving fees,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Additional fees may be coming for incoming South Carolina residents who want to legally drive on their new home state's roads.

            Droves of newcomers have made South Carolina one of the nation's fastest-growing states. As legislators respond to climbing population totals, a bill dubbed the “Yankee tax” could require freshly minted Palmetto State locals to pay $500 total in one-time fees for new driver's licenses and vehicle registration.

            The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday approved the proposal by a 11-6 vote. It now heads to the Senate floor.











            Republican Sen. Stephen Goldfinch's bill purports to capitalize on the state's in-migration by ensuring these new neighbors pay for the infrastructure already funded by existing taxpayers. He compared the tax to impact fees: one-time charges commonly paid by developers to help cover the increased demands their new project might bring for public facilities.

            For Goldfinch, the dynamic is unfair to his growing constituency in coastal Georgetown County who already foot the bill for the services utilized by people just moving into the area.

            “We’re not trying to build a wall across the North Carolina border,” Goldfinch said. ""But, at the same time, we think that people should have to pay their fair share when they show up.”

            Democratic Sen. John Scott said the newcomers already become contributors as soon as they move through payments like the gas tax. In 2017, the General Assembly approved increases to the gas tax by 2-cent increments over a six-year span. The additional revenues go toward a trust fund dedicated to infrastructure maintenance.

            Under the measure, county governments could levy the increased rates if voters approved the hikes through a county referendum held during a General Election cycle. The resulting funds could only go toward local infrastructure, public education and greenspace conservation.

            The fee would be paid with newcomers’ property taxes. Residents would then present the tax receipt at their local Department of Motor Vehicles’ office to get the new license and registration.

            Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy noted that many active-duty military members make South Carolina their permanent residence after getting transferred to the state. Goldfinch said he would be open to adding tax exemptions in those situations.

            Goldfinch also dismissed concerns that the fees would prevent prospective South Carolinians from making the move. Despite the additional $250 driver’s license and $250 registration payments, he suggested newcomers would still be compelled by the money saved through the state’s low property tax rates.

            A steady stream of new residents has boosted South Carolina's ranks as the U.S. South experiences increased in-migration from around the country. U.S. Census Bureau data show that the state added nearly 500,000 people over the last decade for a total population of 5.1 million. Over 129,000 people moved to South Carolina in 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, with former North Carolinians and Georgians leading the pack.

            Republican Sen. Sean Bennett, who supported the effort, said he was torn. Under the bill's logic, Bennett questioned why lawmakers shouldn't also charge fees for placing children in schools or road tolls in new neighborhoods.

            “Growth is not easy to manage, particularly in your community, certainly in my communities,” said Bennett who also represents a coastal district, adding: “But where does it stop, I guess, is my question.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817661,Hawks fire Nate McMillan with team stuck in 8th in East,"ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday fired coach Nate McMillan, who was unable to follow up on the success of leading the team to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals.

            Atlanta general manager Landry Fields announcing the firing. The Hawks are 29-30 and in eighth place in the East this season.

            Assistant coach Joe Prunty will serve as interim coach. Prunty joined the Hawks in July 2021 as lead assistant. 











            The 58-year-old McMillan went 99-80 as Atlanta’s coach, including a 27-11 record as interim in the second half of the 2020-21 season. His success that season earned him the full-time position.

            McMillan was frustrated in his attempts to improve Atlanta's defense, a consistent weakness that weighed down a team led by high-scoring guard Trae Young.

            McMillan denied reports early this season that he considered resigning. 

            Overall in 19 seasons, McMillan has a 760-668 record with the Seattle SuperSonics, Portland Trail Blazers, Indiana Pacers and Hawks.

            “I would like to thank Nate for his leadership and professionalism during his time with the Hawks,” Fields said in a statement. “He is truly a class act, and we appreciate the graciousness and work ethic he brought with him every day.”

            The Hawks finished 43-39 in the 2021-22 season and, after escaping the play-in tournament, lost to the Miami Heat 4-1 in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

            Atlanta then added more emphasis to a win-now approach by trading Danilo Gallinari and three first-round picks to the San Antonio Spurs for All-Star guard Dejounte Murray.

            The trade formed a backcourt pairing of All-Star guards in Murray and Young and placed more heat on McMillan to guide the Hawks back to the top of the conference.

            Instead, the Hawks have struggled near .500 most of the season. They lost four of six games before the All-Star break and are only one game ahead of 10th-place Toronto in the East. The slide left Atlanta closer to falling out of the play-in tournament than moving into the No. 6 spot for a guaranteed playoff position. The New York Knicks are sixth, 3 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta.

            “Decisions like these, especially in-season, are always extremely difficult, but we believe it’s in the best interest of our team to move forward with another voice leading the way,"" Fields said.

            McMillan dealt with persistent rumors he had disagreements with Young. Fields' desire to seek “another voice” could be a sign McMillan's message had worn thin with Young and other players.

            This has been a season of turnover for Hawks' leadership. Travis Schlenk stepped down as team president on Dec. 21 as Fields assumed control of daily operations. Kyle Korver was named assistant general manager on Jan. 16 as the team continued to remodel its front office. 

            Fields and Korver are working with principal owner Tony Ressler’s son, Nick Ressler, the director of basketball and business operations, in the new management team.

            McMillan’s 760 wins rank 18th all-time. In 11 trips to the postseason, his teams have a 28-48 record, including a 11-12 record with Atlanta.

            This is not Prunty’s first experience as an interim coach. He posted a 21-16 record as Milwaukee’s interim coach over the final 37 games of the 2017-18 season. He was an assistant with Milwaukee from 2014-18.

            Prunty also served as an assistant with the Phoenix Suns (2018-19), Brooklyn Nets (2013-14), Cleveland Cavaliers (2010-13), Portland Trail Blazers (2008-10), Dallas Mavericks (2005-08) and San Antonio Spurs (2000-05), where he won three NBA championships.

In speeches just hours apart on Tuesday, Putin in Moscow delivered a warning to the West over Ukraine by suspending its last major nuclear arms control treaty with the United States and Biden in Warsaw proclaimed untiring support for Ukraine, which was invaded by Russian forces nearly a year ago on Feb. 24.
""When Russia invaded, it wasn’t just Ukraine being tested. The whole world faced a test for the ages,"" Biden said in the Royal Castle of Warsaw, the day after he made a secretive surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.
Challenged to respond to the invasion, Biden said the United States and its NATO allies replied: ""Yes, we would stand up for sovereignty. And we did. Yes, we would stand up for the right of people to live free from aggression. And we did.""
""And we would stand up for democracy. And we did,"" he said.
Biden went on to say that ""there should be no doubt: Our support for Ukraine will not waver, NATO will not be divided, and we will not tire.""
NUCLEAR TREATY
Putin, in an earlier speech to Russia's military and political elite, accused the United States of turning the war into a global conflict and announced the suspension of Russia's participation in the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). The foreign ministry later said Moscow intended to continue abiding by the restrictions outlined in the treaty on the number of nuclear warheads it could have deployed.
""The elites of the West do not hide their purpose. But they also cannot fail to realise that it is impossible to defeat Russia on the battlefield,"" Putin said.
""They intend to transform a local conflict into a phase of global confrontation,"" he said. ""This is exactly how we understand it all and we will react accordingly, because in this case we are talking about the existence of our country.""
Biden rejected Russia's assertion that Western allies were seeking to control or destroy Russia. He did, however, accuse Russia of crimes against humanity such as targeting civilians and rape. Moscow has denied previous allegations by Ukraine and its allies of war crimes and targeting civilians.
REACTION TO PUTIN
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Putin's move ""deeply unfortunate and irresponsible"". NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said it made the world a more dangerous place, and urged Putin to reconsider.
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters that the New START treaty and other instruments are important for the global security architecture, adding that ""on these important issues the parties concerned should continue to negotiate with each other in finding a good solution"".
Under the treaty that expires in 2026, the United States and Russia may physically check the other's nuclear arsenal, although tensions over Ukraine had already brought inspections to a halt.
NATO allies and other supporters have sent Ukraine tens of billions of dollars worth of war weaponry and ammunition, with modern battle tanks promised and some mulling President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's appeals for fighter jets and longer-range missiles.
Russia suffered three major battlefield reverses in Ukraine last year but still controls around a fifth of the country and appears to be making progress in eastern provinces bordering Russia.
Near Bakhmut, the focal point of Russian advances in the eastern region of Donetsk, 18 towns and villages came under fire, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said in a statement on Tuesday night.
The Russian defence ministry said its troops had made a 2.5 km (1.5 miles) advance towards the city of Bakhmut, seen by the Kremlin as a main staging post in capturing other towns further west in Donetsk region.
""It is very important that despite great pressure on our forces, the front line has undergone no change,"" Ukraine's Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address.
Outspoken Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin chastised military leaders, accusing them of depriving his Wagner fighters of munitions in what he called a treasonous attempt to destroy his private military company. The defence ministry rejected his initial accusations about blocking ammunition as ""absolutely untrue"".
Reuters was not able to verify battlefield reports.
The biggest land war in Europe since World War Two has displaced millions, left Ukrainian cities, towns and villages in ruins and disrupted the global economy. More than 8,000 civilians have been recorded killed, the U.N. human rights office said, adding thousands more were thought to have died.
Meanwhile, investigations by Denmark, Germany and Sweden into explosions last September on the Nord Stream gas pipelines have not yet concluded, the three countries said on Tuesday as the U.N.

""We are mostly worried for our lives.""More than 41,000 people were killed in Turkey in the initial quake, officials say, while the toll in neighbouring Syria stands at around 6,000.President Tayyip Erdogan said 865,000 people are living in tents and 23,500 in containers, while 376,000 are in student dormitories and public guesthouses outside the earthquake zone.With so many buildings destroyed, up to 210 million tonnes of rubble will need to be cleared, United Nations' Development Programme (UNDP) Turkey representative Louisa Vinton said.""It would take an area of 7 million square metres (75.5 million sq feet) to dispose of that rubble. It's a huge task ahead,"" Vinton said.Erdogan's government has faced criticism about what many Turks said was a slow response, and over construction policies that meant thousands of apartment buildings collapsed, trapping victims under rubble.""It is our duty to hold the wrongdoers accountable before the law,"" Erdogan said in the southern province of Osmaniye.In power for two decades, he faces presidential and parliamentary elections in May, although the disaster could prompt a delay in the vote. Even before the quakes, opinion polls showed he was under pressure from a cost of living crisis, which could worsen as the disaster has disrupted agricultural production.SWIFT REBUILD PROMISEDErdogan has promised a swift reconstruction effort, although experts say it could be a recipe for another disaster if safety steps are sacrificed in the race to rebuild.""We won't run away from the ballot box or disregard democracy,"" said Devlet Bahceli, an Erdogan ally and leader of the nationalist party MHP, adding that the opposition was ""obsessed and delusional"" for criticising the government's earthquake response and for discussing the election timing.""Turkey ... will bury you at the ballot box soon,"" he said.In Antakya, one man hugged and consoled another who was crying after news about people killed in the already shattered city after they had entered a building to retrieve possessions when the latest earthquake struck, bringing the structure down.A rescue team lowered one of the dead, covered in a yellow bag, down a ladder from the destroyed apartment block, before it was placed in a coffin to be transported in a municipal van.In Syria, already shattered by more than a decade of war, most deaths have been in the northwest, where the United Nations said 4,525 people were killed. The area is controlled by insurgents at war with President Bashar al-Assad.Syria said 1,414 people were killed in areas under government control.(Additional reporting by Timour Azhari, Ezgi Erkoyun, Nevzat Devranoglu, Daren Butler, Jonathan Spicer and Emma Farge; Writing by Stephen Coates and Dominic Evans; Editing by Michael Georgy, Edmund Blair, Alex Richardson and Sandra Maler)",2023/2/22,138,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817680,2 brothers charged in arena slaying during basketball game,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — Two brothers have been charged in a stabbing death at a New Jersey arena during a high school basketball tournament game last week, authorities said Tuesday.

            Kareem Finney, 25, and Kahli Finney, 20, both of Trenton, are charged with first-degree murder and third-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose in the death of Khalil Glanton, 23, of Trenton. Authorities found Glanton stabbed after a fight that broke out following a game Thursday night at the CURE Insurance Arena in Trenton, according to Mercer County prosecutors.

            Kareen Finney held Glanton while his younger brother repeatedly stabbed him, investigators allege, citing video and witness interviews. Investigators also discovered that the brothers had an ongoing dispute with the victim over a female, prosecutors said.











            It's unclear whether the defendants have attorneys who could comment on the allegations. A phone number listed for Kareem Finney rang unanswered and then disconnected, and a listed phone number for Kahli Finney couldn't be found Tuesday night.

            The Trenton City Council, which said Monday that most of its members were at the game, called for “a full and thorough investigation” by the county improvement authority into security measures that night and throughout the tournament. The council also wants Trenton police to investigate “any possible security breakdowns or breaches.”

            Mayor W. Reed Gusciora earlier called for the county to look into security breaches at the arena, saying officials must ensure adequate training for all county personnel “who operate a metal detector.” Gusciora vowed additional security for the first round of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association tournament on Tuesday at Trenton Central High School.TRENTON, N.J.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817681,"Alabama hoops star delivered gun in shooting, police say","TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — University of Alabama basketball star Brandon Miller brought a teammate the gun that was used in a fatal January shooting near campus, an investigator testified Tuesday.

            Miller, a freshman standout, brought Darius Miles' gun to him on the night of the shooting after Miles texted him and asked him to do so, Tuscaloosa Police investigator Brandon Culpepper testified, according to news outlets.

            The allegation of Miller's involvement on the night of the Jan. 15 shooting came during a preliminary hearing for Miles and Michael Davis, who face capital murder charges for the death of 23-year-old Jamea Harris.











            Former Tide player Miles is accused of providing his gun to Davis, who fired it and killed Harris, prosecutors say.

            
                Alabama coach Nate Oats told reporters Tuesday the team has been aware that Miller allegedly brought Miles the gun, but the team's leading scorer is not in “any type of trouble.” He has started every game since the shooting.

            Miller was just in “the wrong spot at the wrong time,” Oats said, later clarifying what he termed his “unfortunate remarks” after receiving criticism on social media.

            “We’ve known the situation,"" Oats said in a news conference Tuesday. ""We’ve been fully cooperating with law enforcement the entire time. I mean, the whole situation is just sad. The team closed practice with a prayer for the situation today, knowing that we had this trial today. You think of Jamea and her family,” Oats said.

            Miller has not been criminally charged. A team representative did not immediately know if Miller had an attorney.

            “We knew about that,"" Oats said. “You can’t control everything everybody does outside of practice. Nobody knew that was going to happen. College kids are out. Brandon hasn’t been in any type of trouble, nor is he in any type of trouble in this case. Like the wrong spot at the wrong time.”

            Oats acknowledged in his later statement that those remarks “came across poorly” and sought to clarify,

            “We were informed by law enforcement of other student-athletes being in the vicinity, and law enforcement has repeatedly told us that no other student-athletes were suspects,"" Oats said. ""They were witnesses only. Our understanding is that they have all been fully truthful and cooperative.

            “In no way did I intend to downplay the seriousness of this situation or the tragedy of that night. My prayers continue to go out to Jamea Harris’s family.”

            The 6-foot-9 Miller is the biggest star of the second-ranked Tide team that had its first AP Poll No. 1 ranking in 20 years last week. He is projected to be an NBA Draft lottery pick.

            The shooting occurred on the Strip, a business district of bars and restaurants that cater to students near the Tuscaloosa campus. Harris was sitting in the passenger seat of a car when she was struck by a bullet, police said.

            Investigators wrote in a court document that Miles, who had been a junior reserve forward on the team, admitted to providing the gun used in the fatal shooting, but Davis fired the weapon.

            Culpepper said Tuesday that Miles told Davis where his gun was in Miller’s car.

            Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented diverging accounts of the shooting. Chief Deputy District Attorney Paula Whitley told the judge that there was ample evidence to proceed with the case against Miles and Davis.

            A defense lawyer suggested during Tuesday's hearing that Miles was reacting defensively when he told Davis where the gun was located. 

            “The reason that the gun was provided to Michael Davis was for protection,” Mary Turner argued.

            Defense lawyers asked for Davis and Miles to be released on bond. District Judge Joanne Jannik did not immediately issue a decision on the bond request.

            Both Davis and Miles wiped away tears as their mothers' took to the stand to testify that they would make sure their sons would follow rules if granted bond.

            After court, Harris' mother told reporters that she is frustrated by the focus on basketball when the shooting claimed the life of her daughter.

            “She has a 5-year-old son that is still waiting for his mother to come home,” DeCarla Heard told reporters. “I want justice for my grandson.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817682,Avalanche in Washington's Cascade Mountains kills 3,"SEATTLE (AP) — Heavy snowfall and high winds on Tuesday kept searchers away from a remote, jagged peak in Washington’s Cascade Mountains, where an avalanche killed three climbers from the northeastern U.S. over the weekend. 

            The slide struck Sunday as a group of six climbers were ascending a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653 meters) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Seattle in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Chelan County sheriff's Sgt. Jason Reinfeld said Tuesday.

            Four of the climbers were swept about 500 feet (152 meters) down the slope. One of the four survived, a 56-year-old man from New York, and despite some injuries he was able to confirm that the other three were killed before working his way back to their base camp at Colchuck Lake, Reinfeld said.











            The two members of the climbing party who were not swept away did not immediately descend to base camp, but remained about two-thirds of the way up the gulley — called a couloir — and saw three additional avalanches come down, burying two of the deceased climbers.

            A seventh member of the group, one who remained at base camp rather than participate in Sunday's climb, hiked out to get help — an arduous overnight journey that included a descent of about 4,000 vertical feet (1,219 meters) over 8 miles (12.9 kilometers). He was able to contact the sheriff's office by 8 a.m. Monday to relay what had happened, Reinfeld said.

            A mountain rescue team reached the base camp early that afternoon but decided against venturing above the lake due to the avalanche risk.

            The searchers returned with the surviving climbers on Monday and declined to even attempt to reach the area on Tuesday amid a heavy snowstorm and wind gusts of up to 60 mph (96.6 kmh). 

            Members of the Northwest Avalanche Center and mountain rescue crews planned to head back on Wednesday to assess the hazards at the scene, Reinfeld said.

            Those killed were identified as a 53-year-old man from Connecticut, a 60-year-old woman from New York and a 66-year-old man from New Jersey. Reinfeld said the group had some mountaineering experience, but he did not know the extent of it.

            The avalanche was the the deadliest in the U.S. since four backcountry skiers were killed in an avalanche in Utah two years ago.SEATTLE (AP) — Heavy snowfall and high winds on Tuesday kept searchers away from a remote, jagged peak in Washington’s Cascade Mountains, where an avalanche killed three climbers from the northeastern U.S. over the weekend.The slide struck Sunday as a group of six climbers were ascending a steep, snow-packed gulley on the 8,705-foot (2,653 meters) Colchuck Peak, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Seattle in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, Chelan County sheriff's Sgt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817684,Bulls sign Beverley after ruling injured Ball out for season,"CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bulls signed veteran point guard Patrick Beverley on Tuesday and ruled point guard Lonzo Ball out for the season because of lingering discomfort in his surgically repaired left knee.

            The Bulls brought in Beverley to help solidify a position that has been a sore spot all season with Ball recovering from his second left knee surgery in less than a year and his third since entering the NBA in 2017 with the Los Angeles Lakers. The team said Ball's focus now will be on resolving the discomfort he feels performing “high level basketball-related activities” and making “a full return” for next season.

            Beverley, a Chicago product, is a three-time All-NBA Defensive Team selection. He has averaged 8.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists over 11 seasons with the Houston Rockets, L.A. Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves, and the L.A. Lakers. He averaged 6.4 points in 45 games for the Lakers this season before getting dealt to Orlando, which waived him.











            Ball hasn’t played since Jan. 14, 2022. He had surgery for a torn meniscus a few weeks later and experienced setbacks when he tried to ramp up basketball activities.

            The Bulls had him rest for 10 days at one point, hoping it would resolve the issue and allow him to return. But he felt pain again when he started preparing to play. 

            Ball was still unable to run at full speed or even walk up stairs without experiencing discomfort when he had another operation in late September. He said at the time he expected to play this season.

            Ball has been able to do some on-court work. He posted a video on Instagram last month of him dunking. But it became more and more clear that a return this season was unlikely.

            Ball averaged 13 points and 5.1 assists while shooting 42.3% on 3-pointers over 35 games last season — his first in Chicago. He helped set up stars Zach LaVine and DeMar DeRozan and gave the Bulls an elite perimeter defender.

            Chicago is 11th in the Eastern Conference at 26-33. Losers of six straight, the Bulls host Brooklyn on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817694,Malcolm X's daughter to sue CIA and FBI for wrongful death,"NEW YORK (AP) — The family of slain civil rights leader Malcolm X marked on Tuesday the anniversary of his 1965 assassination by announcing plans to sue agencies including the CIA, FBI, the New York Police Department and others for $100 million, accusing them of playing a role in his death.

            Two of his daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz and Qubilah Shabazz, were joined by attorney Ben Crump at a news conference at the site of the former Audubon Ballroom in upper Manhattan, where Malcolm X was fatally shot as a crowd gathered to hear him speak on Feb. 21, 1965.

            For decades questions have circulated over who was responsible for his death. 











            Three men were convicted, but two were exonerated in 2021 after a renewed investigation into the cases against them showed the evidence used to gain convictions was shaky and that authorities had held back some information.

            Ilyasah Shabazz, the co-administrator of her father's estate, filed notices of claim, which is the first step in the process, saying that the agencies “conspired with each other and with other individuals and acted, and failed to act, in such a way as to bring about the wrongful death of Malcolm X.""

            “For years our family has fought for the truth to come to light,"" she said at the news conference. “We want justice served for our father.”

            Emails seeking comment were sent to the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice and New York City's legal department. The DOJ and NYPD declined to comment.

            Crump noted the anniversary date and said that ever since then, ""there has been speculation as to who was involved in the assassination of Malcolm X.”

            He cited the 2021 exonerations and said that government agencies including the Manhattan district attorney, the NYPD and the FBI “had factual evidence, exculpatory evidence that they fraudulently concealed from the men who were wrongfully convicted for the assassination of Malcolm X.”

            Asked if he believes government agencies conspired to assassinate Malcolm, Crump said, “That is what we are alleging, yes. They infiltrated many civil rights organizations.”NEW YORK (AP) — The family of slain civil rights leader Malcolm X marked on Tuesday the anniversary of his 1965 assassination by announcing plans to sue agencies including the CIA, FBI, the New York Police Department and others for $100 million, accusing them of playing a role in his death.Two of his daughters, Ilyasah Shabazz and Qubilah Shabazz, were joined by attorney Ben Crump at a news conference at the site of the former Audubon Ballroom in upper Manhattan, where Malcolm X was fatally shot as a crowd gathered to hear him speak on Feb. 21, 1965.For decades questions have circulated over who was responsible for his death.Three men were convicted, but two were exonerated in 2021 after a renewed investigation into the cases against them showed the evidence used to gain convictions was shaky and that authorities had held back some information.Ilyasah Shabazz, the co-administrator of her father's estate, filed notices of claim, which is the first step in the process, saying that the agencies “conspired with each other and with other individuals and acted, and failed to act, in such a way as to bring about the wrongful death of Malcolm X.""“For years our family has fought for the truth to come to light,"" she said at the news conference. “We want justice served for our father.”Emails seeking comment were sent to the CIA, FBI, Department of Justice and New York City's legal department.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817695,Bent track a factor in Montana Amtrak crash that killed 3,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) — Investigators probing a fatal 2021 Amtrak derailment in Montana disclosed Tuesday that the railroad track was bent along a curve near the accident site, and the problem got worse as freight trains traveled over the area before the crash.

            Details on the bent track were included in hundreds of pages of investigative documents released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The three passengers who died and two who were seriously injured were in, or had just been in, an observation car that ended up on its side, the investigation found.

            Railroad safety practices are facing renewed scrutiny after a fiery freight train derailment released toxic chemicals in Ohio. The Feb. 3 crash of a Norfolk Southern train forced evacuations and raised public health concerns. 











            Investigators identified the problem with the track based on video footage, including from two BNSF freight trains that went around the accident curve within 90 minutes before the Amtrak derailment.

            After each of the freight trains had passed, the bend in the track appeared to get worse, investigators reported. Neither of the freight train crews saw the problem.

            “The Amtrak engineer also did not see the track misalignment before traveling over that portion of track. Investigators, who watched the videos and were focused primarily on detecting the track deviation, were able to first see the misalignment only a couple seconds before the trains had traveled over it,” the investigators said.

            They did not determine the final cause of the accident.

            Amtrak’s Empire Builder derailed Sept. 25, 2021, in northern Montana while en route from Chicago to Seattle and Portland, Oregon, with 154 people on board. The track is owned by BNSF Railway.

            The train was traveling just below the speed limit of 79 mph (127 kph) when its emergency brakes were activated, the NTSB said.

            Amtrak spokesperson Marc Magliari declined comment on the track issues raised in the report. A spokesperson with BNSF Railway did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

            Survivors described horrific scenes of people maimed and killed as four cars toppled and skidded down the tracks. Forty-four passengers and crew were taken to area hospitals with injuries. 

            First responders and residents of the rural plains near the crash site banded together to transport injured passengers to Chester, Montana, where they were given food and other assistance. 

            Killed in the accident were Margie and Don Vardahoe, a Georgia couple on a cross-country trip to mark their 50th wedding anniversary, and Zachariah Schneider, 28, a software developer from Illinois. 

            Rail safety expert David Clarke at the University of Tennessee said a track misalignment as described in the NTSB report could “certainly” cause a derailment.

            Former NTSB investigator Robert Chipkevich, who had not reviewed the findings in the 2021 crash, said track problems can be caused by issues including the quality of maintenance and repairs, the integrity of the ballast material that underlies the rails and excessive summer heat.

            “These conditions can change certainly after a heavy freight train passes over it,” Chipkevich said. “If it wasn't noticed by a crew member, then you have several tons of train crossing over that so it could change.”

            The Vardahoes were reportedly in the vestibule — the space between the observation car and a coach car behind it — when the derailment happened and were thrown from the train, investigators found. Don Vardahoe, 74, ended up under the observation car while Margie Vardahoe, 72, suffered a fatal head injury when she struck equipment along the track, a report said. 

            All but two of the windows on the observation car fell out during the derailment and the other fatality, Schneider, 28, and three other people were ejected from the car, investigators found. 

            Attorneys for the estates of the Vardahoes and Schneider did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment on Tuesday. 

            Schneider was dragged or rolled on the ground. Another man in the observation car suffered serious injuries and ended up with his prosthetic legs pinned under the car, the report stated. A husband and wife in the observation car fell out a window and into a gap between the side of the car and the ground as the train came to a stop. The man suffered serious injuries.

            Rail accidents including derailments have been trending down in the U.S. as the number of miles traveled by trains drops. 

            However, the rate of accidents per mile has been going up, according to the Federal Railroad Administration. Railway unions contend rail transportation has become riskier in recent years following widespread job cuts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4817697,Musk's Tesla pay package under scrutiny in Delaware court,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Attorneys for a Tesla shareholder urged a Delaware judge on Tuesday to invalidate a 2018 compensation package awarded by the company’s board of directors to CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth more than $55 billion.

            The shareholder's lawyers argue that the compensation package should be voided because it was dictated by Musk and the product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. They also say it was approved by shareholders who were given misleading and incomplete disclosures in a proxy statement.

            Delaware courts often defer to the “business judgment” of corporate directors in decision-making absent a showing of wrongdoing. But attorney Greg Varallo argued that the Tesla defendants should be required to show that the compensation plan was “entirely fair” to stockholders because Musk was a controlling shareholder.











            Defense attorneys countered that the pay plan was fairly negotiated by a compensation committee whose members were independent, contained performance milestones that were so lofty they were ridiculed by some Wall Street investors, and blessed by a shareholder vote that was not even required under Delaware law. They also argue that Musk was not a controlling shareholder because he owned less than one-third of the company at the time.

            Tuesday’s arguments followed a November trial at which Musk denied that he dictated terms of the compensation package or attended any meetings at which the plan was discussed by the board, its compensation committee, or a working group that helped develop it. 

            Musk also downplayed the notion that his friendships with certain Tesla board members, including sometimes vacationing together, mean that they were likely to do his bidding. 

            The plan called for Musk to reap billions if Tesla hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones. For each incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company’s market capitalization grew by $600 billion.

            Tesla has achieved all twelve market capitalization milestones and eleven operational milestones, providing Musk nearly $28B in stock option gains, according to a post-trial brief filed by plaintiff’s attorneys. The stock option grants are subject to a five-year holding period, however.

            Varallo told Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick that Musk should be force to give back some, if not all, of the stock option grants he has earned.

            Defense attorney Evan Chesler said the compensation package was a “high-risk, high-reward” deal that benefitted not just Musk, but Tesla shareholders who have seen the value of the company based in Austin, Texas, climb from $53 billion to more than $600 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion last year.

            Chesler also said Tesla made sure that the $55 billion compensation figure was included in the proxy statement because the company wanted shareholders to know that ""this was a heart-stopping number that Mr. Musk could earn.”

            “Nobody’s laughing now,” added Chesler, noting that, while some Wall Street investors bet against Tesla, the company’s leadership in electric-vehicle manufacturing has transformed the U.S. automobile industry.

Multi-storey Xi Men Ding store in Taiwan and Causeway Bay store in Hong Kong are also turned into MIRROR GO GREEN Flagships to promote sustainable living.      The Low-Carbon Virtual Green Garden    At the same time, Watsons has developed an interactive inapp game in Watsons SG App to promote sustainability where Watsons members can create their own virtual Green Garden. By completing various green tasks from 11 February – 30 March 2023, Watsons members can establish a greener lifestyle through ""Skip it"" (Reduce); ""Bring it"" (Reuse) and ""Keep it"" (Recycle). The App will then estimate the carbon emission savings for each green task completed and Watsons will then match the carbon emission savings and sponsor relevant tree-planting projects in Rimba Raya, Indonesia. The project is estimated to offset 900 tonnes of CO2 and make a bigger impact on our planet in parallel to its green actions. Customers in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan can play the game on the Watsons App, while customers in Hong Kong can play the game via the MoneyBack app.   To reward Watsons members for completing the green missions, Watsons' all-time favourite Sustainable Choice products will be awarded when the designated number of virtual trees have been planted in the virtual Green Garden. The sustainable products include Watsons Green Tea Bamboo Toothbrush (1's), Naturals By Watsons Lavender Hand Sanitising Spray 60ml and Watsons Love My Glow Moisturising Capsule Mask (5's). Qualified members would be able to collect them from their preferred Watsons store upon receiving email notification.   Dance Challenge for Greener Lifestyle   ""GO GREEN"" is MIRROR's brand new song composed by the group. It will be aired in Watsons stores across Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan and it will be strategically aired in Singapore, reminding customers that green actions can be a part of their lives, and it can be as simple as snapping their fingers. Stores at selected participating Asian markets will be turned into MIRROR GO GREEN Flagship Stores to promote the message of low-carbon living. Furthermore, customers can participate in a dance challenge on social media to spread the impact of MIRROR across Asia and to create a more sustainable future.
