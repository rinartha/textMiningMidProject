https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800699,Strong wind suspends third round at Pebble Beach,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — A strong wind was more than just a menace at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. It brought the tournament to a halt Saturday because of two holes on one of the courses, and set up a Monday finish without the amateurs.

            Keith Mitchell made it through the worst stretch of wind at Pebble Beach, so strong that he hit an 8-iron on the 106-yard seventh hole. And right when he thought he was off the hook by getting through the ocean holes, the horn blew to stop play.

            “We knew going into today that those were going to be the tough holes. That was going to be the hardest stretch potentially all week,” Mitchell said. “If we could make it through that stretch in a relatively good score, I would be set up for the weekend.”











            He made it through, and after a big drive on No. 11 with the wind at his back, he suddenly had the rest of the day off.

            Peter Malnati was atop the leaderboard at 12 under with six holes left in his round at Pebble Beach. He started on the back nine along the ocean in benign conditions, and he was on the fourth green, coming off three straight birdies, when play stopped.

            Mitchell, playing alongside Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, and Joseph Bramlett, playing with Welsh soccer star Gareth Bale, were at 10 under. 

            Kurt Kitayama, the 36-hole leader, and Hank Lebioda were three shots behind. They were at Spyglass Hill.

            The culprit was the Shore course at Monterey Peninsula, particularly the stretch that runs along the ocean. Gary Young, the PGA Tour's chief referee, began getting reports that balls were moving on the greens. He said one amateur hit a putt and the wind began to blow it back toward the player.

            With a three-course rotation, play has to stop at all three courses. The PGA Tour was hopeful of restarting later in the afternoon, except the wind was relentless and the forecast didn't provide any optimism.

            The third round was to resume Sunday morning, and the amateurs had the option to return and complete a pro-am that will be only 54 holes.

            Mitchell was asked if he expected Allen to be among the amateurs to finish.

            “I haven’t spoken with him. But the guy was out practicing in the rain and the wind this afternoon when everybody was inside,” he said. “I can’t imagine him not showing up. The weather’s better tomorrow morning than in Buffalo right now, I can promise you that.”

            Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers was leading. His partner is Ben Silverman of Canada, and they were at 25-under par. That would point to some amazing golf by Rodgers, who plays off a 10 handicap and is getting limited help from Silverman, who was 2 over for the tournament.

            The 54-hole cut typically is top 60 to account for the 25 amateurs. Now it will revert to top 65 and ties, and it will be professionals only for the final round. Young anticipates the lead group getting in nine holes.

            The Monday finish will be the second time Pebble wasn't decided on a Sunday since Tiger Woods came from five shots behind to win in 2000. Phil Mickelson had to play two holes Monday morning to win in 2019, and Dustin Johnson was declared the 54-hole winner in 2009 the final round couldn't be played on Monday.

            The wind had been expected later in the day, one reason for moving up the starting times by an hour. Weather at Pebble, however, is rarely predictable.

            It arrived about three hours after the round began, and it was ferocious.

            Mitchell smashed a drive on the par-5 sixth and had 235 yards up the hill, and he came up some 30 yards short of the green. Then came the chip 8-iron down the hill at the picturesque par-3 seventh.

            With the wind and their backs on the eighth, in which the second shot is over a corner of the ocean, Allen hit 6-iron off the tee, and then he hit another 6-iron to 12 feet on the fringe. Mitchell and Allen were six shots behind Rodgers. 

            For others, it was tough to hang on. Jordan Spieth figured he needed to be 3 or 4 under through the opening stretch at Pebble. The wind showed up on the par-3 fifth, where Spieth pulled it left into a bunker and made bogey. He finished the front nine with a bogey and a double bogey for a 39, leaving him on the cut line.

            Mitchell had the toughest stretch of Pebble in the wind, but it was tough all over. Bramlett, who played college golf at Stanford, had 136 yards into the wind on No. 9 and hit 8-iron short of the green. On the par-5 14th, with the wind at his back, he had 210 yards up the hill and hit 8-iron over the green.

            “It's a guessing game,” Bramlett said. “We're just doing our best.”

            The nation's best 3-point shooting team at 41.1%, the Bulldogs made 13 of 24 (54%) from distance, better than their 14 of 33 (39%) inside the arc. They also made 11 of 12 free throws.

            McKayla Williams made 3 of 4 3-pointers and scored 17 points for Gonzaga (22-3, 12-1 West Coast Conference), which bounced back from having its 14-game winning streak snapped with a 77-72 loss at Santa Clara on Thursday. Yvonne Ejim added 16 points with nine rebounds.











            The Bulldogs remain tied for the league lead with Portland heading into next Saturday's game in Spokane, Wash.

            Jasmine Gayles scored 14 points for the Dons (15-9, 5-7), who lost the first meeting 63-52 after trailing by two with six minutes to go, and Kennedy Dickie added 12.

            Truong hit four 3-pointers, her last one in the final minute and Ejim's buzzer-beater from beyond half court, gave Gonzaga a 23-16 lead after one quarter. Williams' 3 gave the Bulldogs a 34-20 lead midway through the second quarter before the Dons ran off seven straight. 

            With Truong and Williams scoring 12 each, Gonzaga, which made 7 of 11 3-pointers, led 36-27 at the half.

            Brynn Maxwell, who has made a 3 in every game and leads the nation at 52.2%, made the first of her two triples in the third quarter when Gonzaga stretched the lead to 61-44. She was 2-for-4 for the game.

(AP) — DeYona Gaston scored 24 points and intercepted a half-court pass as time ran out to preserve No. 24 Texas' 68-65 win over Kansas to remain in first place in the Big-12 Conference on Saturday.

            Texas had a chance to put the game away from the free-throw line in the closing seconds, but missed three of four attempts, leaving the Jayhawks with an opening to tie the game with three seconds left. Sanna Strom's long pass to the front court was picked off by Gaston and the Longhorns were able to run out the clock. 

            Texas trailed 34-28 at intermission, but rallied behind Gaston, who scored six in a 12-4 run to put the Longhorns up 40-38. Kansas came right back behind Taiyanna Jackson's three-point play and two free throws to grab a 53-48 lead after three quarters.











            Gaston hit a jumper with 4:33 left to put Texas in front for good, 61-59, then made it a four-point lead with a jumper with 1:54 left. Holly Kersgieter's open 3 with 10 seconds left pulled Kansas within two, 67-65 and the Jayhawks immediately fouled Rori Harmon, who missed both free throws. Khadija Faye collected a Kansas turnover and drew a quick foul, but missed the first free throw with three seconds left.

            Gaston was 12 of 20 from the field, pulled down seven rebounds and had four steals to lead Texas (18-6, 9-2 Big 12). Sonya Morris had 13 points and Faye pulled down 10 rebounds.

            Jackson scored 21 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead Kansas (14-7, 4-6). Zakiyah Franklin scored 20 points and Wyvette Mayberry added 12.

            Edwards made 12 of 15 shots from the floor and 3 of 4 from the free-throw line for the Orange (14-10, 7-6 Atlantic Coast Conference), who snapped a three-game skid. Edwards added seven rebounds and blocked four shots. Joseph Girard III sank all nine of his free throws and scored 18, adding six rebounds and four assists.

            General manager Brian MacLellan announced the contract Saturday, adding to an already busy All-Star break for taking care of future business. The Capitals extended forward Dylan Strome for $25 million over five years on Friday.

            Like Strome, Milano has fit in as a new addition for Washington. He's now set to count $1.9 million against the salary cap through the 2025-26 season.











            The 26-year-old Milano has been a near-perfect bargain signing for the Capitals after joining them on an NHL veteran one-year deal after this season got underway. He has eight goals and 14 assists for 22 points in 40 games since getting called up from Hershey of the American Hockey League.

            Originally drafted by the Columbus Blue Jackets 16th in 2014, Milano split his first eight seasons in the league with them and the Anaheim Ducks. He went unsigned as an unrestricted free agent last summer despite putting up 34 points in 66 games with Anaheim.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800755,South Taiwan night market game operator faces suspension for dishonesty,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — An arcade game operator at Tainan’s Garden Night Market has been accused of purposefully “forgetting” to give change. The latest accusation comes just weeks after his business was suspended for attempting to swindle customers by charging NT$5,200 (US$173.44) to shoot darts at balloons.In a post shared to the Facebook group “Breaking News Commune” on Friday (Feb. 3), a woman named Tien Pei Shan wrote about her experience while playing a ball-throwing game commonly found in Taiwan’s night markets. “Each game cost NT$100, so my sister gave (the vendor) NT$500 and told him we wanted to play one game.”After finishing the game without winning any prizes, Tien and her sister prepared to leave. However, her sister realized just before they walked away that the vendor had not given her change.Tien said the vendor smirked that he did not usually give change, but that he “reluctantly” gave them back their NT$400. When the two went to the night market’s management to report the incident, they were told that the vendor often did such things and had been reported for his actions in the past.The Tainan City Market Administration Office on Saturday (Feb. 4) responded to the incident in a press release. The statement cited the night market’s management, which previously suspended the vendor's business for a month due to the earlier dispute over balloon darts. The administration office wrote that it would interview the vendor and possibly suspend the business again.In November last year, a woman who visited the Garden Night Market with her boyfriend shared their experience of being tricked while playing balloon darts. She accused the vendor of first telling them not to pay up front, that he would charge them after they were done. The vendor reportedly encouraged the customers to keep playing more games under the pretense that he was giving them more chances for free.When the couple finally won a stuffed animal prize and finished the game, the vendor told them that their bill amounted to NT$5,200. After negotiating with the vendor, they ended up paying NT$2,600.",2023/2/5,5420,Society

            Missouri used a 10-0 run established by a pair Brown layups wrapped around a pair of 3s by Nick Honor to reduce the Tigers' deficit to 45-41 with 10:38 left. But Mississippi State countered and went on to outscore the Tigers 15-2 over close to the next seven minutes to seal it.

            Andrews hit a 3-pointer and a three-point play to give Baylor a 62-57 lead with 6:05 left in the fourth. Lexi Donarski scored six points for Iowa State to get the Cyclones within 66-64 before Asberry hit a jumper and a pair of free throws to put the Bears up 70-64 with 1:13 to go. Baylor maintained at least a five-point lead in the final minute.

            The Bears' win overshadowed a milestone night for Iowa State's Ashley Joens, who scored 23 points and cracked the top 30 in NCAA Division I career scoring. The loss denied Iowa State coach Bill Fennelly his 750th career win.











            Andrews scored 20 points for the seventh time this season. Asberry had 14 points, as did Caitlin Bickle. Darianna Littlepage-Buggs had 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Bears (16-6, 7-3 Big 12).

            Nyamer Diew led Iowa State (15-6, 7-4) with 25 points. She made 3 of 4 3-pointers but the Cyclones were 5-for-24 as a team. Ashley Joens made 1 of 9 from distance. Donarski added 12 points and Emily Ryan had 12 assists.

            Baylor went up by seven in the third, but Diew, who scored 13 of Iowa State's 18 third-quarter points, hit a 3-pointer and a layup to get the Cyclones within 48-46 with 2:04 to go. Morgan Kane tied it with a layup and Joens made a free throw to give Iowa State a 49-48 lead heading to the fourth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800765,"James closes on NBA scoring record, Lakers fall to Pelicans","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — When LeBron James was pulling up his dribble to float an alley-oop pass to Anthony Davis, or diving into the stands in an attempt to regain the ball for the Lakers, he appeared far more concerned with immediate team goals than making NBA history.

            Yet, after nearly 40 minutes on the court, James couldn't stop Los Angeles from losing ground in the standings, even as he gained on Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's scoring mark. 

            James moved 36 points away from breaking the NBA career scoring record in the Lakers' 131-126 loss to New Orleans on Saturday night that ended the Pelicans' losing streak at 10 games.











            “I just want to win,” James said. “You know, you play the game the right way and see what happens.”

            James had 27 points to go with nine rebounds and six assists as he continued to close in on Abdul-Jabbar’s record total of 38,387 points.

            “I’m tired as hell,"" James said, but added, ""I’ll be ready to go on Tuesday,” when the Lakers play next.

            Brandon Ingram had his best game since returning 10 days earlier from a nearly two-month injury absence, scoring 35 points for the Pelicans on an array of drives and jumpers, sometimes in heavy traffic as he was fouled.

            CJ McCollum had 23 points, highlighted by a late 3 to help New Orleans close out the final 3:14 on a 9-5 run that kept the Lakers at bay.

            “We just continued to attack across the board,” said Pelicans coach Willie Green, whose team won for just the fourth time in 19 games. “Every guy on our team that touched the floor came in and played with force and played with confidence. That is what is going to take for us to get over the hump.”

            Davis had 34 points and 14 rebounds for the Lakers. They led by 12 when James' finger role made it 84-72 in the third quarter. 

            The Pelicans chipped away and closed the period with five quick points on McCollum's transition floater and Jose Alvarado's 3 after he caught a deflected inbound pass.

            That sequence cut the Lakers' advantage to 106-103, and New Orleans surged in front when Trey Murphy hit back-to-back 3s, the second from 27 feet, to make it 114-108.

            The game remained tight thereafter, but the Pelicans didn't allow Los Angeles to regain the lead.

            Murphy finished with 21 points and Alvarado 18.

            Jonas Valanciunas had 18 points and 14 rebounds for New Orleans but left late in the third quarter with a right knee injury and did not return.

            Russell Westbrook scored 15 points but did not play during the final 11 minutes.

            “Whatever decision they make, that’s up to them,"" Westbrook said, brushing off questions about the possibility of being shipped out of Los Angeles before the Feb. 9 trade deadline. “I’ve been all in since Day 1. I’m very supportive of my teammates. I compete every night.

            ""Whatever decision that they make, I’ll make sure I’m very professional like I always have been and always will be,” Westbrook added.

            James said trade deadline rumors should not distract the Lakers from what they need to do to win games.

            “It shouldn’t be an issue. The trade deadline happens every single year,” James said. ""You go out and focus, no matter what happens. You’re still a professional.”

            And while James said he didn't want to speak for the Lakers' front office about possible trades, he didn't quibble with the notion that Kyrie Irving, who has requested a trade and won a title with James in Cleveland, could help the Lakers. 

            ""That’s a ‘duh’ question when talking about a player like that,” James said.

            Antetokounmpo’s latest triple-double came two nights after he scored 54 points in a 106-105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. During the Bucks’ six-game winning streak, Antetokounmpo is averaging 39.4 points, 14.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800768,No. 9 UCLA routs Washington State 76-52; 13-0 at home,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Just over a week removed from a spirit-crushing loss to crosstown rival Southern California, UCLA gave itself an attitude check.

            Senior David Singleton gathered his teammates and reminded them that their time together is short. March is on the horizon and the ninth-ranked Bruins want to make a national championship run.

            “We’re playing for something bigger than ourselves,” Singleton told them. “I just wanted to make them think about it.”











            Jaime Jaquez Jr. heard his fellow senior loud and clear. It showed in UCLA's 76-52 win over Washington State on Saturday night.

            Jaquez had 24 points and a career-high 15 rebounds in the Bruins' 21st consecutive home victory.

            “We took the pressure off ourselves. A lot of times you get pressure from outside sources, media, people telling us this or that. Today we came together,” Jaquez said. “We played with a lot different attitude, a lot more positive attitude, not thinking about anything other than winning a game.”

            The Bruins (19-4, 10-2 Pac-12) own the nation’s longest active home winning streak, including a 13-0 mark at Pauley Pavilion this season.

            “It was closer to playing 40 minutes with the intensity that we want,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. “We needed it.”

            Washington State (10-15, 5-9) was without second-leading scorer DJ Rodman. The senior missed both games in Los Angeles because of illness. The Cougars were led by TJ Bamba with 19 points. Justin Powell added 17, hitting five 3-pointers.

            The Cougars lost to the Bruins by one point at home on Dec. 30 after leading for over 35 minutes in the game. This time, WSU kept it close early in the first half before UCLA twice pulled away to leads of 10 points. 

            “We did a good job of not letting them get comfortable even though they came out firing,"" Cronin said.

            The Bruins dominated the second half. Jaquez scored 10 of their first 15 points. He had four in a row to lead an 11-0 run that stretched UCLA's lead from single digits to 57-38.

            “He’s got great talent,” Cronin said. “He can do whatever you need him to do.”

            The Cougars committed 11 of their 15 turnovers in the first half. UCLA scored 19 points off WSU's miscues.

            BIG PICTURE

            Washington State: The Cougars are trending in the wrong direction with six games left in the regular season. They've lost five of six and two straight. Of their remaining games, two are against teams that are below them in the Pac-12 standings.

            UCLA: The Bruins have eight regular-season games remaining in which to preserve their Pac-12 lead. The biggest one comes at the end when they host No. 5 Arizona, the team chasing them in the standings. The Wildcats won 58-52 in Tucson last month, snapping UCLA's 14-game winning streak. 

            BETTER IN EVERY CATEGORY

            The Bruins were better than the Cougars in every category. They outscored WSU 36-12 in the paint and their bench outscored WSU's reserves, 17-0. Singleton had eight points off the bench to go with three rebounds, three steals and two assists.

            “I only have so many games left, so I decided I wanted to play my heart out,” he said. “It’s not even about points, it’s about the hustle plays.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800769,Thomas helps Nets rally from 23 down to beat Wizards 125-123,"NEW YORK (AP) — Cam Thomas scored a career-high 44 points off the bench and the short-handed Brooklyn Nets rallied from a 23-point deficit to stun the Washington Wizards 125-123 on Saturday night.

            Edmond Sumner also set a personal best with 29 points and Nic Claxton had 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Nets, who had their largest comeback win of the season and swept the regular-season series against the Wizards.

            Washington also lost to Portland 124-116 on Friday night after blowing a 20-point lead. The Wizards became the first NBA team in the last 25 seasons to lose on consecutive days after being up by 20 or more points in each, according to ESPN Stats and Info.











            Patty Mills added 13 points and Royce O’Neale had 10 for the Nets, who trailed 44-21 late in the first quarter.

            “We responded,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. ""Definitely a shift in our mentality and we got rewarded for it.”

            The victory came despite Brooklyn being without Kyrie Irving, who was out with what the team said was right calf soreness — a day after he told the Nets he wants to be traded, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press. Vaughn said after the win that Irving didn't attend the game and that the player’s absence was excused. 

            “We were all in agreement on him not being here tonight,” Vaughn said. 

            The Nets, who also played without Kevin Durant (right knee MCL sprain), T.J. Warren (left shin contusion) and Ben Simmons (left knee soreness), also lost Seth Curry (left adductor) and Markieff Morris (sore left knee) in the game.

            Kristaps Porzingis led the Wizards with 38 points before fouling out. Deni Avdija finished with 23 points, Monte Morris added 18 and Corey Kispert had 15 for beleaguered Washington.

            “What can I say?” Porzingis told The Washington Post. “It’s very similar games (with Friday’s loss), right? (The Nets) played together, stayed together throughout everything. And not that we didn’t give our all, not that we didn’t play hard — just some stupid mistakes maybe. And, again, it slipped out of our hands.”

            Entering the fourth quarter, Washington was clinging to a 99-92 lead but Mills, Thomas, and Yuta Watanabe scored eight points to help Brooklyn close to 102-100. Porzingis replied with a 14-footer and two free throws to extend the Wizards' lead to 106-101. 

            It didn’t last long.

            Mills and Sumner made baskets to cut it to 106-105, but Porzingis’ three-point play pushed the lead back to four. Thomas converted a layup and a two-handed dunk on Brooklyn’s next two possessions to tie it at 109-109.

            After Washington took a 110-109 lead on a free throw by Porzingis, Brooklyn went ahead for the first time in the game on Thomas' 3-pointer with 5:46 left. Porzingis knocked down two free throws to tie it again.

            With the Nets ahead 120-119, Morris gave the Wizards the lead again on a pair of free throws. But Thomas made a jumper, Morris had a pull-up jumper and Thomas made a layup and then a free throw after Daniel Gafford was called for goaltending and Avdija whistled for a foul — giving Brooklyn a 125-123 lead.

            Washington had a chance to tie when Thomas was called for a foul, but Morris missed both foul shots and the Nets got the rebound and ran out the clock.

            “We’re all pros at the end of the day. It’s not like only two people can play,” Thomas said. “A lot of guys contribute and play and help at any time.”

            TIP-INS

            Wizards: Coach Wes Unseld Jr. said before the game Bradley Beal was out with ""left foot soreness.” At some point during the Wizards’ 124-116 loss to Portland on Friday night, Beal landed on Trail Blazers guard Anfernee Simons’ foot. “He was able to get through, (but) you could tell there were some moments throughout the third or fourth quarter when he just didn’t move correctly,” Unseld Jr. said. “So he’ll get re-evaluated this afternoon, this evening and tomorrow.” Beal, in his 10th season, is averaging 22.4 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. 

            Nets: Much of Vaughn’s pregame availability was spent discussing Irving’s trade demand, which became public Friday afternoon. The Nets entered the game third in the Atlantic Division, fourth in the Eastern Conference, and sixth overall in the NBA. “I think you make this as simple as possible,” Vaughn said. “With the group, you’re extremely honest with these guys. ... So I think that’s the approach with this group: focus on today. That doesn’t change. We’ve been really good at just locking in and doing our jobs.”

            Kyle Filipowski added 14 points and Tyrese Proctor 11 for the Blue Devils (17-6, 8-4 ACC), who won their third straight and beat the Tar Heels (15-8, 7-5) for the first time in three meetings, including in last year's Final Four in the NCAA Tournament.

            North Carolina's Armando Bacot had 14 points and 10 rebounds for his 63rd career double-double, extending his own program record, Leaky Black had 13 points and 10 rebounds, Caleb Love added 12 points and RJ Davis 11.











            Roach scored eight of Duke's final 10 points, including the last four after Lively's tiebreaking dunk with 1:35 to go. North Carolina missed its last five shots, including a trio of 3-point tries in the final minute.

            The Blue Devils’ six-point winning margin matched their largest lead.

            Neither team reached 40% shooting but Duke outscored North Carolina 20-2 off fast breaks and was 11 of 15 at the free-throw line to only 2 of 3 for the Tar Heels.

            The stat sheet was fairly even at halftime when Duke led 33-32 except for one telling stat, a 16-0 advantage for the Blue Devils on fast-break points as they scored repeatedly off transition. 

            A 14-5 run erased a seven-point North Carolina lead — the Tar Heels' largest — and put Duke in front 26-24 with just under four minutes left in the half. A Proctor 3-pointer broke the fourth tie before Bacot cut it to the one-point margin at the break. Bacot had 12 points in the first half. Roach had 10.

            The game matched two men who played in this rivalry and are now leading the programs they played for: first-year Duke coach Jon Scheyer and Hubert Davis, in his second year for North Carolina.

            The teams will meet again in their regular-season finale at Chapel Hill on March 4. Duke plays at No. 23 Miami on Monday. North Carolina is at Wake Forest on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800780,Historical military building in Taiwan's Pingtung goes up in flames,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A fire broke out in Pingtung City early Sunday (Feb. 5) morning, which seriously damaged a historical military building.The fire began on the second floor of a building that was previously the main office of the Army’s paratrooper training center in the township's Dawuying area. The fire alarm sounded just before 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning, and the fire burned for several hours before it was extinguished at 4:10 a.m., reported China Times.The building was originally constructed in 1937 during the Japanese colonial era by the Japanese Army’s 8th Regiment. It was used by Taiwan’s military until 2019, when the paratrooper training center was relocated to an Air Force base in Pingtung City. Following the training facility’s relocation, the site was handed over to Pingtung County.The two-story structure was one of 13 buildings that were undergoing renovation and restoration to be part of a Dawuying Cultural and Creative Park. A separate portion of the training camp’s property will be used for the construction of a new hospital.The building that was damaged was planned to house a small military museum, and possibly a restaurant, reported UDN. It is unclear if any historical items were damaged in Sunday’s fire; however, the site is currently without utilities and most likely only held construction materials. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.Aerial view of the burned out structure in Pingtung, Feb. 5. (Pingtung Fire Department photo)",2023/2/5,1345,Society

            The surging Suns have won eight of 10 games, including a victory at Boston on Friday night, and have help on the way with Devin Booker nearing his return. The three-time All-Star guard has been out since Christmas with a groin injury, but dunked in warmups in another sign that he's close to coming back.

            “I wouldn’t read too much into it,"" said Suns coach Monty Williams, who didn't want to speculate on the chances Booker will play Tuesday night at Brooklyn.











            Phoenix started each half strong, leading 13-3 in the opening minutes and scoring the first eight points after halftime, to take and keep control against Detroit.

            “It was huge because they set the tone,"" Pistons coach Dwane Casey said.

            Chris Paul had 14 assists for the Suns' balanced offense that didn't need him to make shots, finishing 0 for 7 and without a field goal for the first time since March 18, 2017, when he helped the Los Angeles Clippers beat Cleveland by 30 points. 

            “It’s a great lesson that you don’t have to score to have an impact on the game,"" Casey said.

            Mikal Bridges scored 24 points, Cameron Johnson had 20 points and Torrey Craig added 14 points for Phoenix.

            “You don’t win eight out of 10 without moving in a good direction, but satisfied is probably not a word that I would ever use,” Williams said.

            Johnson had a knee injury in November and has been working his way back into game shape since returning to the lineup two weeks ago.

            “When he’s knocking down shots, it just gives everyone more room to operate,"" Williams said.

            Bojan Bogdanovic scored 23 points for the Pistons, who are vying with Houston to have the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft and a shot to select 7-foot-3 French phenom Victor Wembanyama.

            Williams is bothered that Booker, who he called one of the world's best players, was not selected to play in the All-Star Game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800810,Taiwan welcomes return of Spring Ox ritual on Lantern Festival weekend,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Celebrations are taking place across Taiwan this weekend to mark the first full moon of the Lunar New Year, with the annual Lantern Festival falling on Sunday (Feb. 5).In Tainan, an annual fireworks show and spring ritual known as “Welcoming the Spring Ox” (迓春牛) took place at the Matsu Luermen Temple, drawing an estimated crowd of over 300,000 people on Saturday (Feb. 4) night. Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲), presided over the event, where he whipped a paper-mache effigy of an ox as a symbolic gesture of prosperity for the year ahead.The ox was whipped at about 7:30 p.m., and then “released” into the crowd, where local people clamored to touch the ox and hopefully secure a piece of the effigy for extra luck. At this year’s event, the spring ox was ripped to pieces in less than three minutes by the massive crowd, reported UDN.Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che whips the Spring Ox, Feb. 4.

The current Matsu Luermen Temple was finished in 1977 and has hosted the spring ox festival for decades.Due to the recent pandemic, the event was canceled for the past two years. In 2021 and 2022, to avoid a massive gathering of people in the temple’s courtyard, temple staff instead burned the ox effigy and distributed ashes to those who sought the blessings afforded by the ritual.The city residents, local officials, and temple administrators were delighted that this year saw a return to tradition, with the annual gathering and fireworks show both going smoothly.Also in Tainan, Saturday marked the beginning of the annual Yanshuei Beehive fireworks festival, which will reach its climax on Sunday night.Fireworks over Tainan's Matsu Luermen Temple, Feb. 4.

            After the Clippers lost a 17-point fourth quarter lead, Nicolas Batum’s 3-pointer at the regulation buzzer tied it at 115.

            “I wish we could finish the game in the fourth quarter by making some shots to put teams away,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said. “But, big shot by Nico. Gutsy win by us. Nico makes the big shot and we controlled the overtime.” 











             The Clippers scored the first four points of overtime and never relinquished the lead. Leonard connected on all of his eight free throws in the extra session, finishing 12 for 12 from the line.

             “We got to do better,” Leonard said. “Second night in a row we had big leads against these good team and they’re coming back. They have fight in them and we have to be able to close them out.”

            Norman Powell added 24 points for the Clippers and Marcus Morris Sr. had 17. Los Angeles has won seven of nine.

            Jalen Brunson, who returned after missing a game due to a non-COVID illness, led the Knicks with 41 points. Julius Randle had 28.

            George missed a 3-pointer with eight seconds remaining, but Ivica Zubac got the offensive rebound and Batum made a 3-pointer at the buzzer.

            “As a team, if we didn’t start the way we played and played Knicks basketball, we wouldn’t have been be in that position,” Brunson said. “I am proud of how we fought. I am not really too worried about anything. The biggest thing to take away from this game was that my teammates fought. We will move on from that.”

            TIP-INS:

            Clippers: No one has played in all 56 games for Los Angeles this season. Mann has missed just one, while Zubac has the most starts (54). … Los Angeles had lost three straight games to the Knicks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800822,Heavy rain advisory issued for northern Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Heavy rain accompanied the traditional start of Lantern Festival on Sunday (Feb.5), dampening festivities in many urban centers in northern Taiwan.
A heavy rain advisory was issued by the Central Weather Bureau, from this morning through the late afternoon as more moisture from China will affect Taiwan. Areas included in the advisory include Keelung’s North Coast, Lanyu, and Green Island.

            According to a report by well-known meteorologist, Wu Der-rong (吳德榮), a cloud system will cover northern and eastern parts of Taiwan both today and tomorrow (Jan. 6), potentially leading to shows and heavy rain. Cloud cover will also increase in central areas with intermittent showers being a possibility.

            Wu says the current weather front will continue to keep temperatures low, with temperatures in the north ranging between 15 to 21 C, while central areas will experience temperatures of 14 to 28 C, the south encountering a wider temperature range of 15 to 30 C, and the east ranging from 16 to 27 C.

            The latest model simulations show that there will still be some rain in northern and eastern areas on Tuesday (Feb. 7), with the possibility of rain continuing through Wednesday and Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800844,Antetokounmpo has triple-double; Bucks win 7th straight,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had a triple-double with 35 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists and the Milwaukee Bucks beat the short-handed Miami Heat 123-115 on Saturday night for their seventh straight victory.

            “You kind of know what to expect from the Miami team,"" Antetokounmpo said. “We’ve played them so many times. I’ve played them so many times throughout my years. They’re going to help one another. They're going to be aggressive on defense. You’ve just got to make the right pass, just keep oon being aggressive and making as many good decisionsn as you can throughout the game.""

            Jimmy Butler scored 32 points and Tyler Herro added 24 for the Heat, who had just nine available players. Notable injured Miami players included Kyle Lowry (sore left knee) and Victor Oladipo (sprained right ankle).











            Antetokounmpo had his third triple-double of the season and 32nd of his career. The 11 assists matched his season high.

            “We know that Miami’s going to throw a lot of people at him, a lot of bodies,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. “He’s got to be willing to pass and play with is teammates, and we’ve got to make shots. I think he did that. It starts with him being aggressive, him drawing extra defenders. His teammates have got to make plays around him. We did enough of that, had enough defense, particularly in the fourth quarter, to grind out a win tonight.”

            Antetokounmpo had 26 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in a victory at Minnesota on Nov. 4. He had 30 points, 21 and 10 assists in an overtime win at Toronto on Jan. 4.

            The two-time MVP's latest triple-double came two nights after he scored 54 points in a 106-105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. During the Bucks' winning streak, Antetokounmpo is averaging 39.4 points, 14.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists.

            Khris Middleton scored a season-high 24 points and put the Bucks ahead for good with a tiebreaking buzzer beater to end the third quarter. Grayson Allen added 19, Jrue Holiday 15 and Pat Connaughton 14. 

            “They're a great team, so they're going to find ways to change the rhythm of the game, change the pace a little bit, figure out a way to get back in the game,” Middleton said. “They did. ... We were just able to sustain the things we were doing and not let their changes affect us as much.”

            The Bucks gained a measure of revenge after losing consecutive games in Miami on Jan. 12 and 14. Antetokounmpo didn’t play in either of those games.

            Miami’s Gabe Vincent had a career-high 28 points in one of the Heat’s victories over the Bucks and 27 in the other. Vincent had just seven points Saturday while shooting 3 of 9.

            The loss completed a 1-3 road swing for the Heat.

            “You definitely have to go home disappointed,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “You have to maximize every opportunity when you're on a road trip like this. It's hard to win on the road. We'll gather ourselves.”

            TIP-INS

            Heat: This game represented a homecoming for Herro, who had his jersey retired Friday night at nearby Whitnall High School in Greenfield. Herro’s Heat teammates and Spoelstra attended the ceremony. Earlier this season, they attended a similar ceremony when Heat veteran Udonis Haslem got his jersey retired at Miami High. “The guys really do care about each other and want to support each other,” Spoelstra said before the game. “You also love seeing guys back in their old environment.”

            Bucks: Now that they’ve finished a four-game homestand, the Bucks are about to begin a demanding stretch of their schedule. They go on a three-game West Coast trip before returning home to face the Eastern Conference-leading Boston Celtics on Feb. 14.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800848,Gilgeous-Alexander scores 42 as Thunder blow out Rockets,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma City Thunder took what coach Mark Daigneault called a ""bloodthirsty mentality"" into Saturday's rematch with the Houston Rockets.

            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 42 points to help the Thunder blow out Houston 153-121. 

            They were disappointed in losing at Houston on Wednesday and responded by setting an Oklahoma City record for points in a game, surpassing the 150 they scored in a win over the Boston Celtics last month. 











            “Just (wanted to) be the aggressors,” Gilgeous-Alexander said. “Play our style, our brand of basketball. I think we got away from that a little bit in Houston, and we just wanted to get back on track.”

            Daigneault was most pleased that the approach was player-led.

            “It wasn’t like I was giving motivational speeches,” he said. “But, you know, as a team, they kind of banded together and decided that they were going to come out and play the way they did. And they were impressive because of it.”

            Gilgeous-Alexander set the tone by scoring 20 points in the first quarter.

            “I thought tonight was, like, a pretty big leadership statement game for him,” Daigneault said. “I think when you need a response like we needed tonight coming out of the other night, you rely on your guys that are most experienced, who play the most minutes.”

            Gilgeous-Alexander shot 7 for 23 from the field in the first matchup, but bounced back to make 14 of 23 field goals on Saturday, falling two points short of his career high. The first-time All-Star also made 14 of 15 free throws and had six assists for the Thunder, despite not playing in the fourth quarter because the Thunder led by 42 points at the end of the third. 

            Mike Muscala scored a season-high 19 points and Josh Giddey added 17 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds for Oklahoma City.

            “We’re a team that’s growing in confidence, and I think our habits are growing,"" Daigneault said. ""And I think a lot of things are moving in the right direction.”

            Josh Christopher and TyTy Washington each scored 20 points and Tari Eason added 18 for the Rockets.

            The Rockets were playing without Eric Gordon (sore right knee) and Jae’Sean Tate (right ankle injury). 

            Rockets coach Stephen Silas didn't want to hear it.

            “You’ve got to step up in these situations, and we didn’t do it,” he said. “We succumbed to back-to-back, three-in-four, no Eric, no Tate, all that stuff. ... We succumbed to it. That’s not — we’re talking about winning habits. That’s not one.”

            Oklahoma City led 79-53 at the break after shooting 55% from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander scored 28 points in the first two quarters, a career high for him in a first half.

            The Thunder continued to roll in the third quarter, making 16 of 26 field goals in the period to go up 123-81 heading into the fourth.

            Oklahoma City set the Thunder single-game scoring record on a 3-pointer by Darius Bazley that banked in during the final minute.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800849,Zach LaVine scores 36 as Bulls beat Trail Blazers 129-121,"CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago Bulls tried all sorts of defensive coverages on Damian Lillard. He kept scoring anyway.

            Just not enough to hold down Zach LaVine and company.

            LaVine scored 36 points, DeMar DeRozan had 27 and the Bulls topped Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers 129-121 on Saturday night.











            Nikola Vucevic added 23 points and 11 rebounds as Chicago won for the third time in four games, erasing a 17-point deficit in the second half. Ayo Dosunmu had 13 points, including a key 3-pointer in the third quarter.

            The Bulls shot 60% (48 for 80) from the field and finished with 32 assists.

            “We were able to get in transition, get some easy baskets,” LaVine said. “Then when they started doubling, it was just picking it out where the rotation was.”

            Lillard scored 40 points for Portland, and Anfernee Simons had 27. But the Trail Blazers looked a little tired in the second half of their third game in four nights.

            Portland had won five of six, including a 124-116 victory at Washington on Friday after trailing the Wizards 69-51 at halftime.

            “I think it is a factor. You start to feel some fatigue,"" Lillard said. “You have some mistakes and some breakdowns and stuff like that, and I think that's probably something that comes from being out there back to back nights.”

            Lillard and Simons took advantage of the absence of Alex Caruso, Chicago's best perimeter defender. Caruso sprained his right foot during Thursday night's 114-98 victory over Charlotte.

            Portland trailed by one with 8:07 left, but Chicago put it away with a 12-0 run. Vucevic made two foul shots to give the Bulls a 117-104 lead with 5:13 remaining.

            “Tonight, we just (weren't) able to weather that storm in the second half,” Lillard said.

            Portland opened an 80-63 lead on Lillard's fourth 3-pointer with 6:38 left in the third quarter. But Dosunmu responded with a 3 on the other end, sparking a 24-4 run for Chicago.

            LaVine converted a three-point play, a conventional 3-pointer and two foul shots to give the Bulls an 87-84 lead with 1:47 left. Andre Drummond's foul shot sent Chicago into the fourth with a 92-87 advantage.

            “I think that when we got down, we were in, I think, a mindset where we were trying to solve problems, and I think that's where we've got to be,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said.

            Lillard started heating up in the second quarter. The seven-time All-Star went 7 for 7 at the line while scoring 19 points in the period, helping Portland to a 70-59 lead at the break.

            HE'S GOOD

            Lillard is averaging 40 points and 7.1 assists over his last seven games. He is shooting 55.9% (85 for 152) during the torrid stretch.

            Dexter Dennis added 12 points for Texas A&M (16-7, 8-2 SEC).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800857,"India's G-20 energy meet to balance renewables, fossil fuels","BENGALURU, India (AP) — Over 500 energy industry heavyweights and 30,000 participants will descend on the southern Indian city of Bengaluru on Monday to discuss the future of renewables and fossil fuels at India Energy Week — the first big ticket event of the country's presidency of the Group of 20 leading economies.

            Speakers, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Saudi Arabia's energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman and the International Energy Agency’s executive director Fatih Birol, will discuss the need to ramp up the transition to clean energy. But the overwhelming presence of oil and gas industry stakeholders has raised questions from climate analysts.

            “This event will showcase India as a global powerhouse for energy transition,” said Hardeep Singh Puri, India's minister for petroleum and natural gas. Puri's ministry is organizing the event.











            But Puri added that ""India’s clean energy targets needs to be weighed against the country’s growing economy and rising energy requirements.” The country is set to become the world's most populous nation this year.

            India is currently the third highest emitter of planet-warming gases but has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2070 and dramatically ramp up its renewable energy capacity.

            Ahead of the event, IEA's Birol praised India's climate efforts, saying the country “can help drive the global agenda on clean energy transitions and energy security, with its focus on addressing technology gaps, ensuring diversified supply chains, scaling up clean fuels for the future, and mobilizing investment.”

            Most of the Indian participants at the event belong to either government-owned or private fossil fuel companies, sparking concerns from climate experts.

            “Gas expansion, which at least in India’s context does not make too much sense, needs looking into,” said Aarti Khosla of New Delhi-based climate think-tank, Climate Trends. “While India energy week talks about the role of gas as a bridge fuel for energy security, it is proven that there are risks ... banks are not lending too much to gas and global sentiment of investors is shifting slowly away from gas as well.”

            But others say it's important to keep the conversation with fossil fuels interests going as they remain key players in energy.

            “A country like India presently needs fossil fuels to keep the lights on,” said Bharath Jairaj, who leads the World Resources Institute India's energy program. “We can’t just assume some sectors should not or cannot be discussed, not until we find reliable, affordable and secure alternatives.”

            Stakeholders from clean energy companies will also be in attendance. Sumant Sinha, the CEO of Renew Power, one of India's largest renewable energy companies, sees the energy week as a forum to understand various stakeholders’ viewpoints.

            “A lot of global energy companies that we can potentially partner with will be there,"" said Sinha. ""And look, the reality is that even the oil and gas companies are shifting to renewables. Therefore its important for us to engage. It's always good to see what the rest of the energy ecosystem is thinking about.”

            India Energy Week runs Feb. 6-10 and will coincide with the first meeting of the G-20 energy transition working group. The Asian ministerial energy roundtable, where energy ministers from key Asian countries will meet, will also be held as part of the event in Bengaluru.

            The Mountaineers snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Sooners, taking control early and pulling away late. West Virginia held a 26-point lead at halftime. Oklahoma used a 9-0 run in the second half to get the deficit down to 20 points, but no closer.

            Stevenson scored 23 points in the first half and tied his career-high, 31 set just a week earlier in a win over No. 25 Auburn, four minutes into the second half on his sixth 3-pointer of the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800859,Curry injures left leg leading Warriors over Mavs 119-113,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Stephen Curry went down and the Golden Warriors once again had to fight like crazy to close out a game.

            Curry had 21 points, seven assists and six rebounds before injuring his left leg defending a drive late in the third quarter, and the defending NBA champions defeated Dallas 119-113 on Saturday night and the undermanned Mavericks team was missing injured star Luka Doncic. 

            The Warriors said X-rays for Curry were negative, and he will have an MRI exam.











            “Any time a guy’s going to get an MRI there’s a concern level, for sure,"" coach Steve Kerr said. “So we'll just have to wait and see the results.”

            Draymond Green added 17 points, nine rebounds and nine assists, while JaMychal Green scored 14 points and Jonathan Kuminga and Donte DiVincenzo each had 13 in another big performance by the bench that helped Golden State build a 40-23 lead after the first.

            Then, the Warriors had to hold on at the end again.

            “I think when we get down the stretch we stop doing the things that worked,” Draymond Green said. “When you have something that works all game long you don't go away from it.”

            Spencer Dinwiddie scored 25 points, Tim Hardaway Jr. 22 and Dorian Finney-Smith 18 points to lead the Mavs, who had won two straight and three of four. They had won the last three facing the Warriors and 10 of 12 overall in the series. 

            But Doncic accounts for 33.4 points, 8.9 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game for Dallas. He bruised his right heel in the third quarter of 111-106 home victory against New Orleans on Thursday night. Coach Jason Kidd said Doncic also would miss Monday's game at Utah then the team would see how he's progressing. 

            The Warriors have struggled closing out games and let the Mavericks get within 116-111 on Hardaway's 3-pointer with 1:28 left but pulled it off even with No. 30 watching.

            “I’m thrilled with the win, but I’m disappointed with the way we closed the game so we’ve got to do better,” Kerr said.

            Dinwiddie moved into the starting lineup for Doncic and shot 9 for 17, receiving a technical at the 6:10 mark of the opening quarter after an offensive foul called against him.

            Draymond Green and Klay Thompson each started for the defending champions after coming into the game listed as questionable; Green with a right calf tightness and Thompson a non-COVID illness. Thompson scored 14 points.

            Dallas began a second five-game road trip in about a month. It marked the Mavs' first visit to Chase Center since the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals with a Game 5 win in their Western Conference final matchup. 

            Golden State made 5 of its first 8 shots to jump ahead 11-2 and force a Mavericks timeout 2:36 into the game.

            Dallas won the first meeting this season 116-113 in November.

            KUMINGA'S FEAT

            Second-year forward Kuminga reached 1,000 points and at 20 years, 121 days became the youngest Warriors player in franchise history to accomplish the milestone.

            “He's a special talent,” Draymond Green said.

            TIP-INS

            Mavericks: With four steals, Dwight Powell passed Finney-Smith to move into 14th place on the team's all-time list with 355. ... F Davis Bertans, who exited Thursday with a strained left calf, is expected to be out until after the All-Star break. ... F Christian Wood (fractured left thumb) scrimmaged and did fine and will continue to progress in the on-court work. ... F/C Maxi Kleber (torn right hamstring) is improving and went through a good rehab session Friday, Kidd said. 

            Warriors: Andrew Wiggins continues to progress after a tough a stretch in which he missed 15 games and then another three with both a strained thigh muscle and non-COVID illness. He returned for the three games of the recent road trip and Kerr noted: ""I think in all three games on the trip he looked much more like himself physically and aggression-wise. I fully expect him to keep that going, and as that happens the shots will start to go in.” Wiggins had nine points on 4-for-6 shooting. ... Golden State got 16 first-quarter bench points and led 40-23, with 12 assists on 17 field goals. The Warriors wound up with 33 assists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800860,Fedor Emelianenko loses to Bader in Russian star's last bout,"INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — Fedor Emelianenko placed his gloves on the canvas and then cracked a warm smile while nearly a dozen mixed martial arts greats behind him led the crowd in one last ovation.

            Although the Last Emperor says his career is over, his fans and fellow fighters won't forget his greatness any time soon.

            Ryan Bader stopped the storied Russian heavyweight halfway through the first round Saturday night with a relentless ground-and-pound finish at Bellator 290.











            The 46-year-old Emelianenko says he is ending his 23-year MMA career with this bout, and he ceremonially laid down his gloves after the defeat in the familiar combat sports gesture by a retiring fighter.

            “On the one side, I’m sad I didn’t deliver on the fight as I wanted to,” Emelianenko said through a translator. “But on the other side, I’m so happy that all these fans and all these veteran fighters are here cheering for me.”

            The much-loved Russian MMA pioneer is one of the most compelling competitors in the still-young sport’s history, and the crowd at the Forum was firmly behind a singularly talented fighter who became a perennial fan favorite.

            That adoration didn’t help when Bader easily defended his heavyweight title by becoming the only fighter ever to beat Emelianenko twice.

            After staggering Emelianenko with an early uppercut, Bader knocked down Emelianenko with a punch that connected with the back of his head one minute into the opening round. Bader quickly pounced on Emelianenko and never let him up, steadily hammering his guard with dozens of punches until referee Herb Dean stopped the punishment 2:30 into the round.

            “It was bittersweet,"" Bader said. “I idolized him like every MMA fan and fighter coming up. He put the sport on his back. That is a legend right there.”

            Emelianenko was sanguine after the loss, and the fighter long known for his emotionless virtuosity couldn't hide his pleasure when he was joined in the cage by a large contingent of fellow MMA greats invited to the show by Bellator. Randy Couture, Chuck Liddell, Dan Henderson, Renzo Gracie, Frank Shamrock and former opponents Mark Coleman, Quinton “Rampage” Jackson and Chael Sonnen all gathered for the last ride.

            “I’m so happy to see all of you, the fighters that are here to come and support me,” Emelianenko said. “All of these guys understand me. We’ve almost the same age, and we’ve been to the heights. I’m happy they’re here to support me.” 

            Emelianenko began his MMA career in 2000 after serving in the Russian Army, and he quickly acquired a reputation as a vaunted underground talent in a sport that still felt like a countercultural phenomenon at the time.

            The slightly pudgy, slightly undersized heavyweight improbably recorded a long series of spectacular knockouts and submissions while fighting for the Pride promotion in Japan. He acquired mainstream attention when he began fighting stateside in 2008 while retaining the blank-faced earnestness and violent talents that made him such a favorite.

            “I’m very happy that some of the fighters who have been crowned as champions are telling me they grew up with my fights,” Emelianenko said. “Eight or 10 years ago, people were telling me that. This is when I started to think I was becoming old.”

            Emelianenko famously refused to fight for the UFC, eschewing the world's most powerful MMA company to maintain his independence, both promotionally and financially. He retired in 2012 before returning in 2015 to steady success.

            His first fight with Bader was a notable exception: Four years ago last weekend at the Forum, Bader knocked out Emelianenko with a massive left hook just 35 seconds in. Emelianenko had fought only twice since then, and just once since the start of the coronavirus pandemic — yet he still insisted on finishing his career against the 39-year-old Bader.

            The bout turned out to be the mismatch that many feared, with Bader thoroughly dominating in his third title defense. Bellator CEO Scott Coker acknowledged that he tried to set up a joint farewell fight between Emelianenko and Anderson Silva, the former UFC champion who is similarly far from his prime — but the Brazilian star turned it down, electing to focus on his boxing career.

            “But every time I talked to Fedor, he said, ‘I want to fight Ryan Bader, and I want to fight for the belt,’"" Coker said. “It was hard to tell him ... maybe he should fight somebody else. He had been on a run (of four wins in his previous five fights), and with everything he’s done for the sport, I felt like he deserved it.”

            Bellator 290 marked the promotion's debut on CBS. Both CBS and Bellator are owned by Paramount Global.

            In the penultimate bout of the main card, Johnny Eblen retained his Bellator middleweight title with a dominant decision victory over Anatoly Tokov, one of Emelianenko's proteges in Russia.

            Emelianenko says he is done fighting, but not done with MMA: He plans to renew his commitment to help Tokov and other fighters who study in his camp. Coker also believes he will keep Emelianenko involved with Bellator as a brand ambassador.

            “I’m going to dedicate my time to my coaching, to my team,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800866,"Nuggets beat Hawks 128-108, tie Boston for NBA's best record","DENVER (AP) — Jamal Murray scored a season-high 41 points, Nikola Jokic had his 18th triple-double of the season and the Denver Nuggets won their third straight game, beating the Atlanta Hawks 128-108 on Saturday night.

            Jokic finished with 14 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists and recorded the 94th regular-season triple-double of his career. Michael Porter Jr. added 23 points for the Nuggets, who are 19-1 in their last 20 home games and moved into a tie with the Boston Celtics for the best record in the NBA at 37-16.

            With the Nuggets' success, Murray said Denver has to be ready to deal with the best effort from opposing teams on a nightly basis.











            “We can’t underestimate any team. We’ve got to come prepared. We’ve got a target on our backs,” Murray said. “We’ve seen that, even today. They stuck in it for a while. We just had to lock in and we did that.”

            Dejounte Murray scored 28 points to lead the Hawks. De’Andre Hunter added 20 points.

            “This is a tough place to come back when you dig such a deep hole like as did in the first half,” Hawks coach Nate McMillan told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

            ""I thought they did a good job of making us earn everything that we got,” McMillan said. “We were making tough shots and I didn’t think we had the ball movement, but I thought it was due to their defense. They just made us work for everything on the offensive end the floor.”

            Trailing by 18 points at the break, the Hawks narrowed the deficit to 97-86 by the start of the fourth quarter on a tip-in by Onyeka Okongwu in the final minute of the third. Atlanta defenders had blocked the Nuggets’ last three field goal attempts in the third period.

            Hunter’s jumper with 5:49 remaining got the Hawks within 109-101. But the Nuggets, with Murray leading the way, responded with a 15-2 run that pushed their lead to 124-103 with 2:23 remaining. The Hawks never threatened again. Murray had 11 of his points in the late flurry, which Jokic helped get started with an alley-oop pass to Aaron Gordon for a layup for his 10th assist of the game. “It was such a weird game,” Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. “If you look at quarters one and three, we played no defense. Quarters two and four, I thought our defense was really good. Most importantly, the fourth quarter, 22 points allowed, a lot of good things for us and that allowed us to pull away.”

            Murray had 22 of his points in the first half, including a 3-pointer off a feed from Jokic following an Atlanta turnover in the waning seconds of the second quarter. That helped the Nuggets take a 70-52 halftime lead.

            Wallace made 7 of 10 shots from the floor with a 3-pointer and all five of his free throws for the Wildcats (16-7, 7-3 SEC). Toppin scored 17 on 8-of-16 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds for his fifth double-double of the season. CJ Fredrick hit three 3-pointers and scored 12.

            Colin Castleton finished with 25 points, eight rebounds, five assists and three blocks for the Gators (13-10, 6-4), who had won 6 of 7 and were coming off a 67-54 win over No. 2 Tennessee last time out.

            Toppin and Fredrick scored nine points apiece and Wallace added eight as the trio accounted for all but seven points in Kentucky's 33-22 lead at the half. The Wildcats scored the first five points of the game and pushed their lead to 20-9 on Fredrick's three-point play at the 7:48 mark.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800874,Taitung mayor pelted with fireworks at Taiwan's Han Dan celebration,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taitung hosted the annual “Bombardment of Lord Han Dan” on Saturday (Feb. 5), a noisy rite of passage for local men who subject themselves to baptism by fireworks in exchange for good fortune.After a two-year suspension due to the COVID pandemic, many were eager to resurrect the tradition which usually occurs a day before Lunar New Year. This year, Taitung Mayor Chen Mingfeng (陳銘風) was the first to test his mettle, as he ascended a sedan chair and braved the ensuing barrage.Taitung Mayor is all smiles ahead of the fireworks barrage. (Chen Ming-feng Facebook photo)Local custom states that the more fireworks one throws, the more good luck one can receive in the upcoming year. Up to a dozen men annually volunteer themselves to stand atop the sedan chair in the hopes that their physical discomfort will endear Lord Han Dan to grant their wishes. Others volunteer for such duties merely as a matter of tradition.According to his personal Facebook page, Taitung Mayor Chen said he was visibly nervous prior to the fireworks bombardment but thanked his constituents for their continued support and wished his actions could help his community finally get past the COVID pandemic and newly welcome a new peak period of tourism for Taitung.Chen kept a brave face amidst an onslaught of fireworks. He was protected by oversized safety glasses, a ball cap, pants, and long sleeves. His attire was distinctly different than the 10 men that followed him, who were stripped to the waist and wore headscarves paired with goggles.The only real protection available to those atop the sedan chair are banyan tree sprigs, which can be held at shoulder’s length, helping deflect fireworks too close to the face. Other protection is afforded by a small statue of Lord Han Dan which is affixed to a pole above them, providing spiritual strength.Han Dan celebration is not for the faint of heart. (CNA photo)Each bombardment session typically lasts between five and 10 minutes. Special attention is paid to safety and those atop the sedan chain can signify physical discomfort by raising a free hand. In addition to risks associated with gunpowder, smoke is also a choking concern and can make it hard to breathe, and hearing can also be damaged.Aside from Taitung’s Lord Han Dan activity, another firework-centric event was the Yanshuei Beehive Festival, where people position themselves in the direct line of fire of thousands of bottle rocket-like fireworks.Attendees at this event typically wear full-face motorcycle helmets, rain gear, and cotton gloves. Due to the danger involved in both events, local fire departments and police were deployed and on the ready in case of any incidents.",2023/2/5,1281,Culture

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800877,"Amanda Serrano now undisputed champ, sets up Taylor rematch","NEW YORK (AP) — Amanda Serrano finally has all four belts in her weight class.

            Next, she can have revenge on Katie Taylor.

            Serrano wore down a bloody Erika Cruz and won a unanimous decision Saturday night to become the undisputed featherweight champion and set up a rematch with fellow champ Taylor.











            They fought a thriller last year at Madison Square Garden and are expecting nothing less in Ireland on May 20.

            “The last fight was an epic fight and I think the next one’s going to be exactly the same,” Taylor said.

            Before that, Serrano got the better of a bout in which the fighters stood close and kept swinging throughout, emerging with the victory by scores of 98-92 on two cards and 97-93 on the other.

            Cruz spent much of the fight wiping away blood from near her eyes after a clash of heads in the third round. With the Mexican's light blue outfit turning progressively redder during the bout, perhaps Serrano was helped find the range with her combinations.

            Afterward, promoter Eddie Hearn said Serrano (44-2-1, 30 KOs) and Taylor, who joined him in the ring, would meet again. Taylor, the undisputed champion at lightweight, edged Serrano by split decision last April 30 before a sold-out crowd in the first women's match to headline at Madison Square Garden. 

            Back in the Garden, this time in the smaller Hulu Theater, Serrano found herself with another tough test, but this one went her way.

            And she thinks her next match will, too.

            “I've done enough and I will do more,” Serrano said of the rematch.

            The match with Taylor was one of the most significant in women’s boxing history and lived up to the hype, earning numerous fight of the year awards. Taylor won most of the late rounds to pull it out, perhaps a little stronger with Serrano moving up two weight classes to fight her.

            Back at her preferred weight of 126, Serrano appeared to be the fresher fighter Saturday. She won the final eight rounds on one card and the last seven on another.

            Cruz (15-2) held the fourth and final belt that Serrano needed to complete her goal of becoming the first undisputed champion from Puerto Rico, and made her work for it. 

            The fighters stood close — close enough to bang heads and open a cut on Cruz’s forehead — and traded combinations for what largely an even first few rounds. But the pace appeared to catch up with Cruz in the fifth, and fatigue might have been a factor when Serrano caught her with a good shot in the final seconds of the round.

            Serrano than accelerated the pressure in the sixth, the most decisive round of the fight. A quick, short right froze Cruz and Serrano followed up with a flurry that drove the Mexican from one side of the ring to the other. 

            The 34-year-old Serrano, a champion in seven weight classes who decided late in her career to focus on featherweight, smiled throughout the ring introductions. She pumped her arms to encourage louder cheers from her Puerto Rican fans — who moments later began booing when Taylor was shown on a large video screen in the arena. 

            Both they were all smiles in the ring together afterward talking about what will be the unbeaten Taylor's first pro fight in Ireland.

            “Now she deserves to fight in Ireland and it’s going to be a bigger and better fight over there,” Serrano said. 

            Alycia Baumgardner gave the 130-pound division an undisputed champion with a unanimous decision victory over Elhem Mekhaled. Baumgardner (14-1, 7 KOs) added the vacant WBA belt to the three she had held since last year, using a pair of knockdowns to cruise to scores of 99-89 on two cards and 98-90 on the other. 

            After a couple competitive rounds to start, Baumgardner landed a right in the third round that momentarily buckled Mekhaled’s legs. She quickly pounced and dropped her, and after Mekhaled (15-2) got up, Baumgardner swarmed her with a sustained attack that sent her to the canvas again.

            Baumgardner had Mekhaled hurt again in the seventh, driving her back into the ropes and appearing close to stopping her before Mekhaled was able to escape the round and they had a good exchange in the eighth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800878,Chinese balloon's downing creates spectacle over tourism hub,"MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) — The downing of a suspected Chinese spy balloon just off South Carolina’s coast created a spectacle over one of the state’s tourism hubs and drew crowds reacting with a mixture of bewildered gazing, distress and cheers.

            The balloon was struck by a missile from an F-22 fighter just off Myrtle Beach on Saturday, fascinating sky-watchers across a populous area known as the Grand Strand for its miles of beaches that draw retirees and vacationers. Crowds gathered in neighborhoods, hotel parking lots and beaches to watch the balloon hover, with some cheering just after it went down.

            The festive mood belied the seriousness of the situation, with law enforcement around the county of 366,000 warning people not to touch any debris and to instead call dispatchers.











            “Members of the US Military are coordinating to collect debris; however, fragments may make it to the coastline,” the Horry County Police Department said in a statement.

            Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, just inland of Myrtle Beach when she saw her neighbors gathered outside. Curious, she went to see what they were looking at. It was easy to spot the balloon in the cloudless blue sky, and what appeared to be fighter jets circling overhead. After the strike, she could see the balloon start to come apart and fall from the sky.

            “I did not anticipate waking up to be in a ‘Top Gun’ movie today,” she said.

            The balloon hovered directly above the Hardy family as they checked into their oceanfront hotel in Myrtle Beach. The family from Anderson joined several employees in the parking lot taking videos of the scene unfolding above before going up to their room ahead of the missile strike.

            Logan Hardy, 12, said the moment of impact generated a “boom” that shook the building. His room’s balcony gave the middle-schooler a clear view of the debris dropping.

            “It looked like stars falling down,” he said, adding: “I will never forget this day.”

            Some watchers rushed to nearby beaches as the balloon approached the ocean. Travis Huffstetler, who captured photos of the balloon, said the packed Garden City Beach almost looked like summertime on the chilly winter day.

            When the balloon began crossing the water, Mark Doss, 54, drove a golf cart three blocks down from his home to Garden City Beach. There, Doss said he and his two teenage children spent 90 minutes watching the strike and waiting in vain for debris to wash ashore.

            The sheer size of the white orb awed Doss, who said the approaching fighter jet looked like a model airplane. Doss recalled a “white puff of smoke” after the missile struck the balloon.

            “That one jet made a beeline straight to it — wham!” Doss said.

            Life continued uninterrupted for many others into the evening. Doss described the spectacle from a biker bar. There, Saturday night thrill seekers gathered like normal as if international tensions had not played out hours earlier 60,000 feet (18,300 meters) above them. A cover band performed while people shot pool and huddled around patio heaters. Along the Myrtle Beach Boardwalk, nightlife staff went unbothered by the day’s events. Others waiting in line outside a club had completely missed the news.

            But the severity of the growing diplomatic turmoil was not lost on Doss. He lamented the stress the events placed on his two teenage children, whose exposure to such sights had previously only come through the big screen.

            State Sen. Greg Hembree of Horry, who represents the area in the South Carolina General Assembly, watched the strike from his neighbor's backyard.

            The sight was both impressive and “a little bit scary"" for Hembree, who said Americans typically expect such images to come from other countries.

            “It was stunning,” Hembree said. “You don't ever think you're going to see a live engagement with an adversary in sort of a military context.”

            The ensuing debris spread across roughly seven miles (11 kilometers) and landed in 47 feet (14 meters) of water, shallower than officials had expected. 

            The next day, Brady Deal set out to go fishing, but ended up capturing video of what might have been a portion of the shot-down balloon being brought to shore in South Carolina. A Pentagon spokesperson asked about the footage declined to comment Sunday.

            Deal said he saw Navy personnel arriving at the Johnny Causey Boat Landing in North Myrtle Beach with what appeared to be a white, deflated balloon across the bows of two different boats. A third boat appeared to have a crane and boxes on it.

            “I was just in the right place at the right time and I thought it was pretty cool,” said Deal, a North Myrtle Beach construction worker.

            On Saturday, Deal posted a live video on social media when the balloon was shot down.

            On Sunday, “when I went over there and I saw the Navy boats, I was like, ‘Well, I guess they’re going to bring them back in today.’ So we went back over there and we hit it at the right time.”

            As a federal operation to recover the debris continued, life in the beach town largely returned to normal.

            About a dozen people strolled along Surfside Beach on the rainy, foggy morning. One couple spotted a ship in the distance through binoculars. A nearby bakery brands the area as “The Family Beach.” Locals described the town as typically quiet, save for the hullabaloo the previous day's hullabaloo.

            For Sandy and Bob Grubb, the balloon situation was not in the travel itinerary. The retired couple from Lebanon, Pennsylvania has been vacationing there for over 30 years. The two said they had been joking about the prospect of washed-up debris as they collected sea shells on their Sunday morning walk.

            “It's a quite peaceful place — gave us some excitement,” Sandy Grubb said, laughing. “Not the kind of excitement you need.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800879,No. 5 Arizona uses massive run to rout Oregon State 84-52,"TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona got stuck in Oregon State's preferred pace, forced to grind out half-court possessions. A litany of whistles further bogged down the game.

            The Wildcats still managed to build a 14-point lead.

            Once the whistles subsided and the floor opened up, Arizona blew past Oregon State for the type of rout typically seen in early-season nonconference games.











            Azuolas Tubelis scored 19 points, Courtney Ramey added 11 and No. 5 Arizona used a massive first-half run to blow out Oregon State 84-52 on Saturday night.

            “That was a woodshed job,” Oregon State coach Wayne Tinkle. “We came out in the gate and executed our plan, then the floodgates opened.""

            The game started like a trickle, successful foul calls accentuating Oregon State's measured pace. The Wildcats (21-3, 10-3 Pac-12) slogged through it, then raced past the Beavers with a 19-2 run to go up 26 by halftime. 

            Arizona had 22 assists on 28 field goals, grabbed 17 more rebounds and outscored Oregon State by 16 in the paint to win its sixth straight. 

            “I didn’t think maybe our overall energy in all stretches was great tonight, but sometimes that happens,” Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said. “To do that and put together an effort like that, and be able to play a lot of guys is an encouraging sign.”

            The Beavers (9-15, 3-10) brought one of the nation's least-experienced teams into McKale Center and had the game at the pace they wanted — for a little while.

            One of Division I's more deliberate teams, Oregon State prevented the Wildcats from getting out in transition early, the game bogged down even more by 21 combined first-half fouls.

            Once the Wildcats started rolling, the Beavers couldn't catch them, losing their seventh straight to Arizona. Jordan Pope led Oregon State with 11 points.

            “They're a great team, obviously well coached, but I think our youth showed itself a little bit,” Tinkle said. '""We got knocked on our heels.""

            The Beavers turned the first half into a grind, but Arizona was able to smooth it out just enough.

            Relying on defense and half-court offense, the Wildcats steadily built a 14-point lead in small increments. Arizona seemed to spend as much time at the free throw line as running its offense and took advantage, hitting 15 of 21 in the first half.

            The Wildcats finally found room to maneuver once the parade of whistles slowed, getting out in transition for layups and early-offense baskets.

            Led by Tubelis. Arizona closed the first half on a 19-2 run, capped by Boswell's deep 3 at the buzzer for a 47-21 lead. 

            “When I caught and put it up, I knew it was going in,” said Arizona guard Kylan Boswell, who had eight points. ”That was pretty crazy.”

            TUBELIS REUNION

            Tubelis had quite a weekend with friends and family from Lithuania in town.

            On Thursday, he scored 40 points against Oregon, the most by an Arizona player in 28 years. Tubelis needed 8 1/2 minutes to make his first shot against Oregon State, but had 15 first-half points. He finished 6 of 10 from the floor and and grabbed eight rebounds in 23 minutes.

            “He’s playing like a vet,” Lloyd said. “He understands where his opportunities are in the court and he’s doing a tremendous job. He’s having an All-American type season. I've coached those guys and he’s at that level.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Oregon State: The Beavers managed to get the pace they wanted in the early going. They couldn't sustain it — Arizona had something to do with that — and remain winless at McKale Center since 2010.

            Arizona: The Wildcats had to fight through a string of whistles and Oregon State's deliberate style early and still built a 14-point lead. Arizona blew it open with a big run that put the game out of reach by halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800912,Beyoncé emerges as Grammys queen; Styles wins album honor,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Beyoncé sits alone atop the Grammy throne as the ceremony's most decorated artist in history, but at the end of Sunday's show it was Harry Styles who walked away with the album of the year honor.

            The Grammys spread its top awards among other artists, leaving Beyoncé off stage at the end of the night. But the superstar was a constant presence throughout the night, even when she wasn't in the room, especially once she won her 32nd award and surpassed late conductor Georg Solti in all-time wins.

            “I’m trying not to be too emotional,” the superstar said after her historic win as her husband Jay-Z stood and applauded her. The singer thanked her late uncle, her parents, Jay-Z and her children for supporting her. “I’m just trying to receive this night. I want to thank God for protecting me. Thank you, God.”











            The Grammys stage at the end of the night has eluded Beyoncé since 2010, when she won song of the year for “Single Ladies.” She added four trophies to her collection for her album “Renaissance.”

            Styles was emotional accepting his album of the year award, saying he was inspired by everyone in the category. “A lot of different times of my life, I’ve listened to everyone in these categories. It’s so important to remember that there is no such thing as best.”

            The British singer-actor took home three awards Sunday. “It feels like validation that you’re on the right path,” said the singer backstage. “When we get in the studio and begin the record, we just make the music we want to make. It feels really nice to feel like ‘Oh, that’s the right thing to do.’”

            Beyoncé missed being in the room when she tied Solti’s record early in the telecast. Host Trevor Noah said she was on her way to the ceremony but blamed Los Angeles traffic for not being in person to accept it.

            Once Beyoncé — the night’s leading nominee — finally arrived, Noah presented her with the best R&B song award at her table.

            Beyoncé won for best R&B song for “Cuff It,” dance-electric music recording for “Break My Soul,” traditional R&B performance for “Plastic Off the Sofa” and dance-electric album for “Renaissance,” which was nominated for album of the year.

            Lizzo won record of the year for “About Damn Time,” delivering a rousing speech that brought many in the audience, including Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Adele, to their feet. 

            “Me and Adele were having a good time, rooting for our friends. This is an amazing night. This is so unexpected,” Lizzo said, dedicating her award to Prince.

            ""I wanted to make the world a better place, so I had to be that change to make the world a better place. Now, I look around and see these songs are about loving your body and feeling comfortable in your skin and feeling good.”

            Jazz singer Samara Joy won best new artist, shrugging off challenges by such acts as Wet Leg, Anitta and Maneskin. The New Yorker was virtually in tears when she collected the award and noted that her little brother was her date. “I’m so, so grateful. Thank you.” She has released two albums as a lead artist and also won the Grammy for best jazz vocal album earlier in the night.

            Veteran singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt shrugged off big-name rivals like Adele, Swift and Beyoncé to win the song of the year award. “I’m so surprised. I don’t know what to say,” a visibly stunned Raitt said, adding that the song “Just Like That” explores organ donation. It capped a night when Raitt won two other Grammys — for best Americana performance and best American roots song.

            A who’s who of hip-hop royalty took the stage for an epic, rousing 15 minute tribute to the genre’s 50th anniversary. The performance included Grandmaster Flash doing part of his seminal hit “The Message,” Run DMC, Chuck D and Flavor Flav along with Ice-T, Queen Latifah, Busta Rhymes and Nelly all taking the stage.

            It ended with everyone on the stage and LL Cool J shouting “multi-generational! Fifty years!”

            The performance was a crowd-pleasing moment for a ceremony that has long had a shaky history of not recognizing rap.

            Bad Bunny opened the show with a festive, high-energy performance that brought many of the audience including Swift who rose to her feet and danced near her table at Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena. 

            Sam Smith and Kim Petras won best pop duo-group performance for their song “Unholy.” Petras said Smith wanted Petras to make the acceptance speech because “I’m the first transgender woman to win this award.”

            “I want to thank all the incredible transgender legends before me who kicked these doors open for me so I could be here tonight,” said Petras, who made a reference to friend and Grammy-nominated musician Sophie, who died after an accidental fall in Athens, Greece in 2021. “You told me this would happen. I always believed in me. Thank you so much for your inspiration, Sophie. I adore you, and your inspiration will forever be in my music.”

            Petras thanked Madonna for being a tremendous supporter of LGBTQ rights.

            “I don’t think I could be here without Madonna,” Petras said. “My mother, I grew up next to a highway in nowhere Germany. And my mother believed me that I was a girl. I wouldn’t be here without her and her support.”

            During the in memoriam segment, the Grammys recognized the lives of Loretta Lynn, Migos rapper Takeoff and Christine McVie with several star-studded performers paying them homage. The touching performances included Kacey Musgraves singing “Coal Miner’s Daughter” in tribute to Lynn; Quavo and the Maverick City Music hit the stage to honor his nephew Takeoff with the song “Without You;” and Sheryl Crow, Mick Fleetwood and Bonnie Raitt performed “Songbird” to remember McVie.

            Kendrick Lamar won sixth career trophy for best rap performance for “The Heart Part 5” and also won best rap album for his studio offering, “Mr. Morales & The Big Steppers.”

            “You know, as entertainers, we say things to provoke thoughts and feelings and emotions,” he said. “So making this record is one of my toughest. … I would like to thank the culture for allowing me to evolve in order to make this. I finally found imperfection with this album.”

            
                Viola Davis emerged from Sunday's show an EGOT — a term for those who have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony — after her win for best audio book, narration and storytelling recording. The actor gave an emotional speech and emphatically said “I just EGOT” after she marched on stage to collect her award. 

            “Oh, my God,"" she said. ""I wrote this book to honor the 6-year-old Viola, to honor her, her life, her joy, her trauma, everything,"" Davis said. ""It has just been such a journey.”

            The show made its return to Los Angeles after the pandemic first delayed, then forced the Grammys to move to Las Vegas last year. Noah hosted the ceremony as well, which saw Jon Batiste take home album of the year.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800919,US states take control of abortion debate with funding focus,"LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Though the Insight Women’s Center sits at the epicenter of a reinvigorated battle in the nation’s culture wars, the only hint of its faith-based mission to dissuade people from getting abortions is the jazzy, piano rendition of “Jesus Loves Me” playing in a waiting room.

            The Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature is considering allocating millions of dollars in state funds to similar anti-abortion centers that persuade people to bring their pregnancies to term by offering free pregnancy tests and sonograms, as well as counseling and parenting classes taught by volunteers. They're also considering offering millions more in income tax credits for donors supporting what they call “crisis pregnancy centers.""

            When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and gave control of abortion policy to the states, it led to bans and restrictions in some states, and executive orders and laws protecting access in others. Those debates continue, but perhaps less noticed is how this change refueled the renewed battle over taxpayer money.











            Supporters say the effort shows abortion opponents are addressing families' social and financial needs. But critics say the amount of new funding proposed for organizations like Insight — either in direct funding or tax credits for their donors — fall far short of what’s necessary to improve people’s access to health care and address ongoing poverty.

            “You funnel money through a short-term solution that makes it appear as though you are doing something,” said Alesha Doan, a University of Kansas associate professor who has studied and written books about abortion politics.

            Increasingly, liberal cities and states are funding access to abortion, including telemedicine, which has seen a notable rise with more than half of U.S. abortions now done with pills rather than surgery. Meanwhile, states with GOP legislatures and governors are looking to put more taxpayer money into organizations that talk people out of ending their pregnancies.

            Legislative committees held hearings Thursday on proposals for a 70% income tax credit to donors who support anti-abortion centers, with a cap of $10 million in total credits. A Senate committee might vote this week.

            It's similar to a longstanding Missouri law that provides income tax credits to donors supporting anti-abortion centers. Arizona has such a law, and Mississippi's Republican House speaker is trying to expand a cap on tax credits to $10 million from the $3.5 million authorized last year.

            Arkansas and Oklahoma are considering adding similar tax credits, according to the National Right to Life Committee.

            In Missouri, donors to anti-abortion centers have received $15 million in total state tax credits over the past five years, and one state analysis estimates the centers served about 43,000 people last year.

            Abortion opponents have operated centers like Insight for decades, and the practice of conservative-led states offering financial aid to them predates Dobbs — the decision in June overturning Roe v. Wade.

            On the abortion-rights side, Oregon lawmakers last year created a $15 million abortion-access fund, with the first $1 million going to a nonprofit that covers the costs of patients' travel and procedures. California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Washington have also allocated or are considering offering public funding for abortions or related services.

            In New Mexico last year, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham pledged $10 million in state funds to the construction of a new abortion clinic.

            Morgan Hopkins, president of the abortion-rights advocacy group All(asterisk) Above All praised the funding. “Budgets are a reflection of our values,"" she said.

            Kansas already provides grants to programs that provide prenatal care, and encourage people to carry their pregnancies to term. But it spends less than $339,000 in a state budget of $24 billion on the program — and made only two grants totaling less than $74,000 to anti-abortion centers.

            Now, some abortion opponents talk about emulating Missouri's more than $8 million annual funding, plus the income tax credits.

            Abortion rights supporters are frustrated that the push for such support is coming so soon after an Aug. 2 statewide vote that decisively rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed legislators to greatly restrict or ban abortion.

            “I have general concerns that we’re not respecting what was the very clear will of voters,” said state Sen. Ethan Corson, a Kansas City-area Democrat who serves on the Senate tax committee.

            Abortion rights advocates say the centers lure patients away from abortion clinics with free services, give them inaccurate medical information and counseling from people who are not trained therapists. Some see funding them as a political gesture designed to make abortion bans look less harsh.

            Abortion opponents argue that centers like Insight offer patients a wide range of prenatal and post-birth classes, in addition to other help. They also argue that boosting funding for free services after the August vote is a promise not to abandon parents and families.

            In Lawrence, where the nearest abortion clinic is a 40-minute drive away, 28-year-old Korbe Bohac is still visiting the Insight center nearly 8 months after her son Winston was born. She told legislators the classes and counseling make her a better, more confident parent — and helped preserve her mental health. She called it “a safety net.”

            The Insight center, which is only a few miles from the University of Kansas, has two sonogram nurses, and a doctor and radiologist sometimes volunteer their time. But services depend mostly on about 50 volunteers. The $340,000 annual budget is mostly supplied by private donations, but the organization received a community development grant in 2014 to launch parent education programs.

            Center staff said that although they do not refer clients to abortion providers, they discuss abortion as an option. They said some patients who met with them went on to have abortions, though this is not possible to verify given patients' privacy protocols.

            Insight has two separate waiting rooms — one for its educational programs and one for medical services. Executive director Bridgit Smith said one reason is that it keeps pregnant patients from being influenced by seeing babies and toddlers.

            Smith said she believes the proposed tax credit would increase donations, helping Insight start a maternity home for people without shelter.

            “We’re trying to build strong individuals and strong families. And isn’t that what we all want?” Smith said. “Even for the woman that doesn’t choose to parent, we still want her to be strong and healthy after the decision.”

            Follow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna.LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Though the Insight Women’s Center sits at the epicenter of a reinvigorated battle in the nation’s culture wars, the only hint of its faith-based mission to dissuade people from getting abortions is the jazzy, piano rendition of “Jesus Loves Me” playing in a waiting room.The Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature is considering allocating millions of dollars in state funds to similar anti-abortion centers that persuade people to bring their pregnancies to term by offering free pregnancy tests and sonograms, as well as counseling and parenting classes taught by volunteers. They're also considering offering millions more in income tax credits for donors supporting what they call “crisis pregnancy centers.""When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and gave control of abortion policy to the states, it led to bans and restrictions in some states, and executive orders and laws protecting access in others. Those debates continue, but perhaps less noticed is how this change refueled the renewed battle over taxpayer money.Supporters say the effort shows abortion opponents are addressing families' social and financial needs. But critics say the amount of new funding proposed for organizations like Insight — either in direct funding or tax credits for their donors — fall far short of what’s necessary to improve people’s access to health care and address ongoing poverty.“You funnel money through a short-term solution that makes it appear as though you are doing something,” said Alesha Doan, a University of Kansas associate professor who has studied and written books about abortion politics.Increasingly, liberal cities and states are funding access to abortion, including telemedicine, which has seen a notable rise with more than half of U.S. abortions now done with pills rather than surgery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800921,Mahaney leads No. 18 Saint Mary's past No. 12 Gonzaga in OT,"MORAGA, Calif. (AP) — The clock counted down, the Saint Mary's players celebrated and the students stayed in their seats.

            Beating Gonzaga used to be a season-defining event for the Gaels highlighted by court storming fans. 

            After doing it for a second straight season with a 78-70 overtime win Saturday night, they want to show it's expected. 











            “We actually were hoping that they weren’t going to stay on the court for that reason,” star freshman guard Aidan Mahaney said. “We are making this a thing now where we want to be able to rival with them every time. This isn’t an upset or anything like that. We’re not going to just talk about it. We’re going to put in the work.”

            Mahaney did just that, scoring 18 points and taking the game over in crunch time to lead No. 18 Saint Mary's over No. 12 Gonzaga for the Gaels' 12th straight victory.

            Mahaney scored or assisted on 19 of 21 points in a stretch that started with the Gaels (21-4, 10-0 West Coast Conference) trailing by four points with five minutes to play in regulation. 

            The freshman shook off a rough start to the game and put Saint Mary's in control in overtime when he banked in a 3-pointer and then found Mitchell Saxen with a no-look pass for a layup that made it 70-64.

            “He just has it,” coach Randy Bennett said. ""A lot of guys would fold and just kind of hang their head and just kind of finish the game like that. That’s where he’s kind of special. He’s got great belief and he really, really competes to win. That’s where he’s special.”

            The Bulldogs (19-5, 8-2), who didn't trail for the final 37 minutes of regulation, couldn't catch up and fell two games behind in the conference race. 

            Drew Timme scored 23 points to lead Gonzaga, but got little help offensively from the rest of his team.

            “It was hard to generate offense, especially down the stretch,” coach Mark Few said. ""It got really, really physical

            Saxen added 15 points for Saint Mary's and Alex Ducas scored 14.

            The Gaels have been the only team really to challenge the Bulldogs in the WCC for more than the past decade, with their 10 wins against Gonzaga since the start of the 2009-10 season more than triple the second-best team. 

            This was the 10th time these teams have met when both were ranked, with Gonzaga winning eight of the first nine. But the Gaels came into this one as the favorite for a change and followed up last year's home win over the Bulldogs with another one. 

            “I don’t know if I’ve been part of a better game,” Bennett said. “Two really good teams. Unbelievable crowd.”

            Saint Mary's played from behind for most of the night as Gonzaga got out to an 11-point lead in the first half.

            But the Gaels got back into it late in the second half. 

            Mahaney, who started the game 1 for 10, hit four straight drives to help Saint Mary's tie it at 57 with 3:22 to play. 

            “I just trusted myself and trusted the work I put in,” Mahaney said. “I figure the ball is going to go in eventually if I just keep trusting and keep shooting. It’s just about confidence. My confidence isn’t fake because I work.” 

            The teams traded baskets in the final minute of regulation with Julian Strawther hitting a floater with 33.8 seconds left and Saxen answering with 5.5 seconds remaining for Saint Mary's to send it to overtime.

            BIG PICTURE

            Gonzaga: Timme moved past Jim McPhee (2,015 points) for second place on Gonzaga's career scoring list with 2,031 points. He again came up in key spots for the Bulldogs and still has a shot to break Frank Burgess' school record of 2,196 points.

            Saint Mary’s: The Gaels didn't get much from Johnson, who fouled out with 4:51 to play after shooting just 4 of 14 from the field for 12 points. But Mahaney carried them down the stretch to get the win.

The traditional blessing ceremony is done to bestow local fishing boats with good fortune, ensuring safe passage into the open ocean and a return to harbor with full loads of seafood. After a two-year suspension due to the pandemic, many were eager to participate in the festival coinciding with the Lantern Festival.

            At 9:00 a.m. on Sunday (Feb. 5), a blessing ceremony was held and the first fishing boat departed in this harbor cleansing celebration and returned exactly at 10:20 a.m. with a pre-arranged, full catch of seafood.

            Later, at 10:30 a.m., the main event of the day was held as devotees clutched at palanquins carrying local deities and jumped off the pier into cold seawater as the gods “cleansed” the harbor. After a jarring jump into the chilly sea, four-person teams carrying the palanquin must swim their way to the shore, which is about 100 meters away.

            Nearby, Baoan Temple is an important source of spiritual sustenance and comfort for local fishermen. The annual harbor cleansing activity has become a vital cultural asset of the community, akin to Yanshuei’s Beehive Fireworks Festival, Taitung’s Bombing of Lord Han Dan, and Pingxi’s Sky Lantern Festival.

            ""This festival has gone on for more than a century. It purifies the harbor and excises evil spirits by people swimming to the opposite bank and then on land walking barefoot over hot coals three times to stop disasters, eliminate pollution, pray for people's well-being, and welcome good luck,” said Yehliu Baoan Temple Chairman Lin Yuanzhuang (林元莊) in a UDN report.

Advanced registration for the sea jumping activity was conducted with some 200 people registering, though ultimately only 100 people participated. This included some participants who came from as far away as Australia and Columbia and some local participants who livened up the activities by coming dressed as comic characters like Batman and Cat Woman.TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The century-old Yehliu Cleansing of the Harbor Festival culminated on Sunday (Feb. 5) in New Taipei City with one hundred devotees carrying palanquins off a pier and into the sea.

""May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family.""Musharraf, the four-star general who ruled Pakistan for nearly a decade after seizing power in a bloodless coup in 1999, died in a hospital after spending years in self-imposed exile.President Arif Alvi also expressed condolences in a statement.Musharraf's body will be brought to Pakistan for burial on a special flight from Dubai on Monday, local TV channel Geo News reported.Born in New Delhi in 1943, Musharraf was four years old when his parents joined the mass exodus by Muslims to the newly created state of Pakistan.He joined the army at the age of 18 and went on to lead an elite commando unit before rising to become its chief. He took power in 1999 by ousting the then-prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who had tried to sack him for greenlighting an operation to invade Indian-held areas of Kashmir, bringing Pakistan and India to the brink of war.In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, Musharraf became one of Washington’s most important allies after the attacks. That helped legitimize his rule overseas but also helped plunge Pakistan into a bloody war against local extremist militant groups.Under Musharraf, foreign investment flourished and Pakistan saw annual economic growth of as much as 7.5%. He also attempted to usher in socially liberal values in the conservative Muslim country. The later years of his presidency were, however, overshadowed by his increasingly authoritarian rule and waves of violence.In 2008, the country's first democratic elections in 11 years were held. Musharraf's party lost and facing impeachment by parliament he resigned from the presidency and fled to London.He returned to Pakistan in 2013 to run for a seat in parliament but was immediately disqualified. He was allowed to leave for Dubai in 2016.Three years later, he was sentenced to death in absentia for treason, related to his 2007 decision to impose emergency rule. However, a court later nullified the ruling.dh/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters, dpa)",2023/2/5,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800947,"Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan martial ruler in 9/11 wars, dies","ISLAMABAD (AP) — Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup and later led a reluctant Pakistan into aiding the U.S. war in Afghanistan against the Taliban, has died, officials said Sunday. He was 79.

            Musharraf, a former special forces commando, became president through the last of a string of military coups that roiled Pakistan since its founding amid the bloody 1947 partition of India. He ruled the nuclear-armed state after his 1999 coup through tensions with India, an atomic proliferation scandal and an Islamic extremist insurgency. He stepped down in 2008 while facing possible impeachment. 

            Later, Musharraf lived in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid criminal charges, despite attempting a political comeback in 2012. But poor health plagued his last years. He maintained a soldier’s fatalism after avoiding a violent death that always seemed to be stalking him as Islamic militants twice targeted him for assassination.











            “I have confronted death and defied it several times in the past because destiny and fate have always smiled on me,” Musharraf once wrote. “I only pray that I have more than the proverbial nine lives of a cat.”

            Musharraf’s family announced in June 2022 that he had been hospitalized for weeks in Dubai while suffering from amyloidosis, an incurable condition in which proteins build up in the organs. They later said he also needed access to the drug daratumumab, which is used to treat multiple myeloma. That bone marrow cancer can cause amyloidosis.

            Shazia Siraj, a spokeswoman for the Pakistani Consulate in Dubai, confirmed his death and said diplomats were providing support to his family. 

            The Pakistani military also offered its condolences as did Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in 1999. 

            “May God give his family the courage to bear this loss,” Sharif said.

            Less than two years after Musharraf seized power, Pakistan's border with Afghanistan would soon draw the U.S.'s attention and dominate Musharraf’s life. 

            Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden launched the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghanistan, sheltered by the country’s Taliban rulers. Musharraf knew what would come next.

            “America was sure to react violently, like a wounded bear,” he wrote in his autobiography. “If the perpetrator turned out to be al-Qaida, then that wounded bear would come charging straight toward us.”

            By Sept. 12, then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Musharraf that Pakistan would either be “with us or against us.” Musharraf said another American official threatened to bomb Pakistan ”back into the Stone Age” if it chose the latter. 

            Musharraf chose the former. A month later, he stood by then-President George W. Bush at the Waldorf Astoria in New York to declare Pakistan’s unwavering support to fight with the United States against “terrorism in all its forms wherever it exists.”

            Pakistan became a crucial transit point for NATO supplies headed to landlocked Afghanistan. That was the case even though Pakistan’s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency had backed the Taliban after it swept into power in Afghanistan in 1994. Prior to that, the CIA and others funneled money and arms through the ISI to Islamic fighters battling the 1980s Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. 

            The U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan saw Taliban fighters flee over the border back into Pakistan, including bin Laden, whom the U.S. would kill in 2011 at a compound in Abbottabad. They regrouped and the offshoot Pakistani Taliban emerged, beginning a yearslong insurgency in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. 

            The CIA began flying armed Predator drones from Pakistan with Musharraf’s blessing, using an airstrip built by the founding president of the United Arab Emirates for falconing in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. The program helped beat back the militants but saw over 400 strikes in Pakistan alone kill at least 2,366 people — including 245 civilians, according to the Washington-based New America Foundation think tank. 

            Though Pakistan under Musharraf launched these operations, the militants still thrived as billions of American dollars flowed into the nation. That led to suspicion that still plagues the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. 

            “After 9/11, then President Musharraf made a strategic shift to abandon the Taliban and support the U.S. in the war on terror, but neither side believes the other has lived up to expectations flowing from that decision,” a 2009 U.S. cable from then-Ambassador Anne Patterson published by WikiLeaks said, describing what had become the diplomatic equivalent of a loveless marriage. 

            “The relationship is one of co-dependency we grudgingly admit — Pakistan knows the U.S. cannot afford to walk away; the U.S. knows Pakistan cannot survive without our support.” 

            But it would be Musharraf’s life on the line. Militants tried to assassinate him twice in 2003 by targeting his convoy, first with a bomb planted on a bridge and then with car bombs. That second attack saw Musharraf’s vehicle lifted into the air by the blast before touching the ground again. It raced to safety on just its rims, Musharraf pulling a Glock pistol in case he needed to fight his way out.

            It wasn’t until his wife, Sehba, saw the car covered in gore that the scale of the attack dawned on him.

            “She is always calm in the face of danger,” he recounted. But then, “she was screaming uncontrollably, hysterically.”

            Born Aug. 11, 1943, in New Delhi, Musharraf was the middle son of a diplomat. His family joined millions of other Muslims in fleeing westward when predominantly Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan split during independence from Britain in 1947. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in riots and fighting during the Partition. 

            Musharraf entered the Pakistani army at age 18 and made his career there as Islamabad fought three wars against India. He’d launch his own attempt at capturing territory in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir in 1999 just before seizing power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. 

            Sharif had ordered Musharraf’s dismissal as the army chief flew home from a visit to Sri Lanka and denied his plane landing rights in Pakistan, even as it ran low on fuel. On the ground, the army took control and after he landed Musharraf took charge. 

            Yet as ruler, Musharraf nearly reached a deal with India on Kashmir, according to U.S. diplomats at the time. He also worked toward a rapprochement with Pakistan’s longtime rival. 

            Another major scandal emerged under his rule when the world discovered that famed Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, long associated with the country’s atomic bomb, had been selling centrifuge designs and other secrets to countries including Iran, Libya and North Korea, making tens of millions of dollars. Those designs helped Pyongyang arm itself with nuclear weapons, while centrifuges from Khan’s designs still spin in Iran amid the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. 

            Musharraf said he suspected Khan but it wasn’t until 2003 when then-CIA director George Tenet showed him detailed plans for a Pakistani centrifuge that the scientist had been selling that he realized the severity of what happened. 

            Khan confessed on state television in 2004 and Musharraf pardoned him, though he was confined to house arrest after that.

            “For years, A.Q.’s lavish lifestyle and tales of his wealth, properties, corrupt practices and financial magnanimity at state expense were generally all too well known in Islamabad’s social and government circles,” Musharraf later wrote. “However, these were largely ignored. ... In hindsight that neglect was apparently a serious mistake.”

            Musharraf’s domestic support eventually eroded. He held flawed elections in late 2002 — only after changing the constitution to give himself sweeping powers to sack the prime minister and parliament. He then reneged on a promise to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004.

            Militant anger toward Musharraf increased in 2007 when he ordered a raid against the Red Mosque in downtown Islamabad. It had become a sanctuary for militants opposed to Pakistan’s support of the Afghan war. The weeklong operation killed over 100 people. 

            The incident severely damaged Musharraf’s reputation among everyday citizens and earned him the undying hatred of militants who launched a series of punishing attacks following the raid.

            Fearing the judiciary would block his continued rule, Musharraf fired the chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court. That triggered mass demonstrations. 

            Under pressure at home and abroad to restore civilian rule, Musharraf stepped down as army chief. Though he won another five-year presidential term, Musharraf faced a major crisis following former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in December 2007 at a campaign rally as she sought to become prime minister for the third time. 

            The public suspected Musharraf’s hand in the killing, which he denied. A later United Nations report acknowledged the Pakistani Taliban was a main suspect in her slaying but warned that elements of Pakistan’s intelligence services may have been involved. 

            Musharraf resigned as president in August 2008 after ruling coalition officials threatened to have him impeached for imposing emergency rule and firing judges.

            “I hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes,” Musharraf, struggling with his emotions, said in his televised address.

            Afterward, he lived abroad in Dubai and London, attempting a political comeback in 2012. But Pakistan instead arrested the former general and put him under house arrest. He faced treason allegations over the Supreme Court debacle and other charges stemming from the Red Mosque raid and Bhutto’s assassination.

            The image of Musharraf being treated as a criminal suspect shocked Pakistan, where military generals long have been considered above the law. Pakistan allowed him to leave the country on bail to Dubai in 2016 for medical treatment and he remained there after facing a later-overturned death sentence. 

            But it suggested Pakistan may be ready to turn a corner in its history of military rule. 

            “Musharraf’s resignation is a sad yet familiar story of hubris, this time in a soldier who never became a good politician,” wrote Patterson, the U.S. ambassador, at the time. 

            “The good news is that the demonstrated strength of institutions that brought Musharraf down — the media, free elections and civil society — also provide some hope for Pakistan’s future. It was these institutions that ironically became much stronger under his government.”

He maintained a soldier’s fatalism after avoiding a violent death that always seemed to be stalking him as Islamic militants twice targeted him for assassination.“I have confronted death and defied it several times in the past because destiny and fate have always smiled on me,” Musharraf once wrote. “I only pray that I have more than the proverbial nine lives of a cat.”Musharraf’s family announced in June 2022 that he had been hospitalized for weeks in Dubai while suffering from amyloidosis, an incurable condition in which proteins build up in the organs. They later said he also needed access to the drug daratumumab, which is used to treat multiple myeloma. That bone marrow cancer can cause amyloidosis.Shazia Siraj, a spokeswoman for the Pakistani Consulate in Dubai, confirmed his death and said diplomats were providing support to his family.The Pakistani military also offered its condolences as did Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, the younger brother of the prime minister Musharraf overthrew in 1999.“May God give his family the courage to bear this loss,” Sharif said.Less than two years after Musharraf seized power, Pakistan's border with Afghanistan would soon draw the U.S.'s attention and dominate Musharraf’s life.Al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden launched the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghanistan, sheltered by the country’s Taliban rulers. Musharraf knew what would come next.“America was sure to react violently, like a wounded bear,” he wrote in his autobiography. “If the perpetrator turned out to be al-Qaida, then that wounded bear would come charging straight toward us.”By Sept. 12, then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Musharraf that Pakistan would either be “with us or against us.” Musharraf said another American official threatened to bomb Pakistan ”back into the Stone Age” if it chose the latter.Musharraf chose the former. A month later, he stood by then-President George W. Bush at the Waldorf Astoria in New York to declare Pakistan’s unwavering support to fight with the United States against “terrorism in all its forms wherever it exists.”Pakistan became a crucial transit point for NATO supplies headed to landlocked Afghanistan. That was the case even though Pakistan’s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency had backed the Taliban after it swept into power in Afghanistan in 1994. Prior to that, the CIA and others funneled money and arms through the ISI to Islamic fighters battling the 1980s Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.The U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan saw Taliban fighters flee over the border back into Pakistan, including bin Laden, whom the U.S. would kill in 2011 at a compound in Abbottabad. They regrouped and the offshoot Pakistani Taliban emerged, beginning a yearslong insurgency in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.The CIA began flying armed Predator drones from Pakistan with Musharraf’s blessing, using an airstrip built by the founding president of the United Arab Emirates for falconing in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. The program helped beat back the militants but saw over 400 strikes in Pakistan alone kill at least 2,366 people — including 245 civilians, according to the Washington-based New America Foundation think tank.Though Pakistan under Musharraf launched these operations, the militants still thrived as billions of American dollars flowed into the nation. That led to suspicion that still plagues the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.“After 9/11, then President Musharraf made a strategic shift to abandon the Taliban and support the U.S. in the war on terror, but neither side believes the other has lived up to expectations flowing from that decision,” a 2009 U.S. cable from then-Ambassador Anne Patterson published by WikiLeaks said, describing what had become the diplomatic equivalent of a loveless marriage.“The relationship is one of co-dependency we grudgingly admit — Pakistan knows the U.S. cannot afford to walk away; the U.S. knows Pakistan cannot survive without our support.”But it would be Musharraf’s life on the line. Militants tried to assassinate him twice in 2003 by targeting his convoy, first with a bomb planted on a bridge and then with car bombs. That second attack saw Musharraf’s vehicle lifted into the air by the blast before touching the ground again. It raced to safety on just its rims, Musharraf pulling a Glock pistol in case he needed to fight his way out.It wasn’t until his wife, Sehba, saw the car covered in gore that the scale of the attack dawned on him.“She is always calm in the face of danger,” he recounted. But then, “she was screaming uncontrollably, hysterically.”Born Aug. 11, 1943, in New Delhi, Musharraf was the middle son of a diplomat. His family joined millions of other Muslims in fleeing westward when predominantly Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan split during independence from Britain in 1947. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in riots and fighting during the Partition.Musharraf entered the Pakistani army at age 18 and made his career there as Islamabad fought three wars against India. He’d launch his own attempt at capturing territory in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir in 1999 just before seizing power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.Sharif had ordered Musharraf’s dismissal as the army chief flew home from a visit to Sri Lanka and denied his plane landing rights in Pakistan, even as it ran low on fuel. On the ground, the army took control and after he landed Musharraf took charge.Yet as ruler, Musharraf nearly reached a deal with India on Kashmir, according to U.S. diplomats at the time. He also worked toward a rapprochement with Pakistan’s longtime rival.Another major scandal emerged under his rule when the world discovered that famed Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, long associated with the country’s atomic bomb, had been selling centrifuge designs and other secrets to countries including Iran, Libya and North Korea, making tens of millions of dollars. Those designs helped Pyongyang arm itself with nuclear weapons, while centrifuges from Khan’s designs still spin in Iran amid the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Musharraf said he suspected Khan but it wasn’t until 2003 when then-CIA director George Tenet showed him detailed plans for a Pakistani centrifuge that the scientist had been selling that he realized the severity of what happened.Khan confessed on state television in 2004 and Musharraf pardoned him, though he was confined to house arrest after that.“For years, A.Q.’s lavish lifestyle and tales of his wealth, properties, corrupt practices and financial magnanimity at state expense were generally all too well known in Islamabad’s social and government circles,” Musharraf later wrote. “However, these were largely ignored. ... In hindsight that neglect was apparently a serious mistake.”Musharraf’s domestic support eventually eroded. He held flawed elections in late 2002 — only after changing the constitution to give himself sweeping powers to sack the prime minister and parliament. He then reneged on a promise to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004.Militant anger toward Musharraf increased in 2007 when he ordered a raid against the Red Mosque in downtown Islamabad. It had become a sanctuary for militants opposed to Pakistan’s support of the Afghan war. The weeklong operation killed over 100 people.The incident severely damaged Musharraf’s reputation among everyday citizens and earned him the undying hatred of militants who launched a series of punishing attacks following the raid.Fearing the judiciary would block his continued rule, Musharraf fired the chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court. That triggered mass demonstrations.Under pressure at home and abroad to restore civilian rule, Musharraf stepped down as army chief. Though he won another five-year presidential term, Musharraf faced a major crisis following former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in December 2007 at a campaign rally as she sought to become prime minister for the third time.The public suspected Musharraf’s hand in the killing, which he denied. A later United Nations report acknowledged the Pakistani Taliban was a main suspect in her slaying but warned that elements of Pakistan’s intelligence services may have been involved.Musharraf resigned as president in August 2008 after ruling coalition officials threatened to have him impeached for imposing emergency rule and firing judges.“I hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes,” Musharraf, struggling with his emotions, said in his televised address.Afterward, he lived abroad in Dubai and London, attempting a political comeback in 2012. But Pakistan instead arrested the former general and put him under house arrest. He faced treason allegations over the Supreme Court debacle and other charges stemming from the Red Mosque raid and Bhutto’s assassination.The image of Musharraf being treated as a criminal suspect shocked Pakistan, where military generals long have been considered above the law. Pakistan allowed him to leave the country on bail to Dubai in 2016 for medical treatment and he remained there after facing a later-overturned death sentence.But it suggested Pakistan may be ready to turn a corner in its history of military rule.“Musharraf’s resignation is a sad yet familiar story of hubris, this time in a soldier who never became a good politician,” wrote Patterson, the U.S. ambassador, at the time.“The good news is that the demonstrated strength of institutions that brought Musharraf down — the media, free elections and civil society — also provide some hope for Pakistan’s future. It was these institutions that ironically became much stronger under his government.”___Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4800967,Former Israeli PM: Putin promised not to kill Zelenskyy,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A former Israeli prime minister who served briefly as a mediator at the start of Russia's war with Ukraine says he drew a promise from the Russian president not to kill his Ukrainian counterpart.

            Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett emerged as an unlikely intermediary in the war's first weeks, becoming one of the few Western leaders to meet President Vladimir Putin during the war in a snap trip to Moscow last March. 

            While Bennett's mediation efforts appear to have done little to end the bloodshed that continues until today, his remarks, in an interview posted online late Saturday, shed light on the backroom diplomacy and urgent efforts that were underway to try to bring the conflict to a speedy conclusion in its early days.











            In the five-hour interview, which touched on numerous other subjects, Bennett says he asked Putin about whether he intended to kill Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

            “I asked ‘what’s with this? Are you planning to kill Zelenskyy?’ He said ‘I won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ I then said to him ‘I have to understand that you’re giving me your word that you won’t kill Zelenskyy.’ He said ‘I’m not going to kill Zelenskyy.’”

            Bennett said he then called Zelenskyy to inform him of Putin's pledge. 

            “'Listen, I came out of a meeting, he’s not going to kill you.’ He asks, ‘are you sure?’ I said ’100% he won’t kill you.’""

            Bennett said that during his mediation, Putin dropped his vow to seek Ukraine's disarmament and Zelenskyy promised not to join NATO. 

            There was no immediate response from the Kremlin, which has previously denied Ukrainian claims that Russia intended to assassinate Zelenskyy.

            Reacting to Bennett's comments in his widely reported interview, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote Sunday on Twitter that Putin was not to be trusted.

            “Do not be fooled: He is an expert liar. Every time he has promised not to do something, it has been exactly part of his plan,"" Kuleba said about the Russian leader.

            Bennett, a largely untested leader who had served as prime minister for just over six months when the war broke out, unexpectedly thrust himself into international diplomacy after he had positioned Israel into an uncomfortable middle ground between Russia and Ukraine. Israel views its good ties with the Kremlin as strategic in the face of threats from Iran but it aligns itself with Western nations and also seeks to show support for Ukraine. 

            An observant Jew and little known internationally, he flew to Moscow for his meeting with Putin during the Jewish Sabbath, breaking his religious commitments and putting himself at the forefront of global efforts to halt the war.

            But his peacemaking efforts did not appear to take off and his time in power was short-lived. Bennett's government, an ideologically diverse union that sent current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into a brief political exile, collapsed in the summer over infighting.

            On the last day of his African pilgrimage, Francis begged South Sudanese people to lay down their weapons and forgive one another, presiding over Mass at the country’s monument to independence hero John Garang before an estimated 100,000 people, including the country's political leadership.

            “Even if our hearts bleed for the wrongs we have suffered, let us refuse, once and for all, to repay evil with evil,” Francis said. “Let us accept one another and love one another with sincerity and generosity, as God loves us.”











            His message aimed to revive hopes in the world's youngest country, which gained independence from the majority Muslim Sudan in 2011 but has been beset by civil war and conflict. 

            President Salva Kiir, his longtime rival Riek Machar and other opposition groups signed a peace agreement in 2018, but the deal’s provisions, including the formation of a national unified army, remain largely unimplemented and fighting has continued to flare. 

            “We have suffered a lot,” said Natalima Andrea, a 66-year-old mother of seven who wiped a tear from her eye as she waited for Francis' Mass to begin. “We need a permanent peace now and I hope these prayers would yield to lasting peace.”

            The Vatican said more than 100,000 people attended the service, filling the field of the Garang Mausoleum and surrounding roads.

            In a bid to spur the process along, Francis was joined on the novel ecumenical peace mission by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields. The aim of the Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian leaders was to push Kiir and Machar to recommit themselves to the 2018 deal.

            Welby and Greenshields joined Francis on the altar at Mass on Sunday and were to accompany him on the flight back to Rome.

            The three also aimed to put a global spotlight on the plight of the country, oil-rich and yet one of the world's poorest, where humanitarian needs are soaring for the 2 million people who have been displaced by continued clashes and years of above-average flooding. Watchdogs' allegations of corruption are also widespread; some South Sudanese upon the pope's arrival noted that his modest vehicle was overshadowed by local officials' luxury ones.

            During the three-day visit, Francis, Welby and Greenshields sought to draw attention to the plight of South Sudan's most vulnerable people, the women and children who have borne the brunt of displacement and make up the majority of people living in temporary camps.

            They raised in particular the plight of women in a country where sexual violence is rampant, child brides are common and the maternal mortality rate is the highest in the world. 

            “If we look at South Sudan, I would just use one word: South Sudan is a patriarchal country,"" said Elizabeth Nyibol Malou, a lecturer in economics at the Catholic University of South Sudan. Citing cultural norms in which wealth is passed down to male heirs and women are married young for dowries, she said it is a constant struggle to keep girls in school.

            Women in South Sudan, she said, ""are tired. They are struggling. They are frustrated, and they’re stuck.”

            Edmund Yakani, executive director of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, said the visit of the three leaders was an important push to the peace process.

            He called it a “critical exposure of our political leaders towards their personal responsibility for making peace and stability prevail in the country.”

He claimed that the guns and bullets belonged to his friend while the heroin was for his personal use.The police handed Hsieh’s case over to prosecutors after interrogating him.

The militaries of Japan and the Philippines, along with the participation of U.S. forces, have been conducting joint drills related to humanitarian assistance and disaster management since 2017.Both Japan and the U.S. consider the Philippines as a strategic partner for any contingency in the event of a regional conflict involving China and Taiwan. Manila and Tokyo’s decision to sign a comprehensive RAA is seen as an important step to bolster regional alliances to deter Beijing from attacking or otherwise threatening Taiwan.News of the bilateral RAA follows an agreement by Washington and Manila, which also boosts military cooperation. On Thursday (Feb. 2), it was announced that U.S. forces will be granted expanded access to military bases throughout the Philippines.In addition to the agreement between the JSDF and the AFP, there are at least six other pacts that are also expected to be signed at Thursday’s meeting between the two leaders, reported the Inquirer. They include several loan agreements related to railroad infrastructure in the Philippines as well as an agreement related to “information and communications technology” and a memorandum of cooperation on agriculture.",2023/2/5,4857,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801013,EU migration impasse leaves many refugees out in the cold,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Some refugees and asylum-seekers in Brussels have been spending months in between the Street of Palaces and the Small Castle — quite literally.

            Unfortunately, it's not a dream come true at the end of their fearful flight from halfway across the globe. It's a perpetual nightmare. 

            Petit Chateau, which means small castle, is a government reception center that often does anything but welcome arrivals. The Rue des Palais — street of palaces — has the city’s worst squat, where the smell of urine and the prevalence of scurvy have come to symbolize how the European Union’s migration policy is failing. 











            They are only 2½ miles (four kilometers) from the sleek Europa Building where EU leaders will hold a two-day summit starting Thursday to deal with migration issues that have vexed the 27 member nations for more than a decade.

            Shinwari, an Afghan army captain who long helped Western powers try to stave off the Taliban, now lives in a makeshift tent camp right on the canal opposite Petit Chateau. 

            It's a place as desolate as it is hopeless. 

            ""It is very cold. Some guys have different diseases and many of us are suffering from depression, because we don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” said the 31-year-old, who left behind his wife and four children, convinced that Taliban forces that took over in August 2021 would kill soldiers like him who worked with NATO countries.

            “They search houses. No one’s life was safe,” Shinwari said. ”They have already once told my family 'your son has taken refuge in an infidel country.'"" 

            Even now, far from home, he's too scared to be identified beyond his last name and with only the vaguest military details. He doesn't want his face shown in photos or video, for fear the Taliban might hurt his family. 

            Exacerbating his plight is the reception he's been given in the wealthy EU — largely marked by indifference, sometimes even hostility. 

            “Unfortunately, no one gets to hear our voices,” he said from his tent, surrounded by a half-dozen ex-members of the Afghan military.

            Instead, the vocabulary of EU leaders before the summit is much more about “strengthening external borders,” “border fences” and “return procedures” than it is about immediately making life better for people like Shinwari.

            And with 330,000 unauthorized attempts made to enter the EU last year — a six-year record — projecting a warm embrace for refugees doesn't win many elections on the continent these days.

            Many Afghans also look with envy at the swift measures that the EU took after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 to grant Ukrainians temporary protection measures such as residency rights, labor market access, medical aid and social welfare assistance — things that all largely pass them by.

            “The issue of Afghans and Ukrainians are the same, but they don’t get treated the same way,"" Shinwari said. ""When Ukrainians come here, they are provided with all the facilities ... on the first day of their arrival, but we Afghans who have left our country due to security threats, we don’t get anything. 

            ""It is surprising because human rights are not the same for everyone and that upsets us and makes us feel disappointed and neglected.”

            EU leaders have already said that a full breakthrough on their migration policies won't come before bloc-wide elections in June 2024.

            Shinwari said he was lucky to puncture the EU's beefed up borders to use his right to asylum after an eight-month trek through Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Bulgaria, Serbia and eventually Belgium. It included beatings, arrest and escape in Iran, and hunger and fear along much of the trail.

            Shinwari made it to Europe alive, “but now that I am here, I am homeless like a nomad” with a flimsy blue tent to keep out Belgium's many rain showers, he said.

            Other Afghan former soldiers settled in the Rue des Palais, where their stories of trauma, depression, drugs and violence were just as bleak.

            “The situation is not good here. If the Red Cross brings food, we will have something to eat, but if not, then many don't have anything,” said Roz Amin Khan, who fled Laghman province to arrive in Belgium two months ago.

            Since arriving four months ago, Shinwari said that he had one interview with asylum processing authorities and has been waiting ever since. 

            The lack of help for most refugees has been driving nongovernmental organizations and volunteers to despair. 

            “Between the legal framework and the situation on the ground there is a world of difference,” said Clement Valentin, a legal advocacy officer at the CIRE refugee foundation. “There is this gap and it is tough to understand — for me and for the NGOs. 

            ""But I cannot even begin to comprehend how tough it must be for Afghans here in Belgium, or other European nations, to understand this.” 

            The legal sloth isn't limited to Belgium. The EU's Agency for Asylum said in its latest trends report of November 2022 that “the gap between applications and decisions had reached the largest extent since 2015,” and was widening still. Overall, it said, more than 920,000 cases were still pending, a 14% annual increase. 

            Such was the bureaucratic backlog at the Petit Chateau when Shinwari arrived, that would-be asylum-seekers had to wait sometimes for days in the rain and cold just to get in the front door. Citizens living close by brought food and set up fire pits, because the government didn't act. 

            Even if the situation has improved, the physical and mental scars are easy to see, said Michel Genet, director of Doctors of the World Belgium.

            “People have been through big traumas and a very difficult situation and they expect to come here and be taken care of,"" but they're not, Genet said. 

            During many sleepless nights in the freezing cold, with the dull buzz of passing cars in the background, Shinwari's thoughts drift back home. 

            “Sometimes I think about the future, and I think how much longer I have to live on the streets,"" he said. ""My mind is surrounded with problems. I think of the safety of my family and my future.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801014,Ex-foreign minister will face diplomat for Cyprus presidency,"NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A center-right former foreign minister and a career diplomat backed by a communist-rooted party will battle it out for the presidency of ethnically divided Cyprus in a Feb. 12 runoff, according to official voting results announced Sunday.

            With all votes counted in the first round of the presidential race, Nikos Christodoulides, 49, the country's former top diplomat, had garnered 32% to head into a runoff against Andreas Mavroyiannis, 66, who had a surprisingly strong showing with 29.6%.

            Averof Neophytou, 61, the leader of Democratic Rally (DISY), the country's largest political party, trailed Mavroyiannis by some 3.5 percentage points, despite earlier opinion polls putting him in the second spot.











            Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou said 72% of some 561,000 citizens cast ballots Sunday, marginally higher than the previous presidential election in 2018. The winner next week's runoff will be Cyprus' eighth new president in its 63-year history as an independent republic.

            Christodoulides, a long-standing DISY member, has consistently led all opinion polls throughout the monthslong campaign, positioning himself as the candidate who can bridge party affiliations and ideological fault lines to unite a fractured electorate.

            Speaking to chanting supporters, Christodoulides underscored the “unifier"" message by taking care not to push away any voters who cast ballots for any other candidate. He said he would reach out to Neophytou for a meeting on Monday to secure his party's support. 

            “As of tomorrow, our door is open for all those who share our concern for tomorrow, for our children,"" Christodoulides said, flanked by his wife and daughters. 

            But he took a dig at the communist-rooted AKEL party that is supporting Mavroyiannis' candidacy. He said there will be no going back to that party's policies, which drove the island to near-bankruptcy during the 2008-2013 presidential tenure of former AKEL leader, the late Dimitris Christofias.

            Mavroyiannis, who served under outgoing President Nicos Anastasiades as his chief negotiator in peace talks with Turkish Cypriots, pulled off an upset by defying earlier opinion polls that showed him trailing Neophytou. His message as an agent of change resonated with voters disgruntled with a decade of Anastasiades’ rule, especially AKEL members.

            Mavroyiannis told a throng of Cyprus flag-waving supporters that he'll be reaching out to other candidates in the coming days to secure their support.

            “Our love for our country strikes down any lines of division and unites us,"" he said. “Our focus on the goal for a healthy, robust economy and our concern for our citizens supersedes our differences.""

            Neophytou had banked on his message as a veteran insider and the steadiest hand to ensure stability in times fraught with economic uncertainty, building on the solid work of the government of which many DISY cadres were members. But it appeared that the perception of Neophytou among a swath of voters as a string-pulling insider tainted by the outgoing administration's mistakes hurt him at the ballot box.

            Neophytou told supporters at his campaign headquarters that he congratulated both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis on their success. But he deflected questions about which of his rivals he would throw his party's support behind, saying that such a decision would be reached collectively in line with party protocols while hinting that he wouldn't step down as DISY leader.

            “We waged a tough battle under most adverse political conditions,"" said Neophytou. “It wasn't enough."" 

            Voter Andreas Mashas said his vote went to the candidate who he saw as the “least worst” of the bunch.

            “No candidate fully satisfies us, they're all politicians, so you vote for the least worst one, that's the way elections usually go, I consider my choice to be sufficiently good,"" Mashas told The Associated Press after casting his ballot, without revealing what his choice was.

            Cypriots will expect the new president to quickly move to buttress an economy buffeted by Russia’s war in Ukraine and its knock-on effect on the cost of living.

             Migration has also been a hot-button issue amid a continued massive influx of migrants that has made Cyprus one of the top EU countries in terms of asylum applications per capita. 

            Capitalizing on Cyprus’ offshore natural gas deposits amid an energy crunch and getting back to the negotiating table with breakaway Turkish Cypriots to resolve the island’s ethnic cleave are also priority issues.NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — A center-right former foreign minister and a career diplomat backed by a communist-rooted party will battle it out for the presidency of ethnically divided Cyprus in a Feb. 12 runoff, according to official voting results announced Sunday.With all votes counted in the first round of the presidential race, Nikos Christodoulides, 49, the country's former top diplomat, had garnered 32% to head into a runoff against Andreas Mavroyiannis, 66, who had a surprisingly strong showing with 29.6%.Averof Neophytou, 61, the leader of Democratic Rally (DISY), the country's largest political party, trailed Mavroyiannis by some 3.5 percentage points, despite earlier opinion polls putting him in the second spot.Chief Returning Officer Costas Constantinou said 72% of some 561,000 citizens cast ballots Sunday, marginally higher than the previous presidential election in 2018.

But it appeared that the perception of Neophytou among a swath of voters as a string-pulling insider tainted by the outgoing administration's mistakes hurt him at the ballot box.Neophytou told supporters at his campaign headquarters that he congratulated both Christodoulides and Mavroyiannis on their success. But he deflected questions about which of his rivals he would throw his party's support behind, saying that such a decision would be reached collectively in line with party protocols while hinting that he wouldn't step down as DISY leader.“We waged a tough battle under most adverse political conditions,"" said Neophytou. “It wasn't enough.""Voter Andreas Mashas said his vote went to the candidate who he saw as the “least worst” of the bunch.“No candidate fully satisfies us, they're all politicians, so you vote for the least worst one, that's the way elections usually go, I consider my choice to be sufficiently good,"" Mashas told The Associated Press after casting his ballot, without revealing what his choice was.Cypriots will expect the new president to quickly move to buttress an economy buffeted by Russia’s war in Ukraine and its knock-on effect on the cost of living.Migration has also been a hot-button issue amid a continued massive influx of migrants that has made Cyprus one of the top EU countries in terms of asylum applications per capita.Capitalizing on Cyprus’ offshore natural gas deposits amid an energy crunch and getting back to the negotiating table with breakaway Turkish Cypriots to resolve the island’s ethnic cleave are also priority issues.",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801024,More challenges for conveyor-belt sushi chain,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Japan’s leading conveyor-belt sushi chain, Sushiro, has been rocked by a viral video of a 17-year-old Japanese high school student purposely licking a soy sauce bottle, cups, and spreading saliva on a passing plate of sushi.The mischievous activity shared on the Twitter post caused an uproar, sending shares of Sushiro down 5% in market value almost overnight. It also led the chain to rethink its decades-long conveyor-belt service, potentially bringing to an end “pick what you want” or the endless stream of uninterrupted sushi service.The initial licking incident occurred on Jan. 29 at a Sushiro location in Gifu City, Japan. Since the video surfaced, many Japanese consumers have stayed away from conveyor-belt sushi restaurants. Empty seats are a common sight now, and copycat incidents of sushi subterfuge have also popped up, such as diners heaping piles of wasabi on passing plates of sushi.Conveyor-belt sushi establishments have been part of Japanese culture for decades, appealing to price-conscious consumers. Four major firms dominate the market, though they have been battered of late by rising seafood costs, inflation, and recent sanitary concerns.Sushiro pledges to make 3 major sanitary changes to operations. (Sushiro official website photo)Sushiro is not taking sanitary concerns lightly. In fact, it is hitting back with sweeping changes to operations which it announced on Feb. 3. The first change is that the conveyor belt will only deliver items expressly ordered by customers from a touch panel screen. The second change is that customers can request new tableware or seasonings at their table. Thirdly, transparent acrylic panels will be installed to reduce the chance of accidentally touching food on the conveyor belt.Sushiro emphasized that it believes that one-time changes to store operations can help regain public trust. As of press time, it is uncertain if and when similar changes will be implemented in Sushiro’s many Taiwan outlets.So far, Sushiro in Taiwan has supposedly only been involved in one sanitary dispute, occurring August 2, 2022. According to a post on Whistleblower Commune, diners at a Sushiro branch in Taipei discovered that they were using a previous diner’s chopsticks. About halfway through their meal, they found seaweed residue on their chopsticks.Sushiro faced another sanitary complaint in August 2022. (Whistleblower Commune Facebook photo)When this diner went to pay, he asked the cashier to review video footage of the dining room when they discovered that a customer had returned his dirty chopsticks to a container of clean chopsticks, potentially intending to play a prank.This diner took to Facebook to demand a public apology and a commitment to change the way it dispenses chopsticks. Sushiro did not acquiesce, saying it did nothing wrong, though it offered this individual a NT$2,000 (US$60) gift certificate, which he refused because the restaurant did not make the changes he suggested regarding sanitation.Sushiro, however, is not without supporters in Taiwan, as some netizens have launched a save Sushiro campaign, actively posting photos of the piles of sushi plates they have consumed, and otherwise sharing adoration for the restaurant chain’s commitment to speedy, low-cost dining.",2023/2/5,10298,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801062,Germany's far-right AfD marks 10 years since its founding,"The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party sees every reason to celebrate: It has been in the Bundestag since 2017 and is represented in 15 of 16 state parliaments. Opinion polls currently put it at 13% voter support overall. In the east of the country, it is well above that.The AfD has evolved from its early days, when it was dismissed as a party catering to economics professors, into a ""far-right party that is extremist, antisemitic and racist,"" according to political scientist Ursula Münch in an interview with DW.At the time of its founding, the AfD was critical of the euro currency and the EU bailout program for Greece.  In September 2012, the ""Election Alternative 2013"" was formed — the precursor to the AfD. Economics professor Bernd Lucke, journalist Konrad Adam and former CDU member Alexander Gauland then turned it into the ""Alternative for Germany.""The party was officially founded on February 6, 2013. Since then, ""the AfD has become a permanent fixture in the German party system, where a decidedly liberal-conservative force had previously been sorely lacking,"" writes AfD co-chair Alice Weidel in response to a DW query.The party fast became a rallying point for people with right-wing attitudes for whom existing far-right extremist splinter groups seemed too extreme, but who had become disenchanted with the liberal tendencies of the center-right Christian Democrats under Angela Merkel.From the beginning, the AfD comprised three different movements: the liberal economists, the national conservatives and right-wing populists.Two of the three founding members have long since turned their backs on the party. And that, too, has become a distinctive feature of the AfD: the frequent change of leadership. It is a ""divided party that often sees battles erupt between its leadership and its grassroots,"" political scientist Münch says.The party's radicalization began when hundreds of thousands of people fled to Germany in 2015, seeking protection from the war in Syria. Xenophobic anti-refugee street protests began to grow, especially in eastern Germany, the former communist GDR, which had known little immigration until 1989.AfD founding member Alexander Gauland once referred to this development as ""a gift"" for his party, whose anti-government rhetoric turned increasingly aggressive. In 2016, then-AfD leader Frauke Petry said refugees should be prevented from crossing the border into Germany by force of arms if necessary.In early June 2018, Gauland, who was the party's parliamentary group leader, triggered outrage across the country when he trivialized the Nazi dictatorship and the Holocaust. Speaking at a party event, he said that ""Hitler and the Nazis were no more than a speck of bird's shit in over 1,000 years of successful history.""Political scientist Münch explains that the AfD's success also comes from the fact that ""such radical statements go down quite well with parts of the population: those who applaud AfD politicians for daring to speak out and ruffle the feathers of the political establishment.""AfD politicians' radical statements put the German security authorities on alert. In March 2021, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) — the domestic intelligence service — classified the entire party as a ""suspected right-wing extremist case.""""Der Flügel"" (the wing), an extremist faction of the AfD, has been determined in court to be right-wing extremist, which means its members can be put under state surveillance. This may include the employment of undercover investigators and the tapping of telephone conversations.Alice Weidel believes this is ""a blatant party-political instrumentalization of the domestic intelligence service."" Political scientist Ursula Münch, on the other hand, says the AfD has indeed ""by and large, become an extreme right-wing party.""Only this week, the pollster infratest dimap asked voters how they see the AfD. Seventy-five percent of respondents feel the AfD does not sufficiently distance itself from extreme-right positions.The AfD has just under 80,000 members. That is roughly the same as the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), the smallest party in the current three-way coalition government. The largest party is the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which has around 380,000 members.More than 80% of all AfD members are men. A representative online survey conducted by the Bertelsmann Foundation in the summer of 2020 found that 29% of AfD voters hold far-right beliefs. Among AfD voters, xenophobia, antisemitism and a penchant for authoritarian regimes are much more widespread than among supporters of other parties.Most recently, the AfD has come out in support of Russia, which has been waging a brutal war of aggression against Ukraine for a year and with which party leaders have long had friendly relations. Weidel has spoken out against the idea of putting Vladimir Putin before a war crimes tribunal or imposing sanctions on Russia. From the start, AfD lawmakers have categorically opposed arms deliveries to Ukraine.  Weidel has, for instance, criticized the fact that Germany will now supply Leopard tanks to Ukraine as a ""disastrous decision.""Infratest dimap pollsters found that this goes down well only with some voters: Only 13% of respondents in western Germany think it is good that the AfD shows understanding for Russian positions in the Ukraine war. In the eastern regions, the figure is almost twice as high, at 25%.After 10 years in opposition, the AfD has its sights set firmly on government participation. It may not be within reach on the federal level, but AfD leaders believe they have a chance in the eastern German states. There, the AfD regularly wins over 20% of the vote, especially in rural, remote regions.According to the latest polls, it is even the strongest party in the eastern German states of Saxony and Thuringia. Elections will be held there next year. ""Participating in government will be the next logical step,"" Weidel told DW.The AfD sees the CDU as a possible coalition partner. The conservatives, however, have ruled out such coalitions, even passing resolutions to that effect at party conferences.But that resistance may be waning. In Thuringia, the CDU, AfD and FDP have just teamed up to force through legislation in defiance of the left-wing minority government of the post-communist Left Party, environmentalist Greens and center-left SPD.According to political scientist Münch, many regional CDU representatives are already asking ""quietly and not so quietly"" what is actually ""so bad"" about the AfD. Should an AfD-CDU alliance actually come about, however, it ""would be a very big conflict for the CDU,"" she predicts.The AfD has lavish plans for its birthday celebrations in Königstein im Taunus, not far from Frankfurt. But protesters are set to turn out in numbers there, too. The ""Stand up against racism"" alliance has announced its intention to demonstrate at the venue. ""The AfD is a serious threat to democracy and to everyone who does not fit into its right-wing worldview,"" the alliance's executive director, Irmgard Wurdack, told the Tagesspiegel newspaper on Thursday.Political scientist Ursula Münch begs to differ. She says the existence of the AfD proves the stability of German democracy and the parliamentary system. She is of the opinion that the AfD's 10 years of existence show how strong and flexible the German party system is and that the entire spectrum of political opinion can be and is represented in Germany's parliament.This article was originally written in German.",2023/2/5,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801063,Pervez Musharraf: A soldier on many fronts,"Pervez Musharraf, who has died in Dubai aged 79, ruled Pakistan as president from 2001 to 2008 after taking power in a coup, leaving behind a mixed legacy as a leader.His rule was marked by frequent oppression and human rights abuses, especially as it drew to an end.However, he also promoted social liberalism under what he termed an ""enlightened moderation program,"" which envisaged a society based on a non-fundamentalist interpretation of Islam. On the economic front, his presidency coincided with a rise in overall gross domestic product by around 50%.Born in New Delhi four years before Pakistan and India gained their independence from British colonial rule in August 1947, Musharraf lived and went to school in Turkey as a child before returning to Pakistan in 1956.He was commissioned as a trainee officer in the Pakistani army in 1961. Later, the young Musharraf rapidly climbed the ranks of the military and also fought in two wars against neighboring India in 1965 and 1971.He was promoted to four-star general by then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1998, making him the serving chief of the army staff.  He was in charge of the Kargil infiltration that led to a war between India and Pakistan in 1999.It was also in this capacity as leader of Pakistan's armed forces that he staged a bloodless coup against Sharif in 1999 after Sharif tried to remove him from his position after months of contention.This enabled Musharraf to become president of the country in 2001.As a military dictator trying to assist the US in its ""war on terror,"" especially in Afghanistan, and fighting an ever-increasing amount of criticism at home because of his policies, Musharraf survived at least three attempts on his life during his seven-year rule. These were attacks planned by Pakistan's Taliban militants.The biggest failed attempt to assassinate him was on December 14, 2003. This was a bomb attack that targeted his high-security convoy while it was crossing a bridge in Rawalpindi.It was during Musharraf's rule that attacks from local Taliban groups began to increase in Pakistan. The special forces' operation against religious extremists holed up in the Red Mosque in Islamabad was also carried out in 2007. Musharraf was hugely criticized for the incident, in which over 150 people died.Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's former prime minister and leader of the opposition's Pakistan People's Party, was also murdered in 2007 at the end of an election rally in Rawalpindi during Musharraf's rule.Musharraf had always said that he wanted to change Pakistan, to make it a peaceful, developed and prosperous nation. And while in power, he did what he felt he had to, though not always with unanimous support. Pakistan did change a lot — during his rule and also afterward. But it was not the way he had intended and perhaps not the way the majority of the over 220 million Pakistanis wanted, either.Musharraf, as president of Pakistan, also had huge differences with the judiciary. He suspended Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry from office after the Pakistan Supreme Court had wanted to examine the legality of Musharraf's reelection as president in October 2007.Musharraf's political career took a turn for the worse when on August 7, 2008, his rival and ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto's widower Asif Zardari announced a plan to impeach him.Eleven days after that, Musharraf announced his resignation as president and was promised permission to leave the country, allowing him to emigrate to London.When he returned to Pakistan at the end of March 2013, he did so as the head of his new political party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, and with a plan: to return to power through public support.The crowd of people welcoming him back in Karachi was, however, smaller than he had anticipated.Upon his return, he said he wanted to free Pakistan from terrorism and that he was risking his life: the Taliban had threatened to kill him upon his arrival.In the end, however, he was disqualified from taking part in that year's general election after arrest warrants were issued for him and former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz over their alleged involvement in the killings of Pakistani politician Nawab Akbar Bugti and of Benazir Bhutto.Sharif, who was reelected as prime minister at the election, then initiated high treason charges against Musharraf for implementing emergency rule and suspending the constitution in 2007.Musharraf moved to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in 2016, leading to his being declared an ""absconder"" in the Bhutto assassination case. He was then sentenced to death in absentia on the treason charges, though that sentence was later lifted by the Lahore High Court.He died in Dubai on February 5 after suffering from a prolonged case of amyloidosis.",2023/2/5,,

The winner needs 50% plus one vote to succeed President Anastasiades, who cannot run for a third term.The forerunners in the elections are former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodouldes, right-leaning Democratic Rally (DISY) party leader Averof Neophytou, and career diplomat Andreas Mavroyiannis, backed by the leftist Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL).Christodoulides is regarded as the favorite.""All polls indicate that Christodoulides is going to the second round.

""And if he goes to the second round, he is predicted to win.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801065,Iran acknowledges 'tens of thousands' detained in protests,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran's supreme leader on Sunday reportedly ordered an amnesty or reduction in prison sentences for “tens of thousands” of people detained amid nationwide anti-government protests shaking the country, acknowledging for the first time the scale of the crackdown. 

            The decree by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, part of a yearly pardoning the supreme leader does before the anniversary of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, comes as authorities have yet to say how many people they detained in the demonstrations. State media also published a list of caveats over the order that would disqualify those with ties abroad or facing spying charges — allegations which have been met with wide international criticism.

            Khamenei “agreed to offer amnesty and reduce the sentences of tens of thousands accused and convicted in the recent incidents,” the state-run IRNA news agency said in a Farsi report. A later IRNA report carried by its English-language service said the pardons and commuted sentences were for ""tens of thousands of convicts, including the arrestees of the recent riots in Iran.” Authorities did not immediately acknowledge the discrepancy in the reports. 











            The reports about the decree offered no explanation for the decision by Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state in Iran. However, prisons and detention facilities already had faced overcrowding in the country after years of protests over economic issues and other matters. 

            Activists immediately dismissed Khamenei’s decree.

            “Khamenei’s hypocritical pardon doesn’t change anything,” wrote Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam of the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights. “Not only all protesters must be released unconditionally, but also it is a public right that those who ordered the bloody repression and their agents are held accountable.”

            Authorities also did not name any of those who had been pardoned or seen shorter sentences. Instead, state television continued to refer to the demonstrations as being a ""foreign-backed riot,"" rather than homegrown anger over the September death of Masha Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman detained by the country's morality police. Anger also has been spreading over the collapse of the Iranian rial against the U.S. dollar, as well as Tehran arming Russia with bomb-carrying drones in its war on Ukraine. 

            More than 19,600 people have been arrested during the protests, according to Human Rights Activists in Iran, a group that's been tracking the crackdown. At least 527 people have been killed as authorities violently suppressed demonstrations, the group said. Iran hasn't offered a death toll for months. It already has executed at least four people detained amid the protests after internationally criticized trials.

            All this comes as Iran's nuclear deal has collapsed and Tehran has enough highly enriched uranium to potentially build “several” atomic bombs if it chooses, the United Nations' top nuclear envoy has said. A shadow war between Iran and Israel has risen out of the chaos, with Tehran blaming Israel for a drone attack on a military workshop in Isfahan last week as well.

            Meanwhile, a long-detained opposition leader in Iran is calling for a nationwide referendum about whether to write a new constitution for the Islamic Republic.

            Mir Hossein Mousavi's call, posted late Saturday by the opposition Kaleme website, included him saying he didn't believe Iran's current system giving final say to a supreme leader worked any longer. He also called for the formation of a constitutional assembly of “real representatives” to write a new constitution. 

            It remains unlikely Iran's theocracy will heed the 80-year-old politician's call. He and his wife have been under house arrest for years after his disputed presidential election loss in 2009 led to the widespread Green Movement protests that security forces also put down. However, he himself had supported and served in Iran's theocracy for decades. 

            In 2019, Mousavi compared Khamenei to the former Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose rule saw troops gun down demonstrators in an event that led to the Islamic Revolution. 

            Separately, former reformist President Mohammad Khatami urged “free and competitive elections” after the release of political prisoners both imprisoned and under house arrest. 

            “Reformism at least has faced a ... dead end, so people have a right to be frustrated about it as they are about the ruling system,” Khatami said in a statement circulated online.

            Currently, hard-liners control all levers of power in the country. Reformists like Khatami and Mousavi previously sought to change and open up Iran's Islamic Republic while maintaining its system. But increasingly, protesters have demanded an end to theocratic rule in the country.

He also called for the formation of a constitutional assembly of “real representatives” to write a new constitution.It remains unlikely Iran's theocracy will heed the 80-year-old politician's call. He and his wife have been under house arrest for years after his disputed presidential election loss in 2009 led to the widespread Green Movement protests that security forces also put down. However, he himself had supported and served in Iran's theocracy for decades.In 2019, Mousavi compared Khamenei to the former Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose rule saw troops gun down demonstrators in an event that led to the Islamic Revolution.Separately, former reformist President Mohammad Khatami urged “free and competitive elections” after the release of political prisoners both imprisoned and under house arrest.“Reformism at least has faced a ... dead end, so people have a right to be frustrated about it as they are about the ruling system,” Khatami said in a statement circulated online.Currently, hard-liners control all levers of power in the country. Reformists like Khatami and Mousavi previously sought to change and open up Iran's Islamic Republic while maintaining its system. But increasingly, protesters have demanded an end to theocratic rule in the country.___Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",2023/2/5,,World

            The governor’s office of Afyonkarahisar province said the bus was traveling from the southeastern Diyarbakir province to the Aegean city of Bodrum.

            Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that 42 people were injured, with three in critical condition.











            Videos from the scene showed ambulances lined up and a crane holding the bus up.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801075,"Chinese 'internet water army' attacks Facebook pages of Taiwan president, former premier","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sources familiar with Taiwan’s national security affairs said that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been using paid online commentators (internet water army) to attack President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) and former Premier Su Tseng-chang’s (蘇貞昌) Facebook accounts.The CCP has hired online marketing companies, which have hired people to engage in cyberattacks, and at least 825 suspicious accounts have been identified, CNA reported.According to CNA, national security sources said that the Chinese cyber army left messages on Tsai’s and Su’s Facebook pages, such as ""[You are] comparing yourself to Ukraine to be the cannon fodder for the Americans.” An investigation found that the true identity of Yanchun Song, which is one of the 825 accounts, was Sung Yen-chun (宋岩春), the general manager of a Chinese advertising agency.According to reports, the cyber army adopted a four-step method. First, they posted articles using a fake account. Second, they used foreigners' fan pages to share screenshots.Third, they used these fake accounts to forward information. Last, they share the fake articles with large public groups on Facebook to increase their reach.The misinformation was then spread by the public to LINE groups and other Facebook groups, per CNA.According to Taiwan’s intelligence, the CCP used this method to extensively meddle in Taiwan’s nine-in-one local election in November, and will target the 2024 presidential and legislative elections, using the same method. Topics the paid commentators focus on include inflation, selling agricultural and fishery products to China, military exercises against Taiwan, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the imminent breakout of a cross-strait war, and the U.S. abandoning Taiwan.",2023/2/5,2638,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801097,It wasn’t me: Ex-UK PM Truss blames 'system' for her failure,"LONDON (AP) — Former British Prime Minister Liz Truss says her failure wasn't her fault. 

            Truss on Sunday blamed a “powerful economic establishment” and internal Conservative Party opposition for the rapid collapse of her government, and said she still believes her tax-cutting policies were the right ones.

            Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister resigned in October, six weeks into the job, after her inaugural budget plan sparked market mayhem.











            Breaking her post-premiership silence in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, Truss said she underestimated the resistance her free-market policies would face from “the system.” 

            “I am not claiming to be blameless in what happened, but fundamentally I was not given a realistic chance to enact my policies by a very powerful economic establishment, coupled with a lack of political support,” she wrote.

            Truss took office in September after winning a Conservative Party leadership contest to replace scandal-tarnished Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Her promise to spur economic growth with tax cuts and deregulation enthused Tory members, but a budget containing 45 billion pounds ($54 billion) in unfunded tax cuts — including an income tax reduction for the highest earners — spooked the financial markets. 

            The prospect of more debt and higher inflation sent the pound plunging to its lowest-ever level against the U.S. dollar. The cost of government borrowing soared and the Bank of England had to step in to prop up the bond market and prevent a wider economic meltdown that threatened people’s pensions.

            Truss first fired her Treasury chief, Kwasi Kwarteng, then quit herself. 

            In the article, she claimed her government was made a “scapegoat” for long-brewing instability with liability driven investments, a form of bond market derivatives in which pension funds are heavily invested,

            Truss said she still believed her low-tax, small-state agenda “was the right thing to do, but the forces against it were too great.” She claimed “large parts of the media and the wider public sphere” had a left-wing slant, and criticized U.S. President Joe Biden for calling her plan a mistake.

            Critics accused the former prime minister of rewriting history and using the populist playbook by blaming the system for her own failures.

            Gavin Barwell, a Conservative who was chief of staff to ex-Prime Minister Theresa May, tweeted at Truss: “You were brought down because in a matter of weeks you lost the confidence of the financial markets, the electorate and your own MPs. During a profound cost of living crisis, you thought it was a priority to cut tax for the richest people in the country.”

            Cambridge University economist Charles Read said he warned the Treasury in early September that a sudden economic stimulus package “risked financial instability and a financial crisis.

            “The mini-budget crisis last autumn was predictable, preventable & avoidable,” he wrote on Twitter.

            Truss’ article could put more pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a former Treasury chief installed by the Conservatives to calm the markets and steady the government after her departure.

            Sunak says tackling double-digit inflation is more important than immediate tax cuts. But with the economy still struggling — the International Monetary Fund says Britain will be the only major economy to contract this year — and the party lagging well behind Labour in opinion polls, some Conservative lawmakers are getting restless.

            A faction inside the party is still pushing immediate tax cuts, despite the damage done by “Trussonomics.”

            Lawmaker Jake Berry, a former party chair, said that while Truss’ agenda “wasn’t delivered in the right way,” she had the right instincts.

            “Her point of, we need to lower taxes, we need to create a growing economy, that’s what people want,” Berry told the BBC. ___

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801099,Election skeptics slow to get sweeping changes in GOP states,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Republicans in some heavily conservative states won their campaigns for secretary of state last year after claiming they would make sweeping changes aimed at keeping fraud out of elections.

            So far, their efforts to make good on their promises are mixed, in some cases because their rhetoric has bumped up against skepticism from members of their own party.

            Voters in politically pivotal swing states such as Arizona, Michigan and Nevada rejected candidates seeking to oversee elections who had echoed former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 presidential election. But newly elected secretaries of state in Alabama, Indiana and Wyoming who had questioned the legitimacy of that election won easily in those Republican-dominated states.











            They are now facing the task of backing up their campaign pledges in states where Republicans have already set strict election laws.

            In Indiana, Secretary of State Diego Morales has been relatively quiet. He has not been making the rounds at the Statehouse trying to persuade lawmakers to embrace the wide-ranging tightening of voting rules he promoted as a candidate.

            After defeating the incumbent secretary of state for the Republican nomination last summer, Morales dialed back his description of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election as a “scam” and his calls for tighter voting laws. That push included cutting Indiana’s 28-day early voting period in half and requiring new voters to prove their U.S. citizenship when registering.

            No bills for such steps were introduced for this year’s legislative session. Morales, who was an aide to Mike Pence when the former vice president was governor, also did not seek any money in his budget request to lawmakers for creating an “election task force,” which he had discussed as a candidate, that would investigate voting “shenanigans” around the state.

            A concept backed by Morales for requiring voters to include a copy of their driver’s license with a mail-in ballot application is being sponsored by a Republican lawmaker, but he said he wasn’t working with Morales on the proposal.

            Morales’ office has declined interview requests from The Associated Press since he took office Jan. 1. Kegan Prentice, the office's legislative director, said Morales was “currently focused on the ongoing transition.”

            During remarks at an early January inaugural ceremony, Morales continued his campaign theme of promoting “election integrity” without giving specifics.

            “My priority is to make Indiana a national model for election confidence and integrity,"" he said.

            Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, also a Republican, said recently he had talked with Morales and told him he was “comfortable” with the state’s election laws.

            “I think our election laws are as good as any in the country,” Huston said.

            Morales was among the otherwise unsuccessful candidates associated with the America First Secretary of State Coalition, which called for large-scale changes to elections with candidates aligned with Trump’s views. The group supported losing candidates in several battleground states.

            They claimed widespread fraud and manipulation of voting machines, but there has been no evidence of either as exhaustive reviews in states lost by Trump have not revealed wrongdoing. That hasn't stopped Republican candidates, particularly in contested primaries, from parroting the false claims that have taken hold among the party’s supporters.

            A large segment of Republicans, 58%, still believe Biden’s 2020 victory was not legitimate, according to an October poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

            While Alabama’s Wes Allen and Wyoming’s Chuck Gray were not on the America First coalition’s candidate list, they also raised doubts about the 2020 vote.

            Allen repeated a debunked claim calling the 31-state Electronic Registration Information Center organization a “Soros-funded, leftist group,” a reference to liberal billionaire George Soros. The voter registration data-sharing partnership is designed to maintain accurate voter rolls by identifying people who have moved or died. It's funded by states after receiving initial startup support from The Pew Charitable Trusts.

            Allen’s first official act was to withdraw Alabama from the group, citing privacy concerns. Indiana and Wyoming weren't part of the organization.

            Even though Wyoming gave Trump his widest victory margins in 2016 and 2020, Gray’s election denials worried some of his fellow Republicans. The former state legislator and right-wing radio host often showed “2000 Mules,” a film that made unsubstantiated claims about ballot fraud, during his campaign events last year. He solidly beat a fellow Republican lawmaker who said the 2020 presidential outcome wasn’t in doubt.

            A few Republicans questioned whether Gray should be stripped of his election oversight role given his views, but that idea has received little support. Instead, he has received a warm welcome from Wyoming lawmakers considering several election bills that are moving ahead.

            One would prohibit “ballot harvesting,” or gathering others' completed ballots for delivery, while another would implement new requirements for voting machines that would, in part, ensure they could not be connected to the internet.

            But so far there is no legislation to follow through on Gray's campaign proposals to ban ballot drop boxes or electronic voting machines, which despite mainly paper balloting in Wyoming are available in every county to help voters with disabilities.

            That reflects the reality of trying to implement the most far-reaching election campaign promises in a heavily Republican state.

            In January, Gov. Mark Gordon made a point in his state of the state speech of saying that Wyoming counts on election integrity because of its “professional and dedicated” county clerks.

            But going off-script, Gordon hinted at Gray’s challenges ahead: “And I’m thrilled that our secretary of state takes that charge very seriously.”

            Cassidy reported from Atlanta and Gruver from Cheyenne, Wyoming. Associated Press writer Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama, contributed to this report.INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Republicans in some heavily conservative states won their campaigns for secretary of state last year after claiming they would make sweeping changes aimed at keeping fraud out of elections.So far, their efforts to make good on their promises are mixed, in some cases because their rhetoric has bumped up against skepticism from members of their own party.Voters in politically pivotal swing states such as Arizona, Michigan and Nevada rejected candidates seeking to oversee elections who had echoed former President Donald Trump's false claims about the 2020 presidential election. But newly elected secretaries of state in Alabama, Indiana and Wyoming who had questioned the legitimacy of that election won easily in those Republican-dominated states.They are now facing the task of backing up their campaign pledges in states where Republicans have already set strict election laws.In Indiana, Secretary of State Diego Morales has been relatively quiet. He has not been making the rounds at the Statehouse trying to persuade lawmakers to embrace the wide-ranging tightening of voting rules he promoted as a candidate.After defeating the incumbent secretary of state for the Republican nomination last summer, Morales dialed back his description of Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential election as a “scam” and his calls for tighter voting laws. That push included cutting Indiana’s 28-day early voting period in half and requiring new voters to prove their U.S. citizenship when registering.No bills for such steps were introduced for this year’s legislative session. Morales, who was an aide to Mike Pence when the former vice president was governor, also did not seek any money in his budget request to lawmakers for creating an “election task force,” which he had discussed as a candidate, that would investigate voting “shenanigans” around the state.A concept backed by Morales for requiring voters to include a copy of their driver’s license with a mail-in ballot application is being sponsored by a Republican lawmaker, but he said he wasn’t working with Morales on the proposal.Morales’ office has declined interview requests from The Associated Press since he took office Jan. 1. Kegan Prentice, the office's legislative director, said Morales was “currently focused on the ongoing transition.”During remarks at an early January inaugural ceremony, Morales continued his campaign theme of promoting “election integrity” without giving specifics.“My priority is to make Indiana a national model for election confidence and integrity,"" he said.Indiana House Speaker Todd Huston, also a Republican, said recently he had talked with Morales and told him he was “comfortable” with the state’s election laws.“I think our election laws are as good as any in the country,” Huston said.Morales was among the otherwise unsuccessful candidates associated with the America First Secretary of State Coalition, which called for large-scale changes to elections with candidates aligned with Trump’s views. The group supported losing candidates in several battleground states.They claimed widespread fraud and manipulation of voting machines, but there has been no evidence of either as exhaustive reviews in states lost by Trump have not revealed wrongdoing. That hasn't stopped Republican candidates, particularly in contested primaries, from parroting the false claims that have taken hold among the party’s supporters.A large segment of Republicans, 58%, still believe Biden’s 2020 victory was not legitimate, according to an October poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.While Alabama’s Wes Allen and Wyoming’s Chuck Gray were not on the America First coalition’s candidate list, they also raised doubts about the 2020 vote.Allen repeated a debunked claim calling the 31-state Electronic Registration Information Center organization a “Soros-funded, leftist group,” a reference to liberal billionaire George Soros. The voter registration data-sharing partnership is designed to maintain accurate voter rolls by identifying people who have moved or died. It's funded by states after receiving initial startup support from The Pew Charitable Trusts.Allen’s first official act was to withdraw Alabama from the group, citing privacy concerns. Indiana and Wyoming weren't part of the organization.Even though Wyoming gave Trump his widest victory margins in 2016 and 2020, Gray’s election denials worried some of his fellow Republicans. The former state legislator and right-wing radio host often showed “2000 Mules,” a film that made unsubstantiated claims about ballot fraud, during his campaign events last year. He solidly beat a fellow Republican lawmaker who said the 2020 presidential outcome wasn’t in doubt.A few Republicans questioned whether Gray should be stripped of his election oversight role given his views, but that idea has received little support.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801100,"Cardi B pays homage to Kallman, Greenwald at pre-Grammy gala","LOS ANGELES (AP) — When Cardi B was searching for a record deal six years ago, the rapper remembered when several labels didn’t financially believe in her talents enough – except for Atlantic Records executives Julie Greenwald and Craig Kallman.

            Cardi B paid homage on Saturday night to Greenwald and Craig Kallman, who were honored with the 2023 Industry Icons Award at the star-studded Clive Davis pre-Grammys gala in Beverly Hills, California. The uber-popular event – which was held the night before the Grammy Awards – returned for the first time since 2020 after being put on hold because of the pandemic.

            In a heartfelt speech, the Grammy winner thanked Greenwald and Kallman for supporting her career aspirations. Kallman is the CEO and chairman of Atlantic Records, while Greenwald holds the position as CEO and chairman of Atlantic Music Group - a newly formed label that’s home to Atlantic Records and 300 Elektra.











            “Other labels were low-balling me and not giving me what I thought I deserved, but Atlantic was right there respecting me, my vision and my career,” the rapper recalled. “Craig and Julie took me under their wing.”

            Cardi B said she had fears of choosing between her career or being a mother while recording her debut album “Invasion of Privacy,” which ultimately won her a Grammy in 2019.

            “I was very scared, I was pregnant and I was afraid to tell anyone,” she said. “I was afraid to tell anyone. I was afraid of people who wanted me to decide between my family and my career, because I knew that happened to other artists with other labels. But with Craig and Julie, the exact opposite happened. You told me I could do both and I will never ever forget that.”

            Davis' annual gala is hard to gain entry or an invite to. With more than 300 tables filled, a plethora of well-known figures helped pack the room including former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, her husband Paul Pelosi, Tom Hanks, H.E.R., Janelle Monae, Lil Nas X, Demi Lovato, Tyrese, Olivia Rodrigo, Machine Gun Kelly, Megan Fox and Chance the Rapper.

            Kevin Costner kicked off the multi-hour event with speech about his relationship with Davis and the late Whitney Houston, who the actor starred with in the 1992 film “The Bodyguard.” The three of them took a “huge leap” to move forward with the film - especially for Davis, the actor said.

            “Maybe the hardest was for Clive,” Costner said. “I needed to believe I could make the movie that I was imagining. Whitney saw it as a chance to reinvent herself. But for Clive, it was a career move that had a recipe for disaster written all over it. I needed Clive. I needed his trust and his blessing. I needed one thing he was not used to doing: control.""

            Costner called Davis a “miracle” in Houston’s life. The singer died in 2012 at the age of 48.

            “You couldn’t protect your beloved Whitney. Your fingerprints on her life are clean, my friend,” Costner said. “You were a miracle in her life. Thank you for being her bodyguard, Clive. … Everyone in this business has a momma. But everyone doesn’t get a Clive.”

            The event included several performances including Maneskin, Lizzo, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Hudson, Frankie Valli, Lauren Daigle, Latto, Lil Baby and Lil Wayne.

            “This one night, we still break bread, we celebrate the music that basically and forever bonds us all,” Davis said. “There are no awards. There are no winners or losers tonight. It’s just our passion that makes our heartbeat faster. It makes our life so much more greatly purposed with joy and fulfillment.”LOS ANGELES (AP) — When Cardi B was searching for a record deal six years ago, the rapper remembered when several labels didn’t financially believe in her talents enough – except for Atlantic Records executives Julie Greenwald and Craig Kallman.Cardi B paid homage on Saturday night to Greenwald and Craig Kallman, who were honored with the 2023 Industry Icons Award at the star-studded Clive Davis pre-Grammys gala in Beverly Hills, California.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801106,Ukraine defense minister expects help from West on warplanes,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's defense minister expressed confidence Sunday that Western allies would agree to the country's latest weapons request — warplanes to fight off Russian forces that invaded nearly a year ago. 

            Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told a news conference in Kyiv that Ukraine has already received everything from its “wish list to Santa,” except planes. 

            “There will be planes, too,"" Reznikov predicted. “The question is just what kind exactly.... Consider that this mission is already completed.”











            So far, Ukraine has won support from Baltic nations and Poland in its quest to obtain Western fighter jets. But several Western leaders have expressed concern that providing warplanes could provoke the Kremlin and draw their countries deeper into the conflict, which has cost tens of thousands of lives and wreaked massive destruction.

            Kyiv says such jets are essential to challenging Russia’s air superiority and ensuring success in a Russian offensive that Reznikov predicted could begin around the war's one-year anniversary, Feb. 24. 

            ""Not all Western weapons will arrive by then, but we have the resources and reserves to help stabilize and sustain the offensive,” Reznikov told reporters.

            Since the war began, Western leaders have balked at some of Ukraine's requests, such as for longer-range missiles and tanks, only to agree later. The warplanes are the latest example.

            Ukraine has relocated its warplanes and concealed air defense assets, hampering Moscow’s efforts to gain full control of the skies. After suffering early losses, the Russian air force has avoided venturing deep into Ukraine’s airspace and mostly focused on close front line support.

            German-made tanks are on the way to Ukraine. Reznikov said his forces would begin training on Leopard tanks in Europe on Monday, before their delivery to Ukraine. So far, Canada, Poland, Germany, Great Britain and the United States have announced they will supply tanks to Ukraine.

            The Kremlin has said Western countries' supply of increasingly sophisticated and more weapons will only prolong the conflict, and it has characterized NATO as a direct participant. Reznikov, commenting on the supply of Western weapons and the state of the Ukrainian army, took the rhetoric further on Sunday, telling reporters: “I absolutely boldly claim that we have become a de facto NATO country. We only have a de jure part left.”

            Ukraine has applied to join NATO, as have two of Russia's other neighbors, Finland and Sweden.

            On the battlefield, Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said four people were injured Sunday when a Russian S-300 missile fell near an apartment block in Kharkiv city, and another was hurt when a missile hit a university building. Video showed the building hit was the National Academy for Urban Economy, about 700 meters from the city's central square.

            Meanwhile, heavy fighting continued in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, one of four regions that Russia illegally annexed last year even though its forces do not fully control the area. Donetsk governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said five civilians were wounded in rocket attacks during the night in the city of Druzhkivka and that the town of Avdiivka and its outskirts were also fired on.

            In the Donetsk city of Bakhmut, the epicenter of the fiercest fighting in Ukraine, the Ukrainian military said Sunday it had repelled Russian attacks. The founder of the mercenary group Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, said in a Telegram post that Kyiv's forces were not retreating and that “there are fierce battles for every street, every house, every stairwell.”

            In the Black Sea port of Odesa, workers labored to connect temporary generators shipped in to restore electricity. The city and surrounding area were plunged into darkness over the weekend following a large-scale network failure.

            Grid operator Ukrenergo said that the failure involved equipment “repeatedly repaired” after Russia’s savage strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid, and that residents should brace themselves for lengthy blackouts.

            As of Sunday afternoon, about 280,000 customers — 40% of the customers — remained without power, said prime minister Denis Shmyhal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801109,"Europe bans Russian diesel, other oil products over Ukraine","FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Europe imposed a ban Sunday on Russian diesel fuel and other refined oil products, slashing energy dependency on Moscow and seeking to further crimp the Kremlin's fossil fuel earnings as punishment for invading Ukraine.

            The ban comes along with a price cap agreed by the Group of Seven allied democracies. The goal is allowing Russian diesel to keep flowing to countries like China and India and avoiding a sudden price rise that would hurt consumers worldwide, while reducing the profits funding Moscow's budget and war. 

            Diesel is key for the economy because it is used to power cars, trucks carrying goods, farm equipment and factory machinery. Diesel prices have been elevated due to recovering demand after the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on refining capacity, contributing to inflation for other goods worldwide.











            The new sanctions create uncertainty about prices as the 27-nation European Union finds new supplies of diesel from the U.S., Middle East and India to replace those from Russia, which at one point delivered 10% of Europe's total diesel needs. Those are longer journeys than from Russia's ports, stretching available tankers. 

            Prices also could be driven up by reviving demand from China as the economy rebounds after the end of draconian COVID-19 restrictions. 

            The price cap of $100 per barrel for diesel, jet fuel and gasoline is to be enforced by barring insurance and shipping services from handling diesel priced over the limit. Most of those companies are located in Western countries. 

            It follows a $60-per-barrel cap on Russian crude that took effect in December and is supposed to work the same way. Both the diesel and oil caps could be tightened later. 

            “Once we have these price caps set, we can squeeze the Russian price and deny them, deny (President Vladimir) Putin money for his war without a price spike that's going to hurt Western economies and developing economies,” said Thomas O'Donnell, a global fellow with the Washington-based Wilson Center. 

            The diesel price cap will not bite immediately because it was set at about what Russian diesel trades for. Russia’s chief problem now will be finding new customers, not evading the price ceiling. However, the cap aims to prevent Russian gains from any sudden price spikes in refined oil products.

            Analysts say there might be a price bump initially as markets sort out the changes. But they say the embargo should not cause a price spike if the cap works as intended and Russian diesel keeps flowing to other countries.

            Diesel fuel at the pump has been flat since the start of December, costing 1.80 euros per liter ($7.37 per gallon) as of Jan. 30, according to the weekly oil market report issued by the European Union’s executive commission. Pump prices in Germany, the EU’s largest economy, fell 2.6 cents to 1.83 euros per liter ($7.48 per gallon) as of Jan. 31.

            The ban provides for a 55-day grace period for diesel loaded on tankers before Sunday, a step aimed at avoiding ruffling markets. European Union officials say importers have had time to adjust since the ban was announced in June.

            Russia earned more than $2 billion from diesel sales to Europe in December alone as importers appear to have stocked up with added purchases ahead of the ban. 

            Europe has already banned Russian coal and most crude oil, while Moscow has cut off most shipments of natural gas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801114,Iraqis protest gender violence after YouTube star killed,"DIWANIYAH, Iraq (AP) — Dozens of Iraqi protesters gathered Sunday to decry the so-called “honor killing” of a 22-year-old YouTube star who was allegedly strangled by her father, adding fuel to calls for legal reforms protecting women.

            Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan on Friday announced that Tiba Ali was killed Jan. 31 in the central city of Diwaniyah by her father, who then turned himself in to the police. Reports say the father strangled Ali at night while she was asleep. 

            The so-called “honor killing” was met with condemnation from women's rights groups and residents, who sounded the alarm on violence against women in Iraq and the need to reform legislation to impose harsher punishments on perpetrators. 











            The protesters held banners condemning the killing and demanding legislative reforms. “There is no honor in the crime of killing women,” one placard read. 

            “Anyone who wants to get rid of a woman accuses her of disgracing her dignity and kills her,” protester Israa al-Salman told The Associated Press, who also wanted Ali’s father executed.

            Article 41 of the country's penal code allows husbands to “discipline” their wives, which includes beatings. Meanwhile, Article 409 reduces murder sentences for men who kill or permanently impair their wives or female relatives because of adultery to up to three years in prison.

            Rosa al-Hamid, an activist with civil society group the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq urged the authorities to pass a long-stalled draft law against domestic violence that has been lingering in Iraqi Parliament since 2019.

            “Tiba was killed by her father under tribal justifications that are unacceptable,” she told the AP.

            Amnesty International Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Aya Majzoub said in a press statement said that violence against women and girls in Iraq will continue until “Iraqi authorities adopt robust legislation to protect women and girls from gender-based violence.""

            Diwaniyah's city police department and hospital administration declined to comment to the AP about Ali's death. 

            Tiba Ali had been living in Istanbul, Turkey, and had a YouTube channel with over 20,000 subscribers documenting life in the Turkish city alongside her Syrian-born boyfriend, a real estate investor. In her first YouTube video in November 2021, Ali said she moved to Turkey to further her education, but chose to stay because she enjoyed life there. 

            Her father reportedly did not agree with the move, nor her plans to marry her partner. Maan said that Ali and her father had a heated dispute during a visit to Iraq, and that the day before her murder, the local community police had intervened to help them reach a settlement.

            Salim contributed from Irbil, Iraq. Associated Press writer Kareem Chehayeb reported from Beirut.DIWANIYAH, Iraq (AP) — Dozens of Iraqi protesters gathered Sunday to decry the so-called “honor killing” of a 22-year-old YouTube star who was allegedly strangled by her father, adding fuel to calls for legal reforms protecting women.Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan on Friday announced that Tiba Ali was killed Jan. 31 in the central city of Diwaniyah by her father, who then turned himself in to the police. Reports say the father strangled Ali at night while she was asleep.The so-called “honor killing” was met with condemnation from women's rights groups and residents, who sounded the alarm on violence against women in Iraq and the need to reform legislation to impose harsher punishments on perpetrators.The protesters held banners condemning the killing and demanding legislative reforms. “There is no honor in the crime of killing women,” one placard read.“Anyone who wants to get rid of a woman accuses her of disgracing her dignity and kills her,” protester Israa al-Salman told The Associated Press, who also wanted Ali’s father executed.Article 41 of the country's penal code allows husbands to “discipline” their wives, which includes beatings. Meanwhile, Article 409 reduces murder sentences for men who kill or permanently impair their wives or female relatives because of adultery to up to three years in prison.Rosa al-Hamid, an activist with civil society group the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq urged the authorities to pass a long-stalled draft law against domestic violence that has been lingering in Iraqi Parliament since 2019.“Tiba was killed by her father under tribal justifications that are unacceptable,” she told the AP.Amnesty International Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Aya Majzoub said in a press statement said that violence against women and girls in Iraq will continue until “Iraqi authorities adopt robust legislation to protect women and girls from gender-based violence.""Diwaniyah's city police department and hospital administration declined to comment to the AP about Ali's death.Tiba Ali had been living in Istanbul, Turkey, and had a YouTube channel with over 20,000 subscribers documenting life in the Turkish city alongside her Syrian-born boyfriend, a real estate investor.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801116,Martínez scores again as Inter beats Milan in Serie A derby,"MILAN (AP) — World Cup winner Lautaro Martínez continued his roaring start to the year as he set Inter Milan on its way to a 1-0 victory over AC Milan in the Derby della Madonnina on Sunday.

            Martínez has been in fantastic form since helping Argentina win the World Cup in December and he netted his seventh goal in his last eight matches as Inter consolidated second spot in Serie A with a second win over its fierce rival in less than three weeks.

            “As soon as the World Cup was over I said that winning it had fired me up,” Martínez said. “It’s the best present that I have ever received, I learnt a lot and I’m trying to put all that on the field.”











            It was Martínez’s 12th league goal of the season, putting him four behind leading Serie A goalscorer Victor Osimhen, who scored another two on Sunday to help runaway leader Napoli win 3-0 at lowly Spezia.

            Inter is 13 points behind Napoli and three points above third-place Roma. It is five points above Lazio, Atalanta and Milan, which has slipped to sixth after a woeful start to the year.

            “I complimented my players because they were perfect, I don’t remember a derby won and dominated in this way,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. 

            “We had a really great derby, winning two derbies in the space of 20 days isn’t something that happens every year. We’re not looking either ahead of us or behind us in the standings, but just at ourselves.”

            Milan's winless run extended to seven matches. That streak included elimination from the Italian Cup and a 3-0 loss to Inter in the Super Cup.

            Before the derby, Milan had also conceded an unprecedented nine goals in its past two Serie A matches.

            With that perhaps playing in their minds, the Rossoneri defended deep from the start and rarely got out of their own half. Milan had to wait almost an hour for its first shot, and that was off target.

            Inter almost took the lead in the 10th minute but Martínez headed just wide of the right upright.

            Martínez did better in the 34th as he got away from Simon Kjær at the near post to get his head to a corner and it took a deflection off the Milan defender on the way in.

            Romelu Lukaku thought he had scored his first league goal since August, late on, but the whistle had already gone for a foul by him on Malick Thiaw.

            Martínez also had a goal ruled out for offside.

            FIVE-STAR OSIMHEN

            Osimhen appears to be firing Napoli to the Serie A title as the Nigeria forward netted for the fifth straight league match.

            Spezia had defended well against Napoli’s stellar attack but gifted the visitors a penalty less than 10 seconds after the break when defender Arkadiusz Reca was trying to hold off Matteo Politano but didn’t anticipate that the bounce of the ball would take it onto his outstretched arm.

            Khvicha Kvaratskhelia converted the penalty, prompting the game to open up.

            Osimhen had a goal ruled out in the 62nd for pulling back Mattia Caldara but he headed in his first in the 68th and doubled his tally five minutes later following another assist from Kvaratskhelia.

            Spezia remained five points above the relegation zone.

            EUROPEAN FIGHT

            Torino beat Udinese 1-0 to leapfrog its opponent into the Europa Conference League qualifying spot.

            Torino is one point above Udinese and Bologna, which won 2-1 at Fiorentina for its first victory in Florence in 13 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801117,Gavins wins Ras Al Khaimah Championship after wild finish,"RAS AL KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Daniel Gavins won the Ras Al Khaimah Championship on Sunday after a wild finish that saw the Englishman twice find the water on the last hole before rolling in a title-clinching putt from 26 feet for double-bogey.

            Gavins shot 3-under 69 to finish on 17 under overall, then had to wait to see if Zander Lombard — the third-round leader playing in the final group — could eagle the par-5 No. 18 to force a playoff. 

            Lombard's eagle putt missed right and Gavins celebrated with his girlfriend in the scoring hut. It was his second European tour title after the ISPS Handa World Invitational in 2021.











            Lombard (72) and Alexander Bjork (68) tied for second place, with Bjork — playing in the group ahead of Gavins — making a costly bogey down the last hole.

            Gavins hadn't realized that and thought he was playing the 18th leading by two, rather than three.

            He sliced his tee shot into the water. Then, after finding the middle of the fairway with his third shot, Gavins hit a fairway wood that veered right, bounced off the rocks and plopped into the water again.

            Gavins chipped from the rough onto the green with his sixth shot and thought he needed to hole the putt to get into a playoff with Bjork. He clenched his fist when the double-bogey putt dropped, not knowing he'd actually likely won.

            “I put two in the water and thought, ‘Well, that’s one way to end the tournament,'” Gavins said about what he described as a “difficult last hole to get through.”

            “I sunk the putt, went to the back of the green and saw that I was actually winning, still. It was kind of a big shock.”

            Gavins started the final round two shots off the lead, bogeyed the first, then made six birdies in seven holes to take the lead at Al Hamra Golf Club.

            “I felt pretty relaxed all day, to be fair,” he said, ""even though my swing off the tee wasn't great. I just played with what I had.

            “I felt it a lot on the 18th but apart from that, I was pretty calm all day.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801136,5 dead after migrant boat sinks off Greek island,"ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Four children and a woman died when a boat carrying at least 41 migrants crashed Sunday on a rocky coast on the Greek island of Leros, authorities said.

            Greece’s Coast Guard said it was alerted by a person who saw a body floating at sea. Three vessels and a helicopter, joined by a detachment that went overland, reached the point and retrieved the woman's body, as well as an unconscious boy and 39 other people, six of whom had made it to the rocky coast.

            A boy found unconscious was briefly revived in the hospital but later died, the Coast Guard said. Three other children who were conscious when they were found also died Sunday evening in the hospital.











            Three more minors and two adults were hospitalized early in the afternoon. The remaining boat passengers were taken to a reception camp to be sheltered.

            An inflatable boat was found half submerged. Gale force winds were blowing in the area and it was raining, authorities said.

            Minister of Shipping and Island Policy Ioannis Plakiotakis congratulated the rescuers but accused “criminal networks of traffickers that operate from Turkey, tolerated by the Turkish authorities” of abandoning the migrants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801139,"Mahomes, Hurts latest Texas prep QBs on Super Bowl stage","DALLAS (AP) — Texas high school quarterbacks guru Todd Dodge got what he wanted when Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts of Philadelphia won their conference championship games.

            “I really like Joe Burrow,” Dodge said with a chuckle in reference to Cincinnati's star quarterback, “but I'm not going to root for Joe Burrow over Patrick Mahomes, that Texas quarterback.”

            The Mahomes-Hurts matchup is the first showdown between a pair of Texas high school QBs and the latest milestone for a football-crazy state once known much more for Earl Campbell and Eric Dickerson than whoever was handing off to those future Pro Football Hall of Fame running backs.











            Dodge, a recently retired high school coach who won seven state championships, played a big role in the start of the transformation around 1980. He was the quarterback for what he considered the father of the passing game in Texas.

            Ronnie Thompson, a high school coach in Port Arthur about 100 miles from Houston, was throwing before it was cool in the Lone Star State, which made Dodge a high-profile recruit for the Texas Longhorns.

            While Dodge's career in Austin was disappointing, his legacy of training quarterbacks in his home state is unmistakable. One of the keys was identifying QBs — plenty of them — as early as seventh grade, with the goal of always having two capable of flourishing on the varsity.

            Before the likes of Dodge, Art Briles and the late Sonny Detmer came along, the focus was usually on finding the best running back and building from there.

            “Jalen Hurts 40 years ago would have been the next great tailback in the Southwest Conference,” said Dodge, who still runs a quarterback training program in retirement. “Somewhere along the way, his dad put the ball in his hands and he started throwing it.”

            Indeed, coach Averion Hurts at Channelview just outside Houston put his son at QB. Jalen Hurts went from college star at Alabama and Oklahoma to Philadelphia backup behind Carson Wentz to NFL MVP candidate in a matter of six years.

            Mahomes had the throwing pedigree as the son of former major league pitcher Pat Mahomes, and his strong arm was evident long before he became the starter at Whitehouse in East Texas.

            The Chiefs traded up to get Mahomes 10th overall in 2017, declared him the starter in the offseason a year later and watched him become MVP that year and a Super Bowl winner the next.

            “I think in Texas it's been a program of building football players up for a long time,” said Mahomes, whose Super Bowl matchup against Hurts will be the first between two Black quarterbacks. “There's still the great running backs, there's still the great receivers, the great tight ends, whatever you want to say.”

            The most recent Super Bowl-winning quarterback from Texas is Matthew Stafford, who played in the Dallas enclave of Highland Park before going to Georgia and getting drafted No. 1 overall by Detroit in 2009.

            His prolific career with the Lions mostly went nowhere before a trade to the Rams immediately led to a title last season. His high school coach, four-time state title winner Randy Allen, has a quarterback training program he believes he started after seeing Dodge conduct a coaching clinic.

            Once Texas became fertile ground for quarterbacks, it was only natural for growth in the college game, and subsequently the pros.

            “College coaches want to win, number one,” said Allen, the winningest active coach in Texas. “And number two, they know if they’ve got a Texas high school quarterback, that he’s probably played in front of big crowds. He’s probably played against great competition. He’s probably had great high school coaching and he’s probably ready to play as a freshman.”

            One of Allen's Highland Park teams was a round away from facing Mahomes in the Texas playoffs a decade ago, but Mahomes' team lost. 

            Mahomes never made a deep playoff run before thriving at Texas Tech under Kliff Kingsbury, a prolific Texas high school QB himself in the 1990s.

            Allen, Dodge and Mahomes all mentioned the expansion of offseason 7-on-7 football as a significant part of the development of Texas quarterbacks. Dozens of tournaments around the state culminate in a state championship event every summer in College Station, home of Texas A&M.

            Dodge also believes it helped when pass-happy teams started winning state championships. In one five-year stretch at Southlake Carroll, where son Riley is now coach, the elder Dodge had a 79-1 record with four state titles in the state's largest classification.

            The other three titles for Dodge came at Austin Westlake. Before his arrival, that school produced the first two Super Bowl-winning QBs from Texas in Drew Brees (New Orleans, 2009 season) and Nick Foles (Philadelphia, 2017).

            Hurts says the high school highlights might have something to do with how the mindset about the position. A regional cable network for Texas carries a live scoreboard show every Friday night, well into a six-week postseason that's capped by championship-game crowds approaching 50,000 at the home of the Dallas Cowboys.

            “Texas is so big,” Hurts said. “I’d turn on the TV and see, you had the Texas high school football late night show. It runs throughout the whole state. You see what (Mahomes is) doing.”

            Western Pennsylvania is famous for quarterbacks, too, with Hall of Famers Dan Marino, Joe Montana, Joe Namath, Jim Kelly and Johnny Unitas among the products. Mahomes is aware of this — because he has teammates from a state that also takes its high school football just as seriously.

            “I brag to all my PA guys because they brag they have the best state for football because of the history,” Mahomes said. “But I'm like, we're talking about the present, and Texas is pretty good right now.”

            Mahomes has a point. Texas is already guaranteed to be the high school home of four of the past six Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801141,Turmoil risks financial stability Peru long took for granted,"CUSCO, Peru (AP) — Marco Gonzales ventured to the Andean city of Cusco from his home in the Peruvian Amazon in 2007 with little more than $20, a smidgeon of English and a change of clothes poorly suited for the icy mountain air. 

            He started offering walking tours of the former Incan Empire capital in exchange for tips. Along the way he fell in love with a British backpacker, Nathalie Zulauf, and together the couple built a travel business and family.

            But now it's all at risk of collapsing along with so much of Peru’s once-enviable economic stability. 











            The couple’s company, Bloody Bueno Peru, which caters to mostly foreign tourists from Britain and elsewhere, hasn’t seen a customer since December, when protesters demanding the resignation of interim President Dina Boluarte all but cut off access to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu. Groups have canceled reservations months in advance, forcing the couple to dip into savings already depleted by the coronavirus pandemic.

            “We’re waiting until March to see if the situation improves,” said Gonzales, 38, staring at a calendar he no longer bothers to update. “If it doesn't we’ll have to explore other options, like shutting down the business and emigrating. At least in England we have Nathalie’s family.”

            Others in Cusco have far less to fall back on. 

            The city of 450,000, normally a polyglot mecca of foreign travelers, is a ghost town these days. The Plaza de Armas, where women dressed in colorful Andean textiles used to pose for snapshots, now attracts demonstrators playing cat-and-mouse with heavily armored riot police.

            Political turmoil is nothing new in Peru, which has seen six presidents in the last five years. In 1969, with a military dictatorship in power, Nobel Prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa posed this now iconic question to start his novel “Conversations in the Cathedral”: “At what precise moment did Peru screw itself?” 

            For a long time, the dysfunction was held in check and didn't interfere with sacred cornerstones of the free-market economy like the key mining industry. Since 2000, Peru's economy grew at an average annual rate of 4.4% — more than any country in South America —with low inflation and a stable currency. Until the pandemic hit, poverty had fallen by half.

            But the scale of violence following President Pedro Castillo’s Dec. 7 impeachment and arrest for a clumsy effort to shutter Congress — unrest that has left 57 civilians dead and hundreds more injured — has revived class and racial divisions and has many Peruvians wondering whether the long period of uneasy stability has run its course. 

            “This dichotomy couldn’t last,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard University political scientist and co-author of the 2018 book, “ How Democracies Die.”

            Signs of the economic fallout are everywhere.

            In December — as the political crisis got underway — the number of foreigners arriving in Peru had already fallen to the lowest level since 2009, aside from the two years lost to COVID-19. Activity at three major copper and tin mines had been suspended because highways were blocked or their facilities attacked by protesters. 

            Peru is the world’s largest exporter of grapes and the protests hit during the height of harvest. Shipments in one major growing area are barely 4% of a year ago, according to Darío Núñez, whose company, Uvica, has been unable to fulfill orders by U.S. retailers such as Costco and Sam’s Club.

            “The credibility of Peru as a brand is starting to suffer,” said Núñez. “I don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel.”

            Peru’s democratic dysfunction, years in the making, accelerated with Castillo’s surprise election in 2021. A rural schoolteacher, he rose from obscurity to fill a void left by a broken political system, widespread graft and deep-seated racism.

            His journey from an adobe home in one of Peru's poorest areas to the presidential palace was fueled by fury in the long-neglected Andean highlands. But once in office, he shuffled his Cabinet almost weekly and was beset by corruption allegations that underscored his inexperience.

            Elites in Congress, although even more discredited than Castillo, went on the offensive, using an obscure constitutional power to seek his impeachment for “moral incapacity.” This triggered Castillo’s move to shut down Congress, which backfired with his arrest on charges of rebellion — and vice president Boluarte’s ascension to power. 

            The current revolt has coalesced around an urgent demand: Boluarte’s departure. Congress could act by ordering early elections but has so far refused as lawmakers are reluctant to, in effect, fire themselves.

            Levitsky, the Harvard professor, said it's too early to know how Peru’s crisis will unfold. One demand from protesters is that the constitution adopted during Alberto Fujimori's 1990-2000 authoritarian rule and which strengthened free-market reforms be overhauled. 

            But whatever happens, Levitsky doesn’t see a return to the status quo.

            “A state that doesn’t work is sooner or later going to fall into crisis,” he said. “They had 20 years to build a state and they failed miserably.”

            Monuments to that failure are everywhere in Cusco: An unfinished highway that was supposed to bisect the city and the crumbling façade of the Hotel Cusco, a historic landmark owned by the city government.

            But perhaps the biggest white elephant is the Hospital Antonio Lorena. 

            Rising above the city’s red tile roofs, the sleek glass-and-steel structure was supposed to be the most modern in southern Peru when construction began in 2012. But after three years, the Brazilian builder abandoned the project amid an investigation into cost overruns fueled by alleged bribes paid to Cusco’s governor and the wife of Peru’s then-president Ollanta Humala.

            Today, the half-built skeleton is covered by graffiti amid peeling paint, exposed power cables and shattered glass. On Dec. 7 — the day Castillo was arrested — a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to mark the start of a 730-day, $244 million rescue plan for the project by a new foreign consortium with technical assistance from France. 

            Jorge Zapata, the head of Peru’s construction lobby, blames greedy politicians for the standstill. Nationwide, over 2,500 state-funded infrastructure projects worth $7 billion are paralyzed due to mismanagement, he said.

            Meanwhile, instead of guiding tourists, Gonzales now spends his days scouring Cusco for a propane gas cannister to cook and bathe the couple's 5-month-old daughter, Willow. 

            At an industrial depot, dozens of desperate residents were lined up this week in hopes demonstrators blocking the highways would halt their pickets long enough to let the trucks delivering the propane reach the besieged city.

            “This is really scary,” said Zulauf, as she bounced her baby on her knees staring at the long line from her car. “In Cusco, people live day-to-day. If they can’t work, I don’t know how they’re surviving.”

            Among those in line was Fredy Deza, who spent the night in a sleeping bag on the sidewalk.

            Deza, 40, said the all-night vigil recalled another dark period in Peru’s history, when he would wait with his mother in long lines for bread, sugar and other staples during the chaotic 1985-1990 presidency of Alan Garcia.

            “It’s like we’re going back in time,” said Deza, who worked as a guide in Machu Picchu until he was let go in December.

            Prices for propane and other scarce items in Cusco are soaring due to inflation that jumped to 8.7% in January, near the highest level in a quarter-century. A black market has emerged, with cannisters going for three times the listed price. 

            Adding to insult, the cooking gas many can no longer afford is pumped by a foreign-owned consortium from the resource-rich department of Cusco and transported by a pipeline to the capital, Lima, where the bulk is then exported. A projected second pipeline, which would deliver it to Cusco and other cities in the south, remains a pipe dream.

            “It’s sad,” said Deza, as he prepared for another cold night, ""that as owners of our gas we have to be enduring this.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801148,Ukraine: Are Kyiv's anti-corruption efforts serious?,"Ukrainian authorities have stepped up their fight against corruption. At the beginning of February, there was a slew of high-profile searches and employment terminations.The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced that it had searched the house of the oligarch Ihor Kolomoiskiy in connection with the embezzlement of 40 billion Ukrainian hryvnia (about €980 million/$1 billion today) by the former management of the largest Ukrainian oil and gas producer, Ukrnafta, and pipeline operator Ukrtransnafta. Kolomoiskiy held shares in both then partly state-owned firms, which were fully nationalized last year under Ukraine's martial law.Ukraine's State Bureau of Investigation (DBR) also announced that a former minister of energy and the coal industry is suspected of corruption as well. Ukrainian media outlets report that the suspect is Ihor Nasalyk. He is accused of signing contracts that were advantageous to companies associated with Ukrainian oligarchDmytro Firtash, who has lived in Austria for years. The allegedly shady dealings were said to have cost Ukraine 1.5 billion hryvnia (around €35 million/$37 million).Beyond that, the SBU and the DBR searched the residence of a former interior minister, Arsen Avakov. He has already acknowledged that the search was related to the helicopter crash in Brovary (a suburb of Kyiv), in which 10 people – including Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky – were killed. Authorities were particularly interested in purchase agreements made with the Interior Ministry for Airbus helicopters with the model number H225.Media have also reported on searches of premises linked to representatives from Kyiv-based construction companies that were regulated by a Ukrainian politician who was a member of the now banned pro-Russian party Opposition Platform — For Life. At the same time, the DBR also carried out searches at Kyiv's Finance Ministry. Officials said they had uncovered schemes worth millions there as well.Searches have targeted former employees at Ukraine's Ministry of Defense as well. The prosecutor general's office also announced that a former department head at the ministry is suspected of embezzling particularly large sums of money, in addition to other malfeasance.A former deputy defense minister is also suspected of illegal activities. He is accused of hindering the work of Ukraine's armed forces and other military bodies at critical moments. Investigators claim that the suspect put his weight behind signing contracts that saw food delivered to the military at inflated prices and purchases made of bullet-proof vests, helmets, uniforms and other items that were of inferior quality.While investigators were carrying out searches, the government fired almost all leading officials at Ukraine's State Customs Service and a number of other bodies.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his satisfaction with the investigations in a national address. He emphasized that ""in some areas, lawfulness can only be ensured when the implementation of institutional changes is carried out simultaneously with changes in leadership.""Volodymyr Fesenko, a political scientist and director of the Penta Center for Applied Political Studies, thinks engaging in a highly publicized fight against corruption allows President Zelenskyy to kill two birds with one stone.""This has been one of the biggest demonstrations in the fight against corruption. It's no coincidence that this took place just before the EU summit in Kyiv this February. Tangible results of anti-corruption efforts are one of the criteria for Ukraine integrating into Europe,"" Fesenko says.He believes that Zelenskyy's anti-corruption campaign also allows the president to appease the public's widespread desire to see corrupt officials be punished.Fesenko recommends taking a critical look at the organizations that have carried out the searches. They include the SBU, the DBR and the Bureau of Economic Security — the latter of which answers to the prosecutor general. ""Those institutions all actively work with the president's office, even though the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) are more independent and should also play an active role in corruption cases,"" Fasenko says.Oleksandr Lemenov, director of the Ukrainian anti-corruption organization State Watch, believes that the searches are meant to demonstrate that corruption is actually being fought and taken seriously. However, Lemenov doesn't believe the cases will lead to convictions.Mykola Khavroniuk from the Ukrainian think tank Center for Political and Legal Reforms thinks it is a good sign that searches are being carried out and that people are being investigated for wrongdoing. ""In order to investigate effectively, authorities have to collect evidence for illegal activity over an extended period of time, while documenting everything. It's impossible to do all of this in just one day, in advance of a summit, for example,"" Khavroniuk insists.Since the Ukraine's survival is at stake in the war with Russia,  Khavroniuk maintains that it would be an unwise and even dangerous move on the part of Ukraine's leadership to risk undermining the trust of the international community by staging sham anti-corruption efforts. Khavroniuk hopes President Zelenskyy won't engage in such an endeavor.Translated from Ukrainian by Markian Ostaptschuk",2023/2/4,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801152,Panthers hope All-Star weekend showcased team's investment,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Matthew Tkachuk is under contract to the Florida Panthers for much of the next decade. So is fellow All-Star Aleksander Barkov. And right there are two compelling reasons for players to join the Panthers in the coming years.

            The last few days might have helped the recruiting pitch, too.

            Many of hockey’s best players spent three or four days in South Florida. Some got in the ocean. Some golfed. Some just enjoyed the sun.











            Playing host to the NHL's midseason showcase and showing the all-stars what hockey can be like in the Panthers’ market — in Florida, in winter — could pay off in the long run. 

            “Barky’s been here a long time, signed eight years, wants to be here, wants to be here for like the remainder of his time here. That shows the hockey side that it’s a great place to play hockey and it’s a great winning culture,” said Tkachuk, the MVP of the All-Star Game. “It starts with your best player, your captain. But then there’s the off-ice part and everything that comes to play in Florida. Basically, everything guys are seeing now ... like, wow.”

            Wow, indeed. So much about the Panthers has changed over the last few years, and All-Star weekend was both confirmation and affirmation. Long gone are the days of the team continually hearing rumors about moving out of south Florida. So, too, are the days of the franchise being a doormat.

            “This franchise was never moving anywhere,” NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. “The closest it came was when they were in Miami and we were working to get a building because they couldn’t stay in the old Miami Arena. Since they got the arena in Sunrise, there’s never been an issue. And frankly, having the Violas' ownership of this franchise, it’s not only phenomenal, it’s game-changing — pun intended.”

            This September will mark the 10th anniversary of Vincent Viola buying the franchise. Recently, attendance has gotten better. Hope has been building. The team won the President’s Trophy last season and a playoff series for the first time since 1996.

            This season hasn’t gone according to plan, thanks in large part to injuries. And while the Panthers are far from doomed in the playoff race, they have some serious ground to make up over the final 30 games.

            “There’s no quick-fixes,” Florida Panthers president Matthew Caldwell said. “But now, we just feel like we’re structurally, financially, long-term stable.”

            They're also investing: The Panthers are refurbishing the War Memorial in Fort Lauderdale, which will become the team’s new practice headquarters starting next season, and plan to start more community outreach programs.

            The core of the team is set for years. The infrastructure is in place. Ownership has shown it'll spend what is required. And the Panthers can only hope some All-Stars this weekend took notice.

            “South Florida’s a hockey town,” Caldwell said. “It took us a long time. But here we are.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801153,Spain: Rights groups urge more protection for hunting dogs,"MADRID (AP) — Animal rights groups and pet shop owners marched Sunday in separate demonstrations to protest a new animal welfare law proposed by the Spanish government that seeks to advance the protection of animal rights.

            The draft legislation has fueled criticism by animal rights groups after a last-minute amendment excluded hunting dogs from the law's protection, meeting hunting lobbies’ demands.

            Under the “same dogs, same law” slogan, thousands marched in Madrid and dozens of other Spanish cities in coordinated demonstrations to urge the government to restore hunting dogs to the law, which raises fines for animal abuse to 200,000 euros ($216,000) and introduces a possible two-year jail sentence for the most serious cases.











            The abandoning of thousands of greyhounds at the end of every hunting season has earned social attention in the last years in Spain, where the adoption of these animals as house pets has noticeably as people become aware of the harsh conditions many of them endure in the countryside. Greyhounds are used to hunt animals such as rabbits and pheasants.

            The ‘No hunting’ platform's spokesperson, David Rubio, said that Spain is not only the only country left in Europe that allows hunting with dogs but it also holds the record for most dogs abandoned in the EU. 

            A few streets away, pet shop owners protested, saying they will be forced to close their businesses under the new law because it only allows licensed breeders to sell cats, dogs, and ferrets. Thousands of jobs will be lost, they say, and the black market for pets and exotic animals will grow.MADRID (AP) — Animal rights groups and pet shop owners marched Sunday in separate demonstrations to protest a new animal welfare law proposed by the Spanish government that seeks to advance the protection of animal rights.The draft legislation has fueled criticism by animal rights groups after a last-minute amendment excluded hunting dogs from the law's protection, meeting hunting lobbies’ demands.Under the “same dogs, same law” slogan, thousands marched in Madrid and dozens of other Spanish cities in coordinated demonstrations to urge the government to restore hunting dogs to the law, which raises fines for animal abuse to 200,000 euros ($216,000) and introduces a possible two-year jail sentence for the most serious cases.The abandoning of thousands of greyhounds at the end of every hunting season has earned social attention in the last years in Spain, where the adoption of these animals as house pets has noticeably as people become aware of the harsh conditions many of them endure in the countryside.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801164,How the cases in Alex Murdaugh's murder trial are shaping up,"Two weeks into the double murder trial of South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh, prosecutors haven't presented any direct evidence that he killed his wife and son at their home in June 2021.

            There is no confession, no surveillance camera footage, no recording of the victims' final moments.

            If found guilty of murdering his wife, Maggie, 52, and their son, Paul, 22, Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison without parole. The disgraced lawyer, who also faces about 100 other charges ranging from stealing money from clients to insurance fraud, has adamantly denied fatally shooting his wife and son. 











            Murdaugh's lawyers said he was visiting his ailing mother on the night of the murders and police wrongly focused on him from the start, ignoring the possibility that anyone else killed them.

            HOW ARE PROSECUTORS MAKING THEIR CASE?

            Prosecutors are trying to build a mountain of circumstantial evidence so high it removes any reasonable doubt with jurors that Murdaugh is guilty.

            In seven days of testimony, prosecutors have presented crime scene photographs, guns collected from Murdaugh's home, cellphone data and a video of Murdaugh wearing different clothes less than three hours before the time that he said he discovered the bodies at their Colleton County home.

            They've also shown a video the son took five minutes before the victims suddenly stopped using their cellphones in which family friends say they can hear the voices of all three Murdaughs. Alex Murdaugh told investigators early in the case that he wasn't there.

            They contend Murdaugh shot the two to distract attention from his other crimes, for which he is awaiting trial.

            HOW IMPORTANT IS THE CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE?

            
                The evidence at the scene is key to unraveling what happened before Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were found shot with at least one bullet to the head by two different guns.

            State agents drove two hours from Columbia to swarm the Murdaugh home the night of the killings, taking photos of blood spots, shoe prints and weapons casings. They collected guns, tested Murdaugh's hands for gunshot residue and took DNA swabs.

            “The crime scene is kind of a temporary thing. Once the crime scene has processed, you can't go back to it. So … you really try to cover absolutely everything while you’re there,” said Kenneth Moses, a forensic scientist who led the crime scene investigations unit at the San Francisco Police Department and now works as a consultant, mostly for criminal defendants. 

            But there were things that weren't done. In cross-examination, agents have said they didn't test shower and sink drains for blood. They did not search the home of Murdaugh's mother for months even though that's where he was before he said he found the bodies. And they didn't preserve tire tracks.

            Defense lawyers are looking for a mistake, or potential mistake, that will resonate with a jury, Moses said.

            It's “different than police, who don’t care about juries at all. They’re looking to make an arrest,” Moses said.

            WHAT ABOUT CELLPHONE EVIDENCE?

            Murdaugh wasn't charged with murder until 13 months after the killings. Through testimony, finally getting data from Paul Murdaugh’s phone appears to be a key development around that time.

            Agents testified they couldn't pull off the data off Paul Murdaugh's phone until advances in technology got past the security features Apple puts on iPhones.

            The phone contained a 50-second video Paul Murdaugh took about 8:45 p.m. near the dog kennels were both bodies were found. His friends testified they heard all three Murdaughs' voices. Alex Murdaugh told police at least twice he was not at the kennels that night.

            But cellphone evidence appears to have helped the defense, too.

            Alex Murdaugh turned his cellphone over to investigators and evidence has it at his SUV still parked at the house at the same time his wife's cellphone was being thrown on the side of the road a half-mile (800 meters) from the property, defense lawyers said.

            WHO IS ALEX MURDAUGH?

            Both sides are trying to get their version of Murdaugh, who comes from a family that's well-known in local judicial circles, before the jury. 

            The defense wants to portray a loving family man and has asked any witness who knew the Murdaughs about their relationships. All have said Murdaugh and his wife appeared happy together and Alex Murdaugh was a doting father.

            Prosecutors are trying to show an attorney living a double life who was so scared it would be discovered he stole millions of dollars that he committed the killings to try to buy time to cover up his other crimes. They asked every officer who encountered Murdaugh after he found the bodies of his wife or son if he was crying and all said he seems upset and distraught, but with no tears.

            WHAT DOES THE DEFENSE SAY?

            Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian contends prosecutors incorrectly locked in on Murdaugh’s guilt from the start and have tried to jam bits of evidence that can be explained away or leave an incomplete picture into a story that frames the wrong man.

            “There’s no direct evidence. There’s no eyewitnesses. There’s nothing on camera. There’s no fingerprints. There’s no forensics tying him to the crime. None,” Harpootlian said.

Alex Murdaugh told police at least twice he was not at the kennels that night.But cellphone evidence appears to have helped the defense, too.Alex Murdaugh turned his cellphone over to investigators and evidence has it at his SUV still parked at the house at the same time his wife's cellphone was being thrown on the side of the road a half-mile (800 meters) from the property, defense lawyers said.WHO IS ALEX MURDAUGH?Both sides are trying to get their version of Murdaugh, who comes from a family that's well-known in local judicial circles, before the jury.The defense wants to portray a loving family man and has asked any witness who knew the Murdaughs about their relationships. All have said Murdaugh and his wife appeared happy together and Alex Murdaugh was a doting father.Prosecutors are trying to show an attorney living a double life who was so scared it would be discovered he stole millions of dollars that he committed the killings to try to buy time to cover up his other crimes. They asked every officer who encountered Murdaugh after he found the bodies of his wife or son if he was crying and all said he seems upset and distraught, but with no tears.WHAT DOES THE DEFENSE SAY?Defense lawyer Dick Harpootlian contends prosecutors incorrectly locked in on Murdaugh’s guilt from the start and have tried to jam bits of evidence that can be explained away or leave an incomplete picture into a story that frames the wrong man.“There’s no direct evidence. There’s no eyewitnesses. There’s nothing on camera. There’s no fingerprints. There’s no forensics tying him to the crime. None,” Harpootlian said.___Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia contributed to this report.___For more stories about the Alex Murdaugh trial, visit: https://apnews.com/hub/alex-murdaugh",2023/2/5,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801175,Barcelona exploits Madrid's stumble to open 8-point lead,"MADRID (AP) — Barcelona took advantage of Real Madrid's stumble to kick off the second half of the season with another win and enjoy its biggest lead so far at the top of the Spanish league.

            After Madrid's 1-0 loss at Mallorca, Barcelona extended its 10-game winning streak in all competitions with a comfortable 3-0 victory over Sevilla on Sunday to open an eight-point lead over Madrid after 20 of 38 rounds.

            It is the biggest lead by any team this season, putting the Catalan club in firm control as it chases its first league title since 2018-19.











            “We are having a great season. We have been playing well, not giving many chances for our opponents,” Barcelona defender Jordi Alba said. “It’s eight points. There's a lot of league left, but it’s a good gap.”

            Alba, Gavi and Raphinha scored a goal each in the second half to give Barcelona its fifth straight victory in the league.

            The last game Barcelona failed to win was a 1-1 league draw against Espanyol last year.

            Sevilla, which got off to a surprisingly awful start to the season, was coming off two straight league wins that had helped it move further away from the relegation zone. It dropped to 16th place with the loss, two points from the drop zone. 

            Sevilla hasn't won in 15 league matches against Barcelona, and in 20 straight visits to the Catalan club.

            Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets had to be replaced eight minutes into the match at Camp Nou with an apparent ankle sprain.

            MADRID LOSES

            Marco Asensio missed a penalty kick in Madrid's loss at Mallorca in its last match before traveling to Morocco to play at the Club World Cup.

            Madrid was depleted by injuries and rested some players ahead of the Club World Cup,

            “We already expected a very tough match,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “We had our chances but couldn’t take advantage of them.” 

            Ancelotti couldn’t count on several injured starters, including striker Karim Benzema, defender Éder Militão and goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was dropped from the squad at the last minute after getting injured during the warmup. Ancelotti also rested midfielders Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, who came on in the second half. 

            Asensio missed a chance to equalize when his 60th-minute penalty kick was saved by Mallorca goalkeeper Pedrag Rajkovic after Madrid forward Vinícius Júnior had been fouled. Madrid's last chance was a header by Antonio Rüdiger that went narrowly wide deep into stoppage time.

            The hosts got on the board with an own-goal by Nacho Fernández, who was replacing Militão in defense. Nacho went for a high cross and deflected the ball into his own net over goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, who started in place of Courtois.

            “I hit the ball with my head and unfortunately it went into the top corner,” Nacho said. “It was a complicated match, against a team that is having a good season. It’s a pity that we let three points get away.”

            Madrid was coming off a win against Valencia after being held by Real Sociedad. Its opponent in the semifinals of the Club World Cup on Wednesday will be Egyptian club Al Ahly. 

            It was the second win in three league matches for Mallorca, and the fourth straight at home. It remained midtable with 28 points from 20 matches.

            “It’s a good result, moves us further away from the relegation zone,"" Mallorca’s Mexican coach Javier Aguirre said. “But there are many matches left, we can’t relax.”

            Vinícius was shown a yellow card and will be suspended for Madrid's next league game against last-place Elche.

            SOCIEDAD STALLS

            Real Sociedad missed a chance to move within three points of Madrid after losing 1-0 to Valladolid at home.

            It was the third winless game for the Basque Country club after a nine-game winning streak in all competitions. Sociedad was coming off a 1-0 loss to Barcelona in the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey, and a 0-0 draw at Madrid in the league.

            Newly signed Canadian forward Cyle Larin scored a second-half winner for 13th-place Valladolid, which has won two in a row after five straight losses in all competitions. 

            STRUGGLING VALENCIA

            Valencia’s struggles continued with a 1-0 defeat at Girona, a result that extended its losing streak to five matches in all competitions. 

            Valencia has only one win in its last 12 league matches and is sitting just outside the relegation zone.

            Girona moved to 11th place.

Nacho went for a high cross and deflected the ball into his own net over goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, who started in place of Courtois.“I hit the ball with my head and unfortunately it went into the top corner,” Nacho said. “It was a complicated match, against a team that is having a good season. It’s a pity that we let three points get away.”Madrid was coming off a win against Valencia after being held by Real Sociedad. Its opponent in the semifinals of the Club World Cup on Wednesday will be Egyptian club Al Ahly.It was the second win in three league matches for Mallorca, and the fourth straight at home. It remained midtable with 28 points from 20 matches.“It’s a good result, moves us further away from the relegation zone,"" Mallorca’s Mexican coach Javier Aguirre said. “But there are many matches left, we can’t relax.”Vinícius was shown a yellow card and will be suspended for Madrid's next league game against last-place Elche.SOCIEDAD STALLSReal Sociedad missed a chance to move within three points of Madrid after losing 1-0 to Valladolid at home.It was the third winless game for the Basque Country club after a nine-game winning streak in all competitions. Sociedad was coming off a 1-0 loss to Barcelona in the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey, and a 0-0 draw at Madrid in the league.Newly signed Canadian forward Cyle Larin scored a second-half winner for 13th-place Valladolid, which has won two in a row after five straight losses in all competitions.STRUGGLING VALENCIAValencia’s struggles continued with a 1-0 defeat at Girona, a result that extended its losing streak to five matches in all competitions.Valencia has only one win in its last 12 league matches and is sitting just outside the relegation zone.Girona moved to 11th place.___Tales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/6,,World

(AP) — Two abducted children who had been missing from Missouri for almost a year were found in a central Florida grocery store with their non-custodial mother, who was taken into police custody, authorities said.

            Kristi Gilley was arrested last Wednesday on an out-of-state fugitive warrant. Court records show Gilley, 36, remained in jail on Sunday.

            High Springs police officers found Gilley and the two children in a Winn Dixie super market after running a routine vehicle tag check that indicated the vehicle's owner was a fugitive, the High Springs Police Department said in a news release.

            The children had been missing from Clay County, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City, since last March.

            The High Springs Police Department said the children were turned over to the Florida Department of Children and Families and would be reunited with family members in Missouri.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801179,"Chiefs' Hunt, Eagles' Lurie behind Super Bowl-winning teams","KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Clark Hunt proudly held aloft the AFC championship trophy bearing his father's name, the one signifying that his Kansas City Chiefs were headed back to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, and reflected that not so long ago, success seemed elusive.

            It had been 50 years between Super Bowl trips when Chiefs coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes led them back the NFL's apex in 2020 — five full decades of heartbreak, disappointment and oftentimes despair.

            The always-pragmatic Hunt uses the stretch in football's wilderness to keep the current ride in perspective.











            “I don't know that it gets better,” Hunt said this week, ""but we do know not to take it for granted. One of the things about going 50 years between Super Bowls is it teaches you how to appreciate it. You know, certainly over the last five years, we've been blessed playing in five straight AFC championship games, all here at home, and the three Super Bowls you mentioned.

            “It's special, but we're not going to take it for granted,” he said.

            Nor does his counterpart, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie, who purchased the franchise in the 1990s and lost four conference title games and a Super Bowl before finally winning his first Lombardi Trophy. The Eagles reached two more playoffs before sliding to a 4-11-1 record two years ago. 

            Most of those years of excruciating letdowns came while Reid was the coach, which only adds to the subplots in the Feb. 12 Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona.

            “Jeffrey is a phenomenal owner,” said Reid, whose affinity for the man who gave him a chance to be a head coach was hardly harmed by Lurie firing him. “He did a great job for me, my family, everything.”

            In truth, both owners have done well for their franchises and their cities.

            Hunt had unimaginably large shoes to fill when his father, Texas businessman Lamar Hunt, died in 2006. The elder Hunt remains a beloved figure in Kansas City. He helped found the AFL, established the Chiefs and even coined the term “Super Bowl.” He also was one of the key figures in the creation of Major League Soccer.

            Clark Hunt made plenty of missteps early, including a series of coaches and general managers that he hired with great fanfare but produced little results. Slowly, steadily and often behind the scenes, Hunt was becoming one of the NFL's most respected owners, sitting on important committees and even helping to end the 2011 lockout.

            Two years later, Hunt changed the Chiefs' entire trajectory with a trip to Philadelphia.

            Reid had just been fired when Hunt, who had just fired Romeo Crennel, picked up the phone and set up a meeting. The interview came Jan. 2, 2013, in a conference room in a Philadelphia-area airport, where a plane sent by the Cardinals to ferry Reid to Arizona for another interview was waiting on the tarmac.

            Hunt proved two things that day: He was an astute businessman and exceptional salesman. The owner convinced Reid they could build a winner in Kansas City — he never did get on that other plane. Over the past decade, they have done just that: seven straight AFC West titles, four conference titles and, they hope, a second Lombardi Trophy.

            “Internally we had high expectations,” Hunt said, ""but if you listen to much of the national media, you know, you would've thought that we had no chance this season. I remember Andy commenting in response to a questions that, ‘We’re not going to be too bad ourselves,' because people were talking about these other teams in the AFC West.

            “Obviously, really, the credit goes to Andy and the coaching staff.”

            Along with the owner.

            In Philadelphia, Reid's firing gave way to ultra-successful college coach Chip Kelly taking the reins. When that experiment failed, Lurie, a movie producer, plucked away Reid's offensive coordinator, Doug Pederson. Within two years, Pederson had done what Reid could not: win the Super Bowl.

            Pederson went to two more playoffs before things fell apart. He was fired, too. Lurie's off-the-radar replacement was Nick Sirianni, then the offensive coordinator of the Colts. 

            If Hunt's hiring of Reid underscored his salesmanship and business acumen, Lurie's decision highlighted his keen eye for talent and willingness to take a gamble.

            The Eagles lost in in the wild-card round in Sirianni's first season, and in his second, they are back in the big game.

            “I can't overestimate the value of the coaches,” Lurie said. “Nick is outstanding — smart, connects with everybody, cares, is passionate. And at the same time, his staff is outstanding. They are all similar age, they are young, they get along great. You have to have a great culture of a coaching staff. He has that.”

            Yet it's Lurie who has established a culture of success within the Eagles organization. Just like Hunt has done with the Chiefs.

            “I’ve been out to eat with him a few times. I talk to him when he’s around the building because he’s here a lot,"" Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert said of Lurie. “Just really thankful for him and everything he gives the team so we can be as successful as we have been. He fits right along with the Philadelphia culture. He knows how important Eagles football is to the city.”

The Eagles reached two more playoffs before sliding to a 4-11-1 record two years ago.Most of those years of excruciating letdowns came while Reid was the coach, which only adds to the subplots in the Feb. 12 Super Bowl in Glendale, Arizona.“Jeffrey is a phenomenal owner,” said Reid, whose affinity for the man who gave him a chance to be a head coach was hardly harmed by Lurie firing him. “He did a great job for me, my family, everything.”In truth, both owners have done well for their franchises and their cities.Hunt had unimaginably large shoes to fill when his father, Texas businessman Lamar Hunt, died in 2006. The elder Hunt remains a beloved figure in Kansas City. He helped found the AFL, established the Chiefs and even coined the term “Super Bowl.” He also was one of the key figures in the creation of Major League Soccer.Clark Hunt made plenty of missteps early, including a series of coaches and general managers that he hired with great fanfare but produced little results. Slowly, steadily and often behind the scenes, Hunt was becoming one of the NFL's most respected owners, sitting on important committees and even helping to end the 2011 lockout.Two years later, Hunt changed the Chiefs' entire trajectory with a trip to Philadelphia.Reid had just been fired when Hunt, who had just fired Romeo Crennel, picked up the phone and set up a meeting. The interview came Jan. 2, 2013, in a conference room in a Philadelphia-area airport, where a plane sent by the Cardinals to ferry Reid to Arizona for another interview was waiting on the tarmac.Hunt proved two things that day: He was an astute businessman and exceptional salesman. The owner convinced Reid they could build a winner in Kansas City — he never did get on that other plane. Over the past decade, they have done just that: seven straight AFC West titles, four conference titles and, they hope, a second Lombardi Trophy.“Internally we had high expectations,” Hunt said, ""but if you listen to much of the national media, you know, you would've thought that we had no chance this season. I remember Andy commenting in response to a questions that, ‘We’re not going to be too bad ourselves,' because people were talking about these other teams in the AFC West.“Obviously, really, the credit goes to Andy and the coaching staff.”Along with the owner.In Philadelphia, Reid's firing gave way to ultra-successful college coach Chip Kelly taking the reins. When that experiment failed, Lurie, a movie producer, plucked away Reid's offensive coordinator, Doug Pederson. Within two years, Pederson had done what Reid could not: win the Super Bowl.Pederson went to two more playoffs before things fell apart. He was fired, too. Lurie's off-the-radar replacement was Nick Sirianni, then the offensive coordinator of the Colts.If Hunt's hiring of Reid underscored his salesmanship and business acumen, Lurie's decision highlighted his keen eye for talent and willingness to take a gamble.The Eagles lost in in the wild-card round in Sirianni's first season, and in his second, they are back in the big game.“I can't overestimate the value of the coaches,” Lurie said. “Nick is outstanding — smart, connects with everybody, cares, is passionate. And at the same time, his staff is outstanding. They are all similar age, they are young, they get along great. You have to have a great culture of a coaching staff. He has that.”Yet it's Lurie who has established a culture of success within the Eagles organization. Just like Hunt has done with the Chiefs.“I’ve been out to eat with him a few times. I talk to him when he’s around the building because he’s here a lot,"" Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert said of Lurie. “Just really thankful for him and everything he gives the team so we can be as successful as we have been. He fits right along with the Philadelphia culture. He knows how important Eagles football is to the city.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/2/5,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801180,As many as 80K Marylanders could lose Medicaid eligibility,"ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland officials are preparing for as many as 80,000 residents who could no longer qualify for Medicaid coverage this spring, as the federal government reinstates a requirement that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic for states to verify the eligibility of recipients. 

            Michele Eberle, the executive director of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, said that beginning in May, the state can start ending Medicaid coverage for people who no longer qualify. Maryland, she added, is in a better position to reach people than many other states to either continue Medicaid coverage or move them into other health plans. 

            “We are working through all of those numbers right now, but we believe it’s around 80,000,"" Eberle told a panel of lawmakers last month. ""There’s different little discrepancies of those numbers. The numbers we’ve come up with is about 80,000 that would roll off, people that we’ll have to make sure we’ve got them covered.”











            Medicaid enrollment ballooned during the pandemic, in part because the federal government prohibited states from removing people from the program during the public health emergency once they had enrolled. 

            The program offers health care coverage to roughly 90 million children and adults — or 1 out of every 4 Americans. 

            Late last year, Congress told states they could start removing ineligible people in April. Millions of people are expected to lose their coverage, either because they now make too much money to qualify for Medicare or they’ve moved. Many are expected to be eligible for low-cost insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act’s private marketplace or their employer. 

            “We’ve had the largest number of folks put into Medicaid during this COVID (pandemic),"" Eberle told Maryland Senate’s Finance Committee. “We ran a COVID special enrollment period over 2020 and 2021, and our numbers have just skyrocketed in Medicaid, and we don’t want to lose those people, so we’re working very closely with our department of health.”

            Maryland will be reaching out to consumers to make sure if they are eligible for Medicaid that their coverage will be renewed. If they are no longer eligible, the state will help get them into qualified health plans, Eberle said. If they age out of Medicaid and are eligible for Medicare, the exchange will help get them on that pathway.

            The Maryland Department of Health will be partnering with Maryland Medicaid Managed Care Organizations, the health exchange, the Maryland Department of Human Services and the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients.

            “The communications campaign will include paid media, social media messaging, and other advertising and digital campaigns, in addition to targeted outreach by the MCOs,” the health department said in an email.

            Eberle said Maryland is in a better position than a lot of states, because of its health care exchange. Maryland has an integrated system between Medicaid and qualified health insurance plans, and the state has not stopped doing redeterminations about qualifications, she said, while other states have not done them for three years.

            “We’ve continued to do those redeterminations every single month,"" Eberle said. ""Now what that means is we didn’t terminate anyone, but we sent them notices. We said if you have a new email address, a new phone, come back, update us, so we’re better off in that we have current information.” 

            Still, some are concerned by the sheer number of people who could be affected. 

            State Sen. Clarence Lam, a Howard County Democrat who also is a physician at Johns Hopkins, noted that it's a huge number of people who could suddenly lose health insurance. He said he believes “the jury is out,” on how the change will be handled.

            “We are very concerned,"" Lam said in a recent interview. ""We made a lot of strides during the pandemic. We don’t want the post-pandemic period to be a period where we see the greatest number of Marylanders thrown off our health insurance rolls.”

            Suzanne Schlattman, a consumer healthcare advocate in Maryland, said she has been impressed by the level of collaboration between state agencies to address the matter. 

            Schlattman, who is the deputy director of development and community outreach for Maryland Citizens’ Health Initiative, said the biggest challenge will be in reaching people who got enrolled in Medicaid for the very first time during the pandemic, which marked a unique period when they did not have to update their information.

            Maryland has about 1.7 million people in Medicaid, Schlattman said, the highest number she has seen. In that context, 80,000 doesn't seem so high, especially compared to what some other states are facing, she said.

            “Other states are looking at a much larger shift and a much bigger bottleneck in getting people enrolled,"" Schlattman said.ANNAPOLIS, Md.

            Brennan Johnson scored the 14th-minute winner for Forest but the hosts had Navas — a multiple Champions League winner who was signed from Paris Saint-Germain this week on the final day of the January transfer window — as much to thank for sealing a third victory in their last four league games.

            The 36-year-old Costa Rica star was especially busy in the first half, with his best saves denying Luke Ayling and Wilfried Gnonto.











            Leeds created chances at will in the first half but found it harder to penetrate Forest after the break, when U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie came on for his debut and played alongside international teammate Tyler Adams.

            Johnson's goal came when a free kick was only half-cleared by Leeds to the edge of the area, where the Wales forward steered a low, first-time shot just inside the near post.

            Forest moved into 13th place, six points above the relegation zone, as the promoted team continues to recover from a slow start to the season on its return to the top flight after 23 years away.

            Leeds is in 17th place in the 20-team league and only out of the relegation positions on goal difference.

            Jesse Marsch's team does have a game in hand, though, and will play Manchester United away on Wednesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801193,Cubans respond with zeal to new US migration policy,"HAVANA (AP) — In barely a week, 25-year-old engineer Marcos Marzo went from riding his small electric motorcycle past the low buildings of Havana’s Vedado district to traveling the mega-highways of Florida, amazed by the towering high-rises and giant supermarkets. 

            A close relative told Marzo on Jan. 21 that he had applied online to sponsor the young engineer’s trip to Florida as required by the new parole program for Cuban migrants set up by the Biden administration. The next day the sponsorship had been confirmed and the day after that it was approved.

            With his printed authorization in hand and a small blue suitcase, Marzo climbed aboard a plane to Hialeah last Friday, shaken by the speed of it all.











            “It has been a very hard, that in seven days your life changes so drastically, it fills you with hope, but at the same time it fills you with dread,” Marzo told The Associated Press before leaving for what he knew would be a personal watershed. 

            Overwhelmed by thousands of Cubans crowding its southern border after making the dangerous trip through Central America and an increase in makeshift boats crossing the Florida Straits, the United States in early January approved a policy change that makes migrants request a permit, or parole, online before arriving with the sponsorship of a relative or acquaintance in the U.S.

            Cubans, who qualify for the program along with Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans, have responded with zeal, launching a search for sponsors and long lines to obtain documents. The program’s backers hope it will help would-be migrants avoid the risks of the route through Mexico -- plagued by traffickers – and bring order to the migrant flow.

            “This option has come like a light,” said Marzo, who had been living with his parents in Havana. Now in the U.S., his dream is to do a master’s degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and work as an engineer, which he says is his passion.

            According to figures from U.S. border authorities, in the 2021-2022 fiscal year – which began in October last year and ended in September – officials had a record 224,000 encounters with Cuban migrants on the Mexico border. In October 2022 there were 29,878 Cuban migrants stopped, in November 35,881 and in December 44,064.

            Meanwhile, the Coast Guard intercepted 6,182 Cubans trying to arrive by sea in fiscal year 2021-2022. Add to that 4,795 in the past three months.

            All the figures are records and come amid a serious economic crises on the island caused by the coronavirus pandemic, inefficiencies in economic reforms and a radical tightening of U.S. sanctions, which seek to pressure its government to change its model. Blackouts, shortages, inflation, long fuel lines and dollarization marked parts of 2021 and 2022 in Cuba, while the country saw its first street demonstrations in decades with thousands of people demanding an end of the power outages.

            Until Jan. 5, Cubans who arrived at the northern border of Mexico obtained permits that granted them entry into U.S. territory, assuming there was a credible fear that prevented them from returning to the island. Later they usually ended up with refugee benefits and a year after that the protection of the Cuban Adjustment Act.

            Then the Biden administration unveiled its new policy: 30,000 migrants will be accepted each month from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti. The migrants can stay for up to two years but must have a sponsor already in place in the United States. Those who risk reaching the borders without permission would be deported and not be able to enter U.S. territory for five years.

            There are still questions about the program, including how many people from each of the four countries will be accepted. 

            And the program is not without controversy in Cuba amid the migrant boom in recent months, since many people had already began their journeys toward the United States on the previous route. Some had even sold houses and cars to make the journey through Central America, which begins with a flight to Nicaragua and continues up through Mexico to the U.S. border. It is a route plagued by dangers and human traffickers. 

            Yudith Cardozo, a 46-year-old homemaker, said the new parole program is “a unique opportunity” that could save lives. 

            “Nicaragua is a total risk, Mexico, all that journey is a total risk,” she said. 

            Marzo acknowledged that he had considered migrating by the route of “the volcanoes,” as Cubans popularly call the Central American journey, but his parents talked him out of it. The number of people who have died on the journey is unknown.

            Cardozo, speaking while waiting in front of a government office to obtain birth certificates and a criminal record certificate, said a relative in the U.S. had initiated the process as sponsor her, her 16-year-old son and her husband, but in three weeks they had gotten no response.

            Many Cubans wanting to migrate cannot apply for the program because they lack a sponsor in the U.S. 

            On social media, memes have spread rapidly about Cubans rediscovering distant cousins or previously unknown uncles in the United States, and the U.S. Embassy warned Cubans to careful to avoid fraud and even human trafficking.

            Meanwhile, Cubans are crowding public offices to request passports and other documents, in some cases forming lines before dawn. The AP found that the postage stamps needed for the process have become scarce. 

            Some experts defend the program but acknowledge that without an upturn in the Cuban economy it is unlikely to reduce the record number of departures.

            Biden’s widespread use of humanitarian parole has been criticized forcefully by advocates for more restrictive immigration policies, including Stephen Miller, a former senior adviser to President Donald Trump. Texas and 19 other Republican-led states have sued halt the policy, arguing it is effectively an amnesty for 360,000 people a year. Many on the left welcome the policy but caution that it cannot be used a substitute for asylum. .

            The parole program “will help to a certain extent to make Cuban migration safer, more orderly and legal,” said William LeoGrande, a political scientist at the American University in Washington. “But the number of Cubans trying to come to the United States right now is so huge that the parole program is not big enough to meet the demand.”

Many on the left welcome the policy but caution that it cannot be used a substitute for asylum. .The parole program “will help to a certain extent to make Cuban migration safer, more orderly and legal,” said William LeoGrande, a political scientist at the American University in Washington. “But the number of Cubans trying to come to the United States right now is so huge that the parole program is not big enough to meet the demand.”____Andrea Rodríguez está en Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801198,"Marseille loses 3-1 to Nice, Monaco wins to keep pressure on","PARIS (AP) — Second-place Marseille saw its unbeaten run end as it lost 3-1 at home to Nice on Sunday to slip eight points behind French league leader Paris Saint-Germain.

            Marseille's first league defeat in 10 games means it is only ahead of third-place Lens on goal difference, with in-form Monaco now two points back in fourth spot. Third place secures a place in the qualifying rounds of the Champions League next season.

            Marseille fans got a first look at club-record signing Vitinha, a forward who joined from Portuguese side Braga for 32 million euros ($34.5 million). Terem Moffi made his debut for eighth-place Nice after joining from Lorient, where he scored 12 goals this season. 











            Neither made much of an impression in a first half where Nice's superior pressing game troubled Marseille and prevented it from getting the ball regularly to playmaker Dimitri Payet. 

            Vitinha’s lack of familiarity with his teammates and the 35-year-old Payet’s tiring legs played into Nice's high-octane game and the visitors scored twice at the end of the first half.

            Striker Gaëtan Laborde's shot was saved by goalkeeper Pau Lopez but forward Sofiane Diop followed up to head in off the post in the 38th minute. Nice's second goal in the 44th was similar as Lopez pushed away a shot from midfielder Khephren Thuram, and this time Laborde followed up.

            Marseille coach Igor Tudor replaced Vitinha and Payet, with Ruslan Malinovskyi and Alexis Sanchez coming on for the second half. Malinovskyi pulled one back in the 60th with his first goal for the club, turning in a cross from left back Jonathan Clauss.

            But Algeria forward Billal Brahimi scored his first goal for Nice in the 86th with a fine curling shot.

            Meanwhile, Monaco extended its unbeaten run to seven matches with a 2-0 win at Clermont.

            Early goals from central defender Guillermo Maripan and striker Breel Embolo allowed Monaco to control the game. Coach Philippe Clement’s side is in good form heading into next Saturday’s home game against PSG.

            Maripan used his aerial ability to head in from Caio Henrique’s cross in the third minute. Ten minutes later Japan forward Takumi Minamino won the ball and fed Russia midfielder Aleksandr Golovin, whose pinpoint cross was headed in by Embolo.

            Lens managed only a 1-1 draw at Brest. Defender Jonathan Gradit equalized from close range in the 83rd for Lens after Brest goalkeeper Marco Bizot miskicked the ball following a corner. Striker Jérémy Le Douaron put Brest ahead in the 54th when he slid to meet Pierre Lees-Melou's low cross to the back post.

            Strasbourg beat Montpellier 2-0 at home to go 17th as it tries to move out of the relegation zone, with striker Habib Diallo scoring both goals. Diallo netted after just 13 seconds from Dimitri Liénard's cross and grabbed his second on the stroke of halftime, with the home side down to 10 men after Jean-Eudes Aholou's red card in the 33rd.

            Nantes won 2-0 at Corsican side Ajaccio with second-half goals from forward Evann Guessand and midfielder Ludovic Blas.

            Rock-bottom Angers finally snapped its 13-game losing streak — a French league record — but could only draw 0-0 at Lorient. 

            
                English striker Folarin Balogun failed to add to his league-leading 14 goals but Reims extended its unbeaten run to 14 games with a 0-0 draw at 19th-place Auxerre, which had lost its seven previous games and kept a rare clean sheet.

            On Saturday, Lionel Messi’s second-half strike helped a lackluster PSG beat Toulouse 2-1.

(AP) — Two southern Indiana law enforcement officers were shot and wounded early Sunday during an exchange of gunfire with a suspect who fled a traffic stop on foot and fired at the officers before he was fatally shot, police said.

            Both officers flown to a hospital in Indianapolis, where they are were in stable condition with injuries that are not life-threatening, said Sgt. John Perrine of Indiana State Police.

            The man who fired at the officers was pronounced dead at a local hospital, he said. His name was not immediately released.











            The shooting occurred in the Lawrence County city of Mitchell, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southwest of Indianapolis, after a county sheriff's deputy pulled a vehicle over at a gas station along State Road 37 about 3:15 a.m. for a traffic violation, Perrine said.

            That officer was soon joined by a second Lawrence County Sheriff’s deputy with a police dog and a Mitchell police officer, he said. After the police dog alerted officers to possible drugs inside the man's car, the officers searched it and discovered narcotics.

            When officers tried to handcuff the man he fled on foot across State Road 37 into a grassy area. Once officers caught up with him, the man began to physically resist arrest before he pulled a handgun and fired at the officers “at point blank-range,"" Perrine said in a news release.

            The wounded officers were a Lawrence County Sherriff's deputy and a Mitchell police officer. At least one of the officers was able to return fire, fatally wounding the man, Perrine said.

            State police are investigating the shooting and Perrine said they will be checking the officers' body and dashboard cameras as part of the investigation.MITCHELL, Ind.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801202,Harry Kane becomes outright leading scorer for Tottenham,"LONDON (AP) — Harry Kane became Tottenham's outright all-time leading scorer with his goal in the 1-0 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday.

            It was the England captain's 267th goal for the club — one more than the late Jimmy Greaves, who played for Tottenham from 1961-70.

            “He (Greaves) is a complete hero, one of the best strikers to play the game, so to be in that conversation is special,” Kane said. ""And to overtake him is a huge moment for me.”











            Kane scored his first goal for Tottenham in December 2011.

            He now has 200 goals in the Premier League, only the third player to do so after Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208).

            Kane took a call in the locker room after the match from Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, who was absent after having his gallbladder removed on Wednesday. Conte could be heard telling Kane that he had made him proud.

            “Harry Kane, in his DNA, he has football,"" said Tottenham assistant coach Cristian Stellini, who was filling in for Conte. ""He understands football in every moment. He can play in any position.

            ""He is a GOAT (greatest of all time) in this league, in this sport. He is a great example.”

            ITALY

            Hellas Verona and Sampdoria are desperate for wins to inch closer to safety in Serie A. Verona, which is five points below 17th-place Spezia, faces a tricky task as it hosts Lazio. Verona has lost only one of its five matches this year, and that was to Inter Milan. Lazio will be looking to bounce back from an Italian Cup loss at Juventus and needs the points to boost its Champions League hopes in a tight fight for the top four. Sampdoria is in penultimate position in Serie A, nine points from safety, and will be looking to end a five-match losing run when it visits Monza. Silvio Berlusconi’s Monza is unbeaten in its last six league matches and surprisingly won at Juventus in the last round.











            SPAIN

            Rayo Vallecano looks to stay close to the European places when it hosts Almería in the Spanish league. Vallecano will try to win its third match in four league games. A victory would move the southern Madrid club within three points of fourth-place Atletico Madrid just past the halfway point of the season. Almería is closer to the relegation zone but is coming off a win against Espanyol that ended its five-match winless streak in all competitions.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801206,Off-duty NYPD officer buying car shot and critically injured,"NEW YORK (AP) — A manhunt was underway Sunday for a gunman who critically wounded an off-duty New York Police Department officer who arranged on social media to meet at a Brooklyn street address to buy a car, authorities said.

            When the officer arrived with a relative in the borough's East New York neighborhood, the gunman announced a robbery and displayed a gun, leading to an exchange of gunfire that wounded the officer, according to Michael Baldassano, assistant chief of the NYPD Detectives Bureau.

            Baldassano told a news conference late Saturday that the gunman fled the scene and the officer was taken to Brookdale Hospital. He asked anyone with information to contact police.











            Baldassano, responding to a question, said there was no reason to believe that the gunman knew that the officer worked for the police department, but it was a question that remained under investigation.

            Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the critically wounded officer was a five-year NYPD veteran assigned to the patrol division.

            “He is currently fighting for his life,” Sewell said.

            Mayor Eric Adams, attending the news conference with Sewell, vowed to “catch the person responsible.”

            He blamed the shooting on “too many illegal guns ... in the hands of bad people.”

            Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, called on state legislators to find ways to attack gun and violence problems.

            “You want to see reality, look at the devastation that those rounds caused to that young man’s body, listen to the cries of a wife, a father, a mother, their children. That’s reality. It’s causing devastation. This has to end,” he said.NEW YORK (AP) — A manhunt was underway Sunday for a gunman who critically wounded an off-duty New York Police Department officer who arranged on social media to meet at a Brooklyn street address to buy a car, authorities said.When the officer arrived with a relative in the borough's East New York neighborhood, the gunman announced a robbery and displayed a gun, leading to an exchange of gunfire that wounded the officer, according to Michael Baldassano, assistant chief of the NYPD Detectives Bureau.Baldassano told a news conference late Saturday that the gunman fled the scene and the officer was taken to Brookdale Hospital.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801208,Pope accuses critics of exploiting Pope Benedict XVI's death,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis accused some of his critics Sunday of taking advantage of retired Pope Benedict XVI’s death to score ideological points in the latest salvo in the partisan divide of the Catholic Church.

            During an airborne news conference returning from South Sudan, Francis was asked about the criticism that accelerated after the Dec. 31 death of Benedict, who lived in the Vatican as an emeritus pope alongside Francis for the first 10 years of his pontificate.

            In the days and weeks after his death, Benedict’s longtime secretary and some conservative cardinals came out with books, interviews and memos criticizing Francis’ papacy. The commentary had the effect of pitting the recently departed former pope, who remained a point of reference for conservatives and traditionalists, against the current pope.











            Francis insisted that rumors of differences with Benedict, or that Benedict was bitter about some decisions he had taken, were false and that the two consulted frequently and were in agreement.

            “I think Benedict’s death was instrumentalized,"" Francis said. “People wanted to score points for their own side. And the people who instrumentalize such a good person, so close to God, I would almost say ... those people don’t have ethics, they are people who belong to a party, not to the church.” 

            To drive home the point that Benedict was above such partisanship, Francis recalled how the emeritus pope handled a complaint that he had received against Francis over his support for legal protections for same-sex partnerships.

            When he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio supported Argentine legislation that would allow people in stable relationships, including same-sex unions, to enjoy inheritance and other rights. He backed such legislation as an alternative to Argentine proposals to legalize gay marriage, which the Catholic Church opposes. 

            Bergoglio’s position was known at the time but he articulated it publicly during a 2019 interview with Mexican broadcaster Televisa. 

            Francis revealed Sunday that someone who fancied himself “a great theologian” had filed a complaint with Benedict about Francis' position but that the emeritus pope “didn’t get scared.” 

            “He called four top-notch cardinal theologians and said, ‘Explain this to me.’”

            “They explained it to him, and that’s how the story ended,” Francis said. “It’s an anecdote to show how Pope Benedict moved when there was a complaint.”

He backed such legislation as an alternative to Argentine proposals to legalize gay marriage, which the Catholic Church opposes.Bergoglio’s position was known at the time but he articulated it publicly during a 2019 interview with Mexican broadcaster Televisa.Francis revealed Sunday that someone who fancied himself “a great theologian” had filed a complaint with Benedict about Francis' position but that the emeritus pope “didn’t get scared.”“He called four top-notch cardinal theologians and said, ‘Explain this to me.’”“They explained it to him, and that’s how the story ended,” Francis said. “It’s an anecdote to show how Pope Benedict moved when there was a complaint.”___Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801209,'Knock at the Cabin' knocks off 'Avatar' at the box office,"NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time in almost two months, the box office doesn't belong to blue people. 

            After seven weeks as the top film in theaters, “Avatar: The Way of Water” was finally knocked out of the No. 1 spot by the M. Night Shyamalan thriller “Knock at the Cabin” and the octogenarian comedy “80 for Brady."" 

            “Knock at the Cabin,” a home invasion horror film with an apocalyptic riff, dethroned James Cameron's 3-D sci-fi epic with $14.2 million in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Universal Pictures release stars Dave Bautista as one of four strangers who approach a family vacationing in a rural cabin.











            The opening for “Knock at the Cabin” came up shy of some of Shyamalan's recent releases. His last film, 2021's “Old,"" about a beach that rapidly ages those who visit it, launched with $16.9 million and ultimately collected $90.1 million worldwide. His 2019 film “Glass,"" the third installment in the director's “Unbreakable” trilogy, opened with $40.3 million on its way to grossing $247 million globally. Every other film directed by Shyamalan has opened higher than “Knock at the Cabin."" 

            But “Knock at the Cabin"" still marks Shyamalan's seventh film as director to open No. 1. With a modest budget of $20 million, “Knock at the Cabin” should easily turn a profit. The film, which drew mostly positive reviews from critics (68% on Rotten Tomatoes), added another $7 million internationally. 

            Taking second place was “80 for Brady,"" a comedy about four friends (Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Rita Moreno and Sally Field) who take a trip to the 2017 Super Bowl. It opened with an estimated $12.5 million. Shortly after announcing his retirement from football (again), Tom Brady attended the film's premiere. 

            Paramount Pictures employed a unique strategy in releasing “80 for Brady.” While many films have sought to capitalize on higher ticket prices through large-format or 3-D screenings or surge pricing, which films like “The Batman"" have tried, Paramount went the other direction on “80 for Brady.” The studio partnered with exhibitors, including the largest chains, to play “80 for Brady” at matinee prices to help lure its largely older audience. (Half of ticket buyers were over the age of 55.) 

            It seemed to work. At a time when comedies have struggled mightily in theaters, “80 for Brady” (with a production budget of $28 million) had one of the best openings for a live-action comedy in years. Discount pricing is to continue for the rest of the film's run. 

            “Avatar: The Way of Water” slide to third with $10.8 million domestically in its eighth weekend. The film's No. 1 streak matched the run of 2009's “Avatar."" In the last four decades, only those two by Cameron and his “Titanic"" (1997) have had such sustained reigns atop the box office. 

            “The Way of Water” continues to perform especially strongly overseas, where its $27.9 million this weekend pushed its overall total to $2.17 billion worldwide. That puts it at fourth highest gross of all-time; Cameron — with two “Avatar” films and “Titanic” — now accounts for three of the top four. 

            “BTS: Yet to Come in Cinemas"" took in $5.1 million to land in fifth place. The BTS concert film is drawn from their October 2022 performance in Busan, South Korea — a send-off show before the group began a two-year hiatus. It opened in 1,111 locations. 

            Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

            1. “Knock at the Cabin,” $14.2 million. 

            2. “80 for Brady,” $12.5 million. 

            3. “Avatar: The Way of Water,” $10.8 million. 

            4. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” $8 million. 

            5. “BTS: Yet to Come in Cinemas,” $5.1 million.

            8. “Missing,” $3.7 million. 

            9. “The Chosen Season 3 Finale,” $3.6 million.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801210,Biden's State of the Union to tout policy wins on economy,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden will use his second State of the Union address on Tuesday to remind Americans of how their lives have been improved over his first two years in office, as he tries to confront pessimism in the country and navigate the tricky politics of a newly divided Washington.

            Rather than laying out major new policy proposals, Biden was expected to devote much of his speech to highlighting his efforts over the past two years to create jobs, fight inflation and improve the nation’s infrastructure. The speech comes as Biden is honing his pitch to voters ahead of his expected announcement in the next few months that he will seek another term in office despite voter frustrations about the direction of the nation.

            “Next week, I’ll be reporting on the state of the Union,” Biden said Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report that saw the unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than 53 years. “But today, I’m happy to report that the state of the Union and the state of our economy is strong.”











            Biden’s remarks from the House rostrum will take place in a sharply different context from a year ago. Republicans now control the chamber, rendering it unlikely that any significant legislation reaches Biden’s desk. The newly empowered GOP is itching to undo many of Biden’s achievements and raising the specter of persistent investigations — including into the recent discoveries of classified documents from his time as vice president at his home and former office.

            “Jobs are up, wages are up, inflation is down, and COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden told the Democratic National Committee on Friday. “But now, the extreme MAGA Republicans in the House of Representatives have made it clear they intend to put it all at risk. They intend to destroy it.”

            The president, meanwhile, is shifting his focus from legislating to implementing the massive infrastructure and climate bills passed in the last Congress — and to trying to make sure Americans credit him for the improvements.

            “These things don’t sell themselves,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Sunday on NBC. “And it’s one of the reasons I’m really looking forward to that State of the Union address. I will say that there have been so many accomplishments under this administration. It can be difficult to list them in a distilled way.”

            While large-scale bipartisanship remains unlikely, Biden was set to reissue his 2022 appeal for Congress to get behind his “unity agenda” of actions to address the opioid epidemic, mental health, veterans’ health and cancer.

            Biden will also call on lawmakers to responsibly raise the debt limit and keep the government funded. The president has remained opposed to negotiating to avoid default, while Republicans are pushing for unspecified deep spending cuts to reduce the deficit. 

            Biden, according to two administration officials who requested anonymity to preview the speech, was also expected to discuss his decision to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon Saturday, as part of a broader section on countering China’s more assertive economic and military actions around the world. 

            His address last year came just days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and many in the West doubted Kyiv’s ability to avoid a swift routing. Now the war is on the cusp of entering its second year, and under Biden the U.S. and allies have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defenses. Now the president must make the case — both at home and abroad — for sustaining that coalition as the war drags on.

            Meanwhile, inflation, which rose precipitously last year in part because of soaring energy prices from the war, has begun to ease. 

            Still, only a quarter of U.S. adults say things in the country are headed in the right direction, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research; about three-quarters say things are on the wrong track.

            Similarly, views of the national economy remain deeply negative, with 24% calling the national economy good and 76% calling it poor. Forty-one percent of Democrats and 8% of Republicans call the economy good. The figures are similar to when Biden delivered his State of the Union address last year, but an adjustment from Biden’s first year in office when Americans were more optimistic; about half said they thought the country was headed in the right direction when the president took office. 

            At the same time, 57% say their personal financial situation is good. That’s unchanged since December but has eroded slightly since earlier last year. No less than 62% of Americans had called their personal financial situation good in AP-NORC polls conducted from late 2019 through spring of 2022. 

            Two years after Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, a protective fence was reinstalled Sunday around the Capitol ahead of Biden’s address.

            After the speech, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and his Cabinet plan to hold over 30 events in two days to drive the message home to the American people in their communities. Biden will visit Wisconsin to discuss job creation on Wednesday and on Thursday will be in Tampa, Florida to talk about his efforts to lower prescription drug costs and protect Social Security and Medicare.

            “During the State of the Union, President Biden will outline how the past two years has seen historic job growth, falling inflation, higher wages, and record investments coming back to America,” the White House said. “The economic travel blitz showcases how the president’s vision is creating jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure, lowering costs for families, tackling climate change, investing in our future and delivering for families too often left behind.”

            The travel follows Biden’s stops last week in Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia focused on rail and water infrastructure projects funded by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801211,6N: France survives Italy scare to set up Ireland showdown,"ROME (AP) — France put down a daring Italy 29-24 on Sunday and played its part in setting the stage for the eagerly awaited Six Nations showdown with Ireland next weekend.

            The French, ranked No. 2 in the world, will be defending the title against the Irish, ranked No. 1, and the nominal title favorite. France hasn't lost since 2021 and Ireland hasn't lost at home since 2021, when France last visited Dublin.

            But to extend its winning streak to 14 tests, France had to overcome an unexpectedly serious scare from Italy.











            Italy fought back from 19-6 down to lead for the first time in the match at 24-22 with less than a quarter to go. It had been 10 years since Italy had beaten France or won at home but the huge crowd at Stadio Olimpico weren't the only ones on edge.

            France was making uncharacteristic errors under pressure; a remarkable 18 penalties, 13 turnovers and a yellow card conceded for the first time in more than a year. Shaun Edwards, considered the world's best defense coach, believed it was the most penalties any side of his has given away in 22 years in rugby union.

            The difference ultimately came from a late injection of fresh reinforcements. Sekou Macalou earned a turnover and fellow replacement Romain Taofifenua gave the last pass for new flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert to crash over for a bonus-point fourth try with 13 minutes left.

            Italy hammered France to the end, though. Tommaso Allan missed a long-range penalty and a last-gasp lineout drive was broken up by France to end the match in relief.

            “We're in a good habit at the moment of winning tight, close games,” Edwards said. ""It happened (in the autumn) against Australia, South Africa. Hopefully, we'll continue that habit but we all know if we don't up our performance next week we’ll be on the end of a 15, 20, 30-points hiding.”

            Italy ended a 36-test losing streak in the Six Nations only in its previous match, but its self-belief has grown, and a high-risk game plan unnerved the French. Italy was willing to run from its own 22 and try and disrupt with offloads, box-kicks and chips. Kicking out was the last option.

            “This isn't the Italy side from the Six Nations a few seasons ago,” new France winger Ethan Dumortier said. “They surprised us.”

            France was composed enough early on to turn forced errors into a 19-6 lead inside half an hour. Tries were finished by Thibaud Flament from a chargedown, Thomas Ramos from an attack that had its origins in a scrum penalty, and debutant Dumortier after Gregory Alldritt stole ruck ball.

            Italy hardly flinched, though, and when it pushed a kickable penalty into a corner lineout, Stephen Varney attacked the blind. Fullback Ange Capuozzo cleverly made Alldritt slow up, then dived beside the left corner flag.

            Allan couldn't convert but his third penalty on halftime cut France's lead to 19-14.

            A Ramos penalty put France up 22-14 but Italy responded with another lineout drive. Italy hooker Giacomo Nicotera looked set to be driven across but France's Charles Ollivon dragged him down illegally. He was sin-binned and Italy given a penalty try.

            France's lead was slashed to one until Allan's fourth penalty kick from four put Italy in front in the 62nd. But it couldn't hold on.

            “It's quite tough to swallow this defeat,” Allan said.

            But Italy’s improvement took another massive step, and roused anticipation of their next match with France in the Rugby World Cup pools on Oct. 6 in Lyon.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801212,Ally Financial expands NASCAR spend with 2 new partnerships,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Ally Financial has expanded its growing portfolio as a top NASCAR sponsor with a deal to become the official bank of the stock car series and NASCAR-owned race tracks. 

            The multiyear deal was announced Sunday ahead of NASCAR's exhibition extravaganza at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and led to the creation of the “Ally Pre-Race Tailgate” that debuted ahead of the Busch Light Clash. 

            Ally also will be the presenting sponsor of NASCAR's Drive for Diversity Awards beginning in 2024. It said it will use that platform to celebrate “the stories, community, and work being done across the cultural landscape of racing"" and work with NASCAR on initiatives to welcome a diverse audience. 











            Ally entered NASCAR as the main sponsor of the No. 48 Chevrolet for the final two years of Jimmie Johnson's full-time career, stayed on the car after Johnson retired in 2020 and has been supportive of replacement Alex Bowman. 

            Ally has also sponsored NASCAR's return of Cup racing to Nashville. 

            “We’ve loved every minute of the ride since becoming a sponsor of the No. 48, from seeing the growth in popularity of the sport to the increased diversity among team ownership,” Ally chief marketing and public relations officer Andrea Brimmer said. “The timing couldn’t be better for us to complement our wonderful relationship with Hendrick Motorsports by expanding our footprint as an official NASCAR sponsor.""

            Diversity (and animal rescue) have been key pillars of Brimmer's stewardship of Ally spending in NASCAR.

It said it will use that platform to celebrate “the stories, community, and work being done across the cultural landscape of racing"" and work with NASCAR on initiatives to welcome a diverse audience.Ally entered NASCAR as the main sponsor of the No. 48 Chevrolet for the final two years of Jimmie Johnson's full-time career, stayed on the car after Johnson retired in 2020 and has been supportive of replacement Alex Bowman.Ally has also sponsored NASCAR's return of Cup racing to Nashville.“We’ve loved every minute of the ride since becoming a sponsor of the No. 48, from seeing the growth in popularity of the sport to the increased diversity among team ownership,” Ally chief marketing and public relations officer Andrea Brimmer said. “The timing couldn’t be better for us to complement our wonderful relationship with Hendrick Motorsports by expanding our footprint as an official NASCAR sponsor.""Diversity (and animal rescue) have been key pillars of Brimmer's stewardship of Ally spending in NASCAR.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801213,"Pope planning India, Mongolia trips after Lisbon, Marseille","ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis said Sunday he is planning to visit India next year and is studying a possible trip to Mongolia later in 2023 in what would be a first for a pope. 

            Francis outlined his upcoming travel schedule during his flight back to Rome from South Sudan. 

            He confirmed that he would be in Lisbon, Portugal for World Youth Day the first week of August and would participate in a Sept. 23 meeting of Mediterranean bishops in Marseille, France.











            He said there was “the possibility” that he would fly from Marseille to Mongolia, which would be a first for a pope.

            Looking further ahead, Francis said he thought he would visit India in 2024, after plans for a trip in 2017 fell apart. 

            Francis spoke to reporters after a six-day visit to Congo and South Sudan, where he was joined in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields. 

            The Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian leaders made a novel joint visit to push South Sudan’s political leaders to make progress on implementing a stalled 2018 peace accord that ended a civil war following the country’s 2011 independence from Sudan.

            Welby and Greenshields joined Francis aboard the papal plane back and took part in his airborne news conference, during which they were asked if they would be willing to join Francis on future trips too. 

            Welby said he would be “delighted to” if it might be helpful, joking that the papal plane was “the best airline I’ve ever flown on.”

            Greenshields also was keen but noted his mandate ends in May. 

            In a nod to the nearly all-male Vatican delegation that accompanies Francis on his foreign trips, Greenshields pointed out that he would be replaced by “a very capable woman” as moderator of the Church of Scotland, the Rev. Sally Foster-Fulton, an American. The Church of Scotland has had ordained female ministers since the 1960s.

            “She would be delighted to do the same thing,” he said.

            The Vatican delegation, made up mostly of cardinals and bishops, traditionally only includes one woman: a protocol expert in the Vatican secretariat of state. On this trip, Francis also invited as his personal guest a Congolese nun.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801214,"Pope, Anglican, Presbyterian leaders denounce anti-gay laws","ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) — Pope Francis was backed by the ceremonial head of the Anglican Communion and top Presbyterian minister in calling for gays to be welcomed by their churches as he again decried laws that criminalize homosexuality as unjust. 

            The three Christian leaders spoke on LGBTQ rights during an unprecedented joint airborne news conference Sunday while returning home from South Sudan, where they took part in a three-day ecumenical pilgrimage to try to nudge forward the young country’s peace process.

            They were asked about Francis’ recent comments to The Associated Press, in which he declared that laws that criminalize gay people were “unjust” and that “being homosexual is not a crime.” 











            South Sudan is one of 67 countries that criminalizes homosexuality, 11 of them with the death penalty. LGBTQ advocates say even where such laws are not applied, they contribute to a climate of harassment, discrimination and violence. 

            During the news conference on the way back to Rome, Francis specifically didn't repeat that “being homosexual is not a crime,” perhaps to not antagonize his South Sudanese hosts, who had originally objected to his comments to the AP.

            “If he (Pope Francis) is coming here and he tells us that marriage of the same sex, homosexuality, is legal, we will say no,” Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan’s information minister, said after the pope’s AP interview and before his visit.

            On Sunday, Francis referred to his Jan. 24 comments to the AP and repeated that such laws are “unjust.” He also repeated previous comments that parents should never throw their gay children out of the house. 

            “To condemn someone like this is a sin,” he said. “Criminalizing people with homosexual tendencies is an injustice.”

            “People with homosexual tendencies are children of God. God Loves them. God accompanies them,” he added. 

            The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, recalled that LGBTQ rights were very much on the agenda of the Church of England, and said he would quote the pope’s own words when the issue is discussed at the church’s upcoming General Synod.

            “I wish I had spoken as eloquently and clearly as the pope. I entirely agree with every word he said,” Welby said.

            Recently, the Church of England decided to allow blessings for same-sex civil marriages but said same-sex couples could not marry in its churches. The Vatican forbids both gay marriage and blessings for same-sex unions.

            Welby told reporters that the issue of criminalization had been taken up at two previous Lambeth Conferences of the broader Anglican Communion, which includes churches in Africa and the Middle East where such anti-gay laws are most common and often enjoy support by conservative bishops.

            The broader Lambeth Conference has come out twice opposing criminalization, “But it has not really changed many people’s minds,” Welby said. 

            Friction has been simmering within the global Anglican Communion for many years over its 42 provinces’ sharp differences on whether to recognize same-sex marriage and ordain LGBTQ clergy.

            Welby has been caught in the middle as both the top bishop of the Church of England and the ceremonial leader of the Anglican Communion, which is one of the world’s largest Christian communities. Welby has acknowledged “deep disagreement” among the provinces over LGBTQ issues and has said neither the Lambeth Conference nor he individually has the authority to discipline a member province or impose demands on it.

            The Rt. Rev. Iain Greenshields, the Presbyterian moderator of the Church of Scotland who also participated in the pilgrimage and news conference, offered an observation.

            “There is nowhere in my reading of the four Gospels where I see Jesus turning anyone away,” he said. “There is nowhere in the four Gospels where I see anything other than Jesus expressing love to whomever he meets. 

            “And as Christians, that is the only expression that we can possibly give to any human being, in any circumstance.”

            The Church of Scotland allows same-sex marriages. 

            Catholic teaching holds that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect, but that homosexual acts are “intrinsically disordered.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801217,West Indies on 221-0 in rain-hit 1st test against Zimbabwe,"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) — Captain Kraigg Brathwaite and fellow opener Tagenarine Chanderpaul started the second day in their 50s and finished it with centuries as West Indies advanced to 221-0 against Zimbabwe in the first test with rain again limiting play.

            Only 38 overs were bowled Sunday as the visitors resumed their first innings on 112-0 at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo.

            Brathwaite (116 not out) and Chanderpaul (101 not out) each resumed on 55 and reached their tons with relative ease.











            Brathwaite brought up his hundred with a shot down to third man. It was his 12th test ton.

            “Kraigg is a guy who values his wicket, he doesn’t give it away,” Chanderpaul said.

            Zimbabwe spin bowler Wellington Masakadza (0-30) said his side is still in the game, despite the challenging bowling conditions after West Indies chose to bat first on Saturday.

            “It’s always difficult to bowl first in Bulawayo, but we will get better tomorrow,” Masakadza said. “I thought we bowled well, same as yesterday. We just weren’t lucky enough, we missed outside edge, and balls falling short. But we didn’t let them get away, which is a big positive in test cricket.""

            Both games of the two-match series will be in Bulawayo.

            The West Indies lost 2-0 in Australia in its last series in December and interim coach Andre Coley is in charge of the team for the first time. Zimbabwe hasn’t played test cricket in 18 months since losing a one-off match at home to Bangladesh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801218,"Balloon bickering over Biden's actions, China's intentions","WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican lawmakers on Sunday accused China of deliberately surveilling sensitive U.S. military sites with a suspected spy balloon and said the Biden administration had given Beijing an intelligence opening by not downing the balloon during its high-altitude drift through American airspace.

            China, meanwhile, accused the U.S. of indiscriminate use of force when the American military shot down the balloon. Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said he lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy on Sunday over the “U.S. attack on a Chinese civilian unmanned airship by military force.”

            The balloon's presence in the sky above the United States before a military jet shot it down over the Atlantic Ocean with a missile Saturday further strained U.S.-China ties. America's top diplomat abruptly scrapped a trip to Beijing and China's defense ministry said in a statement after the balloon fell into the waters off the Carolina coast that it ""reserves the right to take necessary measures to deal with similar situations.”











            “Clearly this was an attempt by China to gather information, to defeat our command and control of our sensitive missile defense and nuclear weapon sites,” said the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, among the members of Congress on the Sunday news shows. “And that certainly is an urgency that this administration does not recognize.”

            U.S. defense and military officials said the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said President Joe Biden was first briefed on it.

            “It defies belief to suggest there was nowhere” between Alaska and the Carolinas where the U.S. could have safely shot down the balloon, said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the full Senate will get a briefing next week on the balloon, including details about its surveillance capabilities, and that the administration is considering measures against the Chinese for “their brazen activities.” He said the GOP criticism was political and premature, and that the U.S. had “sent a clear message to China that this is not acceptable.”

            A senior administration official said other Chinese balloons transited the U.S. at least briefly on three different occasions during the Trump administration and once previously since Biden took office. The official said that the Trump balloon transits only became known after Trump left office and that intelligence agencies would offer briefings to former officials from the last administration on China’s global surveillance programs.

            Biden issued the shootdown order but had wanted it to happen earlier, on Wednesday. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing down the balloon over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground. 

            “The message they (the Chinese) were trying to send is what they believe internally, and that is that the United States is a once great superpower that’s hollowed out, that’s in decline,” said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “And the message they’re trying to send the world is, ‘Look, these guys can’t even do anything about a balloon flying over U.S. airspace. How can you possibly count on them if something were to happen in the Indo-Pacific region?’”

            By Wednesday the balloon was over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos. 

            The Chinese ""didn’t go and look at the Grand Canyon,” Turner said. “They went and looked at our nuclear weapon sites and the missile defense sites throughout the country.”

            On Thursday the Pentagon publicly exposed the balloon, and after that, “China maneuvered the balloon to leave the U.S.,” Schumer told reporters Sunday. A U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the balloon changed course at that point.

            That it could be maneuvered ran counter to China's contention that the balloon — claimed to be a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research — had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds. 

            ""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence, you know?'' said retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman.

            Asked whether elements of the Chinese military may have wanted to disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken's planned visit, Mullen responded: “Clearly, I think that’s the case.”

            He said “this really damages a relationship between us and China” and “puts a big dent in moving forward in a constructive way, which we really need to do.”

            To Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who leads a new House committee on China, the message conveyed by Beijing is “look what we can do to you and get away with. Your corporations, your career politicians, they will come crawling back.”

            The flight came to an end at about 2:39 p.m. EST Saturday, when an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, defense officials said. 

            The debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly 7 miles. Officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks. 

            A U.S. official said those involved in the recovery were planning to take the remnants of the downed balloon to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for further analysis. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the plan by name and requested anonymity.

            Defense officials who briefed reporters have said the U.S. was able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the country. They said the military concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along. 

            The Pentagon has said a second balloon had been flying over Latin America. On Sunday, Colombia’s Air Force said in a statement that an object matching the characteristics of the Chinese balloon entered the country’s airspace, at a height of around 55,000 feet, on Friday morning. The Air Force said it monitored the object’s flight path until it left the country and at no time did it pose a national security risk.

            In neighboring Venezuela, people on social media reported seeing a balloon, but the government did not confirm its presence. In a statement, however, President Nicolas Maduro’s government condemned the U.S. for downing the balloon that had crossed the states, saying such actions against what China has said is a civilian aircraft that flew off course was an affront to international norms.

            Turner was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Rubio was on ABC's “This Week"" and CNN's “State of the Union,” Mullen was on ABC and Gallagher appeared on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”

Military officials determined that bringing down the balloon over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.“The message they (the Chinese) were trying to send is what they believe internally, and that is that the United States is a once great superpower that’s hollowed out, that’s in decline,” said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “And the message they’re trying to send the world is, ‘Look, these guys can’t even do anything about a balloon flying over U.S. airspace. How can you possibly count on them if something were to happen in the Indo-Pacific region?’”By Wednesday the balloon was over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.The Chinese ""didn’t go and look at the Grand Canyon,” Turner said. “They went and looked at our nuclear weapon sites and the missile defense sites throughout the country.”On Thursday the Pentagon publicly exposed the balloon, and after that, “China maneuvered the balloon to leave the U.S.,” Schumer told reporters Sunday. A U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the balloon changed course at that point.That it could be maneuvered ran counter to China's contention that the balloon — claimed to be a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research — had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds.""This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence, you know?'' said retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman.Asked whether elements of the Chinese military may have wanted to disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken's planned visit, Mullen responded: “Clearly, I think that’s the case.”He said “this really damages a relationship between us and China” and “puts a big dent in moving forward in a constructive way, which we really need to do.”To Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who leads a new House committee on China, the message conveyed by Beijing is “look what we can do to you and get away with. Your corporations, your career politicians, they will come crawling back.”The flight came to an end at about 2:39 p.m. EST Saturday, when an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, defense officials said.The debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly 7 miles. Officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks.A U.S. official said those involved in the recovery were planning to take the remnants of the downed balloon to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for further analysis. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the plan by name and requested anonymity.Defense officials who briefed reporters have said the U.S. was able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the country. They said the military concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along.The Pentagon has said a second balloon had been flying over Latin America. On Sunday, Colombia’s Air Force said in a statement that an object matching the characteristics of the Chinese balloon entered the country’s airspace, at a height of around 55,000 feet, on Friday morning. The Air Force said it monitored the object’s flight path until it left the country and at no time did it pose a national security risk.In neighboring Venezuela, people on social media reported seeing a balloon, but the government did not confirm its presence. In a statement, however, President Nicolas Maduro’s government condemned the U.S. for downing the balloon that had crossed the states, saying such actions against what China has said is a civilian aircraft that flew off course was an affront to international norms.Turner was on NBC's “Meet the Press,” Rubio was on ABC's “This Week"" and CNN's “State of the Union,” Mullen was on ABC and Gallagher appeared on Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures.”___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Tara Copp, Eric Tucker and Zeke Miller in Washington and Joshua Goodman in Cusco, Peru, contributed to this report.",2023/2/6,,World

            “I think France has a special part in my heart right now,” Parks said. “I’ll be back next year.”

            
                The 22-year-old Parks, who is ranked 79th, had 15 aces and saved all four break points against the top-seeded Garcia. 











            Parks secured the only break of a tight contest to win the match.

            The fifth-ranked Garcia, a U.S. Open semifinalist last year, was seeking a 12th career title.

            “Congrats on a great tournament,” Garcia told Parks in English. “If you keep playing like this for sure you're going to keep going up (the rankings).”

            Parks has a career-best ranking of 75th.

            The 29-year-old Garcia, who grew up in Lyon, took time to thank her home crowd — this time in French.

            “It means a lot to play here, thanks for being here,"" Garcia said. “You supported me from the first point to the last. Thanks for all your encouragement.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801234,"Pope Francis defends LGBT rights, Pope Benedict aboard plane","Pope Francis used his pulpit with reporters Sunday aboard the papal plane as he returned from east Africa to defend his predecessor's legacy and defend gay people who are victimized by anti-gay laws.As he was returning from South Sudan following a trip there and to the Democratic Republic of Congo, he said laws criminalizing homosexuality were a sin. He argued god loves and accompanies people attracted to people of the same gender.Francis also said rumors of discord with his predecessor Benedict were incorrect. Instead, Francis said that the two held regular consultations and were in agreement.Alongside his Protestant church colleagues from the UK, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Church of Scotland Moderator Iain Greenshields, the pope was asked to comment on laws outlawing homosexuality.Pope Francis called the criminalization of homosexuality wrong and said 50 countries acted against people involved in relationships with people of the same gender and 10 nations had the death penalty on the books for homosexuals.According to the the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 66 countries have laws on the books that criminalize relationships with same-sex partners.Pope Francis also spoke of his relationship with his predecessor.""I think Benedict's death was instrumentalized,"" he said. ""People wanted to score points for their own side.""Prior to Benedict's death, his longtime secretary and several conservative cardinals published memos, books and interviews criticizing Pope Francis.Benedict died on December 31 of last year after residing in the Vatican as emeritus pope during the first decade of Francis' pontificate.On the flight back to the Vatican, he also called for illegal weapons sales to be curbed, saying it was a requisite for peace.South Sudan was the second of two stops Pope Francis made, the first being the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).Both South Sudan and the DRC have been ravaged over decades of conflict and seen millions displaced along with countless deaths.""The arms trade is the biggest plague in this world today. It is the plague,"" Pope Francis said.Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, called Pope Francis visit a ""milestone"" for the young and war-torn nation.ar/msh (AP, dpa, Reuters)",2023/2/5,338,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801235,Turbine Potsdam's frozen pitch shows uneven development,"Turbine Potsdam were hoping to begin their league restart with a brave showing against heavily-favored Bayern Munich and add to the single point they had accrued in their 10 first games. Instead, they didn't play at all.The match was called off just over an hour before kick off because the pitch was frozen solid - delaying Turbine's great escape, Bayern's great chase of Wolfsburg and casting questions about just how much progress the Women's Bundesliga has made in recent years.While under-soil heating is required for licensing in the top three tiers of men's football in Germany, it is not a requirement for Women's Bundesliga sides.Nevertheless, most of the Bundesliga's 12 teams play in grounds with under-soil heating. For a cash-strapped club like Turbine Potsdam, one of just two all-women clubs in the league without the resources of a men's team to rely on, it is currently an unthinkable luxury.Despite efforts to professionalize the league and its structures, the reality for Germany's women's top-flight remains a far cry from that of even lower men's divisions.This means that the occaisional cancelled match is unavoidable. As German FA regulations state, referees have the final call in cancelling a match if they think player safety can be at risk - as was the case in Potsdam. Referees don't always err on the side of caution, and a decision to play a 2021 match amidst thrashing snow in Wolfsburg drew criticism from players and coaches.The call not to play on a rock-hard pitch was the right one. Waiting until barely an hour before kickoff to make that decision was less understandable. While men's side Babelsberg 03 played in the same stadium the prior afternoon without incident, the pitch froze over night, giving the league plenty of time to make a decision the morning of Turbine's match. Instead, a lack of transparency and urgency led to an unnecessarily last-minute call.However, many of the hundreds of fans that streamed into Potsdam's ""Karl Liebknecht Stadion"" seemed unphased by the decision. Many had decided that a trip to the ground still warranted a mulled wine or bratwurst, even if there wouldn't be football.""These things happen"" was a common refrain among Turbine fans, for whom a cancelled game was just the latest in a long list of things that have gone wrong this season. A supporter who made the roughly 100 kilometer journey from Cottbus with his family quipped to DW that, ""at least Potsdam didn't lose today!""Turbine assistant coach Dirk Heinrichs, in charge as the club look for a new head coach, took a similarly-relaxed approach to the postponement. ""In Potsdam, it's always a challenge to get games played at the Karl Liebknecht Stadion this time of year. But we need to live with that. We're already preparing for our next match on Friday and hope we’ll have good weather,"" he told DW.Bayern Munich, with fitter financials and a title race to keep alive, were a lot less amused. ""The game was going to be really important for us to keep up the pressure [on Wolfsburg]. It’s extremely frustrating and truly bitter,"" the club's Sporting Director Bianca Rech told broadcaster ""Magenta Sport"" after the decision.""We were in discussions with the German FA because we knew this could be an issue. We even asked if we could swap home fixtures. But nothing came of it. That could have gone a lot better,"" Rech continued, adding especially at a time ""when we're talking about wanting to make the league more professional.""In fact, the German FA is due to publish a report in early February about the progress made by the Women's Bundesliga in the last year. It's unclear whether it will highlight the ongoing infrastructural deficit in women's football, the widening financial gulf between between the Bundesliga's haves and have nots, or the inability of the league to make timely decisions and communicate them to all parties.There has been no comment from the league or the FA on the match's late cancellation. Outside of frustration among Bayern players and staff - and certainly any fans that made the trip, the most common response has been shrugging resignation. When similar weather in England saw a Women's Super League (WSL) match between Chelsea and Liverpool called off after six minutes played in January, there was widespread uproar.Chelsea coach Emma Hayes told Sky Sports afterwards: ""The WSL is the same level as the Premier League - just because we're women, it doesn't mean we shouldn't be afforded the same access.""Wolfsburg's star striker Ewa Pajor recently told DW that she thinks the Bundesliga is the ""best league in the world."" For that opinion to be more common, the league will need not only to improve its infrastructure, but to take itself, its clubs, and its fans more seriously.",2023/2/5,,

On Saturday, some thirty avalanches were reported in Tyrol alone. Eleven of the avalanches involved missing people, with rescue efforts slowed by poor visibility and weather conditions.Authorities have continued to warn of further avalanches in several countries' Alpine regions.A Bavarian woman was killed by an avalanche in the German speaking autonomous northern Italian region of South Tyrol on Saturday.The Bavarian avalanche warning service, meanwhile, also reported a series of weekend avalanches, often triggered by skiers, but said that nobody was seriously injured.rmt/msh (AFP, dpa)",2023/2/5,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801237,German star Friedrich wins another 4-man world bobsled title,"ST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) — Francesco Friedrich drove to his fifth consecutive world four-man bobsled championship on Sunday, ending yet another dominant showing for Germany at the season’s biggest competition.

            Friedrich — also the two-time defending Olympic champion in the four-man event — and his team of Thorsten Margis, Candy Bauer and Alexander Schüller finished four runs over two days in 4 minutes, 19.61 seconds.

            That time was 0.69 seconds ahead of the drivers who shared second place. Brad Hall of Britain and Emils Cipulis of Latvia both got their sleds across the line in 4:20.30.











            The U.S. four-man sled driven by Geoff Gadbois finished 18th.

            Out of six events at the world championships – men’s skeleton, women’s skeleton, two-man, four-man, women’s bobsled and women’s monobob – Germany claimed five gold medals and eight of a possible 18 medals overall. Britain grabbed the other gold when Matt Weston won the men’s skeleton title.

            The U.S. tied for second with Britain in the overall medal standings at the world championships with two, both captured by Kaillie Humphries. She won silver in monobob and teamed with Kaysha Love for bronze in the two-woman event.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801238,"Kane's milestone goal gives Tottenham win, helps Arsenal too","Harry Kane broke Tottenham's all-time scoring record with a goal — his 267th for the club — that will have been celebrated almost as jubilantly by the other team in north London.

            The England captain's milestone strike earned Tottenham a 1-0 win Sunday over Manchester City, which was looking for a victory to trim the gap to Premier League leader Arsenal to two points.

            In the end, Arsenal wasn't punished for losing 1-0 at Everton on Saturday — and maybe that's no surprise. After all, City now hasn't won, or even scored, in five games at Tottenham's new stadium in either the Premier League or the Champions League.











            Even the absence of Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, recovering in his native Italy after having his gallbladder removed this week, couldn't change the narrative around this particular fixture.

            Kane swept home the winner in the 15th minute after Pierre-Emile Højbjerg intercepted a pass out from the back by City midfielder Rodri and set up the striker to score his 200th Premier League goal. Only two other players — Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208) — have reached that figure.

            Kane broke the tie for all-time Tottenham goals he had with the late Jimmy Greaves, who played for the club from 1961-70.

            “Just a magical moment,” Kane said in an on-field interview as he looked out at Tottenham's celebrating fans, ""and I was desperate to do it with a win. To do it in front of the home fans is a moment I’ll never forget.

            “There’s been so much talk about it over the last couple of weeks. I just wanted to get it done as soon as possible. And to do it in a big game against one of the best teams in the world is a special feeling.”

            City was the architect of its own downfall for the goal, just as it was when conceding two sloppy first-half goals against Tottenham last month before rallying for a 4-2 win at Etihad Stadium.

            This time, there was no comeback despite a second-half resurgence sparked by the introduction of Kevin De Bruyne, who was benched for the second straight game against Tottenham, and the 87th-minute sending-off of Cristian Romero for a second yellow card.

            “Sooner or later it is going to change,"" City manager Pep Guardiola said of his team's record at Tottenham's new stadium, ""but it's strange. We haven’t scored one goal, we create chances, we have missed penalties in the past. To find an explanation is not easy.

            “We found the positions, made good balls to the channels, but missed the last action up front.""

            City lost for the fourth time this season in the league and stayed five points behind Arsenal, which has a game in hand as it bids for a first top-flight title since 2004.

            Guardiola said City's players were “not in the position to think about being champions, just the next game.”

            “There's still a lot of football to be played,” City defender Kyle Walker said. “I know the twists and turns (in the title race), I know what this team is about.”

            Fifth-place Tottenham moved a point behind fourth-place Newcastle in the race for Champions League qualification. 

            NAVAS DEBUT

            Keylor Navas swapped a contender for the Champions League for a relegation candidate in the Premier League. He immediately looked at home.

            The Costa Rica goalkeeper made a string of great saves on his debut for Forest in its 1-0 win over Leeds that moved the team six points clear of the relegation zone.

            “Outstanding and composed,"" Forest manager Steve Cooper said of the three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, who moved from Paris Saint-Germain this week. “The obvious talking points are the saves, and rightly so, he deserves all the credit for that, but I loved his composure and game management and decision-making.”

            Brennan Johnson scored the 14th-minute winner for Forest, which has won three of its last four league games and is up to 13th.

            Leeds is in 17th place in the 20-team league and only out of the relegation positions on goal difference.

            AMERICAN INFLUENCE

            U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie came on for his debut for Leeds as a second-half substitute and played alongside international teammate Tyler Adams.

            With Brenden Aaronson also in the squad, Leeds became the first team to have three U.S. internationals play in the same season in the Premier League since 2012-13, when Stoke had Geoff Cameron, Brek Shea and Maurice Edu.

            Leeds manager Jesse Marsch is another American at the club and knows he is under pressure ahead of a match at Manchester United on Wednesday, which is Leeds' game in hand.

            ""I have to find a way of turning good performances more into winning because that’s exactly where we are and have been for a little while,” Marsch said.

            “I understand the frustration and doubts. Internally, we have belief here. We do.""

After all, City now hasn't won, or even scored, in five games at Tottenham's new stadium in either the Premier League or the Champions League.Even the absence of Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, recovering in his native Italy after having his gallbladder removed this week, couldn't change the narrative around this particular fixture.Kane swept home the winner in the 15th minute after Pierre-Emile Højbjerg intercepted a pass out from the back by City midfielder Rodri and set up the striker to score his 200th Premier League goal. Only two other players — Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208) — have reached that figure.Kane broke the tie for all-time Tottenham goals he had with the late Jimmy Greaves, who played for the club from 1961-70.“Just a magical moment,” Kane said in an on-field interview as he looked out at Tottenham's celebrating fans, ""and I was desperate to do it with a win. To do it in front of the home fans is a moment I’ll never forget.“There’s been so much talk about it over the last couple of weeks. I just wanted to get it done as soon as possible.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801240,Kane's record goal earns Tottenham 1-0 win over Man City,"LONDON (AP) — Harry Kane’s record-breaking goal pushed Tottenham to a 1-0 win over Manchester City on Sunday to further dent the champions’ hopes of retaining the Premier League title.

            Kane slotted home after 15 minutes and moved past the late Jimmy Greaves as Spurs’ all-time leading scorer on 267 goals.

            It proved enough to keep up Tottenham’s excellent recent home record against City, which could have moved two points behind first-place Arsenal following its defeat at Everton on Saturday.











            Fifth-place Spurs instead claimed a third victory from their last four matches against Pep Guardiola’s team — despite Cristian Romero’s late sending-off for a second yellow card — to aid the recovery of absent manager Antonio Conte, who is still in Italy after having his gallbladder removed on Wednesday.

            Despite Conte recovering from surgery, he was involved in team selection and deadline-day signing Pedro Porro was only on the bench for Spurs with City surprisingly naming Kevin De Bruyne among the substitutes, too.

            The visitors had seen Arsenal drop points a day earlier and signaled their intentions with Riyad Mahrez and Julian Alvarez having shots blocked in the opening exchanges.

            City was dominating possession but soon felt the familiar feeling of trailing to Tottenham — and it proved a record-breaking goal.

            Eric Dier urged his teammates to press higher and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stole in ahead of Rico Lewis outside the away penalty area to intercept Rodri's pass and slip the ball into the path of Kane, who scuffed an effort beyond goalkeeper Ederson and into the corner.

            The screens inside the stadium acknowledged Kane's achievement before the striker waved to his family in the West Stand.

            Bookings followed with Rodrigo Bentancur and Romero cautioned in quick succession, the latter for clattering into the ineffective Erling Haaland.

            Tottenham assistant coach Cristian Stellini, filling in for Conte, was attempting to match the animated presence of his fellow Italian on the touchline but saw his team enjoy a slice of luck before the break.

            After Rodri and Jack Grealish failed to find the net with curled efforts late in the half, Mahrez sent a stinging half-volley crashing against the crossbar from 12 yards (meters) that bounced away to safety to ensure Spurs were ahead at the break for the first time at home since Oct. 12.

            Ben Davies headed wide for the hosts at the start of the second period before Guardiola turned to De Bruyne with 57 minutes played.

            De Bruyne’s first real involvement saw his short free kick find Alvarez, who saw a low shot diverted over by Dier’s thigh.

            It sparked a frantic spell with Romero blocking Manuel Akanji’s shot and, seconds later, Ivan Perisic’s cross agonizingly evaded the Argentina defender and Kane at the back post.

            Kane was in the thick of the action minutes later, sending one effort wide before Ederson denied him after the striker surged between Kyle Walker and Akanji.

            More drama was to follow with referee Andrew Madley showing Romero a second yellow card for a foul on Grealish before five minutes of stoppage time was added on.

            Despite plenty of City possession, Tottenham held firm to move a point off the top four and do rivals Arsenal a big favor in the title race.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801241,Bayern beats Wolfsburg 4-2 to reclaim Bundesliga lead,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich held on despite Joshua Kimmich’s sending off to beat Wolfsburg 4-2 and return to the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday.

            Kimmich was sent off with his second yellow card in the 54th but Wolfsburg was unable to make its dominance count as the visitors delivered a lesson in efficiency.

            Kingsley Coman scored twice and Thomas Müller and Jamal Musiala added two more while Bayern also needed goalkeeper Yann Sommer at his best to secure the team’s first Bundesliga win of the year.











            “The result was important, the victory matters above all else,” Bayern coach Julian Nagelsmann said. “We were too careless after the third goal, not concentrated enough and we allowed a bit too much. But we can be positive looking ahead with these three points.” 

            It was enough for Bayern to move back to one point clear of Union Berlin.

            Wolfsburg had 22 shots at goal compared to the 10-time defending champions’ nine.

            Wolfsburg pressured from the start but Bayern struck first in the ninth minute when Coman’s cross for Müller evaded everyone and crept inside the far post.

            Coman wasn’t finished. The France winger met João Cancelo’s cross with a volley for 2-0 five minutes later, right after Wolfsburg missed a great opportunity to level.

            Müller, making his 427th appearance for Bayern to equal Gerd Müller’s record, celebrated by heading in Kimmich’s free kick for Bayern’s third in only the 19th.

            Despite the goals, Wolfsburg remained competitive and deservedly pulled one back through Jakub Kaminski before the break.

            The home team pushed for more in the scond half, missing two good chances before Kimmich was sent off with his second yellow card for a foul on Maximilian Arnold.

            Wolfsburg enjoyed more possession but failed to make it count before Musiala snatched Bayern’s fourth with a fine individual effort in the 73rd.

            Mattias Svanberg pulled another back for Wolfsburg in the 81st and Yannick Gerhardt thought he’d made it 4-3 three minutes later, only to see the goal ruled out through VAR for an apparent foul in the buildup.

            Earlier, second-half goals from Jens Stage and Marvin Ducksch earned Werder Bremen a 2-0 win at Stuttgart for the visitors’ second consecutive victory.

            It lifted promoted Bremen to eighth while Stuttgart dropped back into the relegation zone. Stuttgart hasn’t won a game since mid-November.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801242,Clark's triple-double leads No. 6 Iowa over Penn State 95-51,"STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — Lisa Bluder loves pretty basketball and Iowa’s coach got her fill of highlights on Sunday.

            The No. 6 Hawkeyes — decked out in pink uniforms with white lettering — transitioned with ease, deftly set each other up for basket after basket and made stop after stop to rout Penn State 95-51 on Sunday.

            Hawkeye star Caitlin Clark was at the center of Iowa’s eighth straight win.











            The junior had 23 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds for her ninth career triple-double.

            “There were some beautiful passes,” Bluder said. “I love it when we pass the ball so well and we transition so well and we did a lot of that today.”

            Enough that the result wasn’t in doubt after one quarter.

            Clark scored 11 of her points in the first half while Penn State’s best shooters went cold early.

            Taniyah Thompson led Penn State (13-11, 4-9) with 11 points while Leilani Kapinus had 10. But Kapinus, Makenna Marisa and Shay Ciezki, all averaging in double figures for Penn State this season, combined to go just 2 for 15 from the floor in the first quarter, when Iowa (19-4, 11-1 Big Ten) took control.

            The two teams, both clad in pink-and-white uniforms for breast cancer awareness, traded baskets until Iowa took the lead for good. As Penn State’s shooters clanked misses off the rim, the Hawkeyes heated up and used a 12-2 run over the final 6:27 of the first quarter to pull ahead 19-9.

            Clark chipped in six points during that run, then fueled her teammates with sharp passes over her head and behind her back in the second. Iowa’s leading scorer set up six buckets and drained a 3-pointer off a fast-break to help the Hawkeyes take a 45-22 lead into halftime.

            “She’s at the top of everyone’s scouting report,” Marisa said. “She makes the right read, she rebounds, she kind of does it all and I have a lot of respect for her.”

            Monika Czinano scored 14 points and Kate Martin added 11 for the Hawkeyes, who controlled the paint and poured on points in a lopsided second half.

            Clark’s 3-pointer put Iowa up by 23, a lead it would extend by as many as 49 in the second half.

            GET INSIDE

            Iowa outclassed Penn State inside all afternoon. The Hawkeyes outscored the Lady Lions 58-18 in the paint and outrebounded them 51-24, with 43 coming on the defensive glass.

            No Hawkeye was better in the paint than Czinano, who buried pinpoint feeds from Clark all game. Many of them came off fast-breaks, too.

            “When you have 28 assists on 39 baskets, that’s pretty special,” Bluder said.

            CLARK’S STREAK

            Clark has hit double figures in an NCAA-best 75 straight games and in all but one game ever.

            That was back on Jan. 9, 2021, when she played 32 minutes against Northwestern and was held to just eight points in a 77-67 loss.

            Bluder called her “a generational player” afterward. Penn State coach Carolyn Kieger agreed.

            “Caitlin Clark is a once-in-a-generation player,” Kieger said. “I’ve watched her since she was probably in sixth grade and every time you see her play, it seems like she gets better and better.”

            RANKINGS GAME

            Penn State fell to 0-5 against AP Top 25 teams this season.

            THE BIG PICTURE

            Iowa: The Hawkeyes won their eighth straight in the series, dating back to 2018. Three of Iowa’s next four opponents are a combined 10-23 in Big Ten play, but two games against No. 4 Indiana remain, along with a trip to No. 8 Maryland in the final two regular-season games.

            Penn State: The Lady Lions are at their best when their shooters are clicking. It didn’t happen in this one. They made just eight of their first 37 shots.

Iowa’s leading scorer set up six buckets and drained a 3-pointer off a fast-break to help the Hawkeyes take a 45-22 lead into halftime.“She’s at the top of everyone’s scouting report,” Marisa said. “She makes the right read, she rebounds, she kind of does it all and I have a lot of respect for her.”Monika Czinano scored 14 points and Kate Martin added 11 for the Hawkeyes, who controlled the paint and poured on points in a lopsided second half.Clark’s 3-pointer put Iowa up by 23, a lead it would extend by as many as 49 in the second half.GET INSIDEIowa outclassed Penn State inside all afternoon. The Hawkeyes outscored the Lady Lions 58-18 in the paint and outrebounded them 51-24, with 43 coming on the defensive glass.No Hawkeye was better in the paint than Czinano, who buried pinpoint feeds from Clark all game. Many of them came off fast-breaks, too.“When you have 28 assists on 39 baskets, that’s pretty special,” Bluder said.CLARK’S STREAKClark has hit double figures in an NCAA-best 75 straight games and in all but one game ever.That was back on Jan. 9, 2021, when she played 32 minutes against Northwestern and was held to just eight points in a 77-67 loss.Bluder called her “a generational player” afterward. Penn State coach Carolyn Kieger agreed.“Caitlin Clark is a once-in-a-generation player,” Kieger said. “I’ve watched her since she was probably in sixth grade and every time you see her play, it seems like she gets better and better.”RANKINGS GAMEPenn State fell to 0-5 against AP Top 25 teams this season.THE BIG PICTUREIowa: The Hawkeyes won their eighth straight in the series, dating back to 2018. Three of Iowa’s next four opponents are a combined 10-23 in Big Ten play, but two games against No. 4 Indiana remain, along with a trip to No. 8 Maryland in the final two regular-season games.Penn State: The Lady Lions are at their best when their shooters are clicking. It didn’t happen in this one.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801243,"Officials urge evacuation near derailment, fearing explosion","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Officials monitoring the smoldering, tangled wreckage of a train derailment in northeastern Ohio urgently warned hundreds of nearby residents who had declined to evacuate to do so Sunday night, saying a rail car was at risk of a potential explosion that could launch deadly shrapnel as far as a mile.

            They warned of “the potential of a catastrophic tanker failure” after a “drastic temperature change” was observed in that rail car, according to a statement from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s office that said teams were working to prevent an explosion at the scene in East Palestine. It did not specify what was in that car or whether it was among those that had been carrying hazardous materials.

            Authorities urged anyone within a 1-mile (1.6-kilometer) radius of the site to leave immediately. Many had, but local officials indicated more than 500 residents had declined to evacuate, the statement said.











            Federal investigators had announced earlier Sunday that a mechanical issue with a rail car axle caused the fiery derailment near the Pennsylvania state line Friday night.

            Michael Graham, a board member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a news conference that the three-member train crew received an alert about the mechanical defect “shortly before the derailment"" but said the board was still working to determine which rail car experienced the issue.

            About 50 cars derailed in East Palestine as a train was carrying a variety of products from Madison, Illinois, to Conway, Pennsylvania, rail operator Norfolk Southern said. No injuries to crew, residents or first responders were reported.

            Graham said investigators identified the exact “point of derailment” but did not disclose the location Sunday. He said information will be included in a preliminary investigative report expected in the next month or so.

            East Palestine officials said emergency responders were monitoring but keeping their distance from the fire, and that remediation efforts could not begin while the cars smoldered.

            Mayor Trent Conaway, who declared a state of emergency in the village, said one person was arrested for going around barricades right up to the crash during the night. He warned that more arrests would follow if people did not to stay away.

            “I don't know why anybody would want to be up there; you're breathing toxic fumes if you're that close,” he said, stressing that monitors of air quality away from the fire showed no levels of concern and the town's water is safe because it is fed by groundwater unaffected by some material that went into streams. Environmental protection agency crews were working to remove contaminants from streams and monitor water quality.

            Sheriffs went door-to-door Sunday to count residents remaining and urge people within the evacuation area to leave. Schools and village offices will be closed at least through Monday, and businesses within the evacuation zone are not allowed to open Monday, officials said.

            Norfolk Southern said 20 of the more than 100 cars on the train were classified as carrying hazardous materials — defined as cargo that could pose any kind of danger “including flammables, combustibles, or environmental risks.”

            The NTSB said only 10 cars carrying hazardous materials derailed, and five of them were carrying vinyl chloride, not 14 as was said earlier. Officials stressed late Saturday that they had not confirmed the release of vinyl chloride other than from pressure release devices operating as designed.

            Vinyl chloride, used to make the polyvinyl chloride hard plastic resin in a variety of plastic products, is associated with increased risk of liver cancer and other cancers, according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute.

            “Short-term exposure to low levels of substances associated with the derailment does not present a long-term health risk to residents,” according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” post on the village Facebook page. “Vinyl chloride and benzene may cause cancer in people exposed in the workplace to high concentrations for many years; however, there is no indication that any potential exposure that occurred after the derailment increases the risk of cancer or any other long-term health effects in community members.”

            Officials said Sunday afternoon that cars involved also carried combustible liquids, butyl acrylate and residue of benzene from previous shipments, as well as nonhazardous materials such as wheat, plastic pellets, malt liquors and lube oil.

            The evacuation order covered homes of 1,500 to 2,000 of the town’s 4,800 to 4,900 residents, but officials said it was unknown exactly how many were actually affected. Most of those who had gone to an emergency shelter were no longer there by Sunday.

            Norfolk Southern opened an assistance center in the village to gather information from affected residents. Village officials said 75 people went to the center Saturday and about 100 had been there Sunday morning.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Officials monitoring the smoldering, tangled wreckage of a train derailment in northeastern Ohio urgently warned hundreds of nearby residents who had declined to evacuate to do so Sunday night, saying a rail car was at risk of a potential explosion that could launch deadly shrapnel as far as a mile.They warned of “the potential of a catastrophic tanker failure” after a “drastic temperature change” was observed in that rail car, according to a statement from Ohio Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801244,"US officials offer Congress briefing on Trump, Biden papers","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. officials have offered to brief congressional leaders on their investigation into the classified documents found at former President Donald Trump's Florida residence as well as President Joe Biden's Delaware home and former private office, people familiar with the matter said Sunday.

            A briefing could come as soon as this week. But it may not meet demands from lawmakers who want to review the documents taken not just from Mar-a-Lago but also from the locations belonging to Biden and the Indiana home of former Vice President Mike Pence. 

            Six months after federal agents first conducted an unprecedented search of a former president's home for classified documents, the White House faces bipartisan pressure to share what it found with lawmakers who say they are concerned about the potential damage to national security and intelligence sources. Separate special counsels are investigating the documents found in the possession of Trump and Biden.











            Officials have declined to answer most questions in public or private about what they found, citing the ongoing criminal investigations and a separate “risk assessment” of the possible damage to intelligence sources. 

            Rep. Mike Turner, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, told NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the administration notified him it would brief on the documents this week.

            “This administration needs to understand we do have national security urgent matters,” said Turner, R-Ohio. He also called on the White House to brief him on the Chinese balloon shot down Saturday. 

            “What's interesting is that the moment this balloon became public, I got a notice not from the administration that I'm going to get a briefing on this balloon, but they have to rush to Congress now to talk to us about Donald Trump's documents,” he said, adding that a discussion of Biden and Pence's records was expected to be included. 

            Three people familiar with the matter confirmed a congressional briefing was offered to the “Gang of Eight” — the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate and of both intelligence committees. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters. 

            Any briefing is not expected to include direct access to the documents that were seized, the people said. 

            Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked for that access in a letter last week to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.

            The director of national intelligence's office and Department of Justice both declined to comment Sunday. 

            The Justice Department says roughly 300 documents with classified markings, including at the top-secret level, have been recovered from Mar-a-Lago after being taken there after Trump left the White House. Last August, FBI agents executed a search warrant at the property after developing evidence that led them to believe that Trump and his representatives had not returned all the classified files. 

            The material taken at that time included roughly 13,000 government documents, including about 100 bearing classification markings. Some of the material was so sensitive that Justice Department prosecutors and FBI counterintelligence investigators required additional security clearances to review them. 

            A special counsel, Jack Smith, is investigating whether to bring charges against Trump or anyone else related to the documents. Prosecutors have revealed that they are investigating possible violations of multiple criminal statutes, including willful retention of national defense information and obstruction. A grand jury in Washington has been hearing evidence and federal prosecutors have interviewed multiple Trump associates. It is not clear how much longer that investigation will last.

            Trump has claimed that the materials were declassified and that he had the power to do so just by thinking about it, though his lawyers have not repeated that claim. They tried to have an independent arbiter conduct an outside review of the documents, though a federal appeals court late last year ended that work and said Trump’s team was not entitled to that assessment. 

            Biden's lawyers say they contacted authorities after first discovering “a small number of documents with classified markings” on Nov. 2, 2022, in a locked closet at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. The documents were found as Biden's attorneys were clearing out the offices. 

            A second batch of documents — again described by Biden's lawyers as a “small number” — were found in a storage space in Biden’s garage near Wilmington, Delaware, along with six pages located in Biden’s personal library in his home. 

            FBI agents on Jan. 20 located six additional items that contained documents with classified markings and also took possession of some of Biden's handwritten notes, according to Biden lawyer Bob Bauer. The FBI subsequently searched Biden's vacation home in Delaware but found no classified documents, Bauer said afterward.

            Vontae Davis, 34, smelled of alcohol, had slurred speech and bloodshot eyes and could barely stay awake while being interviewed by a trooper after the accident early Saturday on the Florida Turnpike in Hollywood, Florida, according to a report from the Florida Highway Patrol. 

            According to troopers, Davis lost control of his Tesla sedan and it collided with the parked pickup truck on the side of the turnpike. The impact of the collision sent the pickup truck spinning into a concrete barrier, and the truck struck its driver who had been waiting outside. The driver was taken to a hospital with multiple injuries, the report said.











            Davis refused to provide a blood or urine sample and wouldn't agree to perform a field sobriety test, the report said. He told the trooper that he had consumed two drinks at a club.

            No attorney was listed for Davis in an online court docket.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801249,"Arrest made in stolen yacht rescue, 'Goonies' fish incident","SEATTLE (AP) — A stolen yacht. A dramatic Coast Guard rescue. A dead fish. And the famed home featured in the classic 1985 film “The Goonies.”

            Combined, Oregon police called it a series of “really odd” events along the Pacific Northwest coast spanning 48 hours that concluded Friday night with the arrest of a Canadian man.

            Jericho Wolf Labonte, 35, of Victoria, British Columbia, was taken into custody in the northwestern Oregon resort town of Seaside, police said in a news release.











            He'd been pulled from the ocean hours earlier by a Coast Guard swimmer, just after the yacht he was piloting capsized amid high waves. He was briefly hospitalized for mild hypothermia. 

            Labonte was discharged before authorities in nearby Astoria, Oregon, saw the rescue video and said they recognized him as the same person who covered over security cameras at the “Goonies” house and left the fish on the porch. 

            Police in Seaside, about 17 miles south of Astoria, said they found Labonte on Friday evening at a homeless shelter where he was staying “under an alias,” and arrested him on charges of theft, criminal mischief, endangering another person and unauthorized use of a vehicle.

            He's also wanted in Canada for “other cases,” Seaside police said.

            It wasn’t immediately clear Sunday whether Labonte had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.

            “It’s been a really odd 48 hours,” Astoria Police Chief Stacy Kelly said Friday.

            Police had been looking for Labonte since Wednesday, when an acquaintance alerted them to a video Labonte posted on social media of himself leaving a dead fish at the “Goonies” house and dancing around the property, Kelly said. The Victorian home was recently sold to a fan of the film, after being listed for $1.7 million. 

            Friday afternoon, before Labonte's arrest, the Coast Guard shared stunning video of the rescue by Petty Officer 1st Class Branch Walton, a newly minted rescue swimmer from Greenville, South Carolina. 

            The 35-foot (11-meter) yacht had been reported stolen by its owner Friday afternoon. As the swimmer approached, a large wave slammed into the vessel, rolling it over and throwing a man, later identified as Labonte, into the water.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801250,No. 1 South Carolina tops fifth-ranked UConn 81-77,"HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — In a rematch of last season's national championship game, South Carolina came out on top again over UConn thanks to a strong fourth quarter by Aliyah Boston.

            Geno Auriemma stepping onto the court to spike a water bottle, that helped them, too.

            Boston scored 23 of her 26 points in the second half, including 14 in the final period, to help the No. 1 Gamecocks beat the fifth-ranked Huskies 81-77 on Sunday in front of a sellout crowd.











            “Aliyah is just relentless, she plays relentlessly although she had a subpar (first half) as far as statistics, she impacted the game,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “She doesn’t get flustered. she knew she didn’t play up to her standards. What does she do? Raise her standard. Bad first half or not, she’s going to continue to play.”

            While there wasn't as much on the line as the title game last April, there was a high intensity to it, including Auriemma getting the technical late in the fourth quarter after getting frustrated by the officiating enough to throw the bottle.

            “I thought there were a lot of things being overlooked. It was difficult for some of our guys to move out on the floor,” said Auriemma, UConn's coach. “I didn’t think it was one key play, I just couldn’t keep quiet any longer. It was bad. ... Dumb mistake by me. Bad decision.”

            The Gamecocks (23-0) have won 29 consecutive games since losing to Kentucky in the SEC Tournament title game last year. They’ve won four of the past five meetings with the Huskies, including a victory in the NCAA championship game last season. That ended UConn’s perfect 11-0 record in title games. 

            “This was a national championship-like game. I wanted us to feel what it takes to do this,” Staley said.

            Now South Carolina finally has a win in Connecticut after never winning there before.

            South Carolina used its size again to top the Huskies. The 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso and Boston — the reigning AP Player of the Year — helped the Gamecocks grab a 42-30 advantage on the boards, including 25 offensive rebounds.

            Boston finished with 11 rebounds for the 76th double-double of her career. Cardoso added 17 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out.

            With her team leading by four in the fourth quarter, Boston took over. She scored the next 12 points for South Carolina, two of those came when Auriemma tossed the water bottle onto the court and was charged with the technical foul.

            Boston hit the two free throws. She then hit a jumper, a 3-pointer and another basket to give the Gamecocks a double-digit advantage.

            “I’m kind of in attack mode. In the second half I made more shots then I did in the first half,” Boston said. 

            Despite seeing their starting backcourt foul out, the short-handed Huskies (21-3) wouldn’t go away. They whittled the lead down to 80-77 with 10.8 seconds left on Aubrey Griffin’s three-point play. 

            Raven Johnson hit the first of two free throws a second later and UConn couldn’t convert to close out the game.

            “They have a lot to feel good about once they get past what it feels like to lose,” Auriemma said. “I feel better at 3 o'clock today then I did at 12 o'clock. I didn’t know how we’d respond. I knew we’d play hard and compete like hell. I didn’t know who was going to make a big play, who was going to get a big rebound, make a big shot. I know now more than I did at noon and I feel better about my team.”

            Aaliyah Edwards led UConn with 25 points.

            UConn got off to a solid start, outscoring South Carolina 25-14 in the opening period. Lou Lopez Senechal capped the strong start, hitting a running 3-pointer just before the buzzer. 

            South Carolina asserted its size in the second quarter with Cardoso scoring 11 points in the period. Her putback with just under 10 seconds left tied the game at 34 heading into the half.

(AP) — In a rematch of last season's national championship game, South Carolina came out on top again over UConn thanks to a strong fourth quarter by Aliyah Boston.Geno Auriemma stepping onto the court to spike a water bottle, that helped them, too.Boston scored 23 of her 26 points in the second half, including 14 in the final period, to help the No. 1 Gamecocks beat the fifth-ranked Huskies 81-77 on Sunday in front of a sellout crowd.“Aliyah is just relentless, she plays relentlessly although she had a subpar (first half) as far as statistics, she impacted the game,” South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. “She doesn’t get flustered. she knew she didn’t play up to her standards. What does she do? Raise her standard. Bad first half or not, she’s going to continue to play.”While there wasn't as much on the line as the title game last April, there was a high intensity to it, including Auriemma getting the technical late in the fourth quarter after getting frustrated by the officiating enough to throw the bottle.“I thought there were a lot of things being overlooked. It was difficult for some of our guys to move out on the floor,” said Auriemma, UConn's coach. “I didn’t think it was one key play, I just couldn’t keep quiet any longer. It was bad. ... Dumb mistake by me. Bad decision.”The Gamecocks (23-0) have won 29 consecutive games since losing to Kentucky in the SEC Tournament title game last year. They’ve won four of the past five meetings with the Huskies, including a victory in the NCAA championship game last season. That ended UConn’s perfect 11-0 record in title games.“This was a national championship-like game. I wanted us to feel what it takes to do this,” Staley said.Now South Carolina finally has a win in Connecticut after never winning there before.South Carolina used its size again to top the Huskies. The 6-foot-7 Kamilla Cardoso and Boston — the reigning AP Player of the Year — helped the Gamecocks grab a 42-30 advantage on the boards, including 25 offensive rebounds.Boston finished with 11 rebounds for the 76th double-double of her career. Cardoso added 17 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out.With her team leading by four in the fourth quarter, Boston took over. She scored the next 12 points for South Carolina, two of those came when Auriemma tossed the water bottle onto the court and was charged with the technical foul.Boston hit the two free throws. She then hit a jumper, a 3-pointer and another basket to give the Gamecocks a double-digit advantage.“I’m kind of in attack mode. In the second half I made more shots then I did in the first half,” Boston said.Despite seeing their starting backcourt foul out, the short-handed Huskies (21-3) wouldn’t go away. They whittled the lead down to 80-77 with 10.8 seconds left on Aubrey Griffin’s three-point play.Raven Johnson hit the first of two free throws a second later and UConn couldn’t convert to close out the game.“They have a lot to feel good about once they get past what it feels like to lose,” Auriemma said. “I feel better at 3 o'clock today then I did at 12 o'clock. I didn’t know how we’d respond. I knew we’d play hard and compete like hell. I didn’t know who was going to make a big play, who was going to get a big rebound, make a big shot. I know now more than I did at noon and I feel better about my team.”Aaliyah Edwards led UConn with 25 points.UConn got off to a solid start, outscoring South Carolina 25-14 in the opening period. Lou Lopez Senechal capped the strong start, hitting a running 3-pointer just before the buzzer.South Carolina asserted its size in the second quarter with Cardoso scoring 11 points in the period. Her putback with just under 10 seconds left tied the game at 34 heading into the half.TIP-INS:UConn is 8-10 against No. 1 teams all time. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801251,Program's head says Iowa school shooting won't deter him,"The founder of an educational program for at-risk youth in Des Moines says he will remain “all in on helping kids that are not reachable in so many peoples' eyes” after he was wounded in last month's shooting that killed two students.

            
                Will Keeps, 49, a former Chicago gang member who moved to Iowa in his 20s and later founded the Starts Right Here program, made his first public comments about the shooting this weekend in a video the police department posted online.

            “We went all in on helping kids that are not reachable in so many peoples’ eyes,” he said. “Our youth is looking to us to not run. If they constantly keep seeing us say, ‘Oh, we can't, we’re done,’ what do you think they’re going to do? They going to be done. So become a beast. We need you to fight, become a warrior. And we need to do it together.”











            Keeps, a rapper whose given name is Will Homes, had his right arm in a cast held up by a blue sling in the video and kept a walker sitting next to his chair. He was just released from the hospital last week.

            Students Gionni Dameron, 18, and Rashad Carr, 16, were killed in the Jan. 23 shooting at the program, which provides help to students under a contract with Des Moines Public Schools. Two other teens have been charged with murder in the shooting. Police have said all four teens were involved with gangs, although the families of the victims denied that.

            Keeps said he continues to encounter the kind of violence he experienced as a youth in Chicago when he saw rival gang members kill his friend and he was himself severely beaten.

            “I’ve lived it and I’ve seen it every day of my life. I’m not going to sit up here and ignore the fact that we're killing each other. And we’re killing each other as easy as seeing a fly on the wall and swatting it or seeing an ant on the ground and stomping on it,” he said. “Our youth is in trouble, and we constantly kept doing the same thing over and over and over and over again, and it ain’t working.”

            Police have charged Preston Walls, 18, and Bravon Michael Tukes, 19, both of Des Moines, with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of criminal gang participation. Bail was set at $2.5 million for each.

            Police say Walls, a Starts Right Here participant, entered a common area of the building Jan. 23 and opened fire before fleeing in a car driven by Tukes. The two belong to a gang and committed the shootings “in connection with that gang membership,” according to police.

            Walls waived his preliminary hearing and is awaiting an arraignment that is scheduled for next month, according to online court records. His attorney has declined to comment.

            Tukes’ preliminary hearing is set for Tuesday.

(AP) — A man suspected of firing shots in a northeastern Indiana city was fatally shot by a police officer early Sunday after the suspect pulled a handgun on the officer, police said.

            Marion police officers received a report about 3:50 a.m. ET about gunshots being fired in the city in an incident in which no one was injured, Indiana State Police said.

            Investigating officers who arrived at the scene received information that a gold-colored SUV was believed involved in the incident in Marion, located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis, police said.











            Shortly afterward, a Marion police officer stopped a gold Saturn Vue but the driver exited the SUV and walked away, ignoring the officer's commands for him to stop and stay in the vehicle.

            The officer used a stun gun against the suspect but it proved ineffective and at some point the suspect “produced a handgun and was shot, at least once, by the Marion officer,"" state police said in a news release.

            Despite life-saving measures by police officers and responding paramedics, the man, identified as William White, 34, of Marion, succumbed to gunshot wound injuries, police said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801265,No. 16 Duke tops No. 9 Notre Dame 57-52 for 1st place in ACC,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Celeste Taylor scored 14 points and No. 16 Duke came from behind for a 57-52 victory at No. 9 Notre Dame on Sunday to move into first place in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

            Trailing for most of the game’s first 28 minutes, the Blue Devils (20-3, 10-2 ACC) took the lead for good in the final minutes of the third quarter to knock off the Fighting Irish (18-4, 9-3) before a sellout crowd of 9,149 at Purcell Pavilion.

            A jumper by Jordyn Oliver put Duke ahead 45-44 with 1:20 left in the third quarter and the visitors never trailed after that.











            “I’m proud of my players for finishing the game,” Duke coach Kara Lawson said.

            Duke led 48-46 going into the fourth quarter after trailing Notre Dame by as many as five points in the third quarter. A steal by Elizabeth Balogun in the final 15 seconds helped seal the win.

            A 13-4 run helped Notre Dame take its biggest lead of the first half for either team at 31-23. The Irish led 31-25 at halftime.

            “We fell short, but you know it’s a part of our growth,” Irish coach Niele Ivey said. “It’s part of our journey.”

            Taylor scored 10 points for Duke in the second half. Balogun and Shayeann Day-Wilson finished with 9 points apiece and Taya Corosdale and Oliver had 8 each.

            Maddy Westbeld, playing all 40 minutes, led Notre Dame with 15 points, Sonia Citron scored 14 and Olivia Miles added 11.

            “She’s one of the best players in the country,” Lawson said of Miles, who logged just over 31 minutes. “We didn’t have to go against her for a quarter of the game.”

            COLD SHOOTING

            Neither team shot well in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame made just 2 of 13 shots from the floor and Duke was 3 of 13.

            “We just talked about staying disciplined defensively and making it hard,” Lawson said. “I though we challenged shots.”

            Ivey also addressed that stretch of the game.

            “Some of those opportunities were in transition and we didn’t get a chance to capitalize,” she said. “We did a good job of finding the open person, we just didn’t nail the shots.”

            SUPERB SUBS

            Led by Corosdale and Oliver, Duke enjoyed a 21-4 edge in reserve scoring.

            “I’m really proud of my players off the bench,” Lawson said. “Jordyn Oliver was really good.

            “We needed to have that depth in scoring. Not only did they score but they were efficient from the field.”

            The Blue Devils' bench shot 9 of 15.

            SHORT-HANDED IRISH

            Notre Dame graduate student Dara Mabrey was lost for the season in the Jan. 22 game against Virginia.

            Lauren Ebo, a 6-foot-4 graduate student, has missed the last three games with a lower-body injury.

            “Ebo does a great job of being a precence on the block with her size and ability to rebound and play post defense,” Ivey said. “She’s been working really hard (at rehabilitation).

            “It’s kind of day to day.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801267,Dickinson leads Michigan to 77-69 win over skidding Buckeyes,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — Hunter Dickinson scored 26 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Michigan to a 77-69 win over Ohio State on Sunday.

            Jett Howard added 16 points and Kobe Bufkin 13 with eight rebounds for the Wolverines (13-10, 7-5 Big Ten Conference), who missed their last four shots to drop to 49% for the game.

            Bruce Thornton scored 22 points to lead the Buckeyes (11-12, 3-9), who have lost four straight and 10 of 12. Justice Sueing and Brice Sensabaugh both had 13 with Sensabaugh snaring nine rebounds. Thornton was 10-of-13 shooting and Ohio State made five of its last eight shots but that only raised the shooting percent to 41.











            Bufkin, Dickinson and Howard combined for for a Michigan 12-3 run for a 24-14 lead midway through the first half. Despite a poor shooting half, the Buckeyes closed it to 41-36 at the half as Sueing hit a last-minute 3-pointer.

            The Wolverines hit five 3-pointers and shot 52% (16 of 32) but they also had four more turnovers and the Buckeyes had three more offensive rebounds, which helped off-set Ohio State's 34% shooting (12 of 35). Ohio State had three 3s but was 9 of 12 from the line to Michigan's 4 of 7.

            Ohio State shot better after the break (48%) but couldn't put together a run as Dickinson scored 13 points and the Wolverines made 9 of 11 free throws.

            Michigan's three-game homestand continues Wednesday with a visit from Nebraska. Northwestern visits Ohio State on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801268,Judge: Banning guns for marijuana users unconstitutional,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A federal judge in Oklahoma has ruled that a federal law prohibiting people who use marijuana from owning firearms is unconstitutional, the latest challenge to firearms regulations after the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority set new standards for reviewing the nation’s gun laws.

            Lawyers for Jared Michael Harrison had argued that their client's Second Amendment right to bear arms was being violated by a federal law that makes it illegal for “unlawful users or addicts of controlled substances” to possess firearms. 

            Harrison had been charged after being arrested by police in Lawton, Oklahoma, in May 2022 following a traffic stop. During a search of his car, police found a loaded revolver as well as marijuana. Harrison told police he had been on his way to work at a medical marijuana dispensary, but that he did not have a state-issued medical-marijuana card. 











            His lawyers had argued the portion of federal firearms law focused on drug users or addicts was not consistent with the nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation, echoing what the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled last year in a case known as New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. That case set new standards for interpreting the Second Amendment. 

            Federal prosecutors had argued that the portion of the law focused on drug users is “consistent with a longstanding historical tradition in America of disarming presumptively risky persons, namely, felons, the mentally ill, and the intoxicated.”

            U.S. District Judge Patrick Wyrick in Oklahoma City agreed with Harrison’s lawyers, ruling on Friday that federal prosecutors’ arguments that Harrison’s status as a marijuana user “justifies stripping him of his fundamental right to possess a firearm ... is not a constitutionally permissible means of disarming Harrison.”

            “But the mere use of marijuana carries none of the characteristics that the Nation’s history and tradition of firearms regulation supports,” said Wyrick, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump. In his ruling, Wyrick highlighted that under Oklahoma law, marijuana can be bought legally at more than 2,000 store fronts in the state. 

            Attorneys for Harrison, as well as the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Oklahoma, which was prosecuting the case, did not immediately return emails seeking comment Sunday. 

            The ruling came a day after a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on Thursday ruled that the government can’t stop people who have domestic violence restraining orders against them from owning guns. The panel referenced the Bruen decision in its ruling. Two of the three judges on the panel are Trump appointees. 

            The Justice Department has said it will seek further review of the appeals court’s decision.

            
                In September, a federal judge in Midland, Texas, ruled that a firearms law that bans those under felony indictment from buying guns is unconstitutional. In that case, U.S. District Judge David Counts, also a Trump appointee, also echoed the Supreme Court’s language in the Bruen case, saying there was “little evidence” the ban related to being under indictment “aligns with this Nation’s historical tradition.”OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A federal judge in Oklahoma has ruled that a federal law prohibiting people who use marijuana from owning firearms is unconstitutional, the latest challenge to firearms regulations after the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority set new standards for reviewing the nation’s gun laws.Lawyers for Jared Michael Harrison had argued that their client's Second Amendment right to bear arms was being violated by a federal law that makes it illegal for “unlawful users or addicts of controlled substances” to possess firearms.Harrison had been charged after being arrested by police in Lawton, Oklahoma, in May 2022 following a traffic stop.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801272,AP source: Kyrie Irving going to the Dallas Mavericks,"DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving is getting his wish. He’s getting traded.

            And Luka Doncic is getting another All-Star to help him in Dallas.

            The Mavericks and Brooklyn Nets agreed Sunday on a blockbuster trade: Irving — the super-talented and often-enigmatic eight-time All-Star point guard — heads to Dallas, ending the pairing with Kevin Durant that never really had a chance to click.











            The Nets bring Spencer Dinwiddie back to Brooklyn along with Dorian Finney-Smith and a package of draft picks, according to a person familiar with the terms of the deal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it had not been finalized. Dallas also gets Markieff Morris.

            The Athletic and ESPN first reported the trade agreement. It will become complete once the teams have a call with the NBA, which is standard for all trades.

            
                The move comes just two days after Irving told the Nets that he wanted to be traded by Thursday’s league deadline, after talks about a contract beyond this season didn’t go to his liking. He wasn’t with the Nets for their game Saturday, and by Sunday afternoon, his time with the franchise he cheered for growing up in New York and New Jersey appeared to be at an end. 

            “Thank you NetsWorld fans and supporters for the Love on and off the court,"" Irving tweeted early Monday morning. “I will forever be grateful I got to live out my dream I had as a Kid with y’all. It will always be Love from me and my family.”

            It was not immediately clear when Irving would make his debut with Dallas. The Mavericks play at Utah on Monday night. ESPN reported that Irving would take a physical in Dallas on Monday with a plan to join the team for a game Wednesday at the Los Angeles Clippers.

            “My first reaction was it seemed like a really good move,"" Toronto coach Nick Nurse said Sunday before the Raptors faced Memphis. “(The Nets) got a lot of assets back for a guy who wasn’t going to be back, it seemed. I think that’s important to do. And I think for Dallas, they got a big-time star to go with the one they’ve got.”

            Irving is averaging 27.1 points, 5.3 assists and 5.1 rebounds this season. Doncic is averaging 33.4 points, 8.9 rebounds and 8.2 assists. They instantly become one of the NBA's top duos, and figure to make Dallas even a stronger contender in a Western Conference that has no shortage of championship-capable teams.

            Irving is, for now, scheduled to become a free agent after the season. The Los Angeles Lakers were believed to have been one of a few teams interested in Irving — a notion that could have reunited Irving with LeBron James, with whom he won a title with in Cleveland in 2016.

            The trade does again pair Irving with Dallas general manager Nico Harrison, who was a Nike executive before taking over the Mavericks in 2021. 

            Irving had a relationship with Nike for the entirety of his NBA career until earlier this season, when the sneaker giant dropped him — and canceled the planned release of his next signature shoe just before it dropped — as part of the massive fallout from Irving posting a link to an antisemitic film on his Twitter account.

            That was one of many drama-filled sagas that marked Irving’s time with the Nets. He wouldn’t get vaccinated against COVID-19 and, because of New York City workplace rules, had to miss most of Brooklyn’s home games last season. He also took two leaves of absence during the 2020-21 season.

            He has also expressed no shortage of controversial opinions during his career — including repeated questioning whether the Earth was round before eventually apologizing to science teachers.

            The various issues limited Irving to 143 games in three-plus seasons with the Nets, and he and Durant were together for just 74 of them after their celebrated pairing in the summer of 2019. Irving signed as a free agent while Durant joined the Nets on a sign-and-trade with Golden State.

            After the Nets lost to Dallas at home in overtime in October, Irving said he saw traits of the Mavericks being “a great team.” And he spoke at length of how highly he thinks of Doncic’s game, after the Mavs star had a 41-point, 14-rebound, 11-assist masterpiece.

            “I think first, we’ve got to discuss just how long he’s been playing professional basketball. I think it’s been since like 14, 15 years old,” Irving said that night. “He’s used to seeing so many different defenses, so many different roles that he’s played, I’m sure, overseas. And now that he’s in the NBA, you just see him. He plays at an incredible pace. He makes great decisions.”

            Dinwiddie spent five seasons with the Nets and had his best season in 2019-20, when he averaged a career-best 20.6 points while starting 49 games, mostly when Irving was injured.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801273,Croatia advances in Davis Cup as Coric beats Thiem,"Borna Coric beat 2020 U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem 7-6 (3), 6-2 on Sunday to send Croatia into the group stage of the Davis Cup.

            Coric helped the Croatians win their second Davis Cup title in 2018, but he was sidelined when they lost in the 2021 final while missing a year of action with a right shoulder injury.

            He returned to the tour last March, winning a Masters 1000 title in August in Cincinnati, Ohio, and rejoined the Croatians when they reached the Davis Cup semifinals last year.











            His victory over Thiem, who has also dealt with injuries in recent years, gave Croatia a 3-1 victory in Rijeka. The Austrians had taken the tie against the No. 1 team in the Davis Cup rankings to a fourth match when Alexander Erler and Lucas Miedler beat Ivan Dodig and Nikola Mektic 6-3, 7-6 (11) in the doubles match earlier Sunday.

            Chile, Finland, the Netherlands, South Korea and the Czech Republic also completed victories Sunday to secure their places in the next round, which will be played in September.

            On Saturday, the U.S. completed a sweep of Uzbekistan, while Serbia, France, Britain, Switzerland and Sweden also finished off victories. Those 12 countries will play in the group stage, along with reigning champion Canada, 2022 runner-up Australia and wild-card recipients Italy and Spain.

            Eight teams will then advance to the closing matches of the Davis Cup Finals scheduled for Nov. 21-26 in Malaga, Spain.

            In Sunday’s other matches:

            — Finland 3, Argentina 1: On indoor hard courts in Espoo, Finland, Harri Heliovaara and Emil Ruusuvuori edged Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-4, before Ruusuvuori secured the winning point and a personal 3-0 weekend by beating Facundo Bagnis 7-5, 6-1.

            — Netherlands 4, Slovakia 0: On indoor hard courts in Groningen, Matwe Middelkoop and Wesley Koolhof sent the hosts through with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Alex Molcan and Lukas Klein. Middelkoop then beat Jozef Kovalik 6-4, 6-4. 

            — South Korea 3, Belgium 2: On indoor hard courts in Seoul, the hosts rallied from a 2-0 deficit after the first day. Min-Kyu Song and Ji Sung Nam kept them alive with a 7-6 (3), 7-6 (5) victory over Joran Vliegen and Sander Gille. Soonwoo Kwon then beat David Goffin 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 before Seong Chan Hong completed the comeback with a 6-3, 7-6 (4) victory over Zizou Bergs.

            — Czech Republic 3, Portugal 1: On an indoor clay court in Maia, Portugal, Jiri Lehecka wrapped up the victory by beating Joao Sousa 6-4, 6-1. 

            — Chile 3, Kazakhstan 1: On an outdoor clay court in La Serena, Chile, Cristian Garin beat Alexander Bublik 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 after the hosts had taken the lead with a victory by the doubles team of Alejandro Tabilo and Tomas Barrios Vera.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801274,Rose has 2-shot lead at Pebble going into a Monday finish,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — The fading light was enough for Justin Rose to see his final shot find the 10th fairway at Pebble Beach, and that was enough for him to call it a day.

            He was 9 under in the 19 holes he played over two courses in wind, rain, hail and sunshine at the weather-delayed AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He went from middle of the pack to a two-shot lead Sunday evening when it was too dark to continue.

            Rose was to return Monday morning to finish the back nine in pursuit of his first victory in four years. 











            “A two-shot lead is great,” Rose said. “Normally, you sleep on a two-shot lead, there's 18 holes to play, tons can happen in 18 holes. Now there's eight holes to play. Less can happen in eight holes, but still ... I've still got to come out and do a job tomorrow.”

            Rose, who completed his third round with a 6-under 65 at Monterey Peninsula in the morning for a one-shot lead, was at 15-under par when the final round was stopped as the sun dipped behind the Pacific horizon.

            Denny McCarthy also played Monterey Peninsula in the morning, making eight pars and one bogey on the front nine that left him frustrated at six shots back. A change of venue, and a quick call with his sports psychologist, changed everything.

            McCarthy shot 29 on the front nine at Pebble Beach with a favorable wind to soar into contention. He chose to continue the 16th hole after the horn sounded, hitting his approach to 15 feet and then choosing to mark his ball and stop for the night.

            He was at 13-under par, along with Brendon Todd (through 12 holes) and Peter Malnati, who was in the final group with Rose.

            “It was pretty gettable early. I just happened to get it,” McCarthy said. “I felt nervous, but I also felt really calm at the same time. I took on some tee shots ... and just felt really comfortable after that start.”

            The only winner Sunday was Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who with Ben Silverman of Canada won the pro-am. Because of the wind and other weather delays, the pro-am was cut to 54 holes, leaving only professionals for the final round.

            Rodgers and Silverman won by one shot.

            He gets his name on the Wall of Champions in front of the first tee at Pebble Beach, which Rodgers called a “bucket list” item for him.

            Rose would love to be on an adjoining plaque for tournament winners.

            He was around the middle of the pack when he returned to Monterey Peninsula on Sunday morning to resume the third round. It was his golf ball blowing some 4 feet on the ninth green that led officials to stop play a day earlier.

            Rose had hit 5-wood to 3 feet on Saturday. He made the 7-foot putt Sunday morning, and he was on his way.

            After a slow start to the final round — a bogey at the start, even par through some of the scorable sections of the front nine — Rose drove into the fairway bunker on the par-5 sixth and figured he would struggle for birdie. And then he changed his mind.

            “It would have been easy to have played a different shot, just try to hit a high cut 7-iron up onto the top of the ridge, give myself a wedge shot,” he said. “But I only had 214 (yards) to the front, so the shot was on.”

            He ripped a 4-iron that rolled onto the green to 8 feet for an eagle, and then followed that with an 18-foot birdie putt on the 106-yard seventh hole.

            “At that point I was looking for some momentum, looking for something good to happen,” Rose said. “That came at the perfect time for me.”

            Sunday featured wind, rain, briefly some hail and sunshine, and that was all in the three hours to complete the third round in the morning. By late afternoon, players went from umbrellas to seeing shadows in a span of 15 minutes.

            The toughest stretch for Rose could await Monday, depending on the wind, and weather has a mind of its own at Pebble. The final stretch of holes has proven the most difficult. Six of the final seven holes have ranked among the eight hardest for the final round.

            Taylor Pendrith of Canada was among 20 players who finished. He went out in 31 and played bogey-free for a 64 to post at 12-under 275. That was three shots behind Rose, but worth sticking around to see how it unfolded.

            Rodgers did his share of heavy lifting. Silverman, coming off a Korn Ferry Tour win, finished at 1-over 216 and missed the cut. Rodgers, playing off a 10 handicap, said he had not played golf since training camp until last Monday.

            They finished at 26-under par.

            Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Keith Mitchell were four behind. Minus the weather, the leading 25 pro-am teams would have played Sunday afternoon.

            “Josh Allen was telling me there's going to be an asterisk by this win because there was only three rounds,” Rodgers said. “But I think our names are going to be up there for a long time.”

Six of the final seven holes have ranked among the eight hardest for the final round.Taylor Pendrith of Canada was among 20 players who finished. He went out in 31 and played bogey-free for a 64 to post at 12-under 275. That was three shots behind Rose, but worth sticking around to see how it unfolded.Rodgers did his share of heavy lifting. Silverman, coming off a Korn Ferry Tour win, finished at 1-over 216 and missed the cut. Rodgers, playing off a 10 handicap, said he had not played golf since training camp until last Monday.They finished at 26-under par.Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Keith Mitchell were four behind. Minus the weather, the leading 25 pro-am teams would have played Sunday afternoon.“Josh Allen was telling me there's going to be an asterisk by this win because there was only three rounds,” Rodgers said. “But I think our names are going to be up there for a long time.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/2/6,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801275,"Banchero, Magic win as Hornets struggle from foul line","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Paolo Banchero had 22 points and 10 rebounds, Wendell Carter Jr. added 20 points and 12 rebounds and the Orlando Magic took advantage of Charlotte's poor foul shooting to beat the Hornets 119-113 Sunday.

            The Hornets made just one of nine free throws in the fourth quarter while Orlando was going 13 of 15. Charlotte finished 11 of 23 from the line in its fourth straight loss — Orlando wound up 27 of 30 on foul shots.

            “You’re going to lose doing that,” Hornets guard LaMelo Ball said. “It’s very frustrating.”











            Markelle Fultz had 16 points and Frank Wagner chipped in with 14 for the Magic, who improved to 9-19 on the road. Orlando (22-32) finished its road trip with a 3-1 record.

            “It shows our resilience and that we can go out and compete with some of the best teams in the league,” Carter said of the road trip, which included wins at Philadelphia and Minnesota.

            The Magic overcame a terrific second half by Ball, who had 26 of his 33 points after the break and finished with six 3-pointers. Terry Rozier had 24 points for the Hornets, 21 of those in the first half. 

            Charlotte trailed by five after three quarters, but Ball knocked down back-to-back 3s in the first 33 seconds of the fourth period for a 91-90 lead.

            The Hornets' momentum didn't last long as the Magic built a 110-103 lead behind Fultz, who scored on short jumpers and finished 8 of 13 from the field. Charlotte squandered chance after chance with Plumlee missing four straight free throws and a layup during that span, allowing the Magic to begin pulling away.

            Wagner helped seal the win with a step-through in the lane for a layup to put the Magic up 115-107 with 35 seconds left.

            Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley liked how his team stepped up its defense after Ball hit the two 3s to open the fourth quarter. From that point on, the Magic outscored the Hornets 29-22 and limited Charlotte to 10 of 23 from shooting from the floor and allowed just one make from beyond the arc.

            “Our guys did a really good job communicating, covering for one another and just competing,” Mosley said. ""It’s the last game of a long road trip, and think that’s a great way to end it.”

            Added Carter: “I think we locked into our game plan when it mattered and got stops when we needed them.""

            TRADE RUMORS

            With the Hornets among the worst teams in the NBA record-wise and their playoff hopes fading fast, trade rumors continue to swirl around Rozier and Plumlee, two potential movable veterans that could allow them to pick up assets.

            Rozier said after the game Charlotte players have talked among themselves on what might be coming, but said he isn't allowing it to become a distraction.

            “My name has been in rumors my whole career so I will let the people upstairs do their job and I will do mine,” Rozier said.

            Coach Steve Clifford praised Rozier for his continued effort despite what has become a forgettable season for Charlotte.

            “He was the one, I felt like, he was determined,” Clifford said. “He is every night. He plays which such effort and toughness. He’s the one for me that fought like, ‘We’re all tired, we’ve all been playing a lot, let’s find a way to win.’ We need more of that.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801276,"Amid crisis, Haitians find solace in an unlikely place: soup","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — For Wilfred Cadet, buying soup on Sunday is the equivalent of going to church.

            Seated on plastic chairs next to a street food stand tucked in an alleyway, the 47-year-old Haitian slurps orange-colored soup out of a metal bowl next to his 9-year-old son.

            Haitians mill past them cradling larger plastic containers, each eager to get a giant spoonful of the stew boiling in two human-sized pots behind them.











            Made of pumpkin, beef, carrots, cabbage – ingredients produced on the island – soup joumou is a cultural staple in Haiti.

            And in a moment of deepening crisis in the Caribbean nation, it’s one of the few points of enduring national pride.

            To this day, when you mention the soup, Haitians are quick to crack a smile.

            “It’s our tradition, our culture. It makes people proud. No matter what happens (in Haiti), the soup is going to stay around,” said Cadet.

            During the colonial period, slaves were banned from eating the spicy dish, and would have to prepare it for French slave owners.

            But Haitians claimed soup joumou as their own in 1804 when they staged one of the biggest and most successful slave rebellions in the Western Hemisphere.

            The uprising put an end to slavery in Haiti far before much of the region, and the dish gained the nickname “independence soup.”

            In 2021 – the same year the country spiraled into chaos following the assassination of its president – the soup was added to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage List, the first cuisine Haiti has on the list.

            “It is a celebratory dish, deeply rooted in Haitian identity, and its preparation promotes social cohesion and belonging among communities,” reads the UNESCO entry.

            It’s traditionally eaten on Sunday mornings, and on Haitian Independence Day in early January.

            That’s when customers begin filing through a pair of black metal gates into 50-year-old Marie France Damas’ makeshift restaurant at 7:30 a.m.

            Tucked behind rows of parked cars, a brick wall with a painted sign reading “Every Sunday: Soup Joumou” and a pile of local pumpkins, Damas labors away over her two big pots just like she has for the past 18 years.

            Her husband weaves between plastic tables taking orders while her daughter chops vegetables behind her. It’s a family affair, but Damas is clear.

            “I’m the boss of the soup,” she said with a grin.

            The business has allowed her to put her children through school and give a good life to her family in a place with some of the highest poverty and unemployment rates in the region.

            To each Haitian, the cuisine means something different.

            For Cadet and his son, it represents one moment of an escape from the day-to-day pandemonium of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince.

            It has also allowed Cadet to pass on a cherished part of Haitian culture at a time when they’re slowly fading away. Celebrations like Carnival that once took center stage on the island have withered due to deep gang violence tearing apart the nation.

            “The violence in the country is making everyone leave, and over time, we’re going to lose a lot of cultural traditions,” Cadet said. “My son, of course, (will go). Right now he doesn’t like Haiti.”

            He hopes that when his son goes, he’ll remember their Sunday mornings together.

            To others, like 35-year-old Maxon Sucan, it’s a way to reconnect with family and home in the countryside.

            He grew up in a rural town in western Haiti in a farming family cultivating the very vegetables used to make the soup.

            He came to Port-au-Prince 13 years ago to support his family, and works as a manager at a nightclub.

            He would once visit his family six to eight times a year, but because of kidnappings and gang control of the countryside, he’s now unable to go home.

            So Sunday mornings, he drinks the soup just like he once did as a kid, and he thinks about his daughter who he sometimes goes weeks without speaking to.

            “She’s three years old and it hurts me that I can’t see her,” Sucan said. “(When I eat soup joumou) I remember my family.”

            As he gets ready to leave the restaurant alone, cradling a large Tupperware filled with steaming soup, he pauses.

            “When I go home today, I’ll call her. And when I do, I’ll ask if she ate the soup,” he adds.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801282,Reese's double-double helps No. 3 LSU beat Texas A&M 72-66,"COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — As the wins have piled up and No. 3 LSU has remained perfect, coach Kim Mulkey has seen teams attacking the Tigers differently than they did earlier in the season. 

            That observation led the veteran coach to remind her team that it will have a target on its back in every game from here on out.

            “I just tell them you are becoming relevant in women’s basketball,” Mulkey said. “It’s out there that you’re undefeated and you’re going to have to learn how to be the aggressor. I think we’re learning that.”











            Angel Reese led the way for LSU again on Sunday with 26 points and 22 rebounds in a 72-66 win over Texas A&M.

            Alexis Morris added 22 points before fouling out late to help LSU (23-0, 11-0 Southeastern Conference) remain unbeaten ahead of next week’s showdown with top-ranked and undefeated South Carolina. It was Reese's 23rd consecutive double-double.

            The Tigers won their first eight SEC games by an average of 23 points, but needed overtime to beat Georgia 82-77 last week before Sunday’s close game with the Aggies. 

            Mulkey raved about the job Reese did to close out the win.

            “She’s just a talent,” Mulkey said. “She’s a talent that hates to lose. She has an unbelievable will to win.”

            Mulkey was impressed with how Reese fought through an A&M defense that was determined to slow her down.

            “I thought they defended her better today than they did at our place,” Mulkey said. “She’s just a competitor. She’s learning that she draws a lot of attention. She was guarded tough today.” 

            An 8-0 run by Texas A&M (6-15, 1-10), capped by six consecutive free throws, cut the lead to 66-62 with less than two minutes to go. Reese made two free throws before Kay Kay Green made 1 of 2 free throws on the other end to leave LSU up 68-63 with less than a minute left. 

            Last-Tear Poa added two free throws for the Tigers to push it to 70-63 seconds later. LSU forced a turnover and Reese added a basket to make it 72-63 with 17 seconds left.

            Sahara Jones scored 14 points for the Aggies, who lost their third straight.

            Texas A&M coach Joni Taylor was encouraged by her team's performance Sunday after the Aggies lost 74-34 to LSU earlier this season.

            “I just think we’re more settled in,” she said. “We’re a different team than when we played them at the beginning of January. I think we’re more confident, we have a better understanding of what we wanted to do.”

            Jones was asked how the Aggies were better Sunday than they were in the blowout in Baton Rouge.

            “Did you see the score?” she asked. “We didn’t get beat by 40. We did the best we could.""

            The Tigers led by 13 at halftime, and the Aggies refused to let them pull away in the fourth quarter.

            Tineya Hylton made a 3-pointer for A&M after a turnover by Reese to cut the lead to three points early in the fourth quarter. But Reese was fouled on the next two possessions and made three free throws to make it 52-45.

            Another 3 by the Aggies, this one from Jones, cut it to four again. But Ladazhia Williams made an off-balance layup to start a 6-2 spurt that pushed the lead to 58-50 with 5 1/2 minutes to go.

            Texas A&M used a 5-0 run to cut the lead to five. But Flau’jae Johnson grabbed a steal and finished with a jump shot as the first of six straight points by the Tigers to make it 66-55 with three minutes left.

            On Sunday a snow plow driver in East Tirol in Austria was recovered dead after being swept away. In Oetztal a 32-year-old Chinese skier died, while in Zillertal a 17-year old male from New Zealand was buried and in Kleinwalsertal a 55-year-old German man missing since Friday was found dead.

            More than a dozen avalanches were reported in the Tirol region of Austria alone and authorities had set the warning level at four on a scale of five and urged caution. 











            A 31-year-old German woman was killed Saturday in the South Tirol region of Italy when a snowmass broke loose at 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) near the Limo Pass some 80 kilometers (50 miles) east of Bolzano, the dpa news agency reported. Rescue efforts were complicated by 120-kilometer-per-hour (75-mile-per-hour) winds; her body was recovered from under 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) of snow. Another woman skiing with her was freed from the snow unharmed.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801285,Warriors say Curry sidelined with left leg injury,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Golden State All-Star guard Stephen Curry will be sidelined due to injuries to his left leg, the team said Sunday, and the Warriors aren't sure how many weeks he'll miss.

            Curry was diagnosed after an MRI with partial tears to his superior tibiofibular ligament and interosseous membrane in his left leg and also has a lower-leg contusion. But Warriors coach Steve Kerr stressed Sunday that the news could have been far worse.

            “I didn’t know those ligaments existed,” Kerr said. “I think the main thing is he’s going to be out for a little bit. We’re going to reevaluate in a few days. And the good news is, he’s going to be back. We don’t exactly know when but it’s not an injury that’s going to keep him out for the season. He’s going to come back this season and hopefully sooner rather than later.”











            Curry left Saturday’s game against Dallas with 2:01 left in the third quarter, after his wrapped left leg — which he originally hurt Thursday in a matchup against Denver — appeared to buckle as he played defense.

            He immediately began hopping in obvious discomfort, then left the game and didn’t return.

            Curry, who is averaging 29.4 points per game this season, won’t play Monday against Oklahoma City. And with the All-Star Game two weeks away, it now seems very possible that Curry might not be there.

            If Curry — or any of the other 24 players selected to the NBA All-Star Game — cannot participate in the Feb. 19 contest, Commissioner Adam Silver will select a replacement. Starters were chosen by a formula that included voting from fans, media and NBA players. Reserves were picked by NBA coaches.

            Curry already has had one extended absence of the season, missing 11 games from Dec. 16 through Jan. 7 with a shoulder injury. The Warriors went 6-5 in those games, and has five games left before the All-Star break.

            “We just got through a stretch without him ... and held our own,” Kerr said. “We know we can hold our own now. We went through this last year when he missed I think the final 10 games of the season or so and obviously went on a great run in the playoffs. We have some experience with this and we’re confident that we can keep things going and be where we want to be by the end of the year.”

            The Warriors, like many teams in the Western Conference, have very little room for error in the playoff chase. Golden State is 27-26 and entered Sunday seventh in the West — three games back of third-place Sacramento but only one game ahead of 11th-place Portland.

            The top six teams in each conference are assured playoff spots. The teams that finish between seventh and 10th will go to a play-in tournament to decide the No. 7 and No. 8 seeds in each of the conference brackets.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801287,Ride at Iowa amusement park where boy died will never reopen,"ALTOONA, Iowa (AP) — The ride at an Iowa amusement park where an 11-year-old boy was killed in 2021 will never reopen, the park's owners said.

            Bill Lentz, Adventureland's general manager, said in a letter posted on the park's website Friday that after spending months reviewing the safety of the Raging River ride, officials decided to close it permanently.

            ""The decision comes after months of examination of the ride, working closely with its manufacturer to identify what enhancements each would need to meet our operating standards,” Lentz said in the statement. “Based upon that review, the best path forward is to close Raging River, and focus on enhancing the Adventureland experience elsewhere.”











            Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured on July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. The ride uses a conveyor belt to move large circular rafts through rapids.

            The park was sold to Palace Entertainment in the wake of the boy's death and Lentz took over as general manager in 2022. Palace Entertainment is the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos.

            The Jaramillo family filed a lawsuit against Adventureland and its former owners in June 2022, and a separate claim against the state of Iowa in September 2022. That lawsuit is tentatively set for trial next spring. The former owners have maintained that the ride was safe.

            State officials cited the park in November 2021 for 17 safety violations related to Jaramillo's death. The Des Moines Register reports that the violations included using Flex Seal instead of approved patches to fix leaks in rafts’ flotation bladders, which keep the ride afloat, and not adequately documenting or testing repairs.

            In 2016, seasonal employee Steve Booher, 68, was killed after he fell when the ride began moving unexpectedly. He became wedged between a boat and a concrete sidewall, and his head was repeatedly rammed. He died days later.ALTOONA, Iowa (AP) — The ride at an Iowa amusement park where an 11-year-old boy was killed in 2021 will never reopen, the park's owners said.Bill Lentz, Adventureland's general manager, said in a letter posted on the park's website Friday that after spending months reviewing the safety of the Raging River ride, officials decided to close it permanently.""The decision comes after months of examination of the ride, working closely with its manufacturer to identify what enhancements each would need to meet our operating standards,” Lentz said in the statement. “Based upon that review, the best path forward is to close Raging River, and focus on enhancing the Adventureland experience elsewhere.”Michael Jaramillo died and his brother and father were injured on July 3, 2021, after their raft overturned and trapped them in the water. The ride uses a conveyor belt to move large circular rafts through rapids.The park was sold to Palace Entertainment in the wake of the boy's death and Lentz took over as general manager in 2022. Palace Entertainment is the U.S. subsidiary of Madrid-based Parques Reunidos.The Jaramillo family filed a lawsuit against Adventureland and its former owners in June 2022, and a separate claim against the state of Iowa in September 2022. That lawsuit is tentatively set for trial next spring. The former owners have maintained that the ride was safe.State officials cited the park in November 2021 for 17 safety violations related to Jaramillo's death. The Des Moines Register reports that the violations included using Flex Seal instead of approved patches to fix leaks in rafts’ flotation bladders, which keep the ride afloat, and not adequately documenting or testing repairs.In 2016, seasonal employee Steve Booher, 68, was killed after he fell when the ride began moving unexpectedly.

            “I'm was excited to be part of the rivalry after not being a part my first two years,” said Parrish, a 2020 Indiana Miss Basketball who transferred to join the Hoosiers after two seasons at Oregon. “It was a little more personal as I am the only player from Indiana on the team. I had to step up and be that person on our team to show who the best team in Indiana is.”

            Parrish and Mackenzie Holmes each scored 15 points and No. 4 Indiana won its 10th straight game, pulling away from Purdue 69-46 Sunday in front of a record Boilermakers crowd.











            The announced attendance of 14,876 was the largest for a Purdue women's home game. It marked the first sellout for a women's matchup at Mackey Arena since 2000 and third in program history.

            Hoosiers coach Teri Moren said her team did a good job keeping its cool in a raucous environment.

            “I don't think it affected us from an emotional standpoint,"" Moren said. “That's what happens when you have a veteran team.”

            Sara Scalia had 14 points and Chloe Moore-McNeil had 13 points and nine rebounds for the Hoosiers (22-1, 12-1 Big Ten).

            “Sara gave us great minutes off the bench, that was a shot in the arm for us,” Moren said. “Chloe hit some 3s but took opportunities to attack as well. Mackenzie knows the double team is coming and she continues to handle it in a mature type of way.""

            Holmes made 6 of 7 shots, including a 3-pointer. Moore-McNeil was 3 of 8 from 3-point range.

            Ahead 31-26 at halftime, Indiana outscored Purdue 19-2 in the third quarter. The Boilermakers missed their final 12 shots in the period and finally broke their scoreless streak on a layup by Jayla Smith in the first minute off the fourth quarter.

            “During halftime, we knew had to keep our foot on the gas and keep playing hard and our runs would come,” Parrish said.

            Purdue was 1 of 17 from the field in the third quarter.

            “We missed some open shots, but a lot of that has to go to Indiana's defensive pressure,” Purdue coach Katie Gearlds said. “It was a little different than it was in the first half. If we had hit some open shots in the first half it might have given us a little more confidence.""

            “There was a domino effect when they come out and scored on their first three or four possessions. It was a real tough quarter for us,” she said.

            Lasha Petree scored 13 points and Abbey Ellis had 10 to lead the Boilermakers (15-7, 6-6).

            Purdue used a 9-0 run for a 17-14 lead in the second quarter. The Hoosiers rebounded to take the lead at the break.

            “Give credit to Indiana, they are by far the best team in our league,” Gearlds said. ""They don’t beat themselves. They have all the weapons out there.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers have now won eight straight in the series and 11 of the last 12 dating to the 2017-18 season. The two teams will meet again in Bloomington on Feb. 19.

            Purdue: After road victories over then-No. 22 Illinois and then-No. 2 Ohio State, the Boilermakers struggled to score against Indiana. Purdue has the opportunity to get back on track for an NCAA berth with its next two games against Rutgers and Northwestern, two teams below .500.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801304,Islanders sign Horvat to 8-year deal after trading for him,"The New York Islanders have signed center Bo Horvat to an eight-year contract less than a week after acquiring him in a trade with the Vancouver Canucks.

            The team announced the contract Sunday, after their first practice following the All-Star break. Horvat’s deal is worth $68 million and carries a $8.5 million salary cap hit through the 2030-31 season.

            General manager Lou Lamoriello joked to reporters at practice on Long Island that Horvat's contract was “too long and it's too much money.”











            The Islanders sent forward Anthony Beauvillier, prospect Aatu Raty and a protected first-round pick to the Canucks for Horvat on Monday. He was set to be an unrestricted free agent after the season, and the trade was a result of Vancouver and Horvat's camp being unable to reach a deal last summer.

            Lamoriello and Horvat expressed confidence about getting a deal done after the trade. The 27-year-old has scored more than 30 goals for a second consecutive season.

            Horvat was chosen as an All-Star and played for the Pacific Division on Saturday despite the trade. He played with longtime Canucks teammate Elias Pettersson and combined on one last goal together before parting ways.

            “I want to get going,” Horvat said Saturday after the All-Star 3-on-3 tournament. “That’s enough. Let’s start playing some games and getting to know the guys. I just want to start playing hockey again.”

            Horvat was on vacation with his family in Orlando when he was traded. He said coach Lane Lambert wanted him to enjoy All-Star festivities before getting rolling with the Islanders, who play at the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday.

            “Obviously getting my legs under me is going to be No. 1 and getting systems down and obviously chemistry with the new linemates and stuff like that,” Horvat said.

            After facing the Flyers and Seattle, Horvat will play against his former team when Vancouver visits UBS Arena on Thursday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801310,Poland: Outcry over abortion law,"A scandal is raging in Polish politics and in the media, concering the shocking case of a 14-year-old rape victim. The girl, who is from the Podlaskie region in northeastern Poland and has mental disabilities, was raped by her own uncle and became pregnant as a result. She was unaware of her condition, but her aunt noticed it and tried to help her get an abortion.Although the girl had written confirmation from the public prosecutor that she was pregnant as the result of a crime, which gave her the right to a legal abortion, two hospitals in the region refused to carry out the procedure. The province of Podlaskie on the Belarusian border is a bastion of the right-wing conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS), which has been in power in Poland since 2015.""The doctors invoked the 'conscience clause' as justification for their refusal,"" the weekly magazine Polityka reported on Wednesday. Poland's restrictive abortion law allows doctors to refuse to carry out an abortion if it is against their religious beliefs. This was what happened in this case. The hospital brusquely turned the girl and her aunt away, telling them to ""get out of here."" ""We don't know where to go,"" they are said to have replied, only to be told: ""That's not our problem.""It's not that simple, though. According to the rules, a doctor who refuses to carry out an abortion must name another doctor who can take on the procedure. The conscience clause can only be invoked by individuals; it cannot apply to an entire hospital. Polityka says this was nonetheless ignored.As for so many women, their last resort was the FEDERA Foundation for Women and Family Planning, who came to their rescue. Time was of the essence: ""She was almost at 12 weeks. We had to act quickly,"" Krystyna Kacpura, FEDERA's executive director, explained in an interview with the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza on Wednesday. ""The termination was carried out successfully in Warsaw.""Kacpura refused to give journalists any further details about the girl. ""The family lives in a small community. She doesn't want to become the target of attacks,"" she explained. Instead, she called on the authorities to examine the situation in all hospitals in the region, and criticized the fact that the medical profession had become ""political."" ""Instead of caring for patients' health, doctors are hiding behind the conscience clause and the law,"" she said.Meanwhile, the Polish health minister Adam Niedzielski has also weighed in on the issue. ""We are appalled by this case; here our response is unequivocal,"" he told reporters earlier this week, and described the girl's struggle to get an abortion as ""unacceptable."" Niedzielski announced that there would be an investigation into case.Women's rights groups and the political opposition are once again clamoring for the relaxation of Poland's abortion law, which makes an abortion almost impossible to obtain.The ""conscience clause,"" which many doctors make use of to avoid potential prosecution, is ""barbaric and inhuman"" and must be abolished, said Katarzyna Kotula from the left-liberal party Wiosna. And the center-left politician Barbara Nowacka from the Civic Coalition (KO) announced in the Sejm (the Polish parliament) that the opposition would be tabling a bill to abolish the ""conscience clause.""In 2020, Poland's constitutional court declared it illegal to abort seriously malformed fetuses, paving the way for a strengthening of the already very restrictive abortion law. At present, termination is only legal if the pregnancy is the result of rape, or if the mother's life is in danger. In practice, even these exceptions are not always observed, with doctors claiming that their religious convictions prevent them from carrying out abortions. If they perform an illegal procedure, they face the possibility of up to three years in jail.After the strengthening of the abortion law, the number of official terminations dropped from 1,076 in 2020 to 107 the following year. FEDERA, however, claims that 150,000 procedures are performed each year outside the official system. ""No restrictive system can stop women from having abortions if they are determined to terminate the pregnancy,"" says FEDERA's director Krystyna Kacpura. ""The only question is whether they do so in safe or not-so-safe conditions.""According to information from the European Parliament on November 6, 2022, since the law was tightened, six women have died in Poland as a direct consequence of their pregnancies not being terminated.Yet hardliners from Poland's pro-life movement are still unsatisfied with the strict abortion law that is currently in place. Their leader, Kaja Godek, wants to ban all information about abortion options. A bill signed by 150,000 people proposes that producing and disseminating such information should be punishable by two years in prison. The title of the draft legislation: ""Abortion is murder.""This piece was originally published in German.",2023/2/5,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801311,Raphael Varane reminds football to remember the person,"Raphael Varane's retirement from international football was perhaps unsurprising. The 29-year-old defender is a World Cup winner and recently just played in perhaps the most spectacular World Cup final ever. Not long afterwards though, the Frenchman gave an interview in which he used a damning turn of phrase that reveals just how much of the person elite athletes feel they have to give up.""The very highest level is like a washing machine, you play all the time and you never stop,"" Varane told Canal Plus on February 4. ""We have overloaded schedules and play non-stop. Right now, I feel like I'm suffocating and that the player is gobbling up the man.""The choice of the word 'gobble' is particularly chilling. The word is defined as eating something quickly and often with a lot of noise. Applying that definition in the context of a person being swiftly removed in order for the player to operate is all the more striking.At this point, footballers' financial comfort is usually used as justification for this treatment and while there is no denying the money in certain leagues in modern football has reached unhealthy amounts, the absence of a truly holistic approach towards players, coaches and staff remains problematic.Last year, players' union FIFPRO delivered a report ahead of the World Cup in Qatar showing the players' workload going into the tournament. The French squad, in which Varane was included, had played the most minutes in international club competitions. At the time of announcing his retirement, Varane had played 2,136 minutes this season, including 76 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester United nine days after playing 112 minutes in the World Cup final.In 2021, Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was critical of UEFA saying players were being treated like ""robots"" and Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gündogan tweeted about the new Champions League reforms saying: ""More and more and more games, is no one thinking about us players?""The mental health of players has long been a major concern. Last year, a FIFPRO report showed the impact an overloaded schedule was having, with FIFPRO General Secretary Jonas Baer-Hoffmann telling DW categorically that: ""The volume of games today is putting too much pressure on the mental and physical well-being of national team players.""With this in mind, it is telling that football continues to be slow in adapting integrated holistic approaches.Australian coaching mentor Cody Royle, who has worked with the major sports leagues across the world, including the NBA and NHL and is currently working with the Premier League to mentor coaches, is not surprised by Varane's comments.Coaches have told Royle this was inevitable and was a reminder that coaches and staff also suffer in this environment. For Royle, Varane's loss of the person in pursuit of a better player is the ""dehumanization of human endeavor.""""In my world we talk about 'at what cost?'"" Royle told DW. ""So what Varane is telling us is that the cost is too high. He's made an assessment and the money, prestige and ability to represent his country is not worth more than his humanity, his family and his sense of being a human being.""Royle believes Varane's comments are also a sign that things are changing, albeit slowly.""Players are self-actualizing,"" Royle said. ""We've taught them about them things like mindfulness and identity and happiness and they do a lot of thinking and education about that so we shouldn't really be surprised when they have these realizations as they mature... They are trying to rehumanize themselves in an industry that has been dehumanized.""Other sports are leading the way when it comes to looking after the person alongside the player. The National Rugby League (NRL) in Australia, for example, has implemented a holistic approach across the league that includes the presence of two well-being managers at each of the 17 teams — one focused on career planning and the other on general physical and mental health. While far from perfect, the league has seen major improvements in well-being as well as performance on the field.""Players and coaching are breaking and stepping away,"" Royle said.""I think we need a beacon club or organization that shows there is a different way... We need them to be held up and say 'we did things differently and saw it as a competitive advantage, we looked at well-being and performance, we helped people, we rehumanized our environment so that people could thrive rather than sink and the resulting performance was great.'""Varane is certainly not the only player to voice his concern in this area, but his comments are the latest reminder that the cost of losing the person in exchange for a better player appears a price football is happy to pay. The evidence in other sports and from an increasing number of people working in the holistic space shows that another way is not only possible, but also necessary.As Royle said: ""The question for coaches and football directors, why not your club?""Edited by: Mark Hallam",2023/2/5,,

            Osborne made 7-of-15 shots, including 4-of-7 3-pointers, and was 5 of 5 from the free-throw line. She added five rebounds and four assists. Jones shot 5 for 8, made 4 of 6 3-pointers, and was perfect in five free-throw attempts for the third 20-point game of her freshman season.

            Gabriela Jaquez added 14 points off the bench for the Bruins (18-6, 7-5 Pac-12), who had a 42-6 advantage in bench scoring.











            Two free throws from Jones and a 3-pointer by Jaquez gave the Bruins a 52-40 lead with 2:44 remaining in the third period. ASU's Tyi Skinner hit a 3-pointer — her third of the period — in the final minute of the quarter to get the Sun Devils within 57-48 heading to the fourth.

            Jones scored the first five points of the fourth and Osborne scored another five soon after, putting the Bruins ahead 67-50 with 7:33 remaining. The lead reached 20 a couple of minutes later when Camryn Brown hit a jumper for a 71-51 advantage.

            The Sun Devils got within 15 points once in the final minutes — on a 3-pointer by Treasure Hunt with 2:40 remaining — but would get no closer.

            Skinner scored 28 points, Hunt 18 and Jaddan Simmons 10 for the Sun Devils (7-14, 0-12), who have lost 12 straight — the fifth-longest active streak in the nation. 

            A 3-pointer by Jones gave the Bruins their first lead, 13—11 with 1:48 remaining in the first quarter and the Bruins led 15-13 after one. UCLA held the lead throughout the second quarter but never by more than six. A 3-pointer by Jaquez gave the Bruins a 35-29 lead at halftime.

            UCLA hosts Oregon State on Friday and Arizona State hosts California, also on Friday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801317,Ladine scores 21 as Washington beats No. 2 Stanford 72-67,"SEATTLE (AP) — Elle Ladine and Washington turned a strong finish into a big victory.

            Ladine scored 21 points and Dalayah Daniels made two key free throws with 8 seconds left, helping Washington knock off No. 2 Stanford 72-67 on Sunday.

            Washington (13-9, 5-7 Pac-12) closed the game with a 9-2 run. Lauren Schwartz made two foul shots before Ladine put the Huskies in front with a layup with 1:40 left.











            “We always play like it’s 0-0, always,"" Daniels said. ""We’ve just got to keep on playing together, and I think this game, we emphasized defense. We knew that defense was going to lead to offense, and we’re not surprised at all because we put in the work. We knew if we kept putting in the work, eventually we were going to get what we deserve.”

            Daniels had 15 points in Washington’s first victory over a ranked opponent since a 74-68 win over UCLA on Feb. 23, 2020. Haley Van Dyke finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds.

            It was Washington's first win against Stanford since 2016, stopping an 11-game slide against the Cardinal. 

            “We try to be process focused,” second-year Huskies coach Tina Langley said. “Stanford is a great team, incredibly well-coached, really talented, so much respect for them. But also, I have so much respect for these young women, and excited for what we’re building. ... It’s going to be fun to see what we can become.”

            Haley Jones scored 18 points for Stanford (22-3, 10-2), and reserve Brooke Demetre had 15. Cameron Brink finished with 14 points and six rebounds.

            “Our first quarter was pretty good, and then our second quarter was just abysmal. Our defense, we really didn’t do a whole lot right,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “We didn’t play well offensively, we didn’t play well defensively, and we didn’t rebound. So that’s pretty hard to win games when you’re really not getting it done in any of those three things."" 

            The Cardinal led 17-8 after one quarter, but the Huskies rallied in the second.

            Washington closed the first half with a 10-0 run. Ladine kicked off the spurt with a 3-pointer with 2:03 left. Schwartz made a 3 and Daniels converted a layup at the buzzer, giving the Huskies a 38-34 lead at the break.

            Washington also scored the first six points in the third quarter. But Brink’s layup started a 9-0 run for Stanford. Brink’s three-point play in the final seconds gave the Cardinal a 54-53 lead heading into the fourth.

            But Washington outscored Stanford 19-13 in the fourth.

            “We were just kind of in the moment,” Van Dyke said. “Focusing on next play, next play, next play. I don’t think we ever really expected that we were going to just come away with the win. I think we really earned it.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Stanford: The Cardinal was outscored by the Huskies 64-50 in the final three quarters. 

            Washington: Enjoyed a 34-24 rebounding advantage. The Huskies have outrebounded each of their past seven opponents.

            UP NEXT

            Stanford: At Arizona on Thursday night.

Lauren Schwartz made two foul shots before Ladine put the Huskies in front with a layup with 1:40 left.“We always play like it’s 0-0, always,"" Daniels said. ""We’ve just got to keep on playing together, and I think this game, we emphasized defense. We knew that defense was going to lead to offense, and we’re not surprised at all because we put in the work. We knew if we kept putting in the work, eventually we were going to get what we deserve.”Daniels had 15 points in Washington’s first victory over a ranked opponent since a 74-68 win over UCLA on Feb. 23, 2020. Haley Van Dyke finished with 14 points and 10 rebounds.It was Washington's first win against Stanford since 2016, stopping an 11-game slide against the Cardinal.“We try to be process focused,” second-year Huskies coach Tina Langley said. “Stanford is a great team, incredibly well-coached, really talented, so much respect for them. But also, I have so much respect for these young women, and excited for what we’re building. ... It’s going to be fun to see what we can become.”Haley Jones scored 18 points for Stanford (22-3, 10-2), and reserve Brooke Demetre had 15. Cameron Brink finished with 14 points and six rebounds.“Our first quarter was pretty good, and then our second quarter was just abysmal. Our defense, we really didn’t do a whole lot right,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “We didn’t play well offensively, we didn’t play well defensively, and we didn’t rebound. So that’s pretty hard to win games when you’re really not getting it done in any of those three things.""The Cardinal led 17-8 after one quarter, but the Huskies rallied in the second.Washington closed the first half with a 10-0 run. Ladine kicked off the spurt with a 3-pointer with 2:03 left. Schwartz made a 3 and Daniels converted a layup at the buzzer, giving the Huskies a 38-34 lead at the break.Washington also scored the first six points in the third quarter. But Brink’s layup started a 9-0 run for Stanford. Brink’s three-point play in the final seconds gave the Cardinal a 54-53 lead heading into the fourth.But Washington outscored Stanford 19-13 in the fourth.“We were just kind of in the moment,” Van Dyke said. “Focusing on next play, next play, next play. I don’t think we ever really expected that we were going to just come away with the win. I think we really earned it.”BIG PICTUREStanford: The Cardinal was outscored by the Huskies 64-50 in the final three quarters.Washington: Enjoyed a 34-24 rebounding advantage.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801318,Panthers hire Evero as  new defensive coordinator,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers have agreed to terms with Ejiro Evero on Sunday to be their new defensive coordinator.

            The 42-year-old Evero was the Denver Broncos defensive coordinator last season and was one of nine candidates to interview for the Panthers head coaching position before owner David Tepper hired Frank Reich.

            The Broncos ranked seventh in the league in total defense in 2022 under Evero and were 14th in points allowed. Evero previously worked as the Broncos secondary coach before being promoted to coordinator.











            He has also experience coaching with the Los Angeles Rams, Green Bay Packers, San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

            Steve Wilks was Carolina’s defensive coordinator to start the 2022 season, but was later promoted to interim head coach after Matt Rhule was fired. Al Holcomb took over as interim defensive coordinator and remained in that role for the rest of the season.

            Carolina’s defense, led by defensive end Brian Burns and safety Jeremy Chinn, finished 22nd in the league last season in yards allowed per game and allowed the 19th-most points in the league, but the defense is generally considered the strength of a team that finished 7-10.

            Evero has ties to Carolina.

            Dom Capers, who served as Carolina's first head coach, was a senior defensive assistant on Evero’s staff last season in Denver. Evero also spent four years on the 49ers staff under Vic Fangio, the Panthers defensive coordinator from 1995-98 under Capers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801324,Miller scores 29 as No. 8 Terps rout No. 10 Ohio State 90-54,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Diamond Miller and her Maryland teammates took out their frustrations on Ohio State.

            Miller scored 16 of her 29 points in the third quarter, and the eighth-ranked Terrapins routed the 10th-ranked Buckeyes 90-54 on Sunday in the program's most lopsided win over a top-10 opponent. Maryland rebounded emphatically from its loss to No. 6 Iowa on Thursday night, and Miller had quite a response to what she thought was some physical play by Ohio State.

            “I was definitely pissed off. They were playing dirty,” Miller said. “Not really dirty I guess, because people call me a dirty player, but they were very aggressive towards me, and I guess I just showed them what real aggression is.”











            Abby Meyers added 22 points and Shyanne Sellers contributed 19 points and nine assists for the Terrapins. Taylor Thierry scored 21 for Ohio State. The Buckeyes (20-4, 9-4 Big Ten) have dropped four of five since starting the season 19-0.

            Maryland (19-5, 10-3) took control by scoring the final 12 points of the first quarter to lead 19-7. Meyers had 11 points in the opening quarter, and after the Terps entered halftime up 42-30, Miller took over.

            The Buckeyes couldn't keep the 6-foot-3 guard away from the hoop. Miller's 3-point play made it 52-37, and after another layup, she connected from 3-point range to put the Terps up by 17.

            Another 3-point play by Miller made the score 64-44. It was 69-44 at the end of the third quarter, and then Maryland dominated the fourth as well, as Ohio State suffered its most lopsided defeat since losing 100-56 to UConn on Nov. 16, 2015.

            “They played a great game and we were really bad,” Buckeyes coach Kevin McGuff said. “They coached better and played better. Everything was better about them today.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Ohio State: The Buckeyes better hope this is rock bottom. Although Maryland is a strong team, it’s almost inconceivable that Ohio State could be beat this badly after the Buckeyes were sporting an undefeated record less than two weeks earlier.

            Maryland: The Terps beat No. 7 Penn State by 27 points in 1991, but they easily shattered that record Sunday with a 36-point win. Miller showed why she's one of the nation's top players, and Maryland was unrelenting on defense, forcing 24 turnovers.

            “I absolutely believe that we made a statement,” Sellers said. “If people don't believe it, then they're going to have to find out for themselves very soon.”

            AROUND THE BASKET

            Maryland outscored Ohio State 48-28 in the paint despite the presence of Rebeka Mikulasikova, the Buckeyes' 6-foot-4 forward. The makeup of Maryland's roster meant she had to defend players who can operate on the perimeter, and the lane was clear enough for the Terps.

            Mikulasikova scored two points and played only 17:36.

            “I thought we did a terrific job with her at both ends of the floor,"" Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. “Defensively we were there on the catches, especially the way she shoots it. We knew the scout, and yeah, making her have to guard.”

            Cotie McMahon, Ohio State's other starting forward, fouled out with six points, and Thierry fouled out as well.

            RETURN

            Ohio State guard Jacy Sheldon was back from an injury-related absence and scored five points in 25:16. It was her first game since Nov. 30.

            “It felt good,” Sheldon said. “It was fun. Obviously, you don't play for that long, you're eager to get out there. But ... we could have played a lot better tonight, could have had a lot more energy.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801326,"Reese scores 33, No. 22 Arizona tops USC 81-75 in 2OT","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Cate Reese scored a career-high 33 points, including four clinching free throws in the last 7.5 seconds of the second overtime, to give No. 22 Arizona an 81-75 win over USC on Sunday.

            Shay Pellington and Jade Loville both had 17 points for the Wildcats (18-5, 8-4 Pac-12 Conference), who picked up a critical sweep in Los Angeles after beating No. 14 UCLA 71-66 in overtime on Friday.

            Helena Pueyo had her only two points from the foul line with 15 seconds to go for a 77-73 Arizona lead, the first time it became a two possession game in the second overtime.











            The Wildcats had a four-point lead midway through the first overtime but the Trojans scored six straight before Maya Nnaji tied it at 68 with 5.2 seconds left.

            Arizona had a five-point lead in regulation with just over two minutes to go but Rokia Doumbia hit a 3-pointer and a layup to tie it and Destiny Littleton made a pair of free throws after an offensive rebound to put USC up 58-56 with 43 seconds to go. 

            Loville quickly answered. The Trojans missed a shot with six seconds to go but Arizona couldn't get off a final shot.

            Littleton had 21 points for the Trojans (17-6, 7-5), playing all 50 minutes, as did Kadi Sissoko, who scored 15 points. Rayah Marshall had 17 points, 20 rebounds and six blocks in 48 minutes. Doumbia, a senior transfer from Purdue, had a career-high 17 in 28 minutes off the bench before fouling out in the first OT.

            USC went 4 of 13 from the field and 9 of 10 from the foul line in the two overtimes. Arizona was 7 of 15 with three 3s and made 6 of 8 free throws.

            Reese, who only had eight points at halftime, and Pellington, who had four, played 49 minutes. 

            Arizona is home on Friday against No. 2 Stanford, which will drop after losing 72-67 at Washington Sunday when USC goes to Oregon.

Bond markets took a beating on Friday following stunning reports on jobs and services, catching speculators very short of dollars and sending the currency sharply higher.
The dollar extended its rally on the yen to a three-week top of 132.60 on Monday amid reports the Japanese government had offered the job of central bank governor to the current deputy, Masayoshi Amamiya.
Amamiya has been closely involved with the Bank of Japan's current super-easy policies and is considered by markets to be more dovish than some other contenders. read more
The early gains were later pared to 131.94 yen but still helped the dollar hold firm on a basket of currencies at 103.090 , having jumped 1.2% on Friday. The euro was huddled at $1.0791 after shedding 1.1% on Friday.
In equity markets, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.7%, with South Korea (.KS11) down 1.0%.
Japan's Nikkei (.N225) added 1.1%, encouraged by hopes the BOJ would keep policy easy.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801343,"Chiefs, Eagles land in Phoenix, prepare for Super Bowl 57","PHOENIX (AP) — A few minutes after the Kansas City Chiefs and quarterback Patrick Mahomes landed in Phoenix, the pilot hung a “Chiefs Kingdom” flag out of the window as players, coaches and staff got off the plane and walked across the runway.

            About an hour later, it was the Philadelphia Eagles who arrived in Arizona, with an “It's a Philly Thing” flag fluttering in the runway as quarterback Jalen Hurts, coach Nick Sirianni and others made their way to a fleet of buses.

            Super Bowl 57 is just one week away. 











            The Chiefs will face the Eagles on Feb. 12 in Glendale, Arizona. 

            Both teams landed at Goldwater Air National Guard Base in ideal Phoenix winter weather — bright sunshine and temperatures in the low 70s. Team personnel occasionally stopped to take pictures and videos on the runway.

            Former Chiefs star Christian Okoye was on hand to pass out hats to Kansas City's players as they got off the plane. The former star running back lives in Southern California and made the short trip to Phoenix.

            “They called me and wanted me to come over here and welcome the team,” Okoye said. “So I said ‘Yes, of course' — my team's over here getting ready to win the Super Bowl.”

            Oddsmakers are expecting a good game, though they disagree with Okoye and are giving the Eagles a slight edge. Philadelphia opened as a 1 1/2-point favorite, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.

            The Chiefs advanced to their third Super Bowl in four seasons when Harrison Butker made a 45-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to push Kansas City past the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in the AFC championship game last weekend.

            The Eagles routed the San Francisco 49ers 31-7 in the NFC title game. They’ve looked dominant in the playoffs so far, also beating the New York Giants 38-7 in the divisional round.

            Philadelphia is back in the Super Bowl five years after beating the New England Patriots 41-33.

            Now a mostly new generation of Eagles — led by Hurts and Sirianni — will come to Arizona to try and win another title.

            The teams will both take part in the “Super Bowl LVII Opening Night” on Monday in downtown Phoenix, where all the players and coaches from both teams are available for the annual media extravaganza.

            Then it's down to business. The Chiefs will practice throughout the week at Arizona State's football facilities while the Eagles will do their preparation at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility. 

            There are no shortage of storylines: Kansas City coach Andy Reid goes against his former team — which he led to Super Bowl 39 — in a game that’s also the first matchup of Black starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl with Mahomes and Hurts. 

            There’s also a brother-against-brother showdown between Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Philadelphia center Jason Kelce.

They’ve looked dominant in the playoffs so far, also beating the New York Giants 38-7 in the divisional round.Philadelphia is back in the Super Bowl five years after beating the New England Patriots 41-33.Now a mostly new generation of Eagles — led by Hurts and Sirianni — will come to Arizona to try and win another title.The teams will both take part in the “Super Bowl LVII Opening Night” on Monday in downtown Phoenix, where all the players and coaches from both teams are available for the annual media extravaganza.Then it's down to business. The Chiefs will practice throughout the week at Arizona State's football facilities while the Eagles will do their preparation at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility.There are no shortage of storylines: Kansas City coach Andy Reid goes against his former team — which he led to Super Bowl 39 — in a game that’s also the first matchup of Black starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl with Mahomes and Hurts.There’s also a brother-against-brother showdown between Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Philadelphia center Jason Kelce.___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/2/6,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801344,"Jokic, 3 other starters out for Nuggets at Timberwolves","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic has been ruled out for Sunday night's game at Minnesota because of left hamstring tightness. 

            Jamal Murray, Aaron Gordon and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope also rested injuries after playing in Saturday night's 128-108 victory over Atlanta at home. Gordon has a left ankle sprain, Caldwell-Pope has a right ankle sprain and Murray is dealing with a left knee issue.

            Jokic, Murray, Gordon and Caldwell-Pope did not make the trip to Minnesota. The tip-off time between the back-to-back games was just 22 hours, attracting the attention of Denver coach Mike Malone.











            Malone called the situation “ridiculous.”

            “The one thing that is really perplexing in this individual scenario is it's the second night of a back-to-back we're playing 22 hours after tip-off last night,"" Malone said. ""When I told our players that, a veteran like Jeff Green looked at me like I was crazy. He said, ‘That’s not allowed. That's not legal.' And, obviously, it is.""

            Murray played more than 36 minutes in the win over the Hawks, finishing with 41 points. Jokic, who missed four games in January but had played in four in a row, played more than 34 minutes. He finished with 14 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists.

            Bruce Brown, Christian Braun, Michael Porter Jr., Vlatko Cancar and DeAndre Jordan were in the starting lineup against the Timberwolves. The teams play in Denver on Tuesday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801345,"Grammys fashion: Lizzo, Doja Cat, Styles wow on red carpet","NEW YORK (AP) — Lizzo wowed in a bright orange Dolce & Gabbana opera coat adorned with flowers and a huge hood as the wild and wacky Grammys red carpet did not disappoint Sunday. Tattered streetwear, T-shirts and denim mixed with blinged-out couture, wild patterns and plenty of skin.

            Lizzo walked gingerly as she navigated her heavy coat with a long train. After awhile, she dropped the coat to her shoulders to reveal a busty sequin corset gown underneath in a softer orange. The coat was entirely embroidered with handmade silk flowers, and the gown was silk with crystal mesh Swarovski details. She accessorized with crystal embellished heels and sheer fingerless gloves.

            “Lizzo is a floral garden fantasy in her ruffle orange 3D robe and matching corset dress underneath,” said Holly Katz, a stylist and host of the Fashion Crimes podcast. “And we love to hear her roar!”











            Taylor Swift, channeling her Midnights era, wore a long two-piece sparkly skirt with a high-neck, long-sleeve crop top, all by Roberto Cavalli. They were, yes, midnight blue. She added statement diamond earrings by Lorraine Schwartz, her hair in an updo.

            Fashion lover Harry Styles walked the carpet in a rainbow harlequin pattern jumpsuit adorned with Swarovski crystals. He was shirtless underneath. His low-cut, multicolored Egonlab look drew cheers. Egonlab is a young brand out of Paris.

            “The man seems like he’s having an enormous amount of fun with fashion, and even if that doesn’t mean wearing harlequin overalls for most of us, the end result — the sheer joy of it — is something we should all aim for,” said Esquire's style director, Jonathan Evans.

            Cardi B., meanwhile, wore a bombshell, sculptural electric blue gown with huge shoulders and a headpiece over one eye.

            “I'm trying, I'm trying,” she told photographers as she carefully walked down the carpet.

            Cardi's look was from Gaurav Gupta’s latest collection, ""continuing to prove she intrinsically understands the delicate style dynamics of the Grammys carpet. It’s not about being silly, but rather making a statement,” said Bianca Betancourt, digital culture editor for Harper’s Bazaar. 

            To present the award for best rap album, Cardi donned a silver metallic assemblage from the archive of Paco Rabanne. Rabanne died Friday in France at age 88. The top and skirt were done by Julien Dossena in 2021. The matching hood that covered her eyes dates to 2020. 

            Anitta also made a splash in black Versace from 2003. 

            “She went toward a more gothic aesthetic,” Betancourt said. “The flowing gown was sublimely tailored and showed the global star doing red carpet elegance in her own way. It was still sexy, still youthful, but still elevated. It didn’t look obviously vintage, which is a testament to Donatella’s artistry.”

            Machine Gun Kelly, who often pushes into edgy fashion, was in a silver double-breasted laminated foil suit with a Swarovski crystal harness. It was custom Dolce & Gabbana. He was accompanied by Megan Fox in creamy Zuhair Murad. Her gown had a corset bodice and heart embroidered applique. 

            Sam Smith was in fire engine red. They were accompanied by Kim Petras, and drag queens Violet Chachki and Gottmik in the same color. Smith wore a top hat with a veil. They, too, wore matching gloves, a trend of the night.

            Monochrome was a major theme, Betancourt said. 

            “It's a great way to experiment with more avant-garde looks while still maintaining a sense of stylistic structure,” she said. “Lizzo and Kacey Musgraves also opted for monochrome and textured looks from Dolce & Gabbana and Valentino.”

            The marathon carpet kicked off with some notable looks. Doja Cat, always pushing her fashion envelope, showed up in a vinyl, one-shoulder and skintight black gown with long matching gloves from Atelier Versace. Bebe Rexha sizzled in hot pink with twists from head to toe and a va-va-voom halter bodice, proving that Barbiecore is going strong. The look was Moschino by Jeremy Scott. 

            Musgraves, in Valentino, also took the Barbie note with a feathery cape in a lighter pink hue over a catsuit. 

            There were golden crowns (Matt B), glittery mouth bling (Alligator Jesus) and epic tattoos (Alisha Gaddis). And lots of slouchy and roomy looks that spoke to many of the men, as did an embroidered denim shorts ensemble for Benny Blanco.

            “While there weren’t any giant, unmissable, overwhelmingly popular red-carpet trends on the men’s fashion front, that actually proved to be a positive this year. It gave the smaller trends a little bit more room to shine,” Evans said. 

            His most compelling? The double-breasted suit, or jacket.

            “It’s not just a 2023 thing, of course, but the popularity of the DB tends to ebb and flow, and it seems like this year could be a very good one for the silhouette. LL Cool J, Jack Harlow, Saint JHN and Scott Evans all wore a version of it. They all looked fantastic, and the really great thing is that men in all walks of life can emulate their outfits and look equally fantastic,” he said. 

            Evans also had thoughts on all that denim.

            “Miguel was decked out in it. Benny Blanco, too. The looks were seemingly made with the word ‘divisive’ in mind, but they smacked of a sort of youth-culture cool that embraces that word instead of shying away from it. Love ‘em or hate ’em, those outfits seem like a bellwether of a more denim-forward world in the near future, so take note,” he said.

            But back to Doja Cat's vinyl.

            “Who can’t stop talking about Doja Cat donning 30,000 red Swarovski crystals for Paris Fashion Week? Well, she certainly doesn’t disappoint at the Grammys as she totally channeled the queen of darkness,"" Katz said. “The Mia Farrow 60′s haircut was a perfect match for this look.”

            Betancourt was also a Doja fan.

            “The look was gritty, sexy and much like Doja herself, forward-thinking. Her makeup also deserves a notable mention. It was an exquisite cat eye (pun intended) by Ernesto Casillas with a juicy metallic glossed lip that echoed the early aughts, but done without the kitsch most 2000s-inspired looks often perpetuate,"" she said. 

            Viola Davis, meanwhile, completed her EGOT by winning a Grammy at the Grammys pre-telecast ceremony in a Naeem Kahn red, silver and blue tiered sequin short-sleeved gown. 

            Shania Twain isn’t up for a Grammy. That, she said, freed her to have fun with fashion. Twain’s hair was red and her Harris Reed wide-belled pantsuit was adorned with huge black polka dots against white. She topped it off with a towering, matching wide-brim hat.

            “Here I am with all my new fun things to wear,” she said. Reed is a young British American designer she wanted to support. Her goal: “I just wanted to add some pop and cheer.”

            Twain, said Katz, “definitely scored in the avant-garde category but does sort of look like she just stepped out of Alice in Wonderland.” 

            Laverne Cox WAS “Wakanda Forever” in her custom strapless leather Kim Kassas embellished warrior figure dress and African-inspired jewelry, Katz said. “Paying homage to the African culture through fashion is always in style.”

            Cox’s leather dress by Kim Kassas honors the vision of the late fashion editor Andre Leon Talley. There was another vibe on her mind: “Egyptian/Cleopatra.”

            Prabal Gurung whipped up a custom sunny yellow chiffon look for Kelsea Ballerini with light-as-air back pieces she unfurled on the carpet. Amanda Gorman was in a top color of the night: black. Gorman, wearing Prada, twirled her long, sheer overlay worn over a mini-dress on the red carpet. 

            Ballerini's look, Katz said, was “so ethereal and dreamy on the red carpet.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801346,Kirk Cousins rallies NFC to 35-33 win over AFC in Pro Bowl,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — For Kirk Cousins, it wasn't quite the NFL-record 33-point comeback against the Indianapolis Colts to win the NFC North.

            However, Cousins was the quarterback for the third and final flag football game at the Pro Bowl on Sunday for a reason.

            NFC coach Eli Manning wanted Cousins in that spot to decide the overall winner, and the Minnesota Vikings QB responded by throwing three touchdowns passes to rally the NFC to a 35-33 victory over the AFC in the Pro Bowl Games and end that conference's five-game losing streak.











            Cousins completed 15 of 19 passes for 150 yards in the NFL's reformatted all-star contest, which gave the NFC the victory.

            “It’s hard to wait around that long to play, but I appreciate Eli letting me be the third guy and fun to go in there and be the closer,"" Cousins said.

            Based on the earlier flag games and skills competitions, the AFC took a 21-15 lead into the final flag game.

            The Pro Bowl changed its format this season, eliminating the traditional game and replacing it with three flag games played on a 50-yard field and a series of skills competitions.

            Each of the first two flag games was worth six points and each skills event was three. The total points were accumulated to form the score entering the final flag game.

            “I thought it was awesome,” San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey said. ""Guys had fun. It got intense there at the end.”

            Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Davante Adams noticed the NFC took the game more seriously than expected, such as sending Cowboys safety KaVontae Turpin at the quarterback.

            “Hopefully, next year the NFC will actually play some man and not sit back in Cover-2 the whole time and blitz one of the fastest men in the league,"" Adams said. “Interesting technique by them, but it was still a good time.”

            BROTHERLY COMPETITION

            Brothers Eli and Peyton Manning each have two Super Bowl rings, but Eli has this Pro Bowl victory over his older sibling.

            “I am the greatest coach of the Mannings,” Eli said tongue-in-cheek on the NFL's Twitter account. “I am so much better at coaching than Peyton, it's unbelievable.”

            He wasn't the only brother to earn bragging rights. Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs intercepted a pass off a trick play from Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs.

            MYLES GARRETT INJURED

            The Cleveland Browns, however, announced defensive end Myles Garrett dislocated a toe Sunday, but X-rays were negative.

            Garrett played with a sprained shoulder this season from a car accident in September, but still had a team-record 16 sacks.

            Injuries were something the NFL hoped to avoid by switching to this new format.

            Though tackling wasn't allowed, Los Angeles Rams cornerback Jalen Ramsey leveled Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill at the goal line.

            PLAYGROUND FOOTBALL

            Cousins said he hopes youngsters watching the Pro Bowl will want to participate in flag football and help that version of the sport grow.

            The change to a flag game took some getting used to, but Cousins said that also made it more fun.

            “You're kind of drawing stuff up in the dirt,” he said. “It’s not as defined of a plan, so some of our guys were coming into the huddle saying, ‘Hey, I think if we did this.’ You try to listen to them and incorporate it. So it was fun, but also a little hectic.”

            McCaffrey agreed.

            “Learning the rules was a little tricky because this was so different,"" McCaffrey said. ""But I think everybody learned pretty quick and had fun.”

            FANS COME OUT

            The Pro Bowl has received quite a bit of criticism in recent years, but the NFL keeps the event for a reason — fans pay attention.

            The announced crowd of 58,331 was more than 2,000 more than last year, also played at Allegiant Stadium.

            No site has been announced for next year's Pro Bowl, but it's unlikely the NFL will want that event to be played in the same venue just before the Super Bowl, which will be in Las Vegas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801347,Analysis: China has reasons to keep cool after U.S. downs balloon,"BEIJING/HONG KONG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - China may respond to the U.S. shooting down its suspected spy balloon after warning of ""serious repercussions"", but analysts say any move will likely be finely calibrated to keep from worsening ties that both sides have been seeking to repair.Regional analysts and diplomats are closely watching China's response after a U.S. fighter jet shot down the balloon - which Beijing says was an errant weather-monitoring craft - in the Atlantic off South Carolina on Saturday.China on Sunday condemned the attack as an ""over-reaction"", saying it reserved the right to use the necessary means to deal with ""similar situations"", without elaborating.Some analysts said they will be scrutinising the seas and skies of East Asia for signs of tension, given growing deployments of ships and aircraft from China and from the United States and its allies.But while bilateral tension has risen in the past few days over the balloon incident, Beijing and Washington have been seeking to improve ties.The discovery of the balloon in the upper atmosphere above North America prompted the United States to postpone a visit to Beijing this week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. That trip had resulted from a November summit between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.Both sides are widely seen as keen to stabilise relations after a turbulent few years, with the Biden administration leery of tensions descending into conflict and Xi eyeing a recovery for the world's second-largest economy after a severe COVID-19 slump.The path of rebuilding U.S.-China relations likely remains on track, said Zhao Tong, a senior fellow at the China office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a visiting researcher at Princeton University.""The two sides still have a shared strong interest in stabilising and responsibly managing the bilateral relationship,"" Zhao told Reuters.SWEEP UNDER RUGCollin Koh, a security fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, predicted China would continue to respond vigorously to U.S. military reconnaissance patrols but stop short of confrontation.Even in calmer moments, Chinese forces actively shadow U.S. military patrols, particularly at sea, amid tensions over Taiwan and the disputed South China Sea, say regional military attaches.""Against manned platforms we might expect China to exercise restraint, but against unmanned ones it becomes more uncertain - especially if Beijing believes that it's possible to contain fallout since it involves no crew,"" Koh said.He noted China's seizure of a U.S. underwater glider deployed by an oceanographic research ship off the Philippines in December 2016. The Chinese navy later returned it to a U.S. warship.Christopher Twomey, a security scholar at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in California, said any Chinese response would be limited.""I'd expect they'd protest moderately but hope to sweep this under the rug and reinstate progress on senior-level visits within months,"" Twomey said, speaking in a private capacity.Zhu Feng, executive dean of the School of International Studies at Nanjing University, said U.S. officials should stop ""hyping"" events to ensure a smooth return to the normalised communications they earlier requested from Beijing.Zhu expressed hope ""the two governments can turn the page as soon as possible so that Sino-U.S. relations can return to an institutionalised channel of communication and dialogue"".Some analysts are watching Chinese state media and online activity for hints at any clamour for a tougher response, as China's mainstream state media have stuck to reporting official statements.On China's heavily censored social media, there was little evidence that nationalistic anger was being stirred up over the incident, with many netizens asking what the fuss was over one balloon.""Now, China can retire its satellites!,"" one user joked.",2023/2/6,930,World

Ukraine is planning its own counter-offensive but is waiting on Western supplies of battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles.MILITARY AID OVERSEERUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, when asked on national television Sunday night how likely was a reshuffle, said: ""Reznikov was extremely efficient in terms of communication with our partners. And this is a very important component in this case.""As a wartime defence minister, Reznikov, 56, fostered ties with Western defence officials and helped oversee the receipt of billions of dollars of military aid to help Kyiv fend off the Russian invasion.Podolyak said that Reznikov's ""wonderful"" personal relations with allies have helped with the military supplies.""Negotiations are not just mathematical formulae but also personal relationships. And trust. Unfortunately, today we are losing a measure of trust in us,"" Podolyak said.Reznikov singled out Ukraine's ""de facto"" integration into the NATO military alliance as a top priority, even if joining the bloc was not immediately possible de jure.During his tenure as defence minister, he spoke out strongly about wartime corruption, which he said was akin to ""marauding"".But in recent weeks his own defence ministry became embroiled in a corruption scandal over an army food contract that envisaged paying vastly inflated prices. It caused a public outcry.One of his deputy ministers has been fired, and two other senior officials have also since left their posts.The scandal prompted Zelenskiy to embark on a major reshuffle that saw the exit of an array of regional governors, deputy ministers and other officials.Reznikov hosted a news conference on Sunday afternoon, in which he said Ukraine expected a possible major Russian offensive this month, but that Kyiv had the resources at hand to hold them at bay.He also said that his ministry's anti-corruption department needed to be overhauled and that it had not done what it was supposed to do.",2023/2/6,222,World

            Jenna Johnson added 19 points and Kennady McQueen scored 16 as the Utes (20-2) shot 62.3% from the field. Utah improved to 10-2 in the conference to tie for the top spot with Stanford, which lost 72-67 at Washington earlier in the day. 

            “We’re excited about being in the hunt,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “February is about keeping your eyes in the moment, so now we play Washington next, that’s all we going to talk about and just stay present.""











            “We haven’t talked about rankings, its cool to get our program on the national map, but our goals are not what we are going to be ranked. Our goal is to have chance be in contention for a championship and host the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament. Those have been the two goals all season and we are chopping wood to give ourselves a chance. There is a lot of basketball left to be played against good teams,” she said. 

            Endyia Rogers scored 35 points to lead Oregon (14-9, 5-7). Chance Gray added 18 points and fellow freshman Grace VanSlooten had 16 for the Ducks, who shot 50% from the field and made nine 3-pointers two days after going 0-for-16 beyond the arc in a loss to Colorado.

It’s kind of been how we’ve done it this year; the days we defend pretty well we can’t get it together offensively and now today offensively we did some good things and we just couldn’t stop Utah.” 

            Utah took a 47-41 halftime lead before Oregon went ahead 58-56 early in the second half on a 3-pointer by Rogers. The Utes followed with six straight points and later stretched the margin to 71-66 on a basket from Gianna Kneepkens. 

            After Oregon drew closer, Pili scored five straight points to put Utes ahead 82-76. Rogers’ six points in a row later got Oregon within 84-82, but McQueen followed with a 3-pointer and Pili scored inside to push the Utes ahead 89-82. 

            “Our team was locked in,” Roberts said. “Since I’ve been at Utah, we never swept the Oregon trip so we wanted to do something that has never been done. That was in the front of our minds. 

            Pili scored the first seven points of the game. The Ducks led 39-36 after a basket by Gray, but Utah followed with 11 straight points, including 3-pointers from Gianna Kneepkens, Pili and Johnson to go up 47-39 just before halftime. 

            BIG PICTURE 

            Utah: The Utes have their highest AP ranking in school history at No. 7, but could move up after sweeping the Oregon schools on the road. The Utes will be in the national rankings for the 13th straight week, stretching their school record. … Utah heads home next weekend to face Washington and Washington State, two teams in the bottom half of the standings. 

            Oregon: The Ducks are below .500 in conference play this late in the season for the first time since 2016-17. … Oregon, which was ranked as high as No. 16 in the Top 25 earlier this season, will be unranked for the third week in a row and on the NCAA Tournament bubble as they prepare for four straight games on the road.

(AP) — Keisei Tominaga scored a career-high 30 points, Jamarques Lawrence scored five key points down the stretch, and Nebraska defeated Penn State 72-63 on Sunday, giving Cornhuskers coach Fred Hoiberg his 150th career victory.

            The win moves Nebraska (11-13, 4-9 Big Ten) past last season’s win total and matches last season’s number of conference victories. The Cornhuskers had lost four in a row while chasing that elusive win.

            Five players scored for Nebraska in an 11-0 run that gave the Cornhuskers a 26-13 lead near the 10-minute mark of the first half. Tominaga scored 15 points in the half and the Cornhuskers led 37-28 at the break.











            Nebraska held the lead throughout the second half. A 3-pointer by Seth Lundy got the Nittany Lions within 57-53 with 6:20 remaining and a free throw by Kebba Njie got Penn State within three. But Tominaga made a layup and a 3-pointer to push Nebraska’s lead back to eight inside the five-minute mark.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801355,Kevin Harvick to join Fox booth as NASCAR analyst in 2024,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kevin Harvick won't spend a single day in retirement when his NASCAR driving days are over: Fox said Sunday it has hired Harvick for its broadcast booth next season. 

            Harvick announced last month that he will retire from NASCAR competition at the end of the 2023 season.

            He will then transition into a broadcast roll for Fox, which has used Harvick regularly as a guest analyst since 2015. He is scheduled to call four Xfinity Series and three Truck Series races this year for FS1, and next season he will join Mike Joy and Clint Bowyer for Fox's entire portion of the Cup schedule.











            “I knew that this was something that I wanted to do because it gives you such a unique position to be able to talk about the sport and be able to use your knowledge and relationships to be able to give the fans and people a great perspective,” Harvick told The Associated Press.

            “This has really been a conversation that's been happening for several years, the timing just was never really right. Now it's all worked out and it's a great time to be able to transition and have a voice in the sport and remain a part of NASCAR racing on a weekly basis and talk about the things I love.”

            Harvick was the centerpiece of Fox's “Drivers Only” broadcasts that began in 2015. The network began using a combination of active drivers and crew chiefs to call lower-level races and Harvick, who has called more than 25 races for the network, was a natural fit from the very beginning.

            He is so steady in the booth that many predicted Harvick would develop into a play-by-play announcer and lead a broadcast team. Harvick, who is beginning his 23rd Cup season, is the 2014 Cup champion and is tied for ninth on NASCAR’s all-time wins list with 60 career victories.

            Harvick has 13 consecutive playoff appearances. 

            “The credibility is off the charts. His longevity in NASCAR will only help him explain to the viewers the evolution the sport has taken,” Fox Sports executive producer Brad Zager said. “For him, that next step of being in the booth is something that’s almost been fait accompli since he first stepped into the booth with us.”

            Zager said the network had to do very little to prepare Harvick for the booth. 

            “We never want to try to convince somebody they should be a broadcaster, and with Harvick, we didn’t have to,” Zager said. “He is someone who has a passion for it already. We’re very excited about everything that he brings, and we think he will be the perfect third man for Clint and Mike with his style, his personality and his credibility.”

            Fox primarily has been a two-man booth since Jeff Gordon stepped down at the end of the 2021 season. The network used guests in place of Gordon but has been content waiting for the right person to fill the role full-time.

            For Harvick, it will be his third different job as a co-worker with Bowyer. 

            The two were teammates at Richard Childress Racing early in their career, were reunited at Stewart-Haas Racing and in 2024 will be side-by-side as Fox analysts. 

            “We obviously have totally different approaches in the things that we do and say, and I think that makes it fun,” Harvick said. “Clint and I became good friends over the years, and we have a good relationship, but we've never been able to have a relationship outside the car that's not been competitive.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801369,Garland leads hot-shooting Cavs to 122-103 win over Pacers,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Darius Garland scored 24 points, Isaac Okoro added 20 and the Cleveland Cavaliers made 15 3-pointers Sunday in a 122-103 rout of the Indiana Pacers.

            All five starters scored in double figures for the Cavaliers, who shot 52.3% percent from the field, including 15 of 37 (40.5%) from long range, to complement a top-ranked defense that held Indiana to 43.5% shooting.

            Jarrett Allen contributed 18 points and 13 rebounds, Evan Mobley had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and Donovan Mitchell added 19 points and six assists for the Cavs. Garland — a Gary, Indiana, native who was not named an All-Star despite averaging 22 points and 8.2 assists — made four 3s and had six assists.











            “No extra fuel,” Garland said. “I think I was a snub, but I’ve just got to come out and prove it every night.”

            Myles Turner had 27 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana, which has lost 12 of 14. All-Star Tyrese Haliburton finished with 15 points and 11 assists, while Buddy Hield had 16 points.

            After alternating wins and losses over its prior eight games, Cleveland took control in the second quarter, led 62-46 at halftime and stretched its advantage to 23 points in the third quarter and as many as 26 in the fourth.

            “There’s a seriousness to our approach and an attitude to how we are playing,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “I think we are taking steps in the right direction. Sometimes when the offense comes easy, you just get in a back-and-forth, but in the fourth we did a much better job of tightening back up and controlling the tempo. We are growing in that area of understanding the intensity level that it takes.”

            The Pacers were within 27-25 at the end of the first quarter but couldn’t keep up after that.

            “They did a good job controlling us in the pick-and-roll,” Haliburton said. “We weren’t able to get stops, and that allowed them to set their defense. Kudos to them. A lot of different guys contributed for them. They just outplayed us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801370,Hong Kong Jumps to Fourth-Placed Ranking in Global Data Center Market Comparison,"Hong Kong moves up to fourth overall in global rankings from sixth in 2022 report         Beijing and Shanghai both rise notably in market size ranking       HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 6 February 2023 - Hong Kong has reconfirmed its position as a top data center market globally in Cushman & Wakefield's latest Global Data Centre Market Comparison report.   The annual report, now in its fourth year, ranks major data center markets around the world according to 13 weighted categories, including market size, fiber connectivity, power cost and environmental risk, to determine the top overall markets as well as the top performing markets in each category.   Hong Kong jumped to fourth in the overall rankings in the new report, scoring highly across categories; with strong connectivity, consistent demand, availability of cloud services and a business-friendly tax structure offsetting high land prices. Hong Kong moved up from sixth overall in the 2022 global rankings.  John Siu, Managing Director, Hong Kong at Cushman & Wakefield, said: ""Hong Kong is one of Asia's leading and still-rising strategic locations for data centers, reflected in its move up in the overall global rankings to fourth place in the 2023 report. On the ground, Cushman & Wakefield Hong Kong recently advised a pan-Asia data center operator BDx to pre-lease the majority area of a brand new building at No. 38 Wing Kei Road, Kwai Chung, as their third data center location in Hong Kong. This transaction further demonstrates the global demand and market confidence in Hong Kong's data center market by multinational players. We anticipate the data center segment will continue to grow as the city continues to expand and develop its innovation and technology industry in the upcoming years.""   Hong Kong and Singapore were the only two cities outside of the United States to make the top 10 overall rankings. Singapore ranked third place within the top markets globally in all three high-weight categories: market size, fiber connectivity and cloud availability. Its strong performance across categories including its low vacancy rate — reflective of high demand — low environmental risk, and its status as a smart city helped cement its rank despite its recently-lifted two-year moratorium which limited new stock.   In the United States, Northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the world and the top-ranked market for the past three years, this year shared the highest rank with Portland following surging prices for prime land and a county-wide pause on development due to power restrictions in Northern Virginia. Portland surged from 10th place in the 2022 report to achieve the joint top spot. Atlanta rounded out the top five markets.   Asia Pacific   Within Asia Pacific, Singapore and Hong Kong were ranked first and second, with Sydney and Seoul tying for third place. Tokyo rounded out the top five markets.   With more accurate data on the size and scope of data center deployments in mainland China, Beijing and Shanghai have both risen notably in the market size rankings.   In the overall rankings for Asia Pacific, the report ranks Beijing as the sixth placed market and Shanghai as the eighth placed market.   Cushman & Wakefield's Head of Asia Pacific Data Centre Practice Group Todd Olson said: ""2022 saw hyperscale tenants continue their expansion across all regions. Hyperscalers, followed closely by co-location providers and developers, have shown increasing interest in secondary and emerging markets which often offer greater availability of, and lower prices for, both land and power. Moving forward, we expect to see secondary markets make significant jumps in the rankings.""

There was no shortage of buzz in the market last year: rising interest rates, an ongoing inflation shock, and, as a result, falling stock markets and a strengthening dollar.  KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 6 February 2023 - The year 2022 remains in the rear-view mirror. There was no shortage of buzz in the market last year: rising interest rates, an ongoing inflation shock, and, as a result, falling stock markets and a strengthening dollar. Just imagine, at the end of the year the S&P500 was headed down 18%.   If we speak about the stock market, we should not be critical, as the decrease in the value of assets was mixed and there are even positive moments:     The Energy sector is a striking example; it added 52% for the year and is, in fact, the only sector in the green zone.       Utilities and      Consumer Staples have proven to be defensive equities (and practically unchanged).       Healthcare fell less than the entire market (8% drop in total).           Other cyclical sectors (Basic Materials, Industrials, Financials) have recovered over the past two months, resulting in a decline of about 10%.           The      Telecommunications, Technology, Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary sectors, which are sensitive to rising interest rates, remain deep in the negative zone.      We have taken all these trends into review and provided you with the most probable scenario of the situation. The following research aims to let our clients know the 2023 trends in the assets they trade (currency pairs and stocks).   We've highlighted two sets of information. In the first part we look at trends in the macroeconomics of countries and forecast the value of the U.S. dollar, and in the second part we share a vision about key industries that we think will perform in 2023.   As we said, this outlook will be of primary interest to our clients, because they can use all the asset types and market situations discussed to execute trades on their accounts.   United States & US Dollar.   We expect the U.S. recession to continue in the first half of 2023, then recover and rebound, gaining strength by the end of 2023:     The business cycle will outpace the economic cycle. Market players will be more optimistic, setting the stage for public equities valuation growth. Nevertheless, the full-year targets for U.S. economic growth and inflation may reflect a mostly recessionary outlook—we forecast that the inflation shock of the last 18 months has stopped—core inflation will slow from 5% now to 3% at the end of 2023. The unemployment rate will rise from 3.5% to 4.0% by year-end.          We believe that in order to contain inflation (on the background of stronger real income growth),      the U.S. Fed will raise the rate three more times in 25 bps increments to a peak of 5–5.25%. We also do not expect a rate cut in 2023.           Based on the above, the US dollar's rise may slow and possibly reverse due to a slowdown in inflation and monetary policy easing by the US Federal Reserve starting in the second quarter (March–April) of 2023.           Global economies   US economic resilience is contrasted with a European recession and a boomy reopening in China. The energy supply shock resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war will contribute to weaker growth in the Eurozone. The situation in Asia-Pacific (APAC) mirrors that of China's reopening and their rejection of zero tolerance Covid in China          Commodity still looks attractive          All commodities had a strong two-year run, and we expect this rally to continue, including Energy. The bullish super cycle that began in March 2020 continues. The lack of supply, which contributed to positive commodity returns in 2021 and 2022, will continue into 2023.           OPEC+ has taken key strategic steps to minimise supply while maximising the price. U.S. preferences are increasingly shifting toward renewable energy, while Russian oil is subject to restraining sanctions. The implication is that falling global oil production will contribute to higher prices over the next few years. Thus, the International Energy Association (EIA) forecasts production growth of 1% in 2023, which with the average assumed growth of global GDP of 1.8%, creates these prerequisites (see fig.).            [1]         However, in 2023, commodity prices may reverse as we expect a recession in the first half of the year. Once recession fears subside in the second half and demand starts to pick up, we expect commodity prices to start rising. Our year-end forecast is $95 for Brent and $91 for WTI.          In the stock market, we identify two sectors that, for different reasons, have growth potential and could be attractive in 2023, but at the same time do not rule out separate market stories with other stocks:   Big Techs have big trends   After the technology crash of 2022, some companies are still struggling to recover, and investors may think that the best days of technology companies have passed.   Ambitious plans can definitely be pushed aside. For the technology sector, 2023 is a year of uncertainty and skills shortages. This puts a strain on all activities in 2023.   Companies are focused on optimising business processes and reducing budgets, which, in our opinion, will have a negative impact on growth stocks.   However, we see the negative market sentiment as a great opportunity for the ""Big Techs"" (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Visa, etc.), as their businesses have become well-established.   We believe that rising interest rates and macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns have simply distracted investors from long-term trends that create growth opportunities for companies in  Semiconductors, Cloud technologies and  5G.   (Our clients can trade 22 shares in this sector)   Healthcare—good fundamentals creating upside opportunity   In the first half of 2022, we saw a massive selloff across the entire spectrum of the market, and the  Healthcare sector is no exception. But with so much negative sentiment already factored into stock prices, the fundamentals become quite interesting and speak to the undervaluation of this category of stocks. If confirmed by investors' willingness to buy, the healthcare sector could rise in 2023.   Another tailwind is worth highlighting: The US Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August 2022, included a 3-year extension of enhanced subsidies for consumers who purchase health coverage on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. This is a benefit to health insurers offering  Medicare and/or  Medicaid plans.   Regardless of where the U.S. markets go next, the  Healthcare sector may offer a combination of protective and growth characteristics that could be attractive in a variety of scenarios.   (Our clients can trade 22 shares in this sector).   The Bottom Line   Due to the fact that business cycles outpace economic cycles, we believe that cyclical stocks have growth potential first and foremost.   We believe that the themes described in this review are the key ones that will drive the world economy. We deliberately divided the forecasts into America and non-America, understanding that the U.S. dollar is the main measure of the state of the world economy. And within 2023, the U.S. dollar tends to decline, which is a leading positive signal for the global economy and all categories of public equities.

KMT officials said the trip is meant to promote the interests of Taiwanese working, studying, or living in China.Issues of Taiwanese farmers, fishers, and small to medium sized enterprises will be discussed, according to reports. As a member of Taiwan’s opposition, Hsia has no power to make decisions, but said that his trip was simply about conveying opinions and sharing information from Taiwan.China Times said that Hsia’s visit was in the interest of promoting goodwill and promoting exchange.This is in stark opposition to statements made recently by the Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花), who said that international norms and rules should dictate trade, not goodwill.Wang told reporters on Thursday (Feb. 2) that Taiwan always adheres to international norms and rules when making trade decisions. ""Commodity transactions, especially food transactions, should not use 'good intentions or bad intentions' to determine whether they can be traded,"" she said.The announcement of the trip comes amid reports that China is increasing cyber-attacks on prominent Taiwanese officials, including trying to influence opinion on cross-strait trade of agricultural and seafood products.Hsia will make stops at Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Chengdu throughout the nine-day visit. His last visit to China was last year in August after large scale military exercises were carried out by the People's Liberation Army around Taiwan, when he visited Shanghai and Fujian Province.",2023/2/6,1285,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801404,No. 3 Houston denies Temple 2nd upset; beats Owls 81-65,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kelvin Sampson stepped on Temple's court and saw a rare packed house ready to give Houston as much of a hard time as the Owls did in an unlikely triumph in Texas only two weeks ago.

            For a moment, Sampson thought about what a scene like this meant for the coach down the sideline — Temple's Aaron McKie — and the feelings the late Temple coach John Chaney might have had before such a big game.

            “My first thought was coach Chaney,” Sampson said. “How proud he would have been of Aaron. I know what this looked like when Aaron got here. There's been a steady growth and he's got a good team.”











            Good. Just not good enough to sweep a Houston team that doesn't lose very often to any team — much less twice to the same one.

            Jarace Walker scored 23 points, Marcus Sasser had 13 and No. 3 Houston earned retribution against Temple with an 81-65 win on Sunday night.

            The Owls failed in their bid for a second upset after they toppled the Cougars from No. 1 in the AP men’s college basketball poll with a 56-55 win last month in Houston. 

            The Cougars (22-2, 10-1 American Athletic Conference) are now poised to regain the top spot in the AP poll after a dominant second half in Philly. No. 1 Purdue lost to Indiana and No. 2 Tennessee lost to Florida, leaving an opening for Houston to ascend to No. 1 on Monday.

            Khalif Battle led Temple (14-10, 8-3) with 24 points.

            Temple has traditionally struggled to draw a full house at Liacouras Center, even for games that include city rivals or Top 25 teams or in seasons full of NCAA Tournament promise. The arena was packed Sunday, and Owls students swayed behind the basket from the opening tip. There was a T-shirt “white out” that put some needed school spirit on display.

            “Kudos to the Temple students. They were giving it to us from the baseline,” Sampson said.

            Temple gave fans plenty of reason to cheer with nine 3-pointers in the first half. Battle hit a 3 for a 26-25 lead, Zach Hicks hit one for a three-point lead and Damian Dunn buried one that sent the Owls into halftime ahead 37-33. 

            “You never know when you’ll get a crowd like that again,” Battle said.

            Unlike the first game, the Owls couldn’t take it to the wire. Houston trailed at halftime for only the third time this season before it rallied to win for the 13th time in 14 games. The Temple loss was the only one in that streak.

            Playing the biggest home game in McKie’s four seasons, the Owls wilted offensively and didn’t have the defensive chops to slow Houston. The Cougars burst the game open with a 13-0 run to open the second half and never let the Owls make a serious run the rest of the way. The Owls were 7-of-24 shooting (29%) from the floor in the second half.

            “When a guy made a mistake or didn't make a shot, they dropped their head,” in the second half, McKie said. “We just couldn’t find a way to get out of our own way.”

            Consider, in the first game, Temple did not make a bucket over the final 7:18 and was 5 of 21 from the field in the second half. Yet the offensive woes were offset by holding Houston to 34% shooting.

            When Walker hit a 3 for a 56-48 lead Sunday with 8:47 left, it was good enough for one more point than Houston scored in the first game. The Cougars had 25 more in them.

            “They're a good team,” Battle said. “I feel like we're just as good, if not better.”

            Maybe only in Texas.

            Houston: Now has wiggle room in the AAC.

            Temple: Losses to Wagner and Maryland Eastern Shore crippled Temple’s chances for an at-large bid for the NCAA Tournament. A season sweep of Houston could created an opening. The Owls will have to win the AAC tournament for a piece of March Madness.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801406,Fabrica X Announces New Store Concept which Celebrates Innovation in Biomaterials in Textile and Lifestyle Products,"Giving waste a new lease of life – six-month showcase hosted in partnership with Fidelity International, Biofabricate, and Lenzing Group

HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 6 February 2023 - Fabrica X, the Impact Retail concept store operated by The Mills Fabrica in Hong Kong, today announces its new campaign, which over the course of six months, will celebrate innovations in biomaterials in textiles and lifestyle products. Biomaterials are new materials regenerated from organic waste through nature-based, biological processes to create more sustainable products. Along with its global partners, Fabrica X will enable Hong Kongers to learn, experience, and purchase biomaterial innovations and products in fabric materials, such as alternative leathers derived from coffee waste or footwear made from wood.            Relaunched in July 2022, Fabrica X is an innovative concept store that combines retail, education, and experiential discoveries through different thematic campaigns related to sustainability. The Mills Fabrica itself was grown out of Nan Fung Group's textile legacy in Hong Kong, with a mission to accelerate innovations for sustainability, environmental and social impact.   From lab to store, to closet – a one-stop-platform to bring new technology to everyday lives   Synthetic fibers today represent 65% of global fiber production, of which 56% of fibers produced are derived from fossil fuels, according to Textile Exchange's 2022 report. The huge amount of textiles produced means an equally staggering amount is sent to landfills or incinerated each year estimated at one garbage truck of textile waste every second. This contributes to the release of greenhouse gas emission as textile waste decomposes in landfills.   ""Our first campaign in 2023 serves to showcase — and celebrate — the wonders and progress made in biomaterials science. Today we are seeing lab innovations transform into beautiful, practical, and biodegradable fabrics, dyes, and materials spun into clothing,""  said Cintia Nunes, General Manager, Head of Asia, The Mills Fabrica.   ""Fabrica X is putting the spotlight on biomaterials as we urge consumers and businesses to rethink conventional textile materials, particularly in our daily lives — and understand the real environmental and social implications of their purchases.""   Fabrica X aims to use its Impact Retail concept store not only as a retail space for businesses to sell products made with sustainable materials, but also to exhibit innovative biomaterial concepts and fabrics where people can touch, feel and observe the materials. It includes an experiential zone where people can get hands-on learning experiences on transforming common food waste and natural materials into new life. By doing so, Fabrica X aims to put this issue front and center in Hong Kongers' lives, and urges businesses and retailers to make more conscious purchasing decisions by seeing and understanding the innovative alternatives that are available in the market today.   With an emphasis on hands-on education, Fabrica X will also showcase the lifecycle and decomposition process of biodegradable fabric throughout the campaign period of 6-months.   With support from Fidelity International, Biofabricate, and Lenzing Group   With a shared belief in building a more sustainable future, Fidelity International is forming a collaborative partnership with Fabrica X, to support and influence consumers and businesses to become more sustainable.   ""At Fidelity, we understand that every decision from investment to daily wearables, has an impact for society. That is why we take an active approach to sustainable investing, seeking to steer companies towards decisions that will positively impact the greater good. United by the goal of building a more sustainable future, we are proud to partner with Fabrica X and lend our support to drive biomaterial innovation at home and beyond to unlock new sustainable possibilities across industries. We seek to become the catalyst to fundamentally change industry practices to become more mindful of consumption choices,"" said  Ellie Tang, Director, Sustainable Investing from Fidelity International.   In addition to Fidelity International, Biofabricate, the global authority in sustainable biomaterials, is the campaign's Knowledge Partner – ensuring that educational contents used in the campaign are verified, impactful, and not susceptible to greenwashing. Lenzing Group, one of the world's leading supplier of specialty fibers for the textile and nonwovens industries – with its flagship brand TENCELTM – provides ecologically responsible fibers for the exhibition.   Fabrica X is open to partnerships and collaborations with startups, brands, corporates and investors from Hong Kong and around the world to join its mission to promote materials sustainability, and to accelerate development and adoption of innovative biomaterials.   The six-month showcase will feature global innovations that will change the industry, including the incubatees and investees from The Mills Fabrica, as well as a number of local, regional, and global innovators who will unveil their innovative and sustainable materials made with from fruit peels, seashells, mushroom, and many more, for the public to feel and experience. During which, Hong Kongers can also shop from featured brands which produce clothings and other goods made from such biomaterials.  Hashtag: #FabricaX

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801424,Taiwan’s Fo Guang Shan founder Master Hsing Yun passes away,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Master Hsing Yun (星雲), the founding patriarch of Fo Guang Shan, passed away on Sunday (Feb. 5) at age 95.Fo Guang Shan issued an announcement early on Monday morning (Feb. 6) confirming the passing of Master Hsing Yun, inviting the public to pay condolences from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day. Thousands of followers are expected to pay respect to the Buddhist master, who founded over 300 temples and undertook humanitarian work around the world.Hsing Yun's generation of Buddhist masters have been referred to as the “Four Heavenly Kings” of Taiwanese Buddhism by contemporaries, such as Master Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain, and Master Wei Chueh of Chung Tai Shan. Only Master Cheng Yen of Tzu Chi remains alive and practicing.Master Hsing Yun promoted humanistic Buddhism throughout his life, a tradition first developed by Master Yin Shun in China, and commonly adopted and shared by Taiwan’s top Buddhist leaders. This modern interpretation of Buddhism is predicated upon rejecting the deification of the Buddha, insisting that the Buddha must live amongst humankind, and exemplify concepts of said humanism such as: altruism, joy, spiritual practice, and concern for all living beings.Born to a poor family in 1927 in Jiangdu, Jiangsu Province, China. Hsing Yun never received formal education and was left in the care of his maternal grandmother. At the age of 12, after the Sino-Japanese War broke out, he reunited with his mother and her search for her missing husband, who had most likely lost his life in the war in 1938. It was on this trip that Hsing Yun encountered eminent Master Zhi Kai in Qixia Temple, Nanjing.Devotees pay last respects to Master Hsing Yun.

""I imagine not a single person in Gaziantep is in their homes now.""The United States was ""profoundly concerned"" about the quake in Turkey and Syria and was monitoring events closely, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Twitter.""I have been in touch with Turkish officials to relay that we stand ready to provide any and all needed assistance,"" he said.The region straddles seismic fault lines and is prone to earthquakes.FOCUS ON SEARCH AND RESCUEThe tremor lasted about a minute and shattered windows, according to a Reuters witness in Diyarbakir, 350 km (218 miles)to the east, where a security official said at least 17 buildings collapsed.Authorities said 16 structures collapsed in Sanliurfa and 34 in Osmaniye.Broadcasters TRT and Haberturk showed footage of people picking through building wreckage, moving stretchers and seeking survivors in the city of Kahramanmaras, where it was still dark.""Our primary job is to carry out the search and rescue work and to do that all our teams are on alert,"" Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told reporters.The German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said the quake struck at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), while the EMSC monitoring service said it was assessing the risk of a tsunami.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported a series of further earthquakes following the initial tremor, which it put at a magnitude of 7.8. There was a quake measuring 6.7 in Gaziantep and another of 5.6 in the city's Nurdag area.Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) put the magnitude of the quake at 7.4 near Kahramanmaras and the larger city of Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border.Tremors were also felt in the Turkish capital of Ankara, 460 km (286 miles) northwest of the epicentre, and in Cyprus, where police reported no damage.""The earthquake struck in a region that we feared. There is serious widespread damage,"" Kerem Kinik, the chief of the Turkish Red Crescent relief agency, told Haberturk, issuing an appeal for blood donations.Turkey is among the most earthquake-prone countries in the world.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801431,"Siakam, Raptors rally past Grizzlies 106-103 as Morant sits","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Pascal Siakam scored 19 points, including a pair of free throws with 9 seconds left, and the Toronto Raptors rallied from a 15-point deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies 106-103 on Sunday.

            Jaren Jackson Jr. missed a 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left that would have tied the game for the Grizzlies, who played without star Ja Morant because of right wrist soreness.

            Toronto won its second straight game and went 4-3 on its season-long seven-game road swing. Memphis has lost three straight and eight of nine.











            Chris Boucher scored 17 points and matched his season high with three 3-pointers for the Raptors. Scottie Barnes scored 13 of his 16 points in the fourth quarter, including a pair of key baskets down the stretch. Fred Van Vleet had 15 points and seven assists.

            “Things got tight in the fourth quarter,” Barnes said. “It was just the ball was coming to me, and I was having a ball. I was just trying to get downhill and win the game.”

            Desmond Bane led Memphis with 26 points, while Jackson had 18 points and four blocks. In addition to Morant, the Grizzlies were missing center Steven Adams (right knee) and forward Dillon Brooks, who served a league-assessed one-game suspension for his confrontation with Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell on Thursday.

            Toronto put the game away by outscoring Memphis 28-17 in the fourth quarter, and Bane said there are obviously things that need to change.

            “I think just valuing every possession,” the Grizzlies guard said. “Understanding the magnitude of every possession for a full 48 minutes, but especially down the stretch. When it comes down to it, we've got to be able to rebound the basketball and not allow teams to get second chances.”

            Memphis led most of the game before Toronto asserted itself late. The Grizzlies were ahead 81-66 with 4:44 left in the third quarter. The Raptors got within 86-78 entering the fourth.

            “You don't want to try and come down and out-jump-shoot teams,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “They were open shots, but we needed to get in attack mode and attack the paint. (Jump shots) are great when they all go in, but when none of them go in, it looks and feels really bad, and you put yourself in a big hole.”

            Precious Achiuwa got free for a baseline dunk with 2:32 left that gave the Raptors a 100-99 lead. From there, the teams traded baskets until Barnes hit a pair of shots, the latter with 20.1 seconds left for a 104-103 advantage.

            “It was a great win ... to close it out with that fourth quarter,” VanVleet said. “Things were not really going our way. We just hung in there and made a couple of more plays at the end.”

VanVleet handed out his 2,000th career assist in the first quarter. ... Barnes had his 100th career block in the third quarter. ...

            MORANT FRIEND PUNISHED

            Morant tweeted that a friend of his has been banned from games at FedExForum for a year. The punishment stems from a confrontation on Jan. 29, when the Grizzlies hosted Indiana. During the game, there was barking between Pacers players and friends of Morant seated along the sideline. The talking apparently continued into the players’ parking area after the game, leading to an investigation by the league. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said he was aware of the league’s investigation and that the team addressed the matter internally. He did not elaborate further.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801432,"Rescuers scramble in Turkey, Syria after quake kills 4,000","ADANA, Turkey (AP) — Rescuers in Turkey and war-ravaged Syria searched through the frigid night into Tuesday, hoping to pull more survivors from the rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 4,000 people and toppled thousands of buildings across a wide region.

            Authorities feared the death toll from Monday's pre-dawn earthquake and aftershocks would keep climbing as rescuers looked for survivors among tangles of metal and concrete spread across the region beset by Syria’s 12-year civil war and refugee crisis.

            Survivors cried out for help from within mountains of debris as first responders contended with rain and snow. Seismic activity continued to rattle the region, including another jolt nearly as powerful as the initial quake. Workers carefully pulled away slabs of concrete and reached for bodies as desperate families waited for news of loved ones.











            “My grandson is 1 1/2 years old. Please help them, please. ... They were on the 12th floor,” Imran Bahur wept by her destroyed apartment building in the Turkish city of Adana on Monday.

            Tens of thousands who were left homeless in Turkey and Syria faced a night in the cold. In the Turkish city of Gaziantep, a provincial capital about 33 kilometers (20 miles) from the epicenter, people took refuge in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centers. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared seven days of national mourning.

            U.S. President Joe Biden called Erdogan to express condolences and offer assistance to the NATO ally. The White House said it was sending search-and-rescue teams to support Turkey’s efforts.

            The quake, which was centered in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, sent residents of Damascus and Beirut rushing into the street and was felt as far away as Cairo.

            It piled more misery on a region that has seen tremendous suffering over the past decade. On the Syrian side, the area is divided between government-controlled territory and the country’s last opposition-held enclave, which is surrounded by Russian-backed government forces. Turkey, meanwhile, is home to millions of refugees from the civil war.

            In the rebel-held enclave, hundreds of families remained trapped in rubble, the opposition emergency organization known as the White Helmets said in a statement. The area is packed with some 4 million people displaced from other parts of the country by the war. Many live in buildings that are already wrecked from military bombardments.

            Strained medical centers quickly filled with injured people, rescue workers said. Some facilities had to be emptied, including a maternity hospital, according to the SAMS medical organization.

            More than 7,800 people were rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkey’s disaster management authority.

            The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999.

            The U.S. Geological Survey measured Monday’s quake at 7.8, with a depth of 18 kilometers (11 miles). Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude temblor, likely triggered by the first, struck more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.

            The second jolt caused a multistory apartment building in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa to topple onto the street in a cloud of dust as bystanders screamed, according to video of the scene.

            Thousands of buildings were reported collapsed in a wide area extending from Syria’s cities of Aleppo and Hama to Turkey’s Diyarbakir, more than 330 kilometers (200 miles) to the northeast.

            In Turkey alone, more than 5,600 buildings were destroyed, authorities said. Hospitals were damaged, and one collapsed in the city of Iskenderun.

            Bitterly cold temperatures could reduce the time frame that rescuers have to save trapped survivors, said Dr. Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University. The difficulty of working in areas beset by civil war would further complicate rescue efforts, he said.

            Offers of help — from search-and-rescue teams to medical supplies and money — poured in from dozens of countries, as well as the European Union and NATO. The vast majority were for Turkey, with a Russian and even an Israeli promise of help to the Syrian government, but it was not clear if any would go to the devastated rebel-held pocket in the northwest.

            The opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense described the situation in the enclave as “disastrous.”

            The opposition-held area, centered on the province of Idlib, has been under siege for years, with frequent Russian and government airstrikes. The territory depends on a flow of aid from Turkey for everything from food to medical supplies.

            U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said 224 buildings in northwestern Syrian were destroyed and at least 325 were damaged, including aid warehouses. The U.N. had been assisting 2.7 million people each month via cross-border deliveries, which could now be disrupted.

            At a hospital in Idlib, Osama Abdel Hamid said most of his neighbors died when their shared four-story building collapsed. As he fled with his wife and three children, a wooden door fell on them, shielding them from falling debris.

            “God gave me a new lease on life,” he said.

            In the small Syrian rebel-held town of Azmarin in the mountains by the Turkish border, the bodies of several dead children, wrapped in blankets, were brought to a hospital.

            In the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble, and one could be seen lying on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Turkish broadcaster CNN Turk said a woman was pulled out alive in Gaziantep after a rescue dog detected her.

            In Adana, 20 or so people, some in emergency rescue jackets, used power saws atop the concrete mountain of a collapsed building to open up space for any survivors to climb out or be rescued.

            “I don’t have the strength anymore,” one survivor could be heard calling out from beneath the rubble of another building in Adana as rescue workers tried to reach him, said Muhammet Fatih Yavuz, a local resident.

            In Diyarbakir, hundreds of rescue workers and civilians formed lines across a huge mound of wreckage, passing down broken concrete pieces and household belongings as they searched for trapped survivors.

            At least 2,921 people were killed in 10 Turkish provinces, with nearly 16,000 injured, according to Turkish authorities. The death toll in government-held areas of Syria climbed to 656 people, with some 1,400 injured, according to the Health Ministry. In the country’s rebel-held northwest, groups that operate there said at least 450 people died, with many hundreds injured.

            Huseyin Yayman, a legislator from Turkey’s Hatay province, said several of his family members were stuck under the rubble of their collapsed homes.

            “There are so many other people who are also trapped,” he told HaberTurk television by phone. “There are so many buildings that have been damaged. People are on the streets. It’s raining, it’s winter.”

            Alsayed reported from Azmarin, Syria, while Fraser reported from Ankara, Turkey. Associated Press writers Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul, Bassem Mroue and Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut, and Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul, South Korea, contributed to this report.ADANA, Turkey (AP) — Rescuers in Turkey and war-ravaged Syria searched through the frigid night into Tuesday, hoping to pull more survivors from the rubble after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed more than 4,000 people and toppled thousands of buildings across a wide region.Authorities feared the death toll from Monday's pre-dawn earthquake and aftershocks would keep climbing as rescuers looked for survivors among tangles of metal and concrete spread across the region beset by Syria’s 12-year civil war and refugee crisis.Survivors cried out for help from within mountains of debris as first responders contended with rain and snow. Seismic activity continued to rattle the region, including another jolt nearly as powerful as the initial quake. Workers carefully pulled away slabs of concrete and reached for bodies as desperate families waited for news of loved ones.“My grandson is 1 1/2 years old. Please help them, please. ... They were on the 12th floor,” Imran Bahur wept by her destroyed apartment building in the Turkish city of Adana on Monday.Tens of thousands who were left homeless in Turkey and Syria faced a night in the cold. In the Turkish city of Gaziantep, a provincial capital about 33 kilometers (20 miles) from the epicenter, people took refuge in shopping malls, stadiums, mosques and community centers. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared seven days of national mourning.U.S. President Joe Biden called Erdogan to express condolences and offer assistance to the NATO ally. The White House said it was sending search-and-rescue teams to support Turkey’s efforts.The quake, which was centered in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaras, sent residents of Damascus and Beirut rushing into the street and was felt as far away as Cairo.It piled more misery on a region that has seen tremendous suffering over the past decade. On the Syrian side, the area is divided between government-controlled territory and the country’s last opposition-held enclave, which is surrounded by Russian-backed government forces. Turkey, meanwhile, is home to millions of refugees from the civil war.In the rebel-held enclave, hundreds of families remained trapped in rubble, the opposition emergency organization known as the White Helmets said in a statement. The area is packed with some 4 million people displaced from other parts of the country by the war. Many live in buildings that are already wrecked from military bombardments.Strained medical centers quickly filled with injured people, rescue workers said. Some facilities had to be emptied, including a maternity hospital, according to the SAMS medical organization.More than 7,800 people were rescued across 10 provinces, according to Orhan Tatar, an official with Turkey’s disaster management authority.The region sits on top of major fault lines and is frequently shaken by earthquakes. Some 18,000 were killed in similarly powerful earthquakes that hit northwest Turkey in 1999.The U.S. Geological Survey measured Monday’s quake at 7.8, with a depth of 18 kilometers (11 miles). Hours later, a 7.5 magnitude temblor, likely triggered by the first, struck more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away.The second jolt caused a multistory apartment building in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa to topple onto the street in a cloud of dust as bystanders screamed, according to video of the scene.Thousands of buildings were reported collapsed in a wide area extending from Syria’s cities of Aleppo and Hama to Turkey’s Diyarbakir, more than 330 kilometers (200 miles) to the northeast.In Turkey alone, more than 5,600 buildings were destroyed, authorities said. Hospitals were damaged, and one collapsed in the city of Iskenderun.Bitterly cold temperatures could reduce the time frame that rescuers have to save trapped survivors, said Dr. Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University. The difficulty of working in areas beset by civil war would further complicate rescue efforts, he said.Offers of help — from search-and-rescue teams to medical supplies and money — poured in from dozens of countries, as well as the European Union and NATO. The vast majority were for Turkey, with a Russian and even an Israeli promise of help to the Syrian government, but it was not clear if any would go to the devastated rebel-held pocket in the northwest.The opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense described the situation in the enclave as “disastrous.”The opposition-held area, centered on the province of Idlib, has been under siege for years, with frequent Russian and government airstrikes. The territory depends on a flow of aid from Turkey for everything from food to medical supplies.U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said 224 buildings in northwestern Syrian were destroyed and at least 325 were damaged, including aid warehouses. The U.N. had been assisting 2.7 million people each month via cross-border deliveries, which could now be disrupted.At a hospital in Idlib, Osama Abdel Hamid said most of his neighbors died when their shared four-story building collapsed. As he fled with his wife and three children, a wooden door fell on them, shielding them from falling debris.“God gave me a new lease on life,” he said.In the small Syrian rebel-held town of Azmarin in the mountains by the Turkish border, the bodies of several dead children, wrapped in blankets, were brought to a hospital.In the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, rescuers pulled two children alive from the rubble, and one could be seen lying on a stretcher on the snowy ground. Turkish broadcaster CNN Turk said a woman was pulled out alive in Gaziantep after a rescue dog detected her.In Adana, 20 or so people, some in emergency rescue jackets, used power saws atop the concrete mountain of a collapsed building to open up space for any survivors to climb out or be rescued.“I don’t have the strength anymore,” one survivor could be heard calling out from beneath the rubble of another building in Adana as rescue workers tried to reach him, said Muhammet Fatih Yavuz, a local resident.In Diyarbakir, hundreds of rescue workers and civilians formed lines across a huge mound of wreckage, passing down broken concrete pieces and household belongings as they searched for trapped survivors.At least 2,921 people were killed in 10 Turkish provinces, with nearly 16,000 injured, according to Turkish authorities.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801447,"Murphy scores season-high 30, Pelicans top Kings 136-104","NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Trey Murphy III highlighted his season-high 30-point performance with six 3-pointers — a couple from well behind the arc — and the New Orleans Pelicans overcame the absence of several starters to beat the Sacramento Kings 136-104 on Sunday night.

            “Just got to keep shooting, no matter if you hitting or not,” said Murphy, who'd missed 21 of 31 from deep in his previous five games. “Eventually, your percentage is gong to get to where it's supposed to be. So, I'm just glad my teammates found me and I was able knock down shots.” 

            CJ McCollum scored 24 points for the Pelicans, who shot 57.1% overall and combined to hit 14 of 26 from 3-point range after struggling from deep throughout their recent 10-game losing streak.











            Willy Hernangomez had 22 points and 16 rebounds, and Naji Marshall scored 17 points for New Orleans, which led by as many as 35 points en route to a second straight victory.

            In addition to being without All-Star forward Zion Williamson (right hamstring) for an 18th straight game, the Pelicans also took the floor without high-scoring wing Brandon Ingram and starting center Jonas Valanciunas.

            Ingram, who recently returned from a left big toe injury, was given the night off after scoring 35 points in a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday night. Valanciunas sat out after leaving the Lakers game with a sore right quadriceps muscle.

            “All the guys understood that we were down a few guys, so we needed to step up,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “Everyone that touched the floor today, they contributed. It started with our defense, getting deflections, challenging shots, rebounding the ball and we just played fast tonight.”

            Malik Monk scored 16 for the Kings, who lost their second straight game without De'Aaron Fox. He is away from the team for unspecified personal reasons. Domantas Sabonis had 12 points and 11 rebounds, while Trey Lyles scored 12.

            “We’ve had a pretty good year so far and we've experienced a lot of highs. And now we've hit a little adversity,” Kings coach Mike Brown said. 

            “I don't know if we're all in like we talked about at the beginning of the year and how we've been because things are flowing and we're winning and in third place or whatever,"" Brown continued. “I'm going to watch and see how we all handle this. It's tough to go through, but it's a great thing for this team to experience. Because if we expect to make the playoffs and we do expect to advance in the playoffs, we'll have to deal with adversity. ... And, right now, I don't think we're doing a great job with it.”

            Murphy attempted 11 shots, hitting nine, including a soaring dunk set up by his ball fake at the start of a baseline drive.

            “B.I. was out, so somebody had to be B.I.,” Murphy said, referring to Ingram. “So, I decided to tap into my B.I. skillset.”

            New Orleans scored the first five points of the game, led by as many as 20 in the first half and never trailed.

            After allowing 70 first-half points in their previous two games, the Pelicans scored that many in the first half against Sacramento, going ahead 70-50 on Kira Lewis Jr.'s 3 before Monk's driving finger-roll made it 70-52 at halftime.

            The lead grew to 30 when Larry Nance Jr.'s free throw made it 80-50 less than six minutes into the third period. Minutes later, Murphy's rainbow 3 from 29 feet made it 93-60.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801448,"Knicks rally from 21 points down, beat 76ers 108-97","NEW YORK (AP) — Julius Randle had 24 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, Jalen Brunson scored 21 points and the New York Knicks overcame an early 21-point deficit to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 108-97 on Sunday night.

            Evan Fournier came off the bench to add 17 points for the Knicks, who were playing a night after an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. 

            “It was great,” Randle said. “I think the biggest difference between last night and tonight, where I thought we could have won, was tonight it was our defense.” 











            Joel Embiid had 31 points for the 76ers, going 18 of 19 from the free throw line, and grabbed 14 rebounds.

            Philadelphia had won nine of its previous 10 games. The 76ers also blew a 21-point lead in a 119-109 loss to Orlando on Monday.

            “It’s never easy,” Embiid said. “A 20-point lead in the NBA, that’s nothing. Any team can come back and that’s what they did tonight.” 

            Philadelphia went ahead by 21 points in the first quarter, but the Knicks continued to chip away and cut it to 53-51 at halftime. 

            Randle’s 3-pointer to start the second half put New York ahead 54-53, its first lead since 2-0. 

            Philadelphia went back up by eight and led 79-76 heading into the fourth quarter. 

            Tyrese Maxey opened the final quarter with a three-point play, but the Knicks scored the next 10 points and capped a 15-2 run on Fournier’s 3-pointer, giving them a 91-84 lead.

            They never trailed again.

            “I thought our second unit came in and struggled,” 76ers coach Doc Rivers said. “This is the second time that has happened. The same thing happened in Orlando. Both times, we were scoring too easy. The second group comes in and thinks this is an offensive game and they didn’t see the reason the first group got the lead was because of defense.”

            “Jaycob has shown with his play this season that he is a responsible defenseman that can be relied on in all situations,” Seattle general manager Ron Francis said. “He provides welcome depth to our defensive group and we are happy to have him join our organization.”











            The 6-foot-6, 220-pound Megna will add some size and bulk to Seattle’s lineup. Megna ranked fifth for San Jose in both blocked shots and hits. 

            Megna previously played for Anaheim for parts of three seasons between 2016-19. The 48 games played this season is a career-high for the 30-year-old.

                Along with Jokic (left hamstring tightness), Denver was without Jamal Murray (left knee injury management), Aaron Gordon (left ankle sprain) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (right ankle sprain), who didn’t travel after playing in the Nuggets’ 128-108 win at home against Atlanta the previous night.

            Michael Porter Jr., the lone regular starter in the lineup, led Denver with 22 points. Christian Braun added 19 points for the Nuggets. Denver shot just 39.5% from the field and committed 14 turnovers in the first half, trailing by 25 at one point.

            “Without four starters, you have to almost play perfect to give yourself a chance,” Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. “Turnovers fueled their break, 24 fast-break points. Just too many breakdowns on both ends of the floor for us to even have a chance to be competitive tonight.”

            Without Jokic and Murray, and choosing not to play Bones Hyland, Denver was without a primary ball-handler. Bruce Brown, a reserve swingman, was the de facto point guard. He finished with 16 points and seven assists.

            The Nuggets finished with a season-high 21 turnovers leading to 32 points for Minnesota.

            “We’re just playing free and easy but, obviously, a little bit too free and a little bit too easy, at times,” Malone said.

            Meanwhile, Minnesota did what it needed to do against a short-handed team, controlling play from the beginning.

            The Timberwolves went on a 25-5 run from the end of the first quarter and start of the second, and never looked back.

            “In games like these, you kind of play down to the competition,” said Minnesota forward Jaden McDaniels, who had 14 points. “So, just made it seem like all their starters were out there and just playing with aggression.”

            QUICK TURNAROUND

            Malone called the timing and travel of the back-to-back to Minnesota “ridiculous” before the game, pointing out there were just 22 hours between tip-offs.

            “When I told our players that, a veteran like Jeff Green looked at me like I was crazy,” Malone said before the game. “He said, ‘That’s not allowed. That’s not legal.’ And, obviously, it is.”

            Malone said he “hopes” that all four starters will return for the next game.

            TIP-INS

            Nuggets: Hyland, who is rumored to potentially be on the move prior to Thursday’s trade deadline, didn’t play despite the lack of a primary ball handler. … Jokic had played four games in a row but did miss four games in January. … Braun, Brown, Vlatko Cancar and DeAndre Jordan were the fill-in starters.

            Timberwolves: Backup point guard Jordan McLaughlin returned after missing 30 games with a left calf strain. … Starting forward Kyle Anderson left the game with a recurrence of back spasms. He didn’t play in the second half after playing less than five minutes in the previous game due to the injury. … Austin Rivers served the first of his three-game suspension for his part in Friday’s fight between Minnesota and the Orlando Magic. ... The Wolves had 72 points in the paint.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801489,China claims kinship with Taiwan in threatening video,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — China’s Eastern Theater Command has released a questionable video celebrating the Lantern Festival and ties with Taiwan, which has received a lot of flak.The combat group is headquartered in Nanjing, China, and its theater of responsibility includes the Taiwan Strait. The one minute 25 second video production includes the usual shots of red lanterns and touching family moments, jarringly interspersed with threatening images of war and military strength.It caught the attention of the TVBS anchor and military correspondent Tingting Liu (劉亭廷), who described it on Twitter as “quite disturbing to many in TW” (Taiwan).It starts with a facetime call between a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) jet fighter dad and his daughter, who reminds him it's the Lantern Festival. He tells her he will not forget and will “hang moon lights” for her when he flies that night — the point being the moon represents unity and togetherness.This wishful thinking on the part of China’s leadership plays out with shots of jets scrambling on patrols, warships menacing, and soldiers in action. The video follows up with images of missile launchers.Interestingly, the video shows footage from Eastern Theater Command exercises that menaced Taiwan after the visit of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August. It also launched multiple missiles in waters around Taiwan.Eastern Theater Command is responsible for ramping up daily incursions on Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ), and crossing the Taiwan Strait median line. It also regularly holds military drills in the area.Finally, in the video, there are images of traveling and new year celebrations in Taiwan and China, with a voiceover saying, “Protect the good old days of families on both sides of the strait.”Liu commented: “While the execution of this video is different from the usual militaristic-centric approach favored by the (Eastern Theater Command), the messaging remains consistent with the (CCP’s) stance of (unification) with Taiwan by force if necessary.”Other comments included:Passive aggressive creepiness.Hahahaha. “Let’s reunite and celebrate the Lantern Festival, but also here are all my guns I will use on you if you don’t” -China",2023/2/6,6041,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801490,Taiwan garbage collectors return red envelopes back to community,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Sanitation workers in Hsinchu are so loved by the community that they are frequently the recipients of red envelopes containing cash over the Lunar New Year.The Hsinchu City Government generally discourages the practice, preferring to focus on the duty of trash collection. But still, there are some occasions when sanitation workers simply cannot return red envelopes as the citizen has simply run off and left them holding a red envelope.When it is impossible to refuse or return such gifts from the public, sanitation teams, which include street sweepers and those who drive garbage trucks or sort recycling, are asked to surrender these red envelopes to a government office with the intention of giving them back to the community. In the past seven years, these red envelopes have amounted to some NT$320,000 (US$10,000).Over the most recent Lunar New Year, the Hsinchu City Bureau of Environmental Protection said it received 282 red envelopes, totaling NT$76,021. This averages out to NT$269 per red envelope.Donations come from all walks of life who want to thank sanitation workers for their hard work, especially during the holiday period when many undertake housecleaning, and the amount of garbage, including furniture, can be overwhelming. Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an (高虹安) called upon the city's Environmental Protection Bureau to publicize and remind civil servants to not accept gifts for personal gain.A nice gesture best to be avoided. (Taoyuan City Government photo)This meant that all red envelopes obtained had to be handed over to the Department of Civil Service Ethics and handled in accordance with regulations. In the end, funds are generally distributed to causes which benefit needy families in the community.“For many years, we told the public sanitation workers only collect garbage, not collect red envelopes. However, over Lunar New Year, many force our workers to take these red envelopes and then just run away,” said Hsinchu City Bureau of Environmental Protection Director Chiang Sheng-jen (江盛任) in a UDN report.Nonetheless, he expressed his gratitude to the public for their enthusiasm and support of sanitation workers and hopes that they will transfer these good feelings into everyday activities like sorting, recycling and reducing garbage, as well as jointly maintaining the overall cleanliness of the city and creating a clean, sustainable, and livable Hsinchu City.",2023/2/6,3388,Environment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801530,Truex wins NASCAR's sloppy return to Los Angeles Coliseum,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Martin Truex Jr. won NASCAR's return to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for its season-opening exhibition race — a sloppy Sunday night extravaganza in which the Wiz Khalifa halftime show might have been the most entertaining part of the event. 

            Truex took the lead with 25 laps to go in the Busch Light Clash, a 150-lap race that was moved from Daytona International Speedway last year to the Coliseum. NASCAR built a temporary quarter-mile track inside the iconic venue in a bold attempt to try something radically different. 

            Truex, who contemplated retirement during last year’s winless season, won for the first time since Sept. 11, 2021.











            “Last year was a pretty rough season for us with no wins, and to come out here and kick it off this way, really proud of all these guys,” Truex said. 

            Last year's race was considered a smashing success based on the new fans drawn to the event and excitement over the progressive approach to creating a brand new type of racing. 

            NASCAR knew it was going to be difficult to duplicate the success in its return and the racing Sunday wasn't great — there were 25 cautions, and laps under yellow didn't count. There were only five cautions in last year's race. 

            “Last year’s show I felt like was relatively clean and good racing, some bumping, some banging, but we could run long stretches of green flag action,” said Kyle Busch. ""Today was, I would call it a disaster with the disrespect from everybody of just driving through each other. 

            “But it’s a quarter mile. It’s tight-quarters racing. Actually this is probably how it should have gone last year, so we got spoiled with a good show the first year. Maybe this was just normal.” 

            Truex put Joe Gibbs Racing in victory lane to start 2023 after a horrible close to last year. Coy Gibbs, who essentially ran his father's race team, passed away in his sleep the night before the November season finale. Coy Gibbs' death came just hours after his son, Ty, won NASCAR's second-tier Xfinity Series championship. 

            Austin Dillon and Busch, in his debut for Richard Childress Racing, finished second and third for RCR. They joined Truex on a podium for a NASCAR-first medal ceremony held below the Coliseum's famed peristyle. 

            Alex Bowman and Kyle Larson went fourth and fifth for Hendrick Motorsports, and Tyler Reddick was sixth in his debut for 23XI. 

            “It's tough when it takes 45 minutes to make like six laps,” Bowman said of the messy race. “That was pretty bad when we were just crashing and crashing and crashing.”

            Ryan Preece, in his debut race for Stewart-Haas Racing, led 43 laps until a late electrical issue took him out of contention. Before Sunday night, Preece had led a total of 25 laps in 115 Cup races over five seasons. Preece finished seventh.

            Bubba Wallace was dominant early for 23XI but was spun late by Dillon and then banged into Dillon after to show his displeasure. He finished 22nd after leading 40 laps. 

            “I hate it for Bubba, he had a good car and a good run,” Dillon said. “But you can’t tell who’s either pushing him or getting pushed. I just know he sent me through the corner and I saved it three times through there, released the brake and all kinds of stuff, and then when I got down, I was going to give the same. Probably was a little too hard.” 

            LCQ's 

            The format of the exhibition Clash included heat races and a pair of 50-lap “last chance qualifiers” to help drivers make the 27-car field. Three drivers from each of the LCQ's advanced: Michael McDowell, Christopher Bell and Todd Gilliland advanced from the first race, and Chase Elliott, Ty Gibbs, and AJ Allmendinger advanced from the second. 

            Those who did not advance to compete in the main event were Brad Keselowski and RFK Racing teammate Chris Buescher, Harrison Burton of The Wood Brothers, Corey LaJoie and Ty Dillon of Spire Motorsports, and Cody Ware and J.J. Yeley for Rick Ware Racing, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. of JTG Racing and B.J. McLeod of Live Fast Motorsports. 

            JOHNSON SCHEDULE

            Jimmie Johnson made his return to NASCAR on Sunday as team co-owner of Legacy Motor Club, which fields two cars for Erik Jones and Noah Gragson. The seven-time NASCAR champion spent the past two years racing IndyCar and will run a limited scheduled this season that includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans. 

            Johnson was already entered in the Daytona 500 later this month, then said Sunday he will also enter NASCAR's first-ever street course race, scheduled for downtown Chicago in July.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801531,Morant says friend banned from arena over Pacers dispute,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant tweeted Sunday that a friend of his has been banned from games at FedExForum for a year as a result of a confrontation between his supporters and members of the Indiana Pacers organization a week earlier.

            The NBA confirmed that unnamed individuals have been banned from the arena, while adding that its investigation found no evidence that anyone was threatened with a weapon during the incident, which happened after the Grizzlies beat the Pacers on Jan. 29.

            Citing unnamed sources, The Indianapolis Star and USA Today reported that multiple members of the Pacers saw a red dot pointed at them, and The Athletic reported that a Pacers security guard believed the laser was attached to a gun.











            “NBA Security and league investigators conducted an investigation interviewing numerous eyewitnesses and reviewing video surveillance following allegations made by the Indiana Pacers organization regarding a postgame incident on Jan. 29. While we substantiated that a postgame situation arose that was confrontational, based on interviews and other evidence gathered, we could not corroborate that any individual threatened others with a weapon,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in an emailed statement.

            ""Certain individuals involved in the postgame situation and a related matter during the game that night have been subsequently banned from attending games in the arena. If additional information becomes available related to the postgame situation, the league office will conduct a further review,” Bass' statement continued.

            Morant didn't play in the Grizzlies' 106-103 loss to Toronto on Sunday because of right wrist soreness and was not available for comment after the game.

            Before the game, Morant tweeted that reports about the incident “paint this negative image on me and my fam. & banned my brother from home games for a year. unbelievable.”

            During the Jan. 29 game, there was barking between Pacers players and friends of Morant seated along the sideline. A close friend of Morant's, Davonte Pack, was escorted from the arena as Pacers bench players shouted in Pack's direction.

            The talking reportedly continued into the players’ parking area after the game.

            Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the team addressed the matter internally.

            “Aware of the investigation of the NBA. Did a full investigation,” Jenkins said. ""We were fully compliant with it, and I think they came out with a statement saying nothing was corroborated or found.

            “That's what I know, and that's all I'm going to comment on it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801532,"Rose leads by 2 at weather-delayed Pebble, Ancer wins Saudi","PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — Justin Rose was a steady presence on a day of weather that changed by the minute, playing 19 holes in 9-under par and leaving the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am in the dark Sunday with a two-shot lead.

            The final round of the wind-delayed tournament was to be completed Monday morning, and the 42-year-old Rose was in position to win for the first time in four years.

            He was at 15-under par through nine holes — his shot safely in the 10th fairway — when the final round was stopped as the sun dipped behind the Pacific horizon.











            Denny McCarthy, who started the final round six shots behind, shot 29 on the front nine at Pebble Beach to soar into contention. He chose to continue the 16th hole, hitting his approach to 15 feet and then choosing to mark his ball and stop for the night.

            He was at 13-under par, along with Brendon Todd (through 12 holes) and Peter Malnati, who was in the final group with Rose.

            Taylor Pendrith of Canada was among 20 players who finished. He went out in 31 and played bogey-free for a 64 to post at 12-under 275. That was three shots behind Rose, but worth sticking around to see how it unfolded.

            The only winner Sunday was Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who with Ben Silverman of Canada won the pro-am. Because of the wind and other weather delays, the pro-am was cut to 54 holes, leaving only professionals for the final round.

            ASIAN TOUR

            KING ABDULLAH ECONOMIC CITY, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Abraham Ancer of Mexico closed with a 2-under 68 for a two-shot victory Sunday over Cameron Young in the Saudi International.

            Ancer capped off a wire-to-wire victory, which featured a majority of the Saudi-funded LIV Golf league. It was his third worldwide victory.

            Young, the PGA Tour rookie of the year, received a release to compete in the Asian Tour event. It was his sixth runner-up finish in the last 16 months. He caught Ancer briefly on the front nine until a two-shot swing on eighth home — Ancer made birdie, Young made a bogey — that restored Ancer’s two-shot lead.

            Lucas Herbert of Australia had a 65 and finished third.

            EUROPEAN TOUR

            RAS AL KHAIMAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Daniel Gavins won the Ras Al Khaimah Championship on Sunday after a wild finish that saw the Englishman twice find the water on the last hole before rolling in the winning putt from 26 feet for double bogey.

            Gavins shot 3-under 69, then had to wait to see if Zander Lombard — the third-round leader playing in the final group — could eagle the par-5 18th to force a playoff. Lombard’s eagle putt missed right. Gavins captured his second European tour title.

            Lombard (72) and Alexander Bjork (68) tied for second. Bjork — playing in the group ahead of Gavins — made a costly bogey on the last hole.

            Gavins sliced his tee shot into the water. Then, after finding the middle of the fairway with his third shot, Gavins hit a fairway wood that veered right, bounced off the rocks and plopped into the water again.

            Unaware of Bjork's bogey and thinking his lead was two, Gavins thought his putt for double bogey was to force a playoff. It turned out to be the winner.

            KORN FERRY TOUR

            PANAMA CITY (AP) — Pierceson Coody closed with a 4-under 66 and then made birdie on the first extra hole to win a three-man playoff Sunday at the Panama Championship.

            Coody, the grandson of Masters champion Charles Coody, won for the second time in two years on the Korn Ferry Tour after finishing at Texas.

            Sam Saunders, the grandson of Arnold Palmer, and Mac Meissner made par in the playoff. Saunders had a 67 and Meissner a 68 to join Coody in the playoff at 3-under 277.

            OTHER TOURS

            Benjamin Follett-Smith closed with a 2-under 70 and won the Bain's Whisky Cape Town Challenge by one shot over Jaco van Zyl and Ugo Coussaud.

Aditi Ashok of India closed with a 74 and still won the Magical Kenya Ladies Open by nine shots on the Ladies European Tour.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801534,China accuses US of indiscriminate use of force over balloon,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Monday accused the United States of indiscriminate use of force in shooting down a suspected Chinese spy balloon, saying it “seriously impacted and damaged both sides’ efforts and progress in stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations.”

            The U.S. shot down the balloon off the Carolina coast after it traversed sensitive military sites across North America. China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian aircraft.

            Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said he lodged a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy on Sunday over the “U.S. attack on a Chinese civilian unmanned airship by military force.” 











            “However, the United States turned a deaf ear and insisted on indiscriminate use of force against the civilian airship that was about to leave the United States airspace, obviously overreacted and seriously violated the spirit of international law and international practice,” Xie said. 

            The presence of the balloon in the skies above the U.S. dealt a severe blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years. It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing tensions. 

            Xie repeated China’s insistence that the balloon was a Chinese civil unmanned airship that blew into U.S. airspace by mistake, calling it “an accidental incident caused by force majeure.” 

            China will “resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies, resolutely safeguard China’s interests and dignity and reserve the right to make further necessary responses,” he said. 

            U.S. President Joe Biden issued the shootdown order after he was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing down the balloon over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.

            “What the U.S. has done has seriously impacted and damaged both sides’ efforts and progress in stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations since the Bali meeting,” Xie said, referring to a recent meeting between Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Indonesia that many hoped would create positive momentum for improving ties that have plunged to their lowest level in years. 

            Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning provided no new details on Monday, repeating China's insistence that the object was a civilian balloon intended for meteorological research, had little ability to steer and entered U.S. airspace by accidentally diverging from its course. She also did not say what additional steps China intended to take in response to Washington's handling of the issue and cancellation of Blinken's trip, which would have made him the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

            “We have stated that this is completely an isolated and accidental incident caused by force majeure, but the U.S. still hyped up the incident on purpose and even used force to attack,"" Mao said at a daily briefing. “This is an unacceptable and irresponsible action.""

            Balloons thought or known to be Chinese have been spotted from Latin America to Japan. Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki told reporters Monday that a flying object similar to the one shot down by the U.S. had been spotted at least twice over northern Japan since 2020.

            “We are continuing to analyze them in connection with the latest case in the United States,"" he said.

            Mao confirmed that a balloon recently spotted over Latin American was Chinese, describing it as a civilian airship used for flight tests.

            “Affected by weather and due to its limited self-control ability, the airship severely deviated from its set route and entered the space of Latin America and the Caribbean by accident,” Mao said. 

            Washington and Beijing are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights, but China is most sensitive over alleged violations by the U.S. and others of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. 

            Beijing strongly protests U.S. military sales to Taiwan and visits by foreign politicians to the island, which it claims as Chinese territory, to be recovered by force if necessary. 

            It reacted to a 2022 visit by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi by firing missiles over the island and staging threatening military drills seen as a rehearsal for an invasion or blockade. Beijing also cut off discussion with the U.S. on issues including climate change that are unrelated to military tensions.

            Last week, Mao warned Pelosi’s successor, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, not to travel to Taiwan, implying that China’s response would be equally vociferous. 

            “China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,” Mao said. McCarthy said China had no right to dictate where and when he could travel. 

            China also objects when foreign military surveillance planes fly off its coast in international airspace and when U.S. and other foreign warships pass through the Taiwan Strait, accusing them of being actively provocative. 

            In 2001, a U.S. Navy plane conducting routine surveillance near the Chinese coast collided with a Chinese fighter plane, killing the Chinese fighter pilot and damaging the American plane, which was forced to make an emergency landing at a Chinese naval airbase on the southern Chinese island province of Hainan. China detained the 24-member U.S. Navy aircrew for 10 days until the U.S. expressed regret over the Chinese pilot’s death and for landing at the base without permission.

            The South China Sea is another major source of tension. China claims the strategically key sea virtually in its entirety and protests when U.S. Navy ships sail past Chinese military features there. 

            At a news conference Friday with his South Korean counterpart, Blinken said “the presence of this surveillance balloon over the United States in our skies is a clear violation of our sovereignty, a clear violation of international law, and clearly unacceptable. And we’ve made that clear to China.”

            “Any country that has its airspace violated in this way I think would respond similarly, and I can only imagine what the reaction would be in China if they were on the other end,” Blinken said.

            China’s weather balloon explanation should be dismissed outright, said Oriana Skylar Mastro, an expert on Chinese military affairs and foreign policy at Stanford University.

            “This is like a standard thing that countries often say about surveillance assets,” Mastro said.

            China may have made a mistake and lost control of the balloon, but it was unlikely to have been a deliberate attempt to disrupt Blinken’s visit, Mastro said.

            For the U.S. administration, the decision to go public and then shoot down the balloon marks a break from its usual approach of dealing with Beijing on such matters privately, possibly in hopes of changing China’s future behavior. 

            However, Mastro said, it was unlikely that Beijing would respond positively.

            “They’re probably going to dismiss that and continue on as things have been. So I don’t see a really clear pathway to improved relations in the foreseeable future.”

That is the equivalent to more than eight people dying on Taiwan’s roads every day.The number of road deaths related to motorcycle and scooter riders for the same period was 1,794, while there were 1,294 deaths that occurred at intersections. Deaths related to drunk driving were 253.It was announced that fines for motorists failing to yield to pedestrians at zebra crossings will be raised by 80% in late January, from NT$2,000 to NT$3,600 (US$120). The Ministry of Transportation said that the higher fines should lead to better behavior on the road.Road safety advocate Lin Chih-hsueh (林志學) disagrees with this approach, saying that ""the focus should be on designing better road infrastructure and enhancing drivers' education.""New Power Party legislator Chiu Hsien-chih's (邱顯智) post criticizing the high death toll.",2023/2/6,5763,Society

            On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 fell 1% on Friday to 4,136.48 after the government reported the economy added 517,000 jobs in January. That was double December's 260,000 and more than double the 185,000 expected by economists.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801623,North Korea party meeting set to discuss 'urgent' food issue,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has scheduled a major political conference to discuss the “urgent task” of improving its agricultural sector, a possible sign of worsening food insecurity as the country's economic isolation deepens amid a defiant nuclear weapons push. 

            North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Monday that members of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Politburo met on Sunday and agreed to hold a larger plenary meeting of the party’s Central Committee in late February to review strategies on agriculture and set new goals. It said the Politburo members acknowledged a “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote the radical change in agricultural development.” 

            “It is a very important and urgent task to establish the correct strategy for the development of agriculture and take relevant measures for the immediate farming … to promote the overall development of socialist construction,” the KCNA said.











            The Politburo meeting came amid indications that the country was preparing to stage a massive military parade in Pyongyang, possibly this week, to glorify the rule of leader Kim Jong Un and his growing collection of nuclear-capable weapons, which he has aggressively pushed to expand despite limited resources and economic decay.

            Lee Sung-jun, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military has been detecting “increased activity related to (parade) rehearsals"" in the North, but declined to share a specific assessment on when the event would take place. 

            Although not unprecedented, it’s uncommon for North Korea to hold two different party plenaries in a span of two months. It’s also rare for North Korea to call a plenary meeting over a single agenda, this time agriculture, South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoungsam said in a briefing. 

            “The government will closely watch North Korea’s food situation and internal trends,” said Koo. He said South Korea estimates that North Korean food production fell by about 4% in 2022 to 4.5 million tons.

            Following the collapse of nuclear negotiations with the United States in 2019, Kim declared to strengthen his nuclear weapons and missile program against “gangster-like” U.S. sanctions and pressure and urged his nation to stay resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance. 

            But the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed further shock on North Korea’s already broken economy, by forcing the nation to shield its poor healthcare system with strict border controls that choked off trade with China, its main ally and economic lifeline. The country was also hit with devastating typhoons and floods in 2020 that decimated crops.

            In a study published on the North Korea-focused 38 North website last month, analyst Lucas Rengifo-Keller said food insecurity in North Korea is likely at its worst since the country's 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands of people.

            It’s difficult to establish an accurate assessment of North Korea’s humanitarian needs considering the closed nature of its regime and the poor quality of the limited statistics it discloses. But North Korea’s grain balance estimates issued by U.N. agencies and outside governments as well as possibly sharp increases in rice and corn prices observed by NGOs and media indicate that “country’s food supply has probably failed to satisfy minimum human needs,” Rengifo-Keller wrote. 

            Russia’s war on Ukraine likely worsened the situation by driving up global prices of food, energy and fertilizer, on which North Korea’s agricultural production is heavily dependent. 

            “Put simply, North Korea teeters on the brink of famine,” Rengifo-Keller said. 

            The Workers’ Party’s Central Committee also held a plenary meeting in December, when Kim doubled down on his nuclear ambitions by calling an “exponential increase” of nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nukes targeting rival South Korea and the development of more powerful long-range missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland. 

            Party members also during the meeting identified key economic projects for 2023, highlighted by agricultural and construction activities.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea has scheduled a major political conference to discuss the “urgent task” of improving its agricultural sector, a possible sign of worsening food insecurity as the country's economic isolation deepens amid a defiant nuclear weapons push.North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Monday that members of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Politburo met on Sunday and agreed to hold a larger plenary meeting of the party’s Central Committee in late February to review strategies on agriculture and set new goals.

The country was also hit with devastating typhoons and floods in 2020 that decimated crops.In a study published on the North Korea-focused 38 North website last month, analyst Lucas Rengifo-Keller said food insecurity in North Korea is likely at its worst since the country's 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands of people.It’s difficult to establish an accurate assessment of North Korea’s humanitarian needs considering the closed nature of its regime and the poor quality of the limited statistics it discloses. But North Korea’s grain balance estimates issued by U.N. agencies and outside governments as well as possibly sharp increases in rice and corn prices observed by NGOs and media indicate that “country’s food supply has probably failed to satisfy minimum human needs,” Rengifo-Keller wrote.Russia’s war on Ukraine likely worsened the situation by driving up global prices of food, energy and fertilizer, on which North Korea’s agricultural production is heavily dependent.“Put simply, North Korea teeters on the brink of famine,” Rengifo-Keller said.The Workers’ Party’s Central Committee also held a plenary meeting in December, when Kim doubled down on his nuclear ambitions by calling an “exponential increase” of nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nukes targeting rival South Korea and the development of more powerful long-range missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland.Party members also during the meeting identified key economic projects for 2023, highlighted by agricultural and construction activities.",2023/2/6,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801654,Key Republican wants Ga. as early primary state — in 2028,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wants his state to become an early presidential primary host — just not in 2024, as President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are pushing.

            The Republican election chief, who garnered attention for rebuffing then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia, told The Associated Press he’d back an early primary in 2028.

            It’s the first time Raffensperger, who sets Georgia's primary election dates, has endorsed the idea of Georgia as an early nominating state, though not as soon as the Democratic National Committee and the White House want. 











            “Georgia would be a great early primary state in 2028,” Raffensperger told the AP.

            “It has a good cross-section of engaged voters from both parties, and, as everyone seems to now recognize, we run great elections,” the secretary added in a dig at Democrats’ assertions that he and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp have worked to limit ballot access.

            Raffensperger’s position highlights the Democrats' challenge in reordering their nominating calendar to elevate racially diverse electorates and de-emphasize Iowa and New Hampshire. Those overwhelmingly white states have opened the nominating process for both major parties for decades and still lead Republicans’ 2024 calendar as it's currently set — with national GOP officials showing little interest in reconsidering their slate. 

            The secretary's announcement nonetheless shows Democrats aren’t alone in wanting Georgia, now a premier general election battleground, to expand its burgeoning influence into presidential nominating politics.

            The question is whether Democrats can find momentum among the Republicans who control the Georgia statehouse and with the national GOP forces necessary to make such a change. That's decidedly harder than Atlanta's push to win the 2024 Democratic convention, a decision that will be made entirely within the party.

            Top Georgia Democrats including Sen. Raphael Warnock and U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta support a presidential primary move, and the state party’s former executive director, Scott Hogan, has taken on the role of the top unofficial lobbyist for the idea, reaching out to Republicans and the business community.

            “This isn’t just a political conversation. This is very much an economic conversation,” Williams, who is also the state Democratic chairwoman, said in an interview before Raffensperger's latest statements about the matter. “It’s a benefit across the board, whether Republicans or Democrats.”

            Audrey Haynes, a University of Georgia professor tracking the debate, cited studies showing how much more influential an average American voter becomes when they live in an early nominating state. The economic boon, she added, ranges from candidates' television advertising to a year's worth of tourism and consumer spending by traveling national media and the top campaigns' permanent field staffers.

            “There's just all this spending to go along with the attention on voters and on local elected officials,” Haynes said.

            Under the Democratic National Committee plan approved Saturday, the party’s 2024 presidential primaries would begin Feb. 3 in South Carolina, the state that propelled Biden’s campaign in 2020. That primary would be followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on Feb. 6, Georgia on Feb. 13 and Michigan on Feb. 27.

            The national party has given Georgia Democrats until June to show they can comply with that calendar, though deadline could be extended.

            Raffensperger noted the Republican National Committee has locked in its 2024 calendar, with the usual opening slate of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The GOP also plans to limit convention delegates from states that move up to disrupt that traditional quartet.

            “This type of move would need to be equitable, take place on the same day, and ensure that no one loses delegates,” Raffensperger said, offering no indications that he’d try to persuade the RNC to reconsider.

            Jordan Fuchs, Raffensperger’s deputy, said calendar reshuffles must “at the start” be a “bipartisan decision,” a tacit acknowledgement that Biden being the genesis of Democrats’ plan does it no favors in Georgia.

            “Just because one party is pushing it doesn’t mean it has bipartisan support,” she said.

            Williams, the Democratic chairwoman, nonetheless suggested in response to Raffensperger’s latest position that the secretary has created an opening on the issue. Stakeholders from both parties and the business lobby, she said, “agree that Georgia is the perfect state to host an early presidential primary.” She said Democrats “look forward to continuing to work alongside all those with a vested interest in Georgia to secure this long-term source of investment in our state.”

            Kemp, meanwhile, has given no public sign that he wants a change ahead of 2024. Additionally, Kemp’s advisers have noted he has no official role in setting the primary dates.

            That said, Kemp is at the apex of his influence as a second-term, battleground governor who won reelection by nearly 8 percentage points; he defeated Democratic power player Stacey Abrams for a second time after dominating a Republican primary challenger who had Trump's backing. So he would be key in any eventual shift.

            A top Kemp adviser, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record about an issue the governor isn't actively pursuing and requested anonymity, said Kemp and his inner circle do not dispute the long-term benefits Georgia would accrue as an early state.

            Yet the considerations for the GOP aren’t as straightforward as for Democrats.

            Multiple recent presidential cycles — Barack Obama’s nomination in 2008, Hillary Clinton’s in 2016 and Biden’s in 2020 — have highlighted the power Black voters in the South already have in Democratic politics. Biden’s path was especially emphatic, as he stormed to the nomination in a matter of weeks after finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire, effectively highlighting their shortcomings as Democratic bellwethers. Those two states, though, still reflect the Republican Party’s overwhelmingly white base, giving the GOP little incentive to depose them.

            National Democrats, meanwhile, have made clear they want their early nominating window to be stacked with November battlegrounds; that would give their eventual nominee early exposure in key Electoral College states. Georgia Republicans, conversely, are still adjusting to their state's tossup status after dominating at all levels of government for decades before 2020, when Georgia opted narrowly for Biden and two Democratic senators. 

            “I certainly believe it’s a two-party state,” said Chip Lake, a veteran GOP campaign operative. “But the conversations among Democrats on what all this means at the presidential level is just more advanced than it is for Republicans right now,” Lake said.

            And, he added, Kemp’s previous statements have effectively cut off any bipartisan movement on primaries.

            “No one,” Lake said, “wants to get out in front of the governor.”ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wants his state to become an early presidential primary host — just not in 2024, as President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are pushing.The Republican election chief, who garnered attention for rebuffing then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia, told The Associated Press he’d back an early primary in 2028.It’s the first time Raffensperger, who sets Georgia's primary election dates, has endorsed the idea of Georgia as an early nominating state, though not as soon as the Democratic National Committee and the White House want.“Georgia would be a great early primary state in 2028,” Raffensperger told the AP.“It has a good cross-section of engaged voters from both parties, and, as everyone seems to now recognize, we run great elections,” the secretary added in a dig at Democrats’ assertions that he and Republican Gov.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801656,Sinema's split from Democrats shows party discord in Arizona,"PHOENIX (AP) — Kyrsten Sinema won Democrats a U.S. Senate seat from Arizona for the first time in a generation thanks in no small part to unity in her party and division among Republicans.

            That Democratic unity of 2018 was on display again in the next two election cycles as the party picked up Arizona’s other Senate seat and won the top three state offices.

            But that winning formula is in jeopardy ahead of the 2024 election because of Sinema’s estrangement and subsequent divorce from the Democratic Party, which could complicate President Joe Biden’s path to reelection and the party’s hopes for maintaining control of the Senate. She registered as an independent shortly after last year's midterm elections.











            Democrats are already voicing fears that a three-way race with Sinema picking up votes from both Democrats and independents could hand the seat to a Republican such as Kari Lake, the failed gubernatorial candidate and one of the country's most prominent election deniers.

            “If there were ever a time for her to listen to her constituents for once, it’d be now,” said Alex Gomez, executive director of the Latino organizing group Living United for Change in Arizona, which has tangled with Sinema for years. “She needs to step aside. The potential candidacy of a Kari Lake presents a clear and present danger to our democracy.”

            Sinema has not said whether she will seek reelection, and Lake has not announced a Senate campaign. But the race already has a Democratic candidate in U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Latino military veteran who kicked off his campaign last month after spending years as one of Sinema’s chief antagonists.

            Gallego says he raised more than $1 million on his first day in the race, capitalizing on pent-up anger with Sinema among Democrats.

            The Senate race is not the only new sign of Democratic division in the state. The Arizona Democratic Party last month had its first contested election for chair in 12 years, pitting a candidate backed by Gov. Katie Hobbs against one backed by most of the state’s other elected Democrats.

            The party elected longtime union leader Yolanda Bejarano, who was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, Gallego and others, bucking the tradition of deferring to the preference of a Democratic governor. Hobbs said Thursday she had not yet spoken to Bejarano — nearly a week after the election.

            The party discord in Arizona reverberates beyond the state.

            Next year, Democrats, who have a narrow 51-49 Senate majority, are defending seats in 23 states — including seven where Donald Trump won at least once. That includes Arizona, where Trump won in 2016 but where Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the state in more than two decades.

            Sinema's political career began with roots in the progressive left and antiwar movement. She first ran for office as a Green Party candidate and lost badly, later winning a state legislative seat as a Democrat. She remade herself as a moderate in the U.S. House and parlayed that reputation into a Senate victory.

            Her 2018 Senate win was fueled by a number of factors, including the state’s changing demographics, contempt for Trump among suburban women and Sinema’s spending advantage over Republican Martha McSally.

            But McSally’s 2018 campaign strategists laid some of the blame for her loss on Democratic unity behind Sinema and Republican infighting. With Democrats in lockstep, Sinema had a head start on reaching out to swing voters, while McSally focused on holding the GOP together to win her primary, campaign officials wrote in a memo that circulated widely after the election. 

            When Sinema was sworn into office in 2019, Trump was in the White House, Republicans were in control of both chambers of Congress and Democrats were unified in opposition.

            But her relationship with the party ruptured during Biden's presidency as she teamed up with fellow moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and became a roadblock for parts of the president's agenda and many progressive priorities. 

            She is one of the Senate’s most vociferous defenders of the filibuster rule, which requires 60 of 100 votes to pass most legislation, and which many Democrats say empowers Republicans to overrule the will of the Democratic majority.

            Sinema says she's focused on crafting bipartisan deals that can outlive any one party's control of Congress and points to victories, including a massive infrastructure bill and protections for same-sex marriage. 

            Her transformation from liberal rabble-rouser into Democratic irritant has left the base feeling angry and betrayed just four years after her victory brought Arizona Democrats in from the cold. 

            “As long as Sinema’s off the team, that’s all that matters,” said Dave Crose, a 67-year-old retired mechanical engineer from Sun City who voted for Sinema in 2018 but has grown disillusioned with her. “That’s a bad thing to say, but she screwed everyone in the state, so payback’s her hell.”

            For Democrats, long shut out from the halls of power, winning was enough to paper over ideological divides, but now they have shown they can win and it wasn't a fluke.

            “When you have power, everyone wants a piece and there’s actually something to fight over,” said Barrett Marson, a Republican political consultant in Phoenix aligned with the party’s establishment wing. 

            One thing Democrats have going for them: Republicans aren’t likely to be any less divided than they’ve been since Trump took over the party in 2016.

            With the Sinema vs. Gallego drama raising some uncomfortable questions, Democrats in Arizona and Washington have tried to put off picking sides.

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after Gallego's announcement that “it’s much too early to make a decision” about the 2024 race. 

            Kelly also declined to wade too deeply into the dynamics of a potential three-way race, saying “there’s plenty of time” to sort it out.

            “I’m not going to get ahead of Sen. Sinema on this,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “I’m going to work with both of of them.""

            Notably, however, Hobbs subtly suggested she would not be supporting her old friend Sinema. Hobbs and Sinema are both former social workers who campaigned together for the state Legislature a decade ago, Sinema getting elected to the Senate and Hobbs to the House.

            Congratulating the new Arizona Democratic Party leadership team on Twitter, Hobbs wrote that she looks forward to helping the party “win back our US House & Senate seats.”PHOENIX (AP) — Kyrsten Sinema won Democrats a U.S. Senate seat from Arizona for the first time in a generation thanks in no small part to unity in her party and division among Republicans.That Democratic unity of 2018 was on display again in the next two election cycles as the party picked up Arizona’s other Senate seat and won the top three state offices.But that winning formula is in jeopardy ahead of the 2024 election because of Sinema’s estrangement and subsequent divorce from the Democratic Party, which could complicate President Joe Biden’s path to reelection and the party’s hopes for maintaining control of the Senate.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801657,'Dances With Wolves' actor charged in Nevada sex abuse case,"NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A former “Dances With Wolves” actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous girls and women for two decades in multiple states has been charged in Nevada for crimes that prosecutors said occurred in the Las Vegas-area starting in 2012.

            Nathan Chasing Horse, 46, was formally charged Monday morning during a brief appearance in a North Las Vegas courtroom full of his friends and relatives who had hoped to see him released on bail. But a judge postponed hearing arguments about his custody status until Wednesday to give Chasing Horse's new California-based attorney, Alexandra Kazaria, additional time to obtain permission from the State Bar of Nevada to represent him in the case.

            Nevada law requires prosecutors to present convincing evidence that a defendant should remain in custody. Clark County Deputy District Attorney Jessica Walsh said last week that she expected testimony from Las Vegas police detectives, FBI special agents and victims.











            In the meantime, Chasing Horse is being held without bail at a jail in downtown Las Vegas. He has been in custody since his Jan. 31 arrest near the North Las Vegas home he shares with his five wives. 

            Chasing Horse is charged with eight felonies, including sex trafficking, sexual assault against a child younger than 16, and child abuse, according to a criminal complaint. Prosecutors also filed an additional felony charge Monday in connection with what detectives said were videos saved on a phone showing sexual assaults of a minor. 

            Seated opposite of Chasing Horse's family on Monday, some of the victims and their supporters held signs inside the courtroom reading “NO MORE STOLEN SISTERS” and “WOMEN AREN'T PRISONERS.”

            Rulon Pete, executive director of the Las Vegas Indian Center, said after the hearing that the victims had been prepared “to help out with making sure justice has been served.”

            “Unfortunately there's a lot of anxiety they're experiencing,"" he told The Associated Press after speaking with the victims and prosecutors. ""When this got pushed back, it was like adding more weight to the situation.”

            He did not enter a plea Monday after he was formally charged. In Nevada, defendants do not enter a plea until their criminal case is bound over to a state district court, either after a grand jury indictment or after a judge decides prosecutors have enough evidence for the defendant to stand trial.

            Chasing Horse played the role of Sioux tribe member Smiles a Lot in Kevin Costner’s 1990 Oscar-winning film. 

            Since then, he has built a reputation among tribes across the United States and in Canada as a “medicine man.” Chasing Horse, police said, abused that position and took underage wives over two decades in multiple states, including South Dakota, Montana and Nevada, where he has lived for about a decade. He also was banished from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana, in 2015 following similar allegations.

            Detectives described Chasing Horse in a 50-page search warrant as the leader of a cult known as The Circle, whose followers believed he could communicate with higher powers.

            Pete, of the Las Vegas Indian Center, described the role of the medicine man in their culture as a highly respected leadership post. “They’re like priests, if you will.""

            “You follow what they teach,” he said, adding that the victims have shown great courage by speaking out despite the intimidation and threats Pete said they have faced since Chasing Horse's arrest.

            An arrest report for Chasing Horse shows at least six victims have been identified, including one who was 13 when she said she was abused, and another who said she was offered to him as a “gift” when she was 15.

            After SWAT officers took him into custody last week, detectives searched the family’s home and found guns, 41 pounds (18.5 kilograms) of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms, according to the arrest report.

            The criminal complaint filed Monday also charges Chasing Horse with two misdemeanors in connection with a dead bald eagle and parts of a dead hawk discovered during the search of his property.

            Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801659,Indigenous senator quits party over Australian referendum,"CANBERRA, Australia: (AP) — An Indigenous senator in Australia quit the minor Greens party on Monday in a disagreement over a referendum to be held this year that would create an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.

            Sen. Lidia Thorpe’s resignation illustrates deep divisions among Indigenous Australians on the referendum and increases the difficulty for the government in getting legislation through the Senate.

            The Greens have suggested they will support a referendum likely to be held this year that would enshrine in the constitution a body representing Indigenous people to advise Parliament on policies that effect their lives. It would be known as the Indigenous Voice.











            Thorpe had argued that Australia should first sign a treaty with its original inhabitans that acknowledged that they had never ceded their sovereignty to the British colonists.

            She said after quitting the Greens that the party’s support for the Voice was “at odds with the community of activists who are saying treaty before Voice.”

            “This country has a strong grassroots black sovereign movement full of staunch and committed warriors and I want to represent that movement fully in this Parliament,” Thorpe told reporters. “It has become clear to me that I can’t do that from within the Greens.""

            Another high-profile Indigenous Sen. Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has also spoken out against the Voice, arguing it would divide the nation along racial lines. Her conservative party, the Nationals, took an official position in November to oppose the referendum, prompting a senior lawmaker and Voice advocate Andrew Gee to quit the party.

            Bipartisan support has long been regarded as a prerequisite for a referendum’s success. But despite the divisions, an opinion poll published by The Australian newspaper on Monday found 56% of respondents in favor of the Voice. Opponents accounted from 37% and 7% were undecided.

            The survey of 1,512 voters nationwide was conducted from Feb. 1 to 4. It had a 3 percentage point margin of error.

            Indigenous people accounted for 3.2% of Australia’s population in the 2021 census. Indigenous Australians are the most disadvantaged ethnic group in Australia. They die younger than other Australians, are less likely to be employed, achieve lower education levels and are overrepresented in prison populations.

            Greens leader Adam Bandt and his deputy Mehreen Faruqi said they were sorry Thorpe had decided to leave their progressive party.

            Bandt said he had told Thorpe that the party’s constitution allowed her to take a different position on the Voice from her colleagues.

            Pakistan-born Faruqi said she and Thorpe had worked together as “strong allies against white supremacy and racism in all its forms.”

            “I know that we will continue to work together, this work of decolonization, as well as working for climate justice,” Faruqi said.

            Thorpe said she would continue to work with the Greens on their climate policy. The Greens want Australia to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 75% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade.

            The center-left Labor Party government enshrined in law a 43% target after it was elect in May last year.

            Labor has relied on the Greens’ 12 senators to pass legislation through the upper chamber that the conservative opposition party opposes.

            With the Greens’ support, Labor had only needed to enlist the vote of a single unaligned senator. With Thorpe’s departure, Labor now will need the support of two unaligned senators. 

            Bandt said the government would continue to rely on the Greens to get its legislative agenda through the Senate.

            “The situation remains now still more or less the same in the Senate. The Greens are central in the balance of power in the Senate,” Bandt said.

            Thorpe has proved a radical and divisive element in the Senate. She was criticized for referring to the then-British monarch during a Senate swearing in ceremony in August last year as “the colonizing, her majesty Queen Elizabeth II.” 

            She resigned as the Greens deputy leader in the Senate in October over what Bandt called a “significant lack of judgment” in failing to declare an intimate relationship she had with a former president of a biker gang.CANBERRA, Australia: (AP) — An Indigenous senator in Australia quit the minor Greens party on Monday in a disagreement over a referendum to be held this year that would create an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801660,India's aircraft carriers key to Indo-Pacific strategy,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India is preparing to relaunch its INS Vikramaditya aircraft carrier after a major refit, a critical step toward fulfilling its plan to deploy two carrier battle groups as it seeks to strengthen its regional maritime power to counter China's increasing assertiveness.

            The Vikramaditya, a former Soviet carrier acquired from Russia, is expected to be launched imminently and will join India’s first domestically built carrier that was launched in September, the INS Vikrant, in undergoing outfitting and sea trials, with the plan to have both fully operational later this year.

            “This is significant in terms of India's power projection capabilities, primarily within the Indian Ocean,” said Viraj Solanki, a London-based expert on Indo-Pacific defense with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 











            “This really gives India an option to display its ability to counter China within the Indian Ocean, which is the Indian navy's priority.”

            China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy has been expanding and modernizing for more than a decade and is now the world's largest. In June, it launched its first domestically designed and built aircraft carrier, the country's third overall, as part of a program to extend its range and power and become more of a “blue water” force that can operate globally.

            At the same time, China's People’s Liberation Army has undertaken massive investment in ballistic and cruise missile technology, and the U.S. Defense Department says it will have the ability to conduct “long-range precision strikes against land targets from its submarine and surface combatants” in the “near term.” 

            As Beijing increases its naval presence around Taiwan and pushes its claims in the South China Sea, the U.S., Britain and other allies have responded with regular naval exercises in the region and passages through the Taiwan Strait as they pursue a policy of a “free and open Indo-Pacific.”

            China has not yet sailed an aircraft carrier into the Indian Ocean but is expected to do so within the next few years. It already has other vessels operating regularly in the region and has established its first overseas base in the Horn of Africa country of Djibouti, which gives it easy access to the Indian Ocean.

            China set off alarm bells in New Delhi in August when it docked what India called a “spy ship” in Sri Lanka's Hambantota port off of India's southern coast, a facility that was leased to China in 2017 for 99 years. 

            “New Delhi sees Beijing as encroaching into its traditional sphere of influence, especially in the Indian Ocean region,"" said Ridzwan Rahmat, a Singapore-based analyst with the defense intelligence company Janes.

            ""While a potential war with China will likely be fought inland, China’s presence in the Indian Ocean region can severely disrupt India’s sea lines of communication, which will be essential in sustaining the war effort. The Indian navy’s recent modernization track is to ensure that scenarios like these will not take root,"" Rahmat said.

            Like China, India has nuclear weapons and has been building nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines as part of its “nuclear triad” of air, sea and land-based platforms. It currently has two such subs and plans for two more, as well as nuclear-powered attack submarines. 

            Its fleet also includes 10 destroyers, 12 frigates and 20 corvettes. 

            India and China clashed on their land border in 2020, with 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers killed. The skirmish turned into a long standoff in the rugged mountainous terrain where each side has tens of thousands of military personnel. 

            Retired Indian navy chief Arun Prakash suggested that experience could make the seas more important in the event of a future conflict.

            ""The 30-month-long Sino-Indian military impasse in the Himalayas and China’s strategic posturing in the South China Sea should be clear pointers for India’s decision-makers that maritime power will have a critical role to play as an instrument of state policy in future outcomes,” Prakash wrote in December in The Indian Express. 

            With two carriers, India's plan is to have one stationed on each coast, said Capt. D.K. Sharma, a retired Indian navy spokesperson who now consults on defense issues.

            India's focus has tended to be toward Pakistan in the west, but with the presence of Chinese vessels in critical shipping lanes east of India, it is prudent for the Indian navy to make its presence felt there as well, Rahmat said. 

            He cautioned, however, that India still lacks many of the support systems, among other things, to make its carriers effective. 

            “The vessels themselves may be operational but the Indian navy is still several years away from being able to project its forces credibly into the Indian Ocean region,” he said.

            Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the launch of the Vikrant as a victory in his “Make in India” campaign to become more self-reliant in defense. 

            The navy has been pushing for another carrier to be made at home, but political concerns coupled with the lengthy delays and massive cost overruns in the construction of the Vikrant have left many skeptical it will ever come to pass, said Indian defense analyst Rahul Bedi.

            “The government doesn't really have the money or the vision to go in for another aircraft carrier,” he said.

            In its proposed 2023-24 budget presented Wednesday, the government increased defense spending by less than 2%, further calling into question major new investments in carriers. Even if it does go ahead, a third carrier would take years to build.

            As it outfits the Vikrant, India is expected to decide soon on the purchase of 26 maritime strike fighters — either the French Rafale-M or American F/A-18. The Indian air force already operates a version of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, which would make maintenance easier, while Boeing’s F/A-18 can carry more missiles.

            The Vikramaditya will continue to operate Russian-made MiG-29K fighters India already owns. 

            India has been seeking to lessen its reliance on equipment from Russia, which currently provides about 60% of its inventory, with the war in Ukraine raising questions about their effectiveness and the availability of spare parts. The United States and other allies have been pitching themselves to New Delhi as alternatives and are increasing their cooperation with the key regional player as they intensify their own focus on the Indo-Pacific. 

            However, experts say that even with domestic production and diversification of acquisitions, it could take India 20 years to get past its dependence on Russian supplies and spares.

            Even before the Russia-Ukraine war, India was increasing its diplomatic engagement with the Quad grouping of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and other countries individually, Solanki said.

            “This really accelerated after the June 2020 India-China clashes on the border,” he said. “That is when we've seen a real shift and focus to engage with the Quad, with France, to engage with the U.K. more actively, work with Europe further … and work with the ASEAN countries as well.”

Sharma, a retired Indian navy spokesperson who now consults on defense issues.India's focus has tended to be toward Pakistan in the west, but with the presence of Chinese vessels in critical shipping lanes east of India, it is prudent for the Indian navy to make its presence felt there as well, Rahmat said.He cautioned, however, that India still lacks many of the support systems, among other things, to make its carriers effective.“The vessels themselves may be operational but the Indian navy is still several years away from being able to project its forces credibly into the Indian Ocean region,” he said.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the launch of the Vikrant as a victory in his “Make in India” campaign to become more self-reliant in defense.The navy has been pushing for another carrier to be made at home, but political concerns coupled with the lengthy delays and massive cost overruns in the construction of the Vikrant have left many skeptical it will ever come to pass, said Indian defense analyst Rahul Bedi.“The government doesn't really have the money or the vision to go in for another aircraft carrier,” he said.In its proposed 2023-24 budget presented Wednesday, the government increased defense spending by less than 2%, further calling into question major new investments in carriers. Even if it does go ahead, a third carrier would take years to build.As it outfits the Vikrant, India is expected to decide soon on the purchase of 26 maritime strike fighters — either the French Rafale-M or American F/A-18. The Indian air force already operates a version of Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, which would make maintenance easier, while Boeing’s F/A-18 can carry more missiles.The Vikramaditya will continue to operate Russian-made MiG-29K fighters India already owns.India has been seeking to lessen its reliance on equipment from Russia, which currently provides about 60% of its inventory, with the war in Ukraine raising questions about their effectiveness and the availability of spare parts. The United States and other allies have been pitching themselves to New Delhi as alternatives and are increasing their cooperation with the key regional player as they intensify their own focus on the Indo-Pacific.However, experts say that even with domestic production and diversification of acquisitions, it could take India 20 years to get past its dependence on Russian supplies and spares.Even before the Russia-Ukraine war, India was increasing its diplomatic engagement with the Quad grouping of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and other countries individually, Solanki said.“This really accelerated after the June 2020 India-China clashes on the border,” he said. “That is when we've seen a real shift and focus to engage with the Quad, with France, to engage with the U.K. more actively, work with Europe further … and work with the ASEAN countries as well.”___Rising reported from Bangkok.",2023/2/6,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801661,Biden 2024? Most Democrats say no thank you: AP-NORC poll,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A majority of Democrats now think one term is plenty for President Joe Biden, despite his insistence that he plans to seek reelection in 2024.

            That's according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that shows just 37% of Democrats say they want him to seek a second term, down from 52% in the weeks before last year's midterm elections.

            While Biden has trumpeted his legislative victories and ability to govern, the poll suggests relatively few U.S. adults give him high marks on either. Follow-up interviews with poll respondents suggest that many believe the 80-year-old's age is a liability, with people focused on his coughing, his gait, his gaffes and the possibility that the world's most stressful job would be better suited for someone younger.











            “I, honestly, think that he would be too old,” said Sarah Overman, 37, a Democrat who works in education in Raleigh, North Carolina. “We could use someone younger in the office.""

            As the president gives his State of the Union address Tuesday, he has a chance to confront fundamental doubts about his competence to govern. Biden has previously leaned heavily on his track record to say that he's more than up to the task. When asked if he can handle the office’s responsibilities at his age, the president has often responded as if he’s accepting a dare: “Watch me.”

            Democratic candidates performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, a testament to Biden's message that he is defending democracy and elevating the middle class. Democrats expanded their control of the Senate by one seat and narrowly lost their House majority even though history indicated there would be a Republican wave.

            When asked about the survey's findings at Monday's news briefing, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre indicated that the results in last year's election mattered more than polling numbers.

            “The way that we should look at this is what we saw from the midterms,” said Jean-Pierre, noting that the relative Democratic successes were “because the president went out there and spoke directly to the American people.”

            Overall, 41% approve of how Biden is handling his job as president, the poll shows, similar to ratings at the end of last year. A majority of Democrats still approve of the job Biden is doing as president, yet their appetite for a reelection campaign has slipped despite his electoral track record. Only 22% of U.S. adults overall say he should run again, down from 29% who said so before last year’s midterm elections. 

            The decline among Democrats saying Biden should run again for president appears concentrated among younger people. Among Democrats age 45 and over, 49% say Biden should run for reelection, nearly as many as the 58% who said that in October. But among those under age 45, 23% now say he should run for reelection, after 45% said that before the midterms.

            Linda Lockwood, a Democrat and retiree from Kansas City, Kansas, said she is not that worried about Biden's age.

            “He seems to be in pretty good condition in my opinion and that’s coming from a 76-year-old woman,” Lockwood said. “You might be a little more careful going down the steps as you get older, but if your brain is still working, that’s the important part.”

            Already the oldest president in U.S. history, Biden has been dogged by questions about his age as he would be 86 if he serves a full eight years as president. He often works long days, standing for hours, remembering the names of strangers he meets while traveling who want to share a story about their lives with him.

            Yet he's been a national political figure for a half-century, having first been elected to the Senate from Delaware in 1972, and the moments when he appears lost on stage or stumbles through speeches can garner more attention than his policies.

            Voters like Ross Truckey, 35, have been watching the president carefully. A lawyer in Michigan, Truckey did not vote for Biden or Republican Donald Trump in 2020. He feels as though Biden has been the latest in a string of “subpar” presidents.

            “His age and possibly his mental acuity is not where I would want the leader of the country to be,” Truckey said. “He, at times, appears to be an old man who is past his prime. Sometimes I feel a little bit of pity for the guy being pushed out in front of crowds.”

            Biden has repeatedly emphasized in speeches that it's essential for the public to know the totality of what his administration is doing. It's notched four big legislative victories with coronavirus relief, the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and tax and spending measures that help to address climate change and improve the IRS' ability to enforce the tax code and help taxpayers.

            Yet just 13% have a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to accomplish major policy goals, a possible reflection of the fact that he must now work with a Republican majority in the House that wants to cut spending in return for lifting the government’s legal borrowing authority. 

            The poll also shows only 23% of U.S. adults say they have “a great deal” of confidence in Biden to effectively manage the White House. That has ticked down from 28% a year ago and remains significantly lower than 44% two years ago, just as Biden took office.

            Just 21% have a lot of confidence in Biden’s ability to handle a crisis, down slightly from 26% last March.

            On working with congressional Republicans and managing government spending, roughly half of U.S. adults say they have hardly any confidence in the president, and only around 1 in 10 say they have high confidence.

            Republican voters are unwilling to give Biden the benefit of the doubt, hurting his ratings.

            John Rodriguez, 76, backed Trump and assumes that Biden is merely doing the bidding of his aides. That creates a challenge for a president who promised to unite the country.

            “I believe he’s not the one who’s calling the shots,” said Rodriguez, who lives in Cutler Bay, Florida. “He’s a puppet being told where to go, what to say.”

            But the key obstacle for Biden might be voters such as Vikram Joglekar, 46, who works in the computer industry in Austin, Texas. He backed the president in 2020, only to summarize his feelings about Biden's time in office as “meh.”

            “It’s not up for me to decide whether someone should run or not,"" Joglekar said. ""I don’t know who is going to be on the ballot, but I would hope it would be someone better from his party.”

It was estimated that 200,000 people attended the event in which thousands of rockets created loud, bee-like buzzing sounds and flew randomly into crowds of onlookers.Despite the Tainan fire department recommending onlookers cover themselves completely with protective gear, not all did so. Ten men and two women were injured during the event, two of them seriously.One man who was not wearing any protective gear received second-degree burns to nearly 40% of his body, and a 13-year-old boy was also seriously injured when a firework hit him in the eye. Both were sent to hospital for treatment.Minor injuries included one man who did not wear a helmet and was hit on the head by a firework, and another woman who was hit in the leg. Both were assisted by an emergency care station set up at the event by the Tainan City Government.The event also produced a huge amount of waste, with a reported 23 tons of fireworks debris and rubbish left behind. The Tainan Environmental Protection Bureau dispatched a team of 185 people, street sweepers, bobcats, and rubbish trucks to clean up the mess.The main roads where the event took place were reopened by 8 a.m. Monday (Feb. 6), the following day, and the whole area was back to normal by 11 a.m., according to Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲).23 tons of rubbish were cleared from the area after the event.

The other 31 have pleaded guilty and will be sentenced after the trial.In a rare protest, supporters carrying a banner that read ""crackdown is shameless"" and ""immediately release all political prisoners"" were seen before the court convened.Experts say this case will highlight Hong Kong's judicial independence under Beijing's national security law.Chinese and Hong Kong authorities credit the law with bringing stability to the region after it was roiled by huge pro-democracy protests in 2019.Others decry the law for itspunitive measures that punishes what it calls subversion, collusion with foreign forces and terrorism with up to life in prison.Western countries have called the 2020 law a tool to crush dissent in the Asian financial hub.The law has managed to transform the former British colony into something closer to the authoritarian mainland.""This trial is not simply a trial against the 47 opposition leaders, but also a trial for the population, who has been supporting the pro-democracy movement for decades,"" Eric Lai, a fellow at Georgetown Center for Asian Law in Washington, told Reuters news agency.In a break from the city's tradition, the defendants were refused a jury trial.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801678,"Swiss lawmakers visit Taiwan, say they want closer ties","TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A group of Swiss lawmakers met with Taiwan’s president and said Monday their government wants to deepen political relations, adding to shows of support by foreign politicians for the self-ruled island democracy in the face of Chinese intimidation.

            U.S. legislators including then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have irked Beijing by visiting Taiwan, which China’s ruling Communist Party claims as part of its territory. The government of Chinese President Xi Jinping has responded by flying fighter jets and bombers near the island of 22 million people and firing missiles into the sea.

            Swiss lawmakers have told their government to “examine how Switzerland’s existing relations with Taiwan can be gradually deepened in the interests of business, politics, science and culture,” said one of the legislators, Fabian Molina, during a meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen.











            Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war. The island never has been part of the People’s Republic of China, but the Communist Party says it is obligated to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Beijing says Tsai’s democratically elected government has no right to conduct foreign relations.

            Switzerland, like all other European governments except Vatican City, has official relations with Beijing instead of Taiwan but has extensive commercial and informal ties with the island, a high-tech center and major trader.

            “It is absolutely essential that the existing differences and tensions between Taiwan and the PRC are resolved peacefully and through dialog,” said Molina, a member of Switzerland's Social Democratic Party. “Anything less would be unacceptable.”

            Legislators from Britain and other countries also have visited Taiwan in a show of support for its elected government. Pelosi in August became the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.

            The Swiss delegation also included lawmakers Nicolas Walder, Yves Nidegger, Mustafa Atici and Leonore Porchet.

            Tsai told them Taiwan and Switzerland are “like-minded partners” that value freedom and democracy.

            “I would like to once again thank you all for your firm support for Taiwan,” she told the legislators.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801681,Israeli troops kill 5 Palestinian gunmen in West Bank raid,"AQABAT JABR, West Bank (AP) — Israeli forces killed five Palestinian gunmen linked to the Islamic militant Hamas group in a raid on refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday, the latest bloodshed in the region that will likely further exacerbate tensions.

            The Palestinian president's office called the violence a crime, urging the United States to pressure Israel to hold back on its incursions. The military said the raid was meant to apprehend a militant cell that staged a botched shooting attack on a restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.

            The violence extends one of the deadliest periods in years in the West Bank and comes during the first weeks of Israel’s new government, its most right-wing ever, which has promised to take a tough stance against the Palestinians.











            The Israeli military said it was operating in the Aqabat Jabr refugee camp to apprehend the suspects behind a failed shooting attack last month at a West Bank restaurant, where attackers allegedly were thwarted by a weapon malfunction. The attackers then fled the scene, the military said, adding that they were members of Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip and has elements in the West Bank as well.

            The military said it was searching Monday for the militant cell behind the shooting that it said had sealed itself inside a home in the refugee camp. During the search, troops encountered gunmen and a gun battle erupted. The military said several of the gunmen who were killed were involved in the attempted attack on the restaurant.

            “The new Israeli government is continuing its series of crimes against our Palestinian people,” a statement from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office said. 

            In Aqabat Jabr, bullets were strewn across a blood-streaked floor at the scene of the gunfight. Bullet marks pocked a door and glass shards from a broken window littered the ground.

            Jihad Abu al-Assal, the governor of Jericho and the Jordan Valley, said the military was holding on to the gunmen's bodies. The Palestinian Health Ministry later confirmed that five Palestinians had been killed.

            Speaking at an event at the site of a recent deadly Palestinian shooting attack, Netanyahu confirmed earlier reports by Israeli security officials that five gunmen were killed.

            Hamas said all five of those killed were members of its armed wing. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the violence would be met with a response.

            “Our people and their resistance will not delay in responding to this crime,” he said.

            The raid comes days after an earlier incursion in the Aqabat Jabr camp, which is near the Palestinian city of Jericho, a desert oasis in an area of the West Bank that rarely sees such unrest, where troops were also searching for the suspects.

            Since the shooting at the nearby settlement, the Israeli military has blocked access to several roads into Jericho — a closure that has placed the city under a semi-blockade, disrupting business and creating hourslong bottlenecks at checkpoints that affected even Palestinian security forces, footage showed.

            Monday’s violence comes days after an Israeli military raid on the Jenin refugee camp killed 10 Palestinians, mostly militants but also a 61-year-old woman. The next day, a Palestinian shooting attack outside an east Jerusalem synagogue killed seven people, including a 14-year-old.

            The Israeli army has ramped up near-nightly raids in the occupied West Bank since a series of deadly Palestinian attacks within Israel last spring. Over the last year of escalating raids, Jericho has remained a sort of sleepy desert town, spared much of the violence.

            The Palestinian Authority, in retaliation for the raid into the Jenin refugee camp, declared a halt to security coordination with Israel.

            Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, making it the deadliest year in those areas since 2004, according to figures by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Since the start of this year, 41 Palestinians have been killed in those territories. Palestinian attacks against Israelis killed some 30 people in 2022.

            The Israeli army says most of the Palestinians killed have been militants. But stone-throwing youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in confrontations have also been killed.

            Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state.

            Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel. Wafaa Shurafa contributed reporting from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.AQABAT JABR, West Bank (AP) — Israeli forces killed five Palestinian gunmen linked to the Islamic militant Hamas group in a raid on refugee camp in the occupied West Bank on Monday, the latest bloodshed in the region that will likely further exacerbate tensions.The Palestinian president's office called the violence a crime, urging the United States to pressure Israel to hold back on its incursions. The military said the raid was meant to apprehend a militant cell that staged a botched shooting attack on a restaurant in a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.The violence extends one of the deadliest periods in years in the West Bank and comes during the first weeks of Israel’s new government, its most right-wing ever, which has promised to take a tough stance against the Palestinians.The Israeli military said it was operating in the Aqabat Jabr refugee camp to apprehend the suspects behind a failed shooting attack last month at a West Bank restaurant, where attackers allegedly were thwarted by a weapon malfunction. The attackers then fled the scene, the military said, adding that they were members of Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip and has elements in the West Bank as well.The military said it was searching Monday for the militant cell behind the shooting that it said had sealed itself inside a home in the refugee camp. During the search, troops encountered gunmen and a gun battle erupted. The military said several of the gunmen who were killed were involved in the attempted attack on the restaurant.“The new Israeli government is continuing its series of crimes against our Palestinian people,” a statement from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' office said.In Aqabat Jabr, bullets were strewn across a blood-streaked floor at the scene of the gunfight. Bullet marks pocked a door and glass shards from a broken window littered the ground.Jihad Abu al-Assal, the governor of Jericho and the Jordan Valley, said the military was holding on to the gunmen's bodies. The Palestinian Health Ministry later confirmed that five Palestinians had been killed.Speaking at an event at the site of a recent deadly Palestinian shooting attack, Netanyahu confirmed earlier reports by Israeli security officials that five gunmen were killed.Hamas said all five of those killed were members of its armed wing. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the violence would be met with a response.“Our people and their resistance will not delay in responding to this crime,” he said.The raid comes days after an earlier incursion in the Aqabat Jabr camp, which is near the Palestinian city of Jericho, a desert oasis in an area of the West Bank that rarely sees such unrest, where troops were also searching for the suspects.Since the shooting at the nearby settlement, the Israeli military has blocked access to several roads into Jericho — a closure that has placed the city under a semi-blockade, disrupting business and creating hourslong bottlenecks at checkpoints that affected even Palestinian security forces, footage showed.Monday’s violence comes days after an Israeli military raid on the Jenin refugee camp killed 10 Palestinians, mostly militants but also a 61-year-old woman. The next day, a Palestinian shooting attack outside an east Jerusalem synagogue killed seven people, including a 14-year-old.The Israeli army has ramped up near-nightly raids in the occupied West Bank since a series of deadly Palestinian attacks within Israel last spring.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801682,Subversion trial for Hong Kong political activists opens,"HONG KONG (AP) — Some of Hong Kong’s best-known pro-democracy activists went on trial Monday in the biggest prosecution yet under a law imposed by China’s ruling Communist Party to crush dissent.

            The 18 defendants face up to life in prison if convicted under the national security law critics say is eroding the autonomy promised when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997, and its status as a global business center.

            They were among 47 pro-democracy figures who were arrested in 2021 under the legislation that was imposed following protests in 2019. They were charged in connection with an informal 2020 primary election.











            The pro-democracy movement has largely dried up after activists were jailed or went into exile. Growing numbers of young professionals have responded to the erosion of Hong Kong’s Western-style civil liberties by leaving for Britain, the United States and other countries. The United States imposed sanctions on officials it said were to blame for the abuses.

            The primary in 2020 aimed at picking pro-democracy candidates who could win control of the territory’s Legislative Council. Prosecutors accuse them of trying to paralyze Hong Kong’s government and topple the city’s leader by securing a majority to veto budgets.

            ""The purpose of the conspiracy is to subvert the state power,” the prosecutor said in his opening statement.

            The prosecution involves many of the city’s most prominent activists, including legal scholar Benny Tai, former student leader Joshua Wong and opposition party leaders Wu Chi-wai and Alvin Yeung. 

            Tai and four others were the election organizers and had indispensable involvement, the prosecutor said. 

            In previous proceedings, the 18 activists had indicated they intended to plead not guilty. But two of them — former district councilor Ng Kin-wai and businessman Mike Lam — later changed their minds, joining the other 29 activists, including Tai, Wong, Yeung and Wu, who plan to admit the charges. 

            While most of the 47 activists who were charged with conspiracy to commit subversion have been detained without bail for nearly two years, former lawmakers Raymond Chan and Helena Wong, who appeared in court on Monday, were among the minority who were granted bail based on strict conditions. 

            Ahead of the opening statements, the pair, alongside 14 other activists, pleaded not guilty in front of the judges, who were approved by the city’s leader to oversee the case. “There is no crime for me to plead guilty,"" former lawmaker Leung Kwok-hung said. Ng and Lam pleaded guilty. 

            Those who intend to plead guilty will receive their sentencing after the trial. Some of them, including Joshua Wong and former district councilor Lester Shum, were in the courtroom to observe the trial. 

            The court also heard that four of the 47 activists would give evidence as prosecution witnesses.

            Earlier in the morning, more than 200 people, including relatives and friends of the defendants, lined up outside the court building as local police stepped up security in the area.

            Some people at the front of the line, including a group of more than 10 who came at 6 a.m. to secure a seat for the hearing, said they had no clue what the trial was about. That prompted pro-democracy activists among the spectators to question whether they were just trying to occupy the seats so that other members of the public could not get a place to observe the high-profile trial. 

            Three members of the League of Social Democrats staged a small protest outside the complex, urging the immediate release of all political prisoners. 

            “Primary election is not crime. This is political repression,"" Chan Po-ying, one of the members, said. 

            Police took away her colleague for violating the mask mandate when he took his mask off and tried to speak loudly.

            The trial is expected to last 90 days. The case has drawn international scrutiny, with advocacy groups and politicians condemning the charges.

            Amnesty International’s deputy regional director Hana Young called on the charges to be dropped, saying the activists were forced to decide whether they should admit liability to “a non-existent crime” for a potential penalty reduction or fight a losing battle. 

            “With this mass trial, the Hong Kong government is attempting to shut off all meaningful political participation in Hong Kong,” she said. 

            But she added the authorities would never be able to fully silence dissidents, pointing to the protest outside the court. 

            The government postponed the legislative election that would have followed the primary, citing public health risks during the coronavirus pandemic. The electoral system was later overhauled to give Beijing more control over who is elected to Hong Kong’s legislature.

            The national security law criminalizes secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces to intervene in the city’s affairs as well as terrorism. Apart from the activists, pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai is also facing collusion charges under the law.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4801683,Asian stocks rebound after Wall St sinks on rate fears,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets rebounded Tuesday after Wall Street sank under pressure from worries about higher interest rates and after Japan reported stronger wage gains than expected.

            Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul advanced. Oil prices rose.

            Wall Street sank for a second day Monday after unexpectedly strong U.S. data on hiring and wages dampened hopes the Federal Reserve might decide it has succeeded in cooling inflation and can wind down plans for more rate hikes.











            Traders were looking ahead to a planned speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in Washington for possible clues about interest rate plans.

            Expectations for the Fed to reverse course quickly are unrealistic, Clifford Bennett of ACY Securities said in a report.

            “The mismatching of financial market pricing and economic reality is both stark and stretched,” Bennett said.

            The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo gained 0.2% to 27,754.36 after the government reported wages rose 4.8% over a year earlier in December. That was close to a three-decade high as workers press for higher pay to keep pace with inflation.

            The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2% to 3,244.55 and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 1% to 21,422.97.

            The Kospi in Seoul added 0.6% to 2,453.80 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 was up less than 0.1% at 7,541.60. New Zealand and Singapore declined while Jakarta advanced.

            On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.6% to 4,111.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1% to 33,891.02 and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 1% to 11,887.45.

            The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for the Fed, leaped by an unusually wide margin to 4.47% from Friday's 4.29% and the previous day's 4.1%.

            The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, jumped to 3.64% from 3.52% late Friday.

            The Fed and central banks in Europe and Asia are trying to extinguish inflation that is at multi-decade highs by cooling economic activity. Traders worry they might be willing to tip the global economy into recession to achieve that.

            Friday’s employment data showed the U.S. economy added twice as many jobs as expected last month despite higher interest rates. That is good for workers but the Fed worries wage gains will push up inflation. That fuels fears the U.S. central bank might push rates higher.

            On Wall Street, Tyson Foods fell 4.6% on Monday after it reported weaker profit and revenue for its latest quarter than analysts expected.

            Dell Technologies dropped 3% after it said it will cut about 5% of its workforce. The company's vice chairman said in a message to employees that “market conditions continue to erode with an uncertain future.”

            In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude gained 83 cents to $74.94 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 72 cents to $74.11 on Monday. Brent crude, the price basis for international oil trading, advanced 81 cents to $81.80 per barrel in London. It added $1.05 the previous session to $80.99.
