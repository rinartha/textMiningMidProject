https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844704,"Book ban attempts hit record high in 2022, library org says","NEW YORK (AP) — Attempted book bans and restrictions at school and public libraries continue to surge, setting a record in 2022, according to a new report from the American Library Association released Thursday.More than 1,200 challenges were compiled by the association in 2022, nearly double the then-record total from 2021 and by far the most since the ALA began keeping data 20 years ago.“I've never seen anything like this,” says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom. “The last two years have been exhausting, frightening, outrage inducing.”Thursday's report not only documents the growing number of challenges, but also their changing nature. A few years ago, complaints usually arose with parents and other community members and referred to an individual book. Now, the requests are often for multiple removals, and organized by national groups such as the conservative Moms for Liberty, which has a mission of “unifying, educating and empowering parents to defend their parental rights at all levels of government.”Last year, more than 2,500 different books were objected to, compared to 1,858 in 2021 and just 566 in 2019. In numerous cases, hundreds of books were challenged in a single complaint. The ALA bases its findings on media accounts and voluntary reporting from libraries and acknowledges that the numbers might be far higher.Librarians around the country have told of being harassed and threatened with violence or legal action.“Every day professional librarians sit down with parents to thoughtfully determine what reading material is best suited for their child’s needs,” ALA President Lessa Kanani’opua Pelayo-Lozada said in a statement. “Now, many library workers face threats to their employment, their personal safety, and in some cases, threats of prosecution for providing books to youth they and their parents want to read.”Caldwell-Stone says that some books have been targeted by liberals because of racist language — notably Mark Twain's “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” — but the vast majority of complaints come from conservatives, directed at works with LGBTQIA+ or racial themes. They include Maia Kobabe's “Gender Queer,” Jonathan Evison's “Lawn Boy,” Angie Thomas' “The Hate U Give” and a book-length edition of the “1619 Project,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning report from The New York Times on the legacy of slavery in the U.S.Bills facilitating the restriction of books have been proposed or passed in Arizona, Iowa, Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma, among other states. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis has approved laws to review reading materials and limit classroom discussion of gender identity and race books pulled indefinitely or temporarily include John Green's “Looking for Alaska,” Colleen Hoover's “Hopeless,” Margaret Atwood's dystopian novel “The Handmaid's Tale” and Grace Lin's picture story “Dim Sum for Everyone!”More recently, Florida's Martin County school district removed dozens of books from its middle schools and high schools, including numerous works by novelist Jodi Picoult, Toni Morrison's Pulitzer Prize-winning “Beloved” and James Patterson's “Maximum Ride” thrillers, a decision which the bestselling author has criticized on Twitter as “arbitrary and borderline absurd.”DeSantis has called reports of mass bannings a “hoax,"" saying in a statement released earlier this month that the allegations reveal “some are attempting to use our schools for indoctrination.”Some books do come back. Officials at Florida's Duval County Public Schools were widely criticized after they removed “Roberto Clemente: The Pride of the Pittsburgh Pirates,” a children's biography of the late Puerto Rican baseball star. In February, they announced the book would again be on shelves, explaining that they needed to review it and make sure it didn't violate any state laws.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844705,Rahul Gandhi gets 2 years for Modi defamation in India,"NEW DELHI (AP) — An Indian court found opposition leader Rahul Gandhi guilty of defamation Thursday over his remarks about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surname and sentenced him to two years in prison.The case against Gandhi dates back to an election rally in 2019 where he said, “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” In his speech, he then went on to name fugitive Indian diamond tycoon Nirav Modi, banned Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi, and Narendra Modi.Narendra Modi is not related to either of the other two.The defamation case against Gandhi was filed by a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in western Gujarat state. The complainant, Purnesh Modi, said Gandhi’s comments had “defamed the entire Modi community.”Modi is a common last name in western Gujarat state.Gandhi, who was present in the court when the verdict was announced, said his remarks were meant to highlight corruption and were not directed against any community. He won’t go to jail immediately as the court granted bail for 30 days to file an appeal against the verdict.Mallikarjun Kharge, president of Gandhi's Congress Party, said Gandhi would appeal against the verdict in a higher court and called Modi’s government “cowardly and dictatorial.”After the verdict, Gandhi wrote on Twitter: “My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth is my God, and non-violence the means to get it.""Gandhi, a lawmaker, is one of the main opposition leaders in India. He will most likely go up against Modi when he seeks his third term as prime minister in 2024.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844706,Prince William thanks Poland for generosity to Ukrainians,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Britain's Prince William paid tribute on Thursday to Poles who lost their lives in past wars, and expressed gratitude to the nation for what it is doing today to provide humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.The heir to the throne's visit to Poland underscores Britain’s support for both Ukraine and Poland, an ally on the front line of efforts to help refugees displaced by Russia’s war and to assist the Ukrainian military in fighting off the invasion.William laid a wreath in Poland's national colors, white and red, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and bowed his head solemnly. The memorial honors Poles who lost their lives in wars including World War II, when Polish and British soldiers were allies.A note on the wreath that he left read: “In memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.""He later headed to the presidential palace for a meeting with President Andrzej Duda, who has been a prominent ally of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than a year ago. Duda's office said their talks focused on humanitarian aid for Ukraine.“The Prince of Wales thanked the Poles for their generosity and hospitality,” Duda's office said.In the final stop on his two-day visit, the prince then went to a trendy food hall where he met with young Ukrainians working or continuing their studies in Poland.William began his surprise visit Wednesday by meeting with British and Polish troops in Rzeszow, a city of 200,000 people in southeastern Poland that has become a hub for shipments of military and humanitarian aid bound for Ukraine.“I just wanted to come here in person to say thank you for all that you’re doing, keeping everyone safe out here and keeping an eye on what’s going on,″ William said as he spoke to the troops.He later traveled to a center in Warsaw that houses about 300 recent arrivals from Ukraine, meeting Ukrainians and playing table tennis with children.The U.K. has been one of the most outspoken supporters of bolstering NATO’s eastern flank in the face of Russia’s aggression. The country sent troops to Poland and the Baltic states and provided more than 2.3 billion pounds ($2.8 billion) of military aid to Ukraine. It also has pledged 220 million pounds ($269 million) of humanitarian assistance.Deploying the popular 40-year-old prince, a military veteran who also worked as a civilian air-sea rescue pilot, offers a more personal touch. While British political leaders have visited Poland regularly to trumpet their support for NATO and the Ukrainian cause, a senior royal like William is a symbol of the nation who can thank military personnel for their service without the baggage of party politics.___Kirka contributed from London.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844707,Boehly sorry after Chelsea banner tweaked for 'Ted Lasso',"LONDON (AP) — Chelsea owner Todd Boehly has apologized after the wording on a banner honoring late club great Ray Wilkins was tweaked while producers of TV show “Ted Lasso” filmed scenes at Stamford Bridge for one of its episodes.Since Wilkins’ death at the age of 61 in 2018, a banner has been on permanent display at Chelsea’s stadium reading: “They don’t make them like Ray anymore.”For the “Ted Lasso” episode that aired recently on Apple TV+, the wording on the banner was altered to say “Roy” instead of “Ray” — a nod to a character in the series, Roy Kent, who is a fictional former Chelsea player returning to the club.That led to some fans criticizing Chelsea, with the club’s former stadium announcer, Neil Barnett, taking aim at Boehly and co-owner Behdad Eghbali — who led the purchase of the London team in May last year from Roman Abramovich — in a tweet late Wednesday.Boehly, who rarely posts on Twitter, replied saying the new ownership “had nothing to do (with) these arrangements” and that a deal with Apple TV was struck at the start of 2022.“We are sorry it affected so many and mostly we care about Ray and his family,” Boehly said in his reply.Ross Wilkins, the son of Ray Wilkins, didn’t appear to take offense, tweeting Thursday: “This is TV and certainly nothing to do with the new regime.”The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust said the banner was paid for by fans and many believe altering the wording was “disrespectful.”“We have expressed our disappointment to club officials,” the trust said. “We expect that CFC will address this in due course.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844708,Taiwan recalls ambassador as Honduras switches ties to China,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan says it has recalled its ambassador to Honduras amid moves by the Central American country to establish formal diplomatic ties with China.Taiwan and China have been locked in a battle for diplomatic recognition since the sides split amid civil war in 1949. Honduras President Xiomara Castro announced last week that her government will seek to establish diplomatic relations with China, which would imply severing relations with Taiwan.The switch would leave Taiwan recognized by only 13 countries, as China spends billions to win recognition for its “One China” policy.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin dismissed reports that Honduras switched relations after Taiwan declined requests to buy $2.5 billion in the country's sovereign debt.“We welcome the Honduran government’s positive statement to develop relations with China. We are ready to establish and develop bilateral relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect,” Wang said at a daily briefing on Thursday.In a statement, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it was “deeply dissatisfied” with the breaking of relations that had lasted more than 80 years and urged Honduras to “be careful of the risks of China's commitments made on its offer of diplomatic relations.”Castro said on her Twitter account that she instructed Honduran Foreign Affairs Minister Eduardo Reina to start negotiations with China and that her intention is to “expand frontiers freely in concert with the nations of the world.”Reina left for China on Wednesday, leading a delegation that included lawmakers Xiomara Hortencia Zelaya Castro and the secretary of the Congress, Carlos Zelaya Rosales — the president’s daughter and son-in-law.The Honduran ministry confirmed the trip without providing any details as to the purpose, but it corresponded with Taiwan’s decision to withdraw its ambassador.The loss of Honduras would leave Taiwan with formal diplomatic ties with just 13 sovereign states, including Vatican City. In Latin America, it also has relations with Belize, Guatemala and Paraguay, with most of its remaining partners being island nations in the Caribbean and South Pacific, along with Eswatini in southern Africa.Honduras would become the ninth diplomatic ally that Taipei has lost to Beijing since pro-independence President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in May 2016. She is due to step down next year at the end of her second term.Despite China’s campaign of isolation, Taiwan retains robust informal ties with more than 100 other countries, most importantly the U.S.__AP writer Marlon González in Tegucigalpa, Honduras contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844709,China criticizes possible US plan to force TikTok sale,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s government said Thursday it would oppose possible U.S. plans to force TikTok’s Chinese owner to sell the short-video service as a security risk and warned such a move would hurt investor confidence in the United States.Governments are worried TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, might give browsing history or other data about users to China’s government or promote propaganda and disinformation. The Wall Street Journal reported U.S. authorities were considering banning TikTok ban if ByteDance doesn’t sell the company.“If the news is true, China will resolutely oppose it,” said a Ministry of Commerce spokeswoman, Shu Jueting. She gave no indication what Beijing might do.A forced sale “would seriously damage investors from multiple countries including China” and hurt “confidence to invest in the United States,” Shu said.TikTok is one focus of conflicts between China and other governments over technology and security that are disrupting processor chip, smartphone and other industries.Shu’s comments on Thursday came hours before the CEO of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, is due to make a high-profile appearance Thursday before a U.S. Congressional committee to make the case for why the hugely popular video-sharing app shouldn’t be banned. American lawmakers have called for a ban on TikTok over national security concerns, alleging that the app could be used to spy on U.S. users. Chew is expected to tell the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce that TikTok prioritizes the safety of its young users and deny allegations that the app is a national security risk, according to his prepared remarks released ahead of the hearing.The United States, Britain and New Zealand's parliament have banned use of TikTok on government-issued phones. India has banned TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps, including the WeChat message service, on security and privacy grounds.On Thursday, the Norwegian parliament followed suit and banned Tiktok and messaging app Telegram on devices with access to the assembly’s systems with immediate effect, the Norwegian news agency NTB said.Telegram is a messaging app founded by Russian-born brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov. The loosely moderated platform is broadly popular in Ukraine, Eastern Europe and used by many conservatives in the United States.“The decision is in line with the recommendation” of the Norwegian National Security Authority,” parliamentary speaker Masud Gharahkhani said, adding the apps should be removed “as quickly as possible.”—-AP writer Jan M.

Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them










Fantasy sports can be a lot of fun, but if you’re not careful, you could easily stumble into some common traps that could ruin your season. Here are five common mistakes fantasy sports players make and how to avoid them:

Not Doing Enough Research – One of the biggest mistakes fantasy sports players make is not doing enough research. Many rely on their familiarity with the sport and players to draft teams, but doing some investigation can give you valuable insights into players’ current form, injuries, and matchups so that you have a better chance at selecting a winning squad.

How to Prevent: Take time to research players before your draft. Read news articles, evaluate past performances, and consult expert rankings for better decisions. This will give you more informed choices when selecting which players to draft.

Overvaluing Star Players – It can be easy to get caught up in the hype surrounding big-name players, but overvaluing them can create an unbalanced team. Prioritizing certain positions can leave gaps in your lineup as a result.

How to avoid: While star players can be beneficial, make sure your lineup has a balance across all positions. Pay attention to value picks that can help fill in any holes in your lineup.

Ignoring the Waiver Wire – The waiver wire is a valuable resource for fantasy sports players, yet many overlook it entirely. On the waiver wire, you can find opportunities to pick up players who may be underrated but still have great potential performances.\
How to avoid: Keep an eye on the waiver wire and make regular pickups to fill any holes in your lineup. Consider streaming players who have favorable matchups during a given week for added value.
Failing to Adjust Lineups Regularly – Fantasy sports require regular attention, and not adjusting your lineup can lead to missed scoring opportunities. Leaving injured or underperforming players in your lineup could significantly diminish your team’s chances of victory.

How to Prevent: Analyze your lineup regularly and adjust as necessary. Stay abreast of player news and injuries so you can make adjustments accordingly. Don’t be afraid to make risky moves, such as benching a struggling star player for an undervalued value pick with an advantageous matchup.
In conclusion, fantasy sports can be an exciting and engaging way for sports fans to get involved in the games they love.  With these tips, you can take your fantasy sports game to the next level and enjoy a successful and rewarding season.Fantasy sports is an online game where participants, also referred to as “fantasy owners,” construct virtual teams of real-life professional athletes from various sports leagues such as football, basketball, baseball, hockey, or soccer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844724,When is the Right Time to Plan the Perfect Yacht Trip?,"The quality of your yachting experience is largely affected by the time you do it. Unexpected rain can ruin the vibes of a party charter. Lunch on the deck will not be as appealing as expected on a humid day. Therefore, planning your yacht charter at the right time is vital to avoid an unpleasant experience. Let’s take a closer look at the best times to charter a yacht per your needs.The season during which you book a yacht charter is a key factor to remember. However, different seasons mean different things depending on where you are. For instance, summer is the best time to charter a yacht in southern Europe’s coastal towns. A yacht rental in Dubai experience during the summer can get quite uncomfortable, so people prefer to sail there in the winter.Browse through information about the peak seasons in the area you plan to charter a yacht. Typically, the weather is perfect during the peak months, and you can book anytime then.While the weather is ideal during the peak season, the prices are more attractive during the off-season. Since bookings are minimal during the low months, yacht rental companies introduce special offers and discounts to attract more customers. If you hope to make your yacht booking more affordable, choosing an off-season trip is a good idea.Plus, since the bookings are low, you can mostly make sudden trip plans. If the idea of chartering a yacht on a whim sounds fun, the off-season could be the time to do it.However, the weather will likely be far from ideal, so be prepared for unfavorable circumstances. There is also the risk of extreme weather conditions during the low months, because of which the trip might get canceled. But if everything goes well, you can enjoy a perfect yacht trip at the best prices.You can charter a yacht any time of the day. However, most people prefer to do so during the vent, around the time of sunset. It is the right option to enjoy spectacular views of the coastline during the golden hour. Moreover, the weather is likely pleasant, neither too hot nor too cold. Guests can relax on the deck or flybridge and enjoy panoramic views of the surroundings.Most people typically plan a yacht trip at night for throwing parties. Add a DJ to the mix, and the guests can dance away under the stars. It can get cold during the night, depending on where in the world you are and what season it is. Therefore, it is usually advised to bring a jacket for night charters.Events like anniversaries, birthdays, and corporate parties are best hosted during the day on a yacht. Usually, such parties start during the day and go on until after sunset. Daytime parties are ideal in winter since the weather will likely be pleasant.The difference between weekday and weekend charters depends on the yacht rental company you choose. Some companies offer discounted charter rates during the weekdays since the number of bookings will be lower. For many people, only weekend charters work since it is a holiday.The yacht you want might be more readily available at short notice during weekdays than on weekends. If you have a day off during a weekday, it is ideal to charter a trip then for better deals and yacht availability.Typically, yachts are rented out weeks and months in advance for festive occasions. For instance, people plan their New Year’s Eve charter trips early and make their bookings by October in Cannes and Dubai. A yacht trip provides the perfect opportunity to watch the fireworks without having to deal with massive crowds. Plus, new year yacht parties are always epic. Some rental companies offer special packages for festive events as well. In such situations, it is essential to plan ahead to avoid losing the yacht you want to book.You can rent a yacht for several special occasions, regardless of the season. Such events happen rarely and are best celebrated on a yacht. Therefore, customers typically pay no heed to whether the timing of the trip is unfavorable. Top rental companies offer yacht packages with food, beverages, music, decorations, and more to enhance the trip. The following are the top occasions to charter a yacht for.Sometimes, you do not need a steadfast reason to book a yacht trip. Sailing is a soothing activity that many people do as a hobby.Therefore, you can book a yacht trip after a hard day at work and when you simply want to leave all negative thoughts behind. Spending a few hours in the middle of the sea, far away from the city, enjoying luxury hospitality, is a great way to unwind and leave stress behind. Or else, you can impress clients on short notice by planning a charter trip or even surprise someone during a date.Sailing opportunities are always right around the corner regardless of the time, provided you book with a reputed company.",2023/03/23,,

As she walked down the street after exiting First Bank, a car pulled up beside her and the robbers jumped out.They used pepper spray to subdue the woman, and then took off with the initial NT$5 million she had withdrawn.Cameras on the street were used to identify the getaway car used by the suspects. Officers tracked the car and caught up with the suspects on Provincial Highway 2C in New Taipei’s Ruifang District.The four suspects were all young men, aged 21 to 26.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844745,EU leaders set to sign off on Ukraine ammunition deal,"EU leaders meeting in Brussels on Thursday are set to endorse a deal to ramp up the supply of artillery shells to Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia's unprovoked invasion, diplomats say.The two-day European Council summit, which is also to focus on other issues, including energy supply, will include the attendance of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a working lunch on Thursday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also scheduled to address the meeting via video.""We will, as always, reaffirm our unwavering commitment to assist Ukraine,"" declared Charles Michel, president of the European Council, in his invitation.The leaders of the 27 EU member states are set to sign off on a fast-track procedure to ramp up the supply of ammunition to Ukraine that was adopted during a meeting of foreign and defense ministers earlier this week.The plan, which envisages sending 1 million rounds of artillery shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months, was mooted last month by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas. It is modeled on a similar joint purchasing plan to that devised during the coronavirus pandemic to buy vaccines.Ukraine is facing an acute crisis of ammunition shortage as it fights the invading troops sent in by its Russian neighbor. The war is widely seen as a conflict in which European liberal values are at stake.Hungary, whose stance on the Russian invasion is ambivalent, has announced it will not take part in supplying ammunition to Ukraine, but said it will not prevent other members from doing so by vetoing the deal. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last month accused the bloc of helping prolong the war by imposing sanctions on Russia and supplying Ukraine with military and financial aid.Discussions with UN chief Guterres are expected to focus on a recently renewed deal, brokered by the world body and Turkey, that allows the safe export of Ukrainian grain through the Black Sea amid the conflict.However, in initial remarks, Guterres spoke of the need for the EU to be at the forefront of efforts to combat global warming.""We very much count on the European Union to lead the transformations that are necessary in order to be able to put back on track the 2030 agenda,"" Guterres said referring to climate goals set for the next seven years.""We are close to the tipping point. We need dramatic action ... we count on the leadership of the European Union in this regard,"" he said.The UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently gave what it called a ""final"" warning that the world had to act now or never to prevent catastrophic consequences of global warming.The leaders are also to discuss  the bloc's competitiveness and its response to the $369 billion (€338.6 billion) US Inflation Reduction Act.Following a meeting with US President Joe Biden earlier this month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said there was ""a striking symmetry"" between the US legislation and the European Green Deal,"" as both aimed to fight climate change and boost investment and growth.However, there have been European complaints that clean energy subsidies contained in the Inflation Reduction Act and other US bills will divert investment away from Europe and hurt their economies.The current high energy prices in the bloc, partly caused by fallout from the war in Ukraine, and ways of ensuring the security of the energy supply will also be on the agenda, according to the European Council.Boosting energy security will include phasing out dependency of Russian fossil fuels, which have long met many of industry's energy needs within the bloc, notably in Germany.tj/es (Reuters, AP)",2023/03/23,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844746,Ukraine updates: Medvedev says Putin arrest would be 'war',"Russia's ex-President Dmitry Medvedev has warned that any attempt to arrest President Vladimir Putin abroad would be seen as ""a declaration of war.""The International Criminal Court (ICC) based in The Hague issued an arrest warrant for Putin last week for alleged war crimes.""Let's imagine — obviously this situation which will never be realized — but nevertheless lets imagine that it was realized: The current head of the nuclear state went to a territory, say Germany, and was arrested,"" Medvedev said in a video posted to Telegram late on Wednesday.""What would that be? It would be a declaration of war on the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""And in that case, all our assets — all our missiles et cetera — would fly to the Bundestag, to the Chancellor's office.""Medvedev, who served as Russia's president from 2008 until 2012 and now deputy chairman of Russia's security council, has made increasingly hawkish statements about the invasion of Ukraine.Russia, which is not a party to the ICC, initially called the arrest warrant ""null and void.""On Monday, Russia's Investigative Committee opened its criminal investigation in to the ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan. It said Khan's actions may have breached two Russian laws relating to accusing an innocent person of a crime, and ""preparing an attack on a representative of a foreign state enjoying international protection, in order to complicate international relations.""On Wednesday, the ICC's legislative body condemned ""threats"" against the tribunal over its warrant.""The presidency of the assembly regrets these attempts to hinder international efforts to ensure accountability for acts that are prohibited under general international law,"" it said in a statement.Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war on Thursday, March 23:Ukrainian armed forces need speedy delivery of ammunition promised by the EU to be able to launch a successful counteroffensive, Ihor Zhovka, a Ukrainian presidential advisor, told DW.""The ammunition is what is badly needed now in order to start the counteroffensive on the ground,"" he said. ""In order to start it, we need enough artillery shells, we need enough armored vehicles and tanks, and that will provide our success.""Zhovka declined to be drawn on whether the counteroffensive was planned for the area around Bakhmut, which has seen fierce fighting in recent weeks.""We will definitely not reveal where we will start the counteroffensive,"" Zhovka said. ""If you ask me about the Bakhmut area: the Bakhmut area is important for Ukraine, because this is our territory, this is our land; we will not even give away any single inch of Ukrainian territory.""""But let's not ease the task of the aggressor and let's not reveal the plans of the Ukrainian armed forces,"" he said, saying ammunition was needed to help liberate all the occupied territory.Zhovka emphasized that military aid needed to be delivered fast to ensure any counteroffensive's success.""We need it quickly; we need it by the end of this month to start the counteroffensive,"" he said.Leaders of the European Union are meeting in Brussels on Thursday for the Europe Council summit, where they are set to formally sign off on a deal to fast-track €2 billion ($2.1 billion) worth of ammunition deliveries to Ukraine.Lawmakers hope to deliver 1 million rounds of artillery shells to Ukraine this year.""We will, as always, reaffirm our unwavering commitment to assist Ukraine,"" Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said in his invitation to the summit.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will attend the summit for a working lunch on Thursday, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also scheduled to address the meeting via video.Russia launched a new military satellite into space on Thursday morning, the Defense Ministry said in a statement.Officials said the satellite was ""a medium-class Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle carrying a spacecraft for the Russian Defense Ministry was launched from the Plesetsk launch site in Arkhangelsk Region by combat crews of the Space Forces.""Russian forces have made inroads in the north of the Luhansk region of Ukraine, according to an intelligence update released by the British Defense Ministry.""Russia has partially regained control over the immediate approaches to Kremina town, which was under immediate Ukrainian threat earlier in the year,"" the British Defense Ministry said.""In places, Russia has made gains of up to several kilometers.""According to the intelligence update, Russia's likely intent in the north-east of Ukraine nevertheless remains defensive.""Commanders probably fear this is one of the sectors where Ukraine could attempt major offensive operations,"" the ministry said.Last year, Vladimir Putin suggested Turkey could become a hub for Russian gas exports. With Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan keen to be a mediator in the region, DW asks whether this plan could actually come to fruition.Chinese President Xi Xinping three-day visit to Moscow was a political boost to an increasingly isolated Putin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844747,India: Rahul Gandhi sentenced over Modi remark,"A district court in the state of Gujarat has sentenced India's opposition leader Rahul Gandhi to two years in prison following a criminal defamation case on Thursday.The case revolved around comments Gandhi made in 2019 about the surname of Prime Minister Narendra Modi being associated with criminals.Immediately after the conviction, the court granted him bail and suspended its order for a period of 30 days.This gives the Congress party leader time to appeal at a higher court and saves him from being disqualified as a member of parliament.In April 2019, ahead of general elections, Rahul Gandhi, now 52, was campaigning at a rally in the southern Indian state of Karnataka.While addressing the crowd the Congress leader asked — ""Why all the thieves, be it Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi or Narendra Modi, have Modi in their names?""Nirav Modi is a fugitive and diamond tycoon while Lalit Modi is the former chief of cricket's Indian Premier League.The statement irked members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is led by Prime Minister Modi.A criminal defamation case was filed against Gandhi by Purnesh Modi, a BJP legislator who said that the statement had offended everyone named Modi in India.During the conviction, Gandhi was present in the courtroom in Surat, a city in Gujarat which is the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Gandhi told the court that he made the comment to highlight corruption and not to defame any community.Welcoming the verdict, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju said that the Congress party was ""suffering"" because of Rahul Gandhi's attitude.""Whatever Rahul Gandhi says always affects Congress party and the entire nation in a negative way,” he told the news agency PTI.Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal alleged that despite his differences with Gandhi, he does not agree with the verdict.He called the move a ""conspiracy"" by the BJP and an attempt to ""finish the opposition leaders and parties.""Soon after the court order the Congress Party tweeted that Gandhi will soon file an appeal after which ""we will fight and win.""Rahul Gandhi himself tweeted a quote by Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi which said ""My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth is my God, and non-violence the means to get it.""The former Congress party leader is not related to the country's national hero, but is a member of the powerful Nehru-Gandhi family that has long been involved in the top echelons of politics in the country.In the 2024 elections, Rahul Gandhi will go up against Modi, who will be seeking his third term as prime minister.The Congress party, led by the Gandhi family, once dominated seats in parliament. Today, the party controls less than 10% of elected seats in the lower house.They were crushed by the BJP in two consecutive elections, the most recent one being in 2019.Narendra Modi continues to remain India's most popular politician and is predicted to win a third victory in the next general elections.ns/es (Reuters, AFP)",2023/03/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844760,Latest Vinícius racist abuse prompts 8th complaint of season,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Racist insults at Real Madrid player Vinícius Júnior by spectators during the game at Barcelona last weekend prompted the Spanish league to file another complaint to judicial authorities.It is the eighth such complaint the league has filed regarding racist slurs directed at Vinícius, who is Black, just this season.The latest incident occurred on Sunday during Barcelona’s 2-1 win that put the host in firm control of the title race.The rivals are set to meet again at Camp Nou on April 5 in the second game of their Copa del Rey semifinal that Barcelona leads 1-0.Vinícius has been racially abused since arriving in Spain five years ago, though little has been done to punish fans. The attacks seem to have increased as the 22-year-old Brazil forward emerged as one of Madrid's stars who helped it win the Champions League and Spanish league last season.This week, Spanish club Mallorca said a fan who racially insulted Vinícius and Villarreal’s Samu Chukwueze during games was banned from holding a club membership for three years. Spain’s anti-violence commission has already proposed a fine of 4,000 euros ($4,300) and a 12-month ban from stadiums for the fan, who may also face criminal charges.Valladolid recently suspended 12 season ticket-holders while investigating their alleged verbal abuse of Vinícius.But many of the other attacks have gone unpunished. Authorities, for example, have yet to find those responsible for the hanging of Vinícius’ effigy from a bridge in Madrid before a derby against Atletico Madrid this season.The league has tried to respond by increasing the number of overseers at matches to try to identify perpetrators, especially when Vinícius plays, and encouraging fans to report incidents of racial abuse.The first trial against a fan who racially insulted a player in Spain is expected to begin this year following remarks by an Espanyol supporter against Athletic Bilbao forward Iñaki Williams a few years ago.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844761,"Ford says EV unit losing billions, should be seen as startup","DETROIT (AP) — Ford Motor Co.'s electric vehicle business has lost $3 billion before taxes during the past two years and will lose a similar amount this year as the company invests heavily in the new technology.The figures were released Thursday as Ford rolled out a new way of reporting financial results. The new business structure separates electric vehicles, the profitable internal combustion and commercial vehicle operations into three operating units.Company officials said the electric vehicle unit, called “Ford Model e,” will be profitable before taxes by late 2026 with an 8% pretax profit margin. But they wouldn't say exactly when it's expected to start making money.Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said Model e should be viewed as a startup company within Ford.“As everyone knows, EV startups lose money while they invest in capability, develop knowledge, build (sales) volume and gain (market) share,” he said.Model e, he said, is working on second- and even third-generation electric vehicles. It currently offers three EVs for sale in the U.S.: the Mustang Mach E SUV, the F-150 Lightning pickup and an electric Transit commercial van.The new corporate reporting system, Lawler said, is designed to give investors more transparency than the old system of reporting results by geographic regions. The automaker calculated earnings for each of the three units during the past two calendar years.Model e had pretax losses of $900 million in 2021 and $2.1 billion last year, and it is expected to lose $3 billion this year. In the past two years Ford has announced it would build four new battery factories and a new vehicle assembly plant as well as spending heavily to acquire raw materials to build electric vehicles.By the end of this year, the company based in Dearborn, Michigan, expects to be building electric vehicles at a rate of 600,000 per year, reaching a rate of 2 million per year by the end of 2026.Last year, the pretax profit margin for Model e was minus 40%, Lawler said. To get to a positive 8% by the end of 2026, the company expects economies of scale — spreading costs over more vehicles sold— to be worth 20 points of the improvement. Design and engineering improvements will bring 15 points, battery cost reductions 10 points and 3 points will come from other areas including federal tax incentives and raw material price reductions.Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan calculated that Ford would need $15,000 in cost savings per vehicle to get to an 8% profit margin. He asked what gives Ford confidence it can reach that number. “It just seems like quite a big number,” he said.Lawler replied that Ford is looking at a whole new way of designing vehicles, focusing on energy efficiency, including aerodynamics. “Every decision is about optimizing energy efficiency so that we can get the smallest battery possible to hit the range target that we have for that vehicle,” he said.Ford also will simplify its manufacturing process, maximizing common parts in next generation of EVs, saving over the current generation of repurposed internal combustion vehicle underpinnings. “There is a significant amount of opportunity in there to identify efficiencies and drive those home,” he said.Ford's disclosure of the losses shows “ugly industry truths” that only Tesla is making a profit on electric vehicles, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an investor note.“EVs are likely to be a material drag on near- and intermediate-term earnings,” he wrote. He maintained a “buy” opinion on Ford shares but cut his one-year share price target by $1 to $16.Ford Blue, the unit that sells internal combustion and gas-electric hybrid vehicles, made just over $10 billion before taxes during the last two years. Ford Pro, the commercial vehicle unit, made $5.9 billion during those years, the company said.For this year, Ford expects Ford Blue to post a $7 billion pretax profit, modestly better than last year. Ford Pro is expected to earn $6 billion before taxes, nearly double its earnings last year, Lawler said.Ford was to present the new structure, announced last March, to analysts and investors on Thursday. Other business units include corporate, Ford Credit and Ford Next, a new business incubator.

I could become homeless.""The legislation “would make it impossible to me to live in this country and work here,” he said.Mugisha spoke to The Associated Press amid growing pressure from the United Nations, the United States and others who are urging President Yoweri Museveni to block the legislation passed by lawmakers on Tuesday.The bill prescribes the death penalty for the offense of “aggravated homosexuality” and life imprisonment for “homosexuality.” Aggravated homosexuality is defined as cases of sex relations involving those infected with HIV as well as minors and other categories of vulnerable people. Jail terms of up to 20 years are proposed for those who advocate or promote the rights of LGBTQ people.A suspect convicted of “attempted aggravated homosexuality” can be jailed for 14 years and the offense of “attempted homosexuality” is punishable by up to 10 years, according to the bill.It remains unclear when Museveni will notify the legislature about his intentions regarding the bill. He sometimes takes his time before signing bills into law. He has condemned homosexuality over the years and recently accused unnamed Western nations of “trying to impose their practices on other people.""The bill was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish the “promotion, recruitment and funding” of LGBTQ activities in this East African country where homosexuals are widely disparaged. Only two of 389 legislators present during the voting session opposed the bill, including one taunted during plenary debate by his colleagues as “a homosexualist"" after he presented a dissenting view.International concern is rising over the legislation.Washington has “grave concerns” about the bill, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday, adding that it would hamper tourism and economic investment in Uganda.U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said if the law were enacted Washington would “have to take a look” at imposing economic sanctions on Uganda. He noted that this would be “really unfortunate” since most U.S. aid is in the form of health assistance, especially AIDS-related assistance.The U.N. AIDS agency also warns that the legislation “threatens public health” because it would hurt efforts to fight HIV.Anti-gay sentiment in Uganda has grown in recent weeks amid press reports alleging sodomy in boarding schools, including a prestigious one for boys where a parent accused a teacher of abusing her son. The recent decision of the Church of England to bless civil marriages of same-sex couples also has inflamed many, including some who see homosexuality as imported from abroad.Cases of alleged sexual abuse of minors have put more pressure on the LGBTQ community, said Mugisha, the openly gay leader whose organization was shut down by authorities last year.“Ugandans have been radicalized,” he said. “Even those who were sympathetic are no longer sympathetic because they worry about children.”He said he was getting calls from members of his community who are worried about where to seek medical services and even where to rent.“Many people are concerned about getting outed,” he said. “The question is: ‘What is going to happen to them?’”Homosexuality is criminalized in more than 30 of Africa’s 54 countries.In Uganda, a deeply conservative Christian country, same-sex relations are already criminalized under a colonial-era law banning sex acts “against the order of nature.”But civilian authorities for years have urged a more sweeping bill targeting homosexuals after one enacted in 2014 was nullified on procedural grounds by a panel of judges amid intense international pressure.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844763,Ethics agency to better protect gymnasts for LA Olympics,"GENEVA (AP) — Created to help protect athletes after the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal, the sport’s international investigations agency has set new safeguarding standards with a view to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.The Gymnastics Ethics Foundation published a “Gymnasts 2028” strategy Thursday to better protect athletes from harassment and abuse, investigate complaints, prosecute disciplinary cases and monitor national federations.“The idea is to really put gymnasts at the center of our thinking throughout everything we do,” Alex McLin, the independent foundation’s director, told The Associated Press in an interview.The GEF was created and funded by the sport’s governing body, the International Gymnastics Federation, in the fallout from the scandal of long-time U.S. team doctor Larry Nassar, who is now in prison.Since 2019, the foundation has worked to address systemic issues it describes as “the inherent power imbalances between gymnasts, coaches, judges, and administrators, a culture of control, tolerance of harmful and unethical behaviors, the vulnerabilities of young gymnasts.”“We realized early on that the sort of issues we were facing would likely take a decade to address,” said McLin, an American who is an expert on sports governance.That made 2028, when Los Angeles will host the Olympics “a good benchmark for us to organize ourselves,” he said.A generation of leaders have left USA Gymnastics since Nassar's abuse of hundreds of athletes emerged in 2016, and a new management structure of women’s teams was put in place.“US Gymnastics has gone through an incredible transition where it’s a completely different organization from what it used to be,” McLin said. “That shift is not happening with the same speed everywhere but that momentum is certainly there.”Since 2020, claims of bullying and abusive cultures were made by gymnasts in countries including Australia, Britain, the Netherlands and Switzerland.“A large majority of what we do relates to cases of maltreatment,” said McLin, whose organization has handled at least 135 cases in its first four years.Two cases not connected to abuse but related to unethical conduct led to bans for a pair of prominent officials well-connected in Olympic circles: Russian rhythmic gymnastics coach Irina Viner and Australian sports executive Kitty Chiller.“We are conscious that these are not decisions that could be taken necessarily by the (International Gymnastics Federation) previously in the former setup because of the political considerations,” McLin acknowledged.Viner’s two-year ban for criticizing judges in Tokyo will exclude her from next year's Paris Olympics, even if Russian athletes are allowed back into competition.Her strict, critical coaching style was starkly shown in a documentary, “Over The Limit,” made ahead of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. The film followed the preparations of eventual gold medalist Margarita Mamun.“There is a level of awareness that simply wasn’t there before and that can only be good,” McLin said, praising such programs and investigative reporting into a bullying culture in gymnastics. “What we need is better prevention, but that starts with awareness.”Seeking to be more sensitive handling complaints by young athletes, the GEF wants to manage cases in a less adversarial way. McLin also wants to ensure the investigators picked for specific cases, plus the disciplinary and appeal judges, have the skills to be aware of trauma suffered by athletes.“We need to be respectful of all of those who have suffered and for whom, even in 2028, watching the Olympics I am sure will be triggering to some,"" McLin said. “That is something we can never lose sight of.”___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844764,What are Australia's plans for Indigenous Voice?,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australians expect to vote this year in a referendum that would enshrine in the nation’s constitution a mechanism for Indigenous people to advise Parliament on policies that effect their lives known as the Voice.Proponents say embedding the Voice in the constitution would recognize the special place that Indigenous people have in Australian history while giving them input in government policies.Skeptics and opponents say Australians need more details before they vote on a proposal that risks dividing the nation along racial lines without reducing Indigenous disadvantage.As Australia’s first referendum in a generation approaches, the bipartisan support regarded as essential to successfully changing the constitution has yet to emerge and Indigenous leaders remain divided.Here are some questions and answers about key issues behind the referendum:____WHO ARE INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS?Australia is unusual among former British colonies in that no treaty was ever signed with the nation’s Indigenous inhabitants. The Aboriginal people of Australia’s mainland are culturally distinct from Torres Strait Islanders who come from an archipelago off the northeast coast. So Australia’s Indigenous population is known collectively as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.They accounted for 3.2% of Australia’s population in the 2021 census. Indigenous numbers had soared 25% since the previous census in 2016. Some say declining stigma encouraged more Australians to acknowledge their Indigenous heritage. Others say Indigenous roots are being faked to claim government benefits aimed at overcoming Indigenous disadvantage.Indigenous Australians are the most disadvantaged ethnic group in Australia. They die younger than other Australians, are less likely to be employed, achieve lower education levels and are overrepresented in prison populations.____WHAT IS THE VOICE?The proposed referendum question only asks Australians if they agree with the Voice in principle.The latest draft of the question is: “A proposed law: To alter the constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice. Do you approve this proposed alteration?”If the answer is “yes,” the constitution would be rewritten to state that the “Voice may make representations” to the Parliament and government “on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.”The Parliament would make laws relating to the Voice “including its composition, functions, powers and procedures.”The government has not said what form it proposes the Voice would take. But Cabinet has agreed on a set of principles upon which the Voice would be created.Its members would be chosen by Indigenous people and would serve for fixed terms. They would come from every Australian state and territory as well as the Torres Strait islands and include specific representatives for remote areas.Genders would be equally represented and Indigenous youths would be included.Proponents say there would be no Indigenous right of veto over government policy and lawmakers would be free to disregard the Voice’s representations.But opponents argue the courts might interpret the Voice’s constitutional powers in unpredictable ways, creating legal uncertainty.____WHERE DID THE IDEA OF A VOICE COME FROM?The Voice was recommended in 2017 by a group of 250 Indigenous leaders who met at Uluru, a landmark sandstone rock in central Australia that is a scared site to traditional owners. They were delegates of the First Nations National Constitutional Convention that the then-government had asked for advice on how the Indigenous population could be acknowledged in the constitution.Their petition for constitutional change is known as the Uluru Statement from the Heart, a play on the common description of the semi-desert red sands of the region as Australia’s Red Heart.The conservative government immediately rejected the proposal, arguing that a Voice would be seen as a “third chamber” of Parliament, an unwelcome addition to the House of Representatives and the Senate.When the center-left Labor Party won elections in May last year, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used his first speech to commit his government to creating the Voice.The Nationals party, the junior coalition partner in the former government, announced in November they had decided to oppose the Voice, saying it would divide the nation along racial lines.The Nationals also argue the Voice would undermine the work of 11 Indigenous legislators among the 227 federal lawmakers in Parliament.The Liberal Party, the senior coalition partner, has yet to announce a position, but has demanded more details and the government’s own legal advice.____WHY CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE?The South Australian state government responded to the Uluru Statement from the Heart by introducing in February legislation that it says would create Australia’s first Voice to Parliament for First Nations People.The First Nations Voice Bill proposes a connected, direct and independent line of communication for Indigenous people to South Australia’s Parliament and the government, to allow important, shared communication by locally-elected regional members, the government says.Critics question why the federal government doesn’t similarly legislate to create a Voice without changing the constitution.But Voice proponents argue that recognition in the constitution of Indigenous Australians was an important element of the reform.Victoria state created an elected First People’s Assembly of Victoria in 2019 but that is focused on creating a treaty between the state government and Indigenous people.____WHEN WILL THE REFERENDUM BE HELD?The government plans to introduce legislation to Parliament next week that would set out the referendum and constitutional changes.The government hopes the referendum will be held on a Saturday sometime between October and December.___HOW IS AUSTRALIA’S CONSTITUTION CHANGED?Changing the constitution has never been easy and more than four in five referendums fail.A referendum to change the constitution requires what is known as a double majority — the support of most Australian adults nationwide plus a majority of voters in a majority of states. Five referendums have failed because while they were supported by most Australians, they fell short of gaining majorities in at least four of the six states. Voter turnout is high because voting is compulsory.Of the 44 referendums held since the constitution took effect in 1901, only eight have been carried and none since 1977.When Australia last held a referendum in 1999, Indigenous recognition in the constitution was a key issue behind one of the questions. Australians were asked to approve adding a preamble to the constitution — an introduction that carried only symbolic and no legal significance.The preamble was to have acknowledged that Indigenous Australians had inhabited the country “since time immemorial” and were “honored for their ancient and continuing cultures.”Some observers argue that such an acknowledgment of Indigenous Australians’ place in the nation’s story would be an easier constitutional change to make today than the creation of the Voice.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844765,"After Denver school shooting, an outcry erupts over security","DENVER (AP) — Outraged Denver students and parents demanded better school security and pushed for tighter firearm controls Thursday, a day after a 17-year-old student shot and wounded two administrators at a city high school beset with violence.More than 1,000 students rallied at the Colorado Capitol to push gun reform legislation, while school board members endorsed the district superintendent's abrupt reversal of a policy that had banned armed officers from Denver schools.The shooting at East High School near downtown occurred as administrators were searching for weapons on suspect Austin Lyle, who fled from the scene and was found dead Wednesday night in the mountains southwest of Denver. He died from a self-inlflicted gunshot wound, the Park County coroner said.Educators for decades have grappled with how to keep students safe as violence has intensified, and the Denver shooting stoked an immediate backlash among parents who said security was too lax.The uproar echoed community outrage after other school shootings — from last year's unchecked rampage by a gunman in Uvalde, Texas, who killed 19 elementary school children and two adults, to January's shooting of a Virginia teacher by a 6-year-old student. The tragedies underscore a chronic problem: keeping guns out of schools even as they proliferate in the community.“We’re scared to go to school,” East High School sophomore Anna Hay said during Thursday's rally at the Capitol. “We want to have these legislators look us in our eyes when they tell us they won’t pass gun legislation.”As Wednesday’s shooting unfolded, Hay heard sirens from emergency vehicles and had a sinking realization that the danger was real. “Watching your friends and the fear in their eyes ... it’s the worst feeling in the world,” she said.The Colorado shooting was one of at least four at or near a school this week in the U.S. On Monday, a 15-year-old was arrested in the fatal shooting of a student outside of a Dallas-area high school, on Tuesday a student was hurt in another Dallas-area school shooting and on Wednesday two teenagers were killed and another wounded in a shooting near a North Carolina middle school.East High School parent Steve Katsaros said putting police into schools was just part of the solution. He also wants the campus closed to outsiders and a ban on students wearing hooded sweatshirts so they can be more easily identified following disruptions.“This place is a ticking time bomb,” Katsaros said.The administrators who were shot were unarmed, said Denver schools spokesperson Scott Pribble. Experts say putting civilian administrators in charge of searching a student for weapons was a mistake. Such tasks should be left to trained, armed school resource officers fitted with body armor, said Mo Canady with the National Association of School Resource Officers.Parents converged on the 2,500-student East High School campus following the shooting to voice frustration officials were not protecting their children. East High School in recent weeks experienced a spate of lockdowns and violence, including the killing of 16-year-old Luis Garcia, who was shot while sitting in a car near school. The violence prompted students to march on the Capitol earlier this month.Denver is one of many communities in the U.S. that decided to phase out school resource officers in the summer of 2020 amid protests over racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd by police. The shift away from an armed presence in schools followed concern that officers disproportionately arrest students of color.Meanwhile, shootings in the nation's schools have increased dramatically, from fewer than 100 annually over the last several decades to 303 last year, said David Riedman, founder of the K-12 School Shooting Database.""This year is on pace for 400 shootings,"" Riedman said. “There's pretty much an incident every single school day.”The Denver shooting happened just before 10 a.m. in an office area as Lyle was undergoing a search as part of a “safety plan"" that required him to be patted down daily, officials said.One of the wounded administrators remained hospitalized in serious condition Thursday and the second was treated and released, said Denver Health spokesperson Heather Burke.In response to the shooting, two armed officers will be posted at East High School through the end of the school year. Other city high schools will each get an officer, Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero said.A state lawmaker voiced concern about the swift change in policy, citing research that shows having police in schools is associated with more suspensions and expulsions for students of color.“In order to provide some sense of safety they are going to an extreme that is safe for a certain population and extremely unsafe for another,” said Democrat Rep. Lorena Garcia.Another East High School parent, Dr. Lynsee Hudson Lang, said she was open to having police in schools, but suggested it was an insufficient response to a multi-faceted problem. Lang wanted other strategies considered, like setting up a secure perimeter around the school and evaluating if students are “emotionally safe enough” to attend classes.In Nevada, activists have renewed calls for less police in schools after an officer in Clark County last month was caught on video slamming a Black student to the ground. The debate over resource officers comes almost a year after leaders in the district declared a hard line on fights in schools.Lyle had transferred to East High School after being disciplined and removed from a high school in nearby Aurora because of unspecified violations of school policies, according to officials.The teenager was facing a firearm charge at the time of the shooting and officials at East High School were aware of the charge, Marrero confirmed Thursday during a news conference. But Marrero said the district does not turn away students with struggles.“We are obligated to provide a free and adequate education for all students,” he said. “We failed Austin.”The administrator who usually searched Lyle was absent on the day of the shooting and Marrero speculated that may have played a role.Daily searches of students are rare, said Franci Crepeau-Hobson, a University of Colorado Denver professor specializing in school violence prevention. She said there should be community input into whether officers should be installed in schools and access to firearms needs to be addressed.“Firearms are now the leading killer of youth in this country between homicides, suicides and accidents,” said Crepeau-Hobson. “This is what’s killings our kids.”___Associated Press reporter Rio Yamat contributed reporting from Las Vegas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844766,Artwork that secretly honored Hong Kong dissidents removed,"HONG KONG (AP) — A Hong Kong department store took down a digital artwork that contained hidden references to jailed dissidents, in an incident the artist says is evidence of erosion of free speech in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.It was unclear whether the government played a role in the decision to remove the artwork, it came just days after a slasher film featuring Winnie the Pooh, a figure often used in playful taunts of China’s President Xi Jinping, was pulled from local cinemas.Patrick Amadon’s “No Rioters” was put on display on a billboard at the SOGO Causeway Bay Store for an exhibition that started last Friday, as the city was promoting its return as a vibrant cultural hub following years of pandemic travel restrictions. Art Basel Hong Kong, a prominent art fair in Asia, began this week, alongside other art events.Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to China’s rule in 1997, promising to retain its Western-style freedoms. The city was rocked by a massive pro-democracy protest movement in 2019, which ended after China imposed a “National Security Law” that criminalized much dissent. The city's government has since jailed and silenced many activists.Amadon said he had followed the protests in Hong Kong closely, and he wanted his work to show solidarity with the protesters and remind people about the new reality of the city.“It was too much watching Art Week in Hong Kong pretend the Chinese government didn’t crush a democracy and turn Hong Kong into a vassal surveillance state... because it’s a convenient location for a good market,” the Los Angeles-based artist said.Amadon said he knew the work would be controversial and was surprised it had been displayed in public for days. It featured a panning surveillance camera.Flashes of Matrix-like text showcased the names and prison sentences of convicted activists and other prominent figures in the pro-democracy movement, including legal scholar Benny Tai and former student leader Joshua Wong, who were both charged with subversion in the biggest case brought under the National Security Law.These details were shown too fast to be seen by the naked eyes Amadon said, but viewers could see the details if they used a camera to capture stills. It also referred to journalist-turned activist Gwyneth Ho who was assaulted when she was live-streaming a mob attack in July 2019 during the massive protests sparked by an extradition bill.The gallery that arranged the exhibit did not know whether the government ordered the work taken down, Francesca Boffetti, CEO at Art Innovation Gallery said in an email.“Our intermediary told us that the owners of SOGO were concerned about the sensitive political content hidden behind Patrick’s work, so they decided to remove the work from the exhibition immediately,” Boffetti said.No one mentioned any law or threatened them with fines, she added, but SOGO’s legal team asked the gallery whether it was aware of the content and message of Amadon’s work.Local police and SOGO did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau told the Associated Press that it did not contact SOGO.Amadon said the gallery told him in an urgent call that it was very concerned about its legal exposure after a conversation with SOGO.Since the passage of the National Security Law, the city’s art and media communities have learned to be wary of crossing vaguely defined red lines. Pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was forced to close after authorities arrested its top editors and executives and accused them of foreign collusion. Some artists known for their political work left Hong Kong under the shadow of the law. Some filmmakers have stopped showing their work in the city. Even those producing non-political content have become cautious. But the government insisted that its residents continue to enjoy promised freedoms after the enactment of the law.Amadon said what happened to his work showed that the city had lost its freedom of expression and artistic freedom.“This objectively shows that they are no longer here in the same way that they once were,” he said. “From a narrative standpoint, I mean, it did have to get censored and taken down, I feel like, to be a completed piece.”___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844835,"Russia's security chief blasts West, dangles nuclear threats","MOSCOW (AP) — A top Russian security official warned Thursday about the rising threat of a nuclear war and blasted a German minister for threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin with arrest, saying that such action would amount to a declaration of war and trigger a Russian strike on Germany.Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council chaired by Putin, said in video remarks to reporters that Russia's relations with the West have hit an all-time bottom.Asked whether the threat of a nuclear conflict has eased, Medvedev responded: “No, it hasn’t decreased, it has grown. Every day when they provide Ukraine with foreign weapons brings the nuclear apocalypse closer.”He has issued a barrage of such strongly-worded statements in the past, blasting the U.S. and its NATO allies for what he described as their efforts to break up and destroy Russia. It's been a drastic metamorphosis for the gentle-looking politician, who once was hailed by the West as a liberal hope.In Thursday's comments, the 57-year-old Medvedev denounced the International Criminal Court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin on charges of alleged involvement in abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine as legally null and void. He noted that the move added to a “colossal negative potential"" in the already bitterly strained ties between Russia and the West.“Our relations with the West are already worse than they have ever been in history,” he said.Medvedev specifically blasted German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, who said last week that Putin would be arrested on the ICC's warrant if he visits Germany.“Let's imagine ... the leader of a nuclear power visits the territory of Germany and is arrested,” Medvedev said, adding that it would amount to a declaration of war against Russia. “In this case, our assets will fly to hit the Bundestag, the chancellor's office and so on.”He noted that Russia's nuclear forces have provided a strong deterrent amid the fighting in Ukraine, adding that “we would have been torn to pieces without them.”Medvedev also challenged Ukraine’s sovereignty in comments that could reflect Moscow’s plans to extend its gains.“Honestly speaking, Ukraine is part of Russia,” he said. “But due to geopolitical reasons and the course of history we had tolerated that we were living in separate quarters and had been forced to acknowledge those invented borders for a long time.”The soft-spoken and mild-mannered Medvedev, who served as Russia’s president from 2008 to 2012 when term limits forced Putin to shift into the prime minister’s post, was widely seen by Western officials as more liberal than his mentor. Many in the West expected Medvedev to win a second term and further soften the Kremlin's policies, but he stepped down to allow Putin to reclaim the presidency in what Kremlin critics denounced as a cynical manipulation.Since Putin sent troops into Ukraine more than a year ago, Medvedev, a law faculty graduate, has emerged as one of the most hawkish Russian officials, regularly issuing blustery remarks that combine Latin mottos and legal expressions with four-letter words, and sound much tougher than those issued by old-time Kremlin hard-liners. Observers have interpreted Medvedev's rhetoric as an apparent attempt to curry favor with Putin.Medvedev launched more anti-Western diatribes Thursday, declaring that “it's useless to have talks” with the West and speaking with contempt about Western politicians, alleging a “catastrophic drop in competence and elementary literacy of European Union leaders.”“I have no illusions that we could communicate with them again any time soon,” he said. “It makes no sense to negotiate with certain countries and blocs — they only understand the language of force.”Medvedev. who heads a Security Council panel coordinating weapons production, derided Western statements alleging that Russia is running out of weapons and charged Russian weapons industries have increased output.He said that Russia will produce 1,500 battle tanks this year alone and boost production of other weapons to meet the army's needs. His claims couldn’t be independently verified.“The most important thing now is to make it all in necessary volumes, and we are launching new factories to do that,” Medvedev said.He said that the Russian military already has good intelligence drones and loitering munitions, but acknowledged that it has yet to deploy long-range strike drones.Medvedev drew parallels with World War II, when the Soviet Union managed to drastically ramp up weapons production. He noted that while checking historic archives, he found Soviet leader Josef Stalin's telegrams urging arms factories directors to boost output under the threat of reprisals.In a video fragment from his meeting with top factory managers posted Thursday, Medvedev read one of those telegrams, in which Stalin demanded a tank factory to meet the production plans and warned: “If you breach your duty before the Motherland, I will destroy you as criminals who forget their honor and interests of the Motherland.”Added Medvedev: “I want you to hear me and remember the Generalissimo's words. As you understand, the results were quite impressive, and if there were none you understand what happened.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844836,US jobless claims inch down as labor market remains tight,"The labor market continues to defy Federal Reserve attempts to cool hiring, with U.S. applications for unemployment benefits down again last week and remaining at historically low levels.Jobless claims in the U.S. for the week ending March 18 fell by 1,000 to 191,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.The four-week moving average of claims, which flattens out some of week-to-week volatility, fell by 250 to 196,250, remaining below the 200,000 threshold for the ninth straight week.Applications for unemployment benefits are seen as a barometer for layoffs in the U.S.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve extended its year-long fight against high inflation by raising its key interest rate by a quarter-point, despite concerns that higher borrowing rates could worsen the turmoil that has gripped the banking system.Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed that the central bank remains focused on fighting high inflation, which could require additional rate hikes.Yet he also signaled that the Fed might not need to impose a lengthy string of increases if more banks were to reduce their lending to conserve cash. This could slow the economy, hiring and inflation, Powell said.The Fed’s rate increases are meant to cool the economy, labor market and wages, thereby suppressing prices. But so far, those things have not happened to the degree that the central bank had hoped.Inflation remains more than double the Fed’s 2% target, and the economy is growing and adding jobs at a healthy clip.Last month, the government reported that employers added a substantial 311,000 jobs in February, fewer than January’s huge gain but enough to keep pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively to fight inflation. The unemployment rate rose to 3.6%, from a 53-year low of 3.4%.In its latest quarterly projections, the Fed predicts that the unemployment rate will rise from its current 3.6% to 4.5% by year’s end, a sizable increase historically associated with recessions.Though the U.S. labor market remains strong, layoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies hired aggressively during the pandemic. IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, Twitter and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.Amazon said this week that it would cut another 9,000 positions, adding to the 18,000 employees the tech giant said it would lay off in January.Last week, Facebook parent Meta said it was slashing another 10,000 jobs in addition to the 11,000 culled in November.The real estate sector has taken the biggest hit from the Fed’s interest rate hikes. Higher mortgage rates — which have risen closer to 7% again in recent weeks — had slowed home sales for 12 straight months before February’s 14.5% improvement.About 1.69 million people were receiving jobless aid the week that ended March 11, an increase of 14,000 from the week before. That number is close to pre-pandemic levels.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844837,Zebra runs loose in Seoul before being taken back to zoo,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A young zebra walked, trotted, and galloped for hours in the busy streets of South Korea’s capital before emergency workers tranquilized the animal and brought it back to a zoo.The zebra — a male named Sero that was born in the zoo in 2021 — was in stable condition and being examined by veterinarians as of Thursday evening, said Choi Ye-ra, an official at the Children’s Grand Park in Seoul.She said the zoo was investigating how the zebra managed to escape. She didn’t immediately confirm media reports that the animal partially destroyed the wooden fencing surrounding its pen before busting out around 2:50 p.m.Social media was flowing with smartphone videos of the zebra trotting alongside lines of cars that were waiting for the greenlight at an intersection, and galloping through a street surrounded by commercial buildings as pedestrians stopped and gasped.Police and emergency workers managed to corner the zebra after it entered a narrow alleyway between houses and shot it with tranquilizers, ending its three hours of freedom.There were no immediate reports of injuries or property damage caused by the zebra running loose.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844838,UEFA to investigate Barcelona for its referee payments,"GENEVA (AP) — Barcelona is facing a new legal threat from UEFA, including a possible Champions League ban, because of its payments of millions of dollars to a company linked to a Spanish refereeing official.The European soccer body asked Thursday for an investigation into the matter, which is already being pursued by prosecutors in Spain.Champions League regulations in effect since 2007 allow for clubs to be removed from European competitions if they were involved in fixing matches. Further disciplinary sanctions can follow.UEFA said Thursday it asked disciplinary inspectors to “conduct an investigation regarding a potential violation of UEFA’s legal framework by FC Barcelona in connection with the so-called ‘Caso Negreira.’”Court documents show Barcelona paid 7.3 million euros ($7.7 million) from 2001-18 to the company of José María Enríquez Negreira, the former vice president of Spanish soccer’s refereeing committee.Prosecutors in Spain have formally accused Barcelona of corruption in sports, fraudulent management and falsification of business documents. An investigating judge will decide if this will lead to charges.No evidence has yet been published that referees or individual games were actually influenced.Barcelona has consistently denied any wrongdoing or conflict of interest, saying it paid for technical reports on referees but never tried to influence their decisions in games.Any proof of manipulated games in the past 16 years could see UEFA exclude Barcelona from its competitions for one year and prosecute a disciplinary case.Barcelona has a 12-point lead in the Spanish league and is almost certain to qualify for next season's Champions League — an entry that would pay tens of millions of dollars to a club that posted record losses last year.The burden of proof for UEFA is stated in regulations for the Champions League and other club competitions.“If, on the basis of all the factual circumstances and information available to UEFA, UEFA concludes to its comfortable satisfaction that a club has been directly and/or indirectly involved, (since April 27, 2007), in any activity aimed at arranging or influencing the outcome of a match at national or international level, UEFA will declare such club ineligible to participate in the competition,” the rules state.In previous cases of suspected match-fixing, clubs including Fenerbahce, Metalist Kharkiv and Skenderbeu were banned from UEFA competitions in decisions that were upheld by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Fenerbahce was withdrawn from the 2011-12 Champions League by the Turkish soccer federation, seeming to be under pressure from UEFA, after being implicated in manipulating games to help secure the previous season's league domestic title. The club was later banned for two more seasons.Former Albanian champion Skenderbeu is serving a 10-year ban after a UEFA investigation into match-fixing for betting scams, including Champions League qualifying games and Europa League group games in 2015.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844873,The Fed raises interest rates despite the ongoing banking crisis,"On Wednesday, 22 March 2023, the Federal Reserve continued its fight against inflation and once again raised interest rates by 0.25%. This move causes concern because the present banking crisis has developed precisely because of rising interest rates.      KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 23 March 2023 - On Wednesday, 22 March 2023, the Federal Reserve continued its fight against inflation and once again raised interest rates by 0.25%. This move causes concern because the present banking crisis has developed precisely because of rising interest rates.   So far, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) successful strategy for fighting inflation has been to raise the key rate and reduce the balance sheet. This negatively impacted the value of U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities, which are an important source of capital for most U.S. banks. Silicon Valley Bank was the first to fail—it was forced to quickly sell the cheaper bonds at a significant loss, leading to a liquidity crisis and eventual collapse. This was followed by Signature Bank and Credit Suisse, which had to sell-off, and First Republic, which received a lifeline.   The U.S. Federal Reserve recognised its mistake and took emergency measures to support the banking system. It provided $303 billion of liquidity to banks through the Discount Window and Bank Term Funding Program (BFTP), thereby curbing the banking crisis locally.   The crisis also spread to the eurozone, with Credit Suisse failing after a 166-year run. To prevent a complete collapse, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) opened a credit line for Credit Suisse, which enabled it to take a $53.7 billion loan and stay afloat. However, it ultimately failed.   Just hours after opening the credit line, the European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde announced a rate hike, doubling it by 50 basis points at a scheduled meeting. While investors viewed this as a positive signal for European economic stability, the rate hike decision appeared hasty and could potentially lead to an aggressive rate hike by the Fed.   At Wednesday's meeting, the Fed showed great restraint by adhering to its baseline and raising the key rate by 25 bps, while looking to reduce the balance sheet further. The  press release on the situation with the banks stated the following:   ""The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly attentive to inflation risks.""   Jerome Powell reported the need for continued balance sheet cuts. Commenting on the issue, the OctaFX financial market analyst Kar Yong Ang said: 'It is commendable that the Fed did not cave to market pressure and maintained the course to suppress inflation. This is a crucial step that will help them curb inflation and perhaps even avoid a recession.'   However, there were dovish signals in the Fed's dot plot, including a rate cut of 75 bps next year. Seeing only the growing liquidity flow, the market interpreted it as the end of the tightening monetary policy cycle, with swap markets betting that the U.S. Fed rate will fall to 4.19% at the end of this year.   The banking sector is facing great risks, and the regulators' fight against inflation could make it more unstable, ultimately dragging the rest of the economy down the chain and potentially causing a global recession. Only time will tell whether this happens.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844897,"Park outside: Hyundai, Kia recall vehicles due to fire risk","DETROIT (AP) — Hyundai and Kia are telling the owners of more than 571,000 SUVs and minivans in the U.S. to park them outdoors because the tow hitch harnesses can catch fire while they are parked or being driven.The affiliated Korean automakers are recalling the vehicles and warning people to park them away from structures until repairs are made.Affected Hyundai vehicles include the 2019 to 2023 Santa Fe, the 2021 to 2023 Santa Fe Hybrid, the 2022 and 2023 Santa Fe Plug-in hybrid and the 2022 and 2023 Santa Cruz. The only Kia affected is the Carnival minivan from 2022 and 2023. All have Hyundai or Kia tow hitch harnesses that came as original equipment or were installed by dealers.The Korean automakers say in documents posted Thursday by U.S. safety regulators that water can get into a circuit board on the hitches and cause a short circuit even if the ignitions are off.Hyundai has reports of one fire and five heat damage incidents with no injuries. Kia has no reports of fires or injuries.Dealers at first will remove the fuse and tow hitch computer module until a fix is available. Later they will install a new fuse and wire extension with an improved connector that's waterproof. Owners will be notified starting May 16.Last year Hyundai recalled more than 245,000 2020 through 2022 Palisade SUVs for a similar problem.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday that the latest recall is a direct result of the agency monitoring the Palisade recall from last year.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844898,Coinbase tumbles after SEC warns of securities violations,"Shares of Coinbase tumbled 15% Thursday after the cryptocurrency trading platform received a warning from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it could face securities charges.The cryptocurrency trading platform said in an SEC filing late Wednesday that it had received a Wells Notice from the agency, which indicates that regulators believe laws protecting investors were violated.Among the practices being targeted by the SEC is “staking,” which is “Coinbase Earn” by the company.Users of trading platforms can stake their cryptocurrency, essentially locking up some of their assets, in exchange for payment later, much like earning interest rates in a savings account. Those assets are used by platforms like Coinbase Global Inc. to guarantee other transactions taking place on the blockchain.The SEC says Coinbase and other platforms must register as a securities platform to offer such services, and only after it is approved by the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance.A Wells Notice for Coinbase is another warning shot from SEC Chair Gary Gensler who is attempting to establish the agency's oversight of crypto firms when they wander into areas typically associated with banking.Kraken, a rival crypto exchange platform, agreed to settle in February for $30 million and to stop offering staking as a service.Analysts that follow crypto and Coinbase said there is a significant threat for the company.“We continue to see regulatory risk as meaningful for Coinbase given substantial (high quality) earnings growth potential from services like staking that are at risk of regulatory elimination,” wrote analysts with JP Morgan on Thursday.Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong lashed out at the SEC late Wednesday and the company has been critical of regulations related to staking, calling them vague.“Going forward the legal process will provide an open and public forum before an unbiased body where we will be able to make clear for all to see that the SEC simply has not been fair, reasonable, or even demonstrated a seriousness of purpose when it comes to its engagement on digital assets,” Armstrong tweeted.In a blog post, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal said that the SEC matter was a “disappointing development.”“Rest assured, Coinbase products and services continue to operate as usual,” Grewal said.In January New York announced a $100 million settlement with Coinbase over what state officials called significant failures in the cryptocurrency trading platform’s systems for spotting potential criminal activity.Under the terms of the settlement, the San Francisco company agreed to pay a $50 million penalty to New York state and will invest another $50 million in its compliance program. An independent monitor installed by the state will work with Coinbase for a year to oversee compliance.That same month, Coinbase announced that it was cutting approximately 20% of its workforce, or about 950 jobs, in a second round of layoffs in less than a year. Coinbase announced the elimination of 1,100 jobs in June, or approximately 18% of its global workforce, in a first round of cuts.Coinbase was founded in 2012 and has no headquarters. It went public in April 2021 by listing its stock directly and skipping the traditional process of hiring underwriters.Cryptocurrency has been on a tear this year after plunging severely in 2022. Bitcoin climbed another 3% Thursday to $27,700 and is now up 68% for the year in an era of mass layoffs in the tech sector and widespread anxiety about stability in the U.S. banking sector.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844899,Weather-weary California hopes for sunny spring after storms,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Californians are tired. Tired of the rain, tired of the snow, tired of stormy weather and the cold, relentlessly gray skies that have clouded the Golden State nearly nonstop since late December.With spring now underway, the state's 39 million residents are hopeful for sunnier days ahead. But this week's atmospheric river — the 12th such storm here since late December — had other plans.The powerful systems dump huge amounts of rain and snow as they bring massive plumes of Pacific moisture into California. They have already wreaked havoc across the state, with a death toll rising as communities dig out and floodwaters recede. High winds toppled trees, snowfall stranded mountain communities and storm surges inundated coastal towns with no end in sight.Californians initially welcomed the precipitation and chilly temperatures after a record-hot summer and yearslong drought that included the driest January through March on record in 2022. But the atmospheric rivers busted the drought in two-thirds of the state and broke precipitation records along the way.In San Diego — famed for its 72-and-sunny climate — this week’s high temperatures hover around 60 F to 61 F (15.5 C to 16 C). The average high is 67 F (19 C), said National Weather Service meteorologist Mark Moede.And San Diego has already recorded nearly 5 more inches (13 centimeters) of rain than normal since the water year began in October, Moede said.All that rainfall has hurt San Diego's beachfront businesses: Surf schools are slowing down, boardwalk vendors are bored, the usual sun-worshipping locals are staying home.“We depend on the sunshine,” said Duncan Taylor, who works at a surf-inspired clothing store called Sun Diego Boardshop. “We depend on people coming out and having a good time at the beach.”Noe Reyes closed up his stand in Mission Beach early Tuesday after too much rain and too few customers. He needs tourists to buy hoodies, souvenirs and drinks, but an empty promenade doesn't make money.“It’s been rough,” he said. “There’s no one out here, not even locals.”Weather in typically temperate Los Angeles hasn't been much better. Angelenos experienced the wettest January and February since 2005, according to the National Weather Service. That put a damper on everything from youth baseball leagues that faced cancellation after cancellation to washed-out beach yoga classes overlooking the Santa Monica Pier.Beach Yoga SoCal co-owner Eric Gomez said he and his wife, who are from less-sunny New Jersey, took over the business in 2018 to experience yoga in “quintessential LA.”“We never imagined it to be this rainy,"" Gomez said Wednesday after canceling another class. ""It definitely feels like a different climate of sorts these past few months.”Even Californians eager for winter weather found themselves exhausted by the season.“I am so tired of this rain,"" said Nicolas Gonzalez, a National Audubon Society spokesperson. ""I am just ready to be outside again.”Gonzalez and a friend had planned a cabin weekend last month in the city of Big Bear Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains with the goal of spotting the Southern California valley's bald eagle pair between snowy hikes and trips to the hot tub. They postponed their trip when major snowfall forced road closures that blocked most routes to the cabin.“I’m hoping that next month, it’ll be just as snowy and wintry with less of a life-endangering risk to get there,” he said in February.No such luck. The pair had to scrap the trip entirely as more snow fell and roads remained treacherous for weeks.Along the central coast — where storm surges and pounding rain have destroyed picturesque seaside towns and inland farming communities alike — TV forecasters are exhausted.“I don’t want to come into work,” said Lee Solomon, KSBW's chief meteorologist. “To have to focus your brain on three storms all at once, in a seven-day period — it’s hard.”The stress is compounded by the complexity of knowing when to tell people to flee in a state with microclimates encompassing the coast, high mountains and valley farmlands. The evacuation orders are piling up with the atmospheric rivers, Solomon said, but you don’t want to “over-warn people” and risk complacency.In coastal Carmel, Jaime Schrabeck's nail salon was under evacuation orders for days in mid-January. Now she's contending with power outages — the result of the 11th atmospheric river — that could cost her up to $1,000 a day. Her clients prefer gel enhancements, which need electricity to power a special light.“We can’t take it outdoors and use the sun’s rays to cure it properly,” she said.At Schrabeck’s utility provider, Pacific Gas and Electric, crews work 12- to 14-hour days, hanging from poles trying to keep the lights on. They’ve been at it for months, but outages still topped 500,000 statewide during one storm.“When everybody else has battened down the hatches, they’re out there working,” said Bob Dean, business manager for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 1245, the union that represents thousands of line workers in Northern California and Nevada. “It's like, ‘My God, we need a break here.’”Further south at Bart’s Books, the partially outdoor bookseller has seen business slow with the rain. The Ojai store lost a shelf of 150 Russian history books to a leak two months back, but manager Matt Henriksen is looking on the bright side.“We lose more books to damage from sun than water,” Henriksen said. “This is a Southern California problem.”As is the current surfing outlook. Even after the rains let up, experts tell swimmers to stay out of the water for three days. Contaminated runoff increases bacteria, introducing a risk of serious illness.For Eric “Bird” Huffman, owner of Bird's Surf Shed in San Diego, the swell has remained stubbornly small, and the 12th atmospheric river's forecast is much the same.Too many rainy days, too little sunshine. And way too much winter.___Dazio reported from Los Angeles.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844900,Japan's winning WBC team drops in on Prime Minister Kishida,"TOKYO (AP) — Prime Minister Fumio Kishida might have had his most enjoyable day in office on Thursday when Japan's winning World Baseball Classic team paid a visit.Kishida was beaming when a gold medal from the winning team was placed around his neck, and he also received a large card in a frame containing each player's signature.“To all the members of Samurai Japan, congratulations on your victory in the WBC,” Kishida said, thanking them for their courtesy visit to his office after their long flight back from the United States.Japan finished undefeated — only the second team to do that in the World Baseball Classic — after beating the United States 3-2 in the deciding game.“I thank you for giving tremendous courage and energy to all of Japan. Your huge achievement was possible because the power of each individual and the power of the team as a whole were combined, and I sincerely appreciated it,” Kishida said.Players wore suits — not baseball uniforms — and posed for photos, including one imitating Lars Nootbaar's pepper-grinder gesture. Players like Nootbaar who compete in Major League Baseball did not return to Japan.Kishida said he did not get to watch the two final victories over Mexico and United States because he was in Ukraine holding talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Japan manager Hideki Kuriyama said he'd “hardly seen such an excellent team” and encouraged the prime minister to praise them — which he did.“I told my players that history is the history of winners,"" Kuriyama said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844901,German unions call for wide-ranging transport strike Monday,"BERLIN (AP) — German unions are calling on thousands of workers across the country's transport system to stage a one-day strike on Monday that is expected to bring widespread disruption to planes, trains and local transit.The ver.di service workers' union and the EVG union, which represents many railway workers, announced the 24-hour walkout in a joint appearance Thursday that came as employees in many sectors have been seeking hefty raises to reflect persistently high inflation.Ver.di chair Frank Werneke said that his union is calling for 120,000 workers to walk out. Those will include security and ground workers at all German airports except Berlin, local transit employees in seven of Germany's 16 states, harbor employees and workers on highways — the latter a measure that Werneke said is likely to affect some tunnels.“This strike day will have a massive effect — we are aware of this and it is also necessary,” Werneke said. He added that it's important to make clear before the next round of negotiations “that our demands have broad support in the workforce.”EVG counterpart Martin Burkert said that his union is calling for 230,000 workers at Germany's main railway operator, government-owned Deutsche Bahn, and others to walk out. He said people traveling on Sunday should take care “to be at their destination in a timely manner,” because some of the affected shifts could start on Sunday evening.Deutsche Bahn personnel chief Martin Seiler called the EVG strike announcement “completely excessive, unnecessary and disproportionate.”“We assume that the country will be paralyzed on Monday, and that as good as nothing will be possible in rail transport,” he added. Deutsche Bahn said that it won't operate any long-distance trains and most regional trains won't run either.Frankfurt Airport, Germany's busiest, tweeted that its operations will be “heavily disrupted,” and “strongly advised” passengers against traveling to the airport on Monday.Munich Airport, the country's second-busiest, said that ver.di is hitting it with two days of strikes and it will have no regular passenger or cargo flights on either Sunday or Monday.Ver.di is engaged in a series of pay negotiations, notably for employees of Germany's federal and municipal governments. In that case, it is seeking a 10.5% pay raise. Employers have offered a total of 5% in two stages plus one-time payments of 2,500 euros ($2,700).It already has staged a series of one-day walkouts at individual airports and in public services, including local transit.EVG is seeking a raise of 12%. Deutsche Bahn also has offered a two-stage raise totaling 5% plus one-time payments.Germany's annual inflation rate in February was 8.7%.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844902,"Joshua facing pressure, new reality ahead of comeback fight","For so long the poster boy of boxing’s heavyweight division, Anthony Joshua has been facing a new reality in recent months.Suddenly, the British fighter is on the outside looking in.His star has fallen — even his promoter acknowledges that — in the wake of punishing, back-to-back losses to Oleksandr Usyk that have led many to question Joshua’s ability, even as a two-time world champion.“You can’t be like, ‘Man, it’s been tough, you know, life’s been down,’” Joshua told the Associated Press. “You always have to walk with your head held high, chest out.“It’s a different perspective for me now, but it’s not one that rules me or makes any difference to my behavior.”So, while the biggest heavyweight fights are being made — or, in the case of the collapsed bout between Usyk and Tyson Fury, not made — around him, Joshua is adapting to his new status and beginning a fresh phase in his career.The hunter, as opposed to the hunted.The pressure, however, is still very much on him.On April 1, Joshua takes on American boxer Jermaine Franklin in London for his first fight since losing the rematch against Usyk in Saudi Arabia in August. It’s the first time in 13 fights, stretching back to December 2015, that Joshua won’t be attempting to either retain or regain a world title.Win, and Joshua — with his brand and standing — will no doubt be thrust back in the conversation for world title fights.Eddie Hearn, his promoter, was even tweeting excitedly on Thursday about a potential all-British fight with Fury next up followed by, somewhat optimistically, a fight to be undisputed champion.Lose to Franklin, though, in a fight being televised by the DAZN streaming service, and Joshua’s career will be hanging in the balance. It would be three straight losses — or four in six fights taking in the shocking defeat to Andy Ruiz Jr. at Madison Square Garden in June 2019.Even Hearn would struggle to sell Joshua as a credible heavyweight force in that case.And deep down, Joshua knows it.“This is what I’ve signed up for, this is what I want, and I’m going to live up to the expectation,” Joshua told the AP.After the second loss to Usyk, Hearn spoke of Joshua likely having three or four fights in 2023 to build him back up for a shot at being world champion for a third time.With the heavyweight division in flux after the collapse of Fury-Usyk, that title shot could yet come much quicker.“I’m going to be flexible, keep a flexible mindset, be open-minded,” said Joshua, who spoke of wanting his world titles back within “12-16 months.”It all hinges on beating Franklin, an American who lost for the first time in his 22-fight professional career in a majority decision against Dillian White in London in November.“I’m a promoter, I’m hyping the fight, but I am nervous,” Hearn said.Joshua has another trainer — a third different one in as many fights — for the Franklin bout, with Derrick James in his corner.Joshua has been with James, who also has Errol Spence Jr. in his stable, in a training camp held exclusively in Dallas during which the Brit says he has dedicated himself solely to boxing and avoided distractions.“He is the truth, you know,” Joshua said of James, who he seems to regard as a permanent trainer. “I don’t want to put him under any pressure, though. I’ve got to fight at the end of the day.”All the pressure, instead, will be on the 33-year-old Joshua while he is at the crossroads of a career that started with an Olympic gold medal in 2012, and includes that era-defining fight with Wladimir Klitschko in 2017.“Of course his star has fallen,"" Hearn said, ""but he’s a man who, in my opinion, is an elite heavyweight — top-three heavyweight in the world — and I’m sorry if that’s such a crime.""He makes more sacrifices and commitments than any athlete I’ve seen, and he’s my mate. I’m so pumped for his return.”___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/23,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844904,Slim pickings for buyers amid near-record low homes for sale,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Americans eager to buy a home this spring, beware: It’s slim pickings out there.The number of U.S. homes on the market is at near-historic lows, which could dim would-be buyers’ prospects for finding a house or condo and fuel competition for the most affordable properties, economists say.As of the end of February, just as the spring homebuying season got under way, some 980,000 homes were on the market nationally, according to the National Association of Realtors.That’s an increase of 15.3% from February last year, when the number of homes for sale sank to an all-time low.February’s tally of homes for sale translates into a 2.6-month supply at the current sales pace, according to NAR. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 5- to 6-month supply.While homebuyers will have more properties to choose from now than last spring, the low supply and sharply higher mortgage rates set the stage for a higher overall price tag for homeownership.“Buyers are facing a tough market, both in terms of inventory availability and in terms of how that matches up to affordability,” said Hannah Jones, an economic data analyst at Realtor.com.A big reason there are more homes for sale than a year ago: Properties are taking, on average, nearly twice as long to sell. New listings, meanwhile, were down about 16% in February from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com data.Homebuyers have had to contend with a shrinking pool of homes for sale for much of the last decade, partly due to underbuilding of new homes since the mid-2000s housing crash and years of ultra-low mortgage rates, which give homeowners less incentive to sell after years of soaring home prices.“Homeowners aren’t giving up their current house and low monthly payments to join a tight, expensive market,” said Skylar Olsen, chief economist for Zillow.The last year that the monthly tally of homes on the market averaged more than 2 million was 2015, according to NAR data. That’s steadily declined, reaching 995,833 last year.Despite the thin inventory of home listings, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes surged 14.5% last month as homebuyers seized on a modest drop in mortgage rates. Sales were down 22.6% from a year earlier, when mortgage rates were, on average, more than 2 percentage points lower.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844905,No red carpet? French unrest impacts King Charles III's trip,"PARIS (AP) — Unrest in France is tarnishing the sheen of King Charles III's first overseas trip as U.K. monarch, with striking workers literally refusing to roll out a red carpet amid pension reform protests and calls for the visit to be canceled altogether.Charles is scheduled to undertake the trip beginning Sunday on behalf of U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s government, which hoped a glamorous royal tour would underscore efforts to rebuild Anglo-French ties that were frayed by Brexit.But anger over French President Emmanuel Macron's resolve to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64 are clouding what was meant to be a show of bonhomie and friendship. Instead, Charles' visit is being seen as an unnecessary display of hereditary privilege.“It’s very bad timing. Normally the French would welcome a British king. But in this moment, people protesting are on high alert for any sign of privilege and wealth,” said Paris-based writer Stephen Clarke, the author of “Elizabeth II, Queen of Laughs.”French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin gave reassurances Thursday night that the king will be safe during his French stay. He spoke after a day of nationwide protest marches, some marred by violence, notably in the French capital.The visit “poses no problem,” Darmanin said. ""King Charles will be welcomed and welcomed well, of course, by France.”With piles of uncollected garbage lining the French capital's once-pristine boulevards, observers say the optics could not be worse — for both Charles and Macron.French labor union CGT announced this week that its members at Mobilier National, the institution in charge of providing red carpets, flags and furniture for public buildings, would snub a Sunday reception for the king upon his arrival in Paris.“We ask our administration to inform the services concerned that we will not provide furnishings, red carpets or flags,” a CGT statement read.The Elysee Palace, the French president's official residence, said that nonstriking workers would set up the necessary accouterments for the trip instead.Months in the making, Charles' posh itinerary with Queen Consort Camilla for the March 26-29 trip includes a visit to the Musee d’Orsay, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe and a lavish dinner at the former royal residence, the Versailles Palace.“They’re planning on going to Versailles. It does not look good. This seems very 1789,” Clarke said. The opulent Versailles, once the dazzling center of royal Europe and a focal point of the French Revolution, is an enduring symbol of social inequalities and excess.Macron is facing a backlash for pushing through a bill raising the retirement age without a parliamentary vote. Some opponents accuse the president of being out of touch, and Charles hasn't been spared from similar criticism as protests continued this week.“Unbelievable! We are going to have Emmanuel Macron, the Republican monarch, welcoming King Charles III in Versailles... while the people in the street are demonstrating,” Sandrine Rousseau, a lawmaker from France's Green Party, told French channel BFM TV. “Of course” the king should cancel his visit, she added.To limit the potential for disruptions to the royal dinner, security is expected to be very tight around Versailles. In 2020, demonstrators clashed with police on its regal cobblestones amid a previous pension reform bill.The unrest and demands for Charles to stay away are certain to cause disquiet in London. When he was on a walkabout in York, England, in November, someone in a crowd of angry protesters threw eggs in his direction.The French have maintained a love-hate relationship with kings ever since they guillotined King Louis XVI in 1793. Queens have typically fared better since then. Queen Elizabeth II, Charles' mother, was a hugely popular figure in France, the European country she visited the most before her death last year.Elizabeth, who spoke fluent French, made five state visits to France, in 1957, 1972, 1992, 2004 and 2014, as well as unofficial and private visits. Her son now wears the crown, but some say that he remains in her shadow.“The problem with Charles is that he is not the queen. She was very loved here,” Paris resident Geraldine Duberret, 62, said. “Charles does not have such a good reputation here. He seems a bit spoiled.”The celebrity press in France recently focused on unconfirmed rumors that the king would travel with excessive numbers of servants, comparing him to his late mother, who famously insisted that her staff turn off lightbulbs in Buckingham Palace to save energy.“This visit was a chance for Charles to relaunch himself in the eyes of the French,” Clarke said. “It could have been like a blank canvas, but he will likely not be able to have the impact he would have wished.”Charles does command some respect in France for his environmental activism. The king and queen consort plan to tour areas of France's Bordeaux region, which last year were ravaged by wildfires widely blamed on global warming.The couple's time in southwest France also gives them a chance to see vineyards and to taste the region’s famous wines, including a planned stop at Bordeaux’s Chateau Smith Haut Lafitte, a vineyard and winemaker.It was unclear whether he would pass by Bordeaux city hall, whose heavy wooden door was burned down Thursday night by troublemakers after a protest march against Macron's pension bill.Regional officials are effusive about receiving the U.K. royals, a stark contrast to the reception Charles and Camilla could expect in Paris.“It’s very touching that Charles plans to come to Bordeaux. We have a very strong relationship — and historic — with the U.K. The region stayed English for three centuries. It’s in our DNA,” said Cecile Ha of the Bordeaux Wine Council.Ha said winemakers in Bordeaux were “on the same page” as Charles, because the region boasts the most organic vineyards in France.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844906,President seals Finland's NATO bid by signing required laws,"HELSINKI (AP) — The Finnish president on Thursday formally sealed the Nordic country’s historic bid to join NATO by signing into law the required national legal amendments needed for membership in the Western military alliance.The move by President Sauli Niinistö means Finland has completed national measures needed to join NATO, and is now just awaiting approval from Turkey and Hungary, the only two of NATO’s 30 existing members that haven't ratified its bid.In Turkey Thursday, a parliamentary committee approved Finland’s NATO application, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, bringing Helsinki a step closer to joining the alliance.Members of the Turkish parliament’s committee on foreign affairs voted in favor of Finland’s bid a week after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would move forward with ratifying it.Finland’s application could be ratified by the full Turkish assembly, where Erdogan’s party and its allies hold a majority, as early as next week. Turkey has presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for May 14, and ratification is expected before that.Admitting new countries requires unanimous approval from the alliance members, and the parliaments in Ankara and Budapest haven’t yet given the green light.After delays of several months, the Hungarian parliament is finally expected to approve Finland's accession on March 27.Finland’s 200-seat Eduskunta legislature endorsed the country’s NATO bid with an overwhelming 184-7 majority on March 1.Finland and neighboring Sweden applied to become NATO members 10 months ago in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, abandoning decades of nonalignment.This is seen by many experts as one of the biggest geopolitical ramifications of Moscow’s war in Ukraine. Finland's border with Russia runs for a total of 1,340 kilometers (832 miles).Finland and Sweden, which are close partners culturally, economically and politically, submitted their bids together and planned to enter the alliance at the same time.Sweden’s accession, however, has stalled due to opposition from Turkey, and Erdogan said last week his country wouldn’t ratify membership before disputes between Ankara and Stockholm are solved.“From the start of this process, Finland was more prepared and determined to meet our country’s sensitivities and expectations,” Turkey’s Deputy Foreign Minister Burak Akcapar said Thursday, as quoted by Anadolu Agency, explaining the different approach by Ankara to NATO bids by Helsinki and Stockholm.“We believe that Finland’s membership will strengthen the NATO alliance, contribute to the alliance’s burden-sharing against threats as well as to NATO’s deterrence, to regional security and to our determination to fight terrorism,” he added.It isn’t clear when Budapest will ratify Stockholm’s bid.In Brussels, Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said Thursday he would ask Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán why Hungary intends to ratify Finland’s NATO application before Sweden’s.“I will ask the question for what reason they are now announcing that they will separate Sweden from Finland. These are signals that we have not received before,” Kristersson told reporters on the sidelines of a European Union summit.On Wednesday, Swedish lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in favor of Sweden joining NATO, signing off on the country’s membership along with the required legislation._____Suzan Frazer in Ankara, Turkey and Jan M.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844907,Ukraine president visits front-line areas as new phase nears,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine's president on Thursday made his third visit in two days to areas that have felt the brunt of Russia’s war, with a trip to the southern Kherson region that was retaken from the Kremlin’s forces, and as a senior Kyiv commander hinted that a brewing Ukrainian counteroffensive could come “very soon.”Ukraine took back control of the Kherson region’s capital, also called Kherson, at the end of last year, pushing out the Russian occupiers who had captured the city in the weeks following the start of Moscow full-scale invasion more than a year ago. The Dnieper River now marks the front line in the region, which is still partially occupied.While in Kherson on Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with local security officials and inspected infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes, his office said.On Wednesday, Zelenskyy visited Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city in northeastern Ukraine. Kyiv's troops recaptured Kharkiv from the Russians last September as part of the same monthslong counteroffensive that won back Kherson.Also Wednesday, Zelenskyy met with troops in the eastern Donetsk region, stopping by a hospital to see wounded soldiers and giving state awards to the defenders of Bakhmut, a wrecked city that is now a symbol of Ukraine’s dogged resistance against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s ambitions.Zelenskyy’s 48 hours of visits far from Kyiv — and close to the front line — came as improving weather sets the stage for possible new offensives by both sides. The biting winter weather, followed by mud as the ground thawed out, have prevented major changes on the battlefield, and the war has largely been deadlocked in recent months.Ukraine is now starting to receive modern weapons, including tanks, from its Western allies, who are also training Ukrainian troops to use them.Russian forces have been digging in where they hold territory in the four provinces that Moscow illegally annexed in September — Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia. Putin has made it clear he wants to have control there.Ukraine’s ground forces commander said Thursday that Russian forces are “exhausting themselves” in their grinding push to take Bakhmut, giving Kyiv a window of opportunity for a counterstrike.Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a Telegram post that the Russian assault on Bakhmut was causing Russian forces to “lose considerable strength.”“Very soon, we will take advantage of this opportunity, as we once did near Kyiv, Kharkiv, Balakliia and Kupiansk,” Syrskyi added, referencing Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year that pushed Russia back from the country’s capital and large swathes of the northeast.Russia has kept up its long-range attacks using artillery, missiles and drones, meanwhile.The death toll from a Russian drone attack Wednesday on a high school and dormitories south of Kyiv rose to nine, Ukrainian emergency services reported.Russia on Wednesday also struck a nine-story apartment building in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia where at least one person was killed.In other developments:— European Union leaders endorsed a plan to send Ukraine 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition within the next 12 months. The EU said at a summit Thursday they would also deliver missiles if Kyiv requests them.— Ukraine's General Staff retracted a claim that units of the Russian army had left Nova Kakhovka, a strategically important city in the occupied part of the Kherson region on the eastern side of the Dnieper. It said the claim was made erroneously “as a result of incorrect use of available data.” The city, which had a prewar population of around 45,000 people, possesses strategic value: A dam there is one of only two road crossings of the lower stretches of the Dnieper— The first four of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets that Slovakia decided to give Ukraine have been handed over to the Ukrainian air force. The Slovak Defense Ministry said Thursday that the remaining MiG-29s will be handed over to the Ukrainian side in the coming weeks. — Finland said Thursday that it would deliver additional defense material, including three Leopard 2 armored mine-clearing vehicles, to Ukraine in a military aid package worth 161 million euros ($175 million). Finland has so far delivered six Leopard vehicles to Ukraine, officials say. The new aid package, the 14th such package from Helsinki so far, also contains heavy weapons and munitions. — Bulgaria’s president said Thursday that despite expanding the national defense industry’s capacity, the Balkan country — a member of NATO and the EU — won't export weapons to Ukraine. Bulgaria has been in the grip of a political crisis and is heading in April toward its fifth general elections in the last two years.___Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844908,Bones kept by former eugenics institute buried in Berlin,"BERLIN (AP) — Thousands of bone fragments, which may include the remains of victims of Nazi crimes, were buried Thursday after they were found on a Berlin university campus where an institute for anthropology and eugenics was once located.Some 16,000 fragments were found on the campus of the Free University in excavations that started in 2015 after human and animal bones were discovered during restoration work. The site was once home to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity and Eugenics, which operated from 1927 until 1945.The university said that the recovered fragments are from “victims of crime contexts"" that could include colonial-era events and Nazi crimes. Researchers determined that the bones belonged to people of all age groups, male and female.But the university said that, following non-invasive examinations of the fragments and historical research. it wasn't possible to identify individual victims or to link the finds to specific colonized regions or to “clear Nazi contexts.”Organizations representing groups that may have been among those the bones belonged to — including Jews, Sinti, Roma and people with physical and mental disabilities killed by the Nazis, as well as the Herero people of Namibia, many of whom were killed in a colonial-era massacre — agreed that further research shouldn't be carried out. They said the bones should be buried “without religious appropriation or eurocentric symbolism,” the university said.The public burial with about 230 guests took place Thursday at the Waldfriedhof cemetery in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, near the site where the remains were found. Five simple caskets were lowered into the ground by pallbearers.“The inhuman practice of research racism foresaw no burial for the remains and threw them in pits,” said Daniel Botmann, a representative of Germany's Central Council of Jews, German news agency dpa reported. “Today we are taking numerous lives whose voices and biographies were extinguished to their last resting place.”The head of the Free University, Günter Ziegler, said that “a specification of the victims by groups would ultimately only reproduce the racist methods and ideologies of the past.”“That also means that we can no longer assign any name or face to the victims,” he added. “But we can remember them.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844909,"Maryland police: Driver veered into a work zone, killing 6","BALTIMORE (AP) — New details are emerging about a midweek crash along the Baltimore beltway that left six construction workers dead after a driver lost control of her car and it careened into a work zone, according to Maryland State Police.Lisa Adrienna Lea, 54, was alone in an Acura sedan driving north on Interstate 695 when she went to change lanes and struck the front passenger side of a Volkswagen early Wednesday afternoon, state police said.The impact caused her to lose control, and her car entered the work zone through an opening in temporary concrete barriers separating the construction area from interstate traffic. The crew was actively working on the highway’s left shoulder.After the crash, Lea was taken to the University of Maryland Medical Center’s Shock Trauma Center for injuries she received. She remained hospitalized Thursday afternoon, police said.The stretch of highway was closed for hours Wednesday in both directions, snarling traffic along the west side of the beltway, which circles Baltimore.Police said the findings of their investigation will be turned over to the Baltimore County State’s Attorney to determine whether anyone will face criminal charges.The driver of the Volkswagen didn’t report any injuries. He stopped his vehicle north of the scene, according to police.Police issued a statement Thursday naming the six workers killed: Rolando Ruiz, 46, of Laurel; Carlos Orlando Villatoro Escobar, 43, of Frederick; Jose Armando Escobar, 52, of Frederick; Mahlon Simmons III, 31, of Union Bridge; Mahlon Simmons II, 52, of Union Bridge; and Sybil Lee Dimaggio, 46, of Glen Burnie.The National Transportation Safety Board, a federal agency that investigates transportation accidents, sent investigators to the scene Thursday. Their investigation will focus on “issues relating to speeding, work zone protection for construction workers, and collision avoidance technology,” an NTSB news release said Thursday afternoon.Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski called the crash horrific.“We offer our sincere condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who have lost their lives in today’s tragic crash,” he wrote in a tweet Wednesday afternoon.Maryland Gov. Wes Moore also tweeted condolences, saying his “heart goes out to the victims and the families affected by the tragic crash on the 695 beltway this afternoon.”",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844921,Solomon Systech Announces 2022 Annual Results,"Maintained a Steady Growth Momentum with Revenue Up 13.5% Mobile Display and Mobile Touch ICs Delivered Outstanding Performance
Financial Highlights:        Sales revenue increased by 13.5% to US$ 190.8 million         Gross profit was US$ 65.5 million with a 34.3% gross margin         Profit attributable to owners of the parent increased by 16.8% to US$ 27.8 million         Shipment volume reached 312.9 million units in 2022         Earnings per share increased by 10% to 1.1 US cents (Equivalent to HK 8.6 cents)     HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 23 March 2023 - Solomon Systech (International) Limited (""Solomon Systech"" or the ""Company''; Stock Code: 2878) announced its annual results of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Group"") for the year ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Year"").   In 2022, the recovery of global economic activities was challenging. Suffering from a slowdown in demand for consumer electronics in the second half of the Year, the semiconductor industry entered a destocking phase. The Group maintained a steady growth momentum by leveraging its pioneering technologies and timely adjusting operating strategies. With the outstanding performance of New Display ICs as well as Mobile Display and Mobile Touch ICs, the Group's sales revenue reached US$190.8 million, representing a year-on-year increase of 13.5%. The profit attributable to owners of the parent during the Year increased by 16.8% to US$27.8 million. Benefiting from the stable market demand for the Group's products, the shipment volume for the Year reached 312.9 million units. Earnings per share were 1.1 US cents, representing an increase of 10% over that in 2021. The Board resolved not to declare any final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2022.   The provision for obsolete inventory in 2022 was approximately US$ 12 million, resulting in a decrease of 5.7 percentage points in gross margin to 34.3% for the Year. In response to the change of market environment, the Group adjusted the average selling price of some products in 2022 to maintain its competitiveness. The Group will continue to boost its competitive edges and maintain a reasonable profit by ensuring its stable supply chain, stringent inventory control and product innovation.   Business Review   New Display ICs  During the Year under review, New Display IC products showed a steady growth in both sales revenue and shipment quantity, maintaining the Group's leading position and pioneering technologies in the New Display IC sector. The Group's sales of Electronic Shelf Labels (ESL) in the European and North American markets remained stable as ESL has become more and more prevalent. The Group's customers include many of the world's top-ranked supermarkets. To further tap into the market of e-Signage and e-Reader applications, the Group commenced mass production of the AMEPD driver IC for Advanced Colour e-Paper (ACeP) products in 2022. Moreover, the Group is committed to expanding the application of IC products to other areas, such as translators and large retail signage applications.   OLED Display ICs  The Group is the world's number one PMOLED display driver IC player with a dominant market share in terms of unit of shipment in 2022. Furthermore, the Group's mini-LED DDI solutions for 50-inch to 100-inch indoor signage display have been in mass production since 2018 and are widely used in the curved signage display in the underground and subways in the United Kingdom and the United States. As the global high-end consumer electronics market continues to expand, the orders for mini/micro-LED IC products grew during the Year as compared to that in 2021.   Mobile Display and Mobile Touch ICs  Benefiting from the robust growth in demand for game console controller ICs, the Mobile Display and Mobile Touch ICs products reported a 55.4% increase in sales revenue. During the Year, the Group continued to expand its product portfolio, including In-Cell Touch Display Driver IC, TFT Display Driver IC, STN Display Driver IC, MIPI Bridge IC and Display Controller IC, which widely support industrial and consumer applications spanning smartphones, tablets, wearables, gaming devices and IoT devices.   Large Display ICs  During the Year, the market of large screens was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to sluggish demand. Panel manufacturers suffered losses against the backdrop of high inventory. Thus, the sales performance of the Group's large display IC business segment was not satisfactory. However, the Group was able to launch the successful mass production of driver ICs for the 165Hz high-refresh-rate gaming monitor of 27/23.8 inches and 43-inch smart HDTV with the panel makers and the international brands, satisfying the needs of the high-end entertainment market.   New Technology and Product Highlights  With the increasingly fierce technology competition in the world, it is extremely important to achieve independent innovation and improve R&D capabilities. The Group supported E Ink in developing the Display IC Solutions for Spectra™ 3100, a next-generation specialised platform for ESL and retail signage application, in 2021. This is a significant technological break-through that enables a four colour spectrum display. Spectra™ 3100 is expected to be launched in 2023, enabling a high growth potential for the Group's New Display IC business in the future.   In addition, the Group expects to launch the world's first PM-MicroLED Display Driver SSD2363 in 2023, which can be applied to next-generation high-brightness displays of three inches or less for wearable devices, home appliances and industrial appliances. The Group will further promote this product to first-tier customers to increase possible applications.   Riding on the highly sought after high-end game console controllers by consumers, the Group strives to provide players with a smooth gaming experience through game console controller ICs. Besides, the Group will focus on forward-looking development of AR and VR fields to capture the opportunities of the Metaverse aggressively by leveraging its capabilities in high-speed and high-resolution display IC technology.   Outlook and Strategies  The semiconductor industry is experiencing the rebound effect caused by the overheating of the electronics industry in the past two years, and the slow pace of development is inevitable in the short term. However, there will be more opportunities for cooperation with downstream to develop products in the second half of 2023 as the epidemic winds down in the mainland China. While supply chain problems have been eased with the removal of pandemic travel restrictions, chips are no longer scarce, however, raw material costs remain under rising price pressure.   Looking ahead, Mr. Wang Wah Chi, Raymond, Chief Executive Officer of Solomon Systech said, ""In the second half of 2022, the semiconductor industry entered a destocking phase. It may need to go through a period for a normalised supply-demand balance. The future will be more volatile and uncertain than ever before, yet we believe we are facing opportunities and challenges at the same time, through our deep experience in the industry. The Group will make concerted efforts to strive for excellence, by formulating long term development strategies as well as empowering our R&D capabilities and technical level, aiming to unlock the value and potential of our business. We will strive to control costs, continue to focus on developing technology, improve product portfolio and endeavor to develop high value-added products, resulting in higher effectiveness and resilience of the operation. Looking forward to the gradual recovery of the global economy and the tremendous opportunities brought about by a new era of technology, the Group aims to achieve an ideal and sustainable business growth, creating fruitful returns to our shareholders.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844941,"After derailment, toxic burn, student-athletes seek normalcy","EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — On the surface, everything looks normal.There's the East Palestine High School baseball team learning the finer points of baserunning at one edge of Reid Memorial Stadium. At the other, a handful of sprinters dart through the mild March air, the blue parachutes attached to their waists mushrooming behind them as they pick up speed.Same as it ever was at East Palestine as it transitions from winter to spring sports. Only, not really.A little over a mile east of the small school — student population 285 — tucked near the Pennsylvania state line, cleanup crews are still dealing with the aftermath of the Feb. 3 train derailment. While no one was hurt, concerns over a potential explosion led state and local officials to approve releasing and burning toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars that forced the evacuations of half the village and closed schools for a week.More than a month later, the cleanup is ongoing. The legal wrangling over who to blame just starting.Workers in reflective yellow vests are everywhere you look. There are road closures and a seemingly never-ending series of press conferences and photo ops by state and federal officials, the CEO of rail operator Norfolk Southern, and politicians, including former President Donald Trump. Not to mention all kinds of interlopers — from media to attorneys to environmental activists — who have come to poke and prod a community that wouldn't mind simply getting on with things.“Sometimes it’s like no offense to you guys, but like, when are we going to have our privacy back?” high jumper Mia Lee, who is a senior, told The Associated Press.While the dark noxious plumes from the accident are gone, a sense of uncertainty remains.Residents worried about lingering environmental and health impacts, and symptoms such as headaches and rashes, are being told their air and water are safe. Yet that hasn’t stopped the spread of what East Palestine athletic director Dwayne Pavkovich describes as “fearmongering” that has disrupted the school’s crowded spring sports schedule.Nearly a dozen schools have pulled out of the series of invitational track meets East Palestine hosts. While Pavkovich stressed he’s not criticizing any school that opts not to come, he also pointed out that the school has provided a link to the results of the Environmental Protection Agency's daily air, water and soil tests in an effort to allay health concerns.On Wednesday, the high school hosted a panel of scientific and health experts, and invited all of the local school districts. Pavkovich described it as a “proactive approach” in hopes of enticing more teams to compete.When asked by administrators at other schools what they can do to help, his answer is simple: Come and play us. Give our athletes — particularly seniors who didn’t have a spring sports season as freshmen because of the COVID-19 pandemic — the same opportunities as everyone else.“We want to create as much normalcy as possible,” he said.It’s telling of the importance of athletics to East Palestine’s identity that none of the school’s spring sports lost a single player in the aftermath of the derailment.For Owen Elliott, a golfer during the fall and a center — all 5-foot-10 of him — on the basketball team during the winter, these three months of baseball season represent the end of his competitive athletic career. An apprenticeship to become an electrician awaits the high school senior.While Elliott believes East Palestine might not be the cleanest place in the world at the moment, he also doesn't have much of a choice. He can't tell you how safe it is. He can tell you this is his last chance to stand on a field next to his friends before the next chapter of his life begins.“I want to play as many games as I can,” said Elliott. His final baseball season will begin Monday when East Palestine hosts Wellsville High at a turf field 5 miles (8 kilometers) up the road — and typically upwind — of the cleanup that is still likely months from being completed.It's much the same for Lee, a two-time state qualifier in the high jump who is looking to make it three in her spring season. She's grateful for the opportunity to say goodbye the right way.It’s an opportunity she wasn’t afforded at the end of basketball season when her Senior Night ceremony was wiped out by the school closure after the derailment. She hoped for another chance when the Bulldogs earned the right to host a playoff game, but their opponent opted to forfeit rather than travel to East Palestine.“I understand they were scared,” said Lee, who had her Senior Night ceremony tucked into a boys’ basketball game. “But if we’re able to come to school that entire week and live here and, you know, everyone’s still here, I think they should have been able to come for a couple of hours to play a game.”Her family moved into a house alongside the train tracks four years ago, 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) away from the derailment. She grew so used to the constant rumble of passing trains that she long ago tuned it out.Until Feb. 3 anyway. Now, whenever she hears a big “thud” she reflexively heads to the window to check things out.Being at the track — even if it's bartering with her coach in an attempt to get out of running — allows Lee to turn her focus away from everything else. The familiar rhythms of practice and the laughter of Lee's teammates make it easy to forget — for a couple of hours anyway — about the recently installed air quality monitor attached to a pole just outside the stadium, and the uncertainty of what comes next.“Mentally, I'm fine,” Lee said. “But like if they said my season was cut, that would affect me. But nothing's going on right now. I think I'm OK.""",2023/03/23,,World

He signed a deal until the end of the season.Foster had a loan spell at the Welsh club, which currently plays in the fifth tier of English soccer, in 2005.Wrexham has gained global recognition since being taken over by Reynolds and McElhenney and featuring in a television series that streams worldwide.“It’s changed a lot since I was last here, but it’s nice to be back and it’s nice to be back as a player, too,” Foster said Thursday. “It will be interesting to see how my body feels after training today.“The first time I was here, it was genuinely the springboard to the rest of my career.”Wrexham is aiming for promotion to England's fourth division this season, but will be without keeper Rob Lainton, who faces six weeks out with knee ligament injury.“We’re delighted to welcome Ben to the club,” Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson said. “With Rob Lainton getting injured at the weekend, it was important we had all bases covered going into the last part of the season, which this signing ensures.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844943,Why you should bench credit cards for March Madness bets,"By the end of the 2023 NCAA tournament, an estimated one in four Americans will have wagered $15.5 billion in bets on the various games, according to the American Gaming Association. Last year, Matt Cappelen — a 34-year-old firefighter from Elk Grove Village, Illinois — would have been in the middle of the action. For this year’s dance, though, he’ll be sitting on the sidelines of the betting game.“I’ve always been a die-hard sports fan,” Cappelen said. “Pretty much anything that involves a winner and a loser, I loved.”Since legal online sports betting was first made available in Illinois in 2020, the fun of sports had only gotten that much bigger for Cappelen.“I was able to combine making money, or so I thought, and sports,” he said. “What better way to do that than with gambling?”But in the three years since, Cappelen built up $83,000 in gambling debts on sites like Bovada and FanDuel. Up to 90% of that, he says, was done on credit cards.“You feel like you’re playing with fake money or play money. Monopoly money,” Cappelen said.Each month, he used gambling winnings to make the next minimum payment on his credit cards, never worrying about how he would repay the debt.“I legitimately thought that I was going to start to get on a hot streak and win it all back.”That hot streak never came, though, and the credit card debt piled up. Finally, after a crushing late-night loss on a particularly big bet, Matt confessed it all to his wife. He knew he needed help, and has since joined Gamblers Anonymous and registered for a debt recovery program. But because online sports betting has become so accessible, many more may walk the same road.FEWER REGULATIONS, MORE RISKS?Since the 2018 overturn of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act , which lifted a 26-year federal ban on online sports betting, more than 35 states have legalized the practice in some form . Of those, only a handful specifically prohibit the use of credit cards to fund bets.Of the $15.5 billion total expected wager on this year’s March Madness , it’s unknown what fraction will be placed using credit cards, though betting operators argue that it’s a relatively small percentage.“Using a credit card for gambling is definitely higher risk,” said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling . Yet he stopped short of noting any specific correlation between problem gambling and credit card use, citing a lack of research.Because legal online sports betting in the U.S. is so new, data is scarce on the exact impact of credit card use for American gamblers. But in a 2021 study on general credit card spending, MIT’s Sloan School of Management found that by reducing the pain of payment, “(credit cards) ‘step on the gas’ by driving motivation to spend .”And in Great Britain, where online sports betting has been legalized and widely available for much longer, the use of credit cards was banned in 2020. This ban came after a 2019 study by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission found “22% of online gamblers using credit cards (were) problem gamblers, with even more suffering some form of gambling harm. ”HIDDEN COSTS OF CREDIT CARD GAMBLINGEven if you’re willing to accept the risk of sports betting with your credit card, spiraling spending isn’t the only potential downside. Other forms of gambling harm, Whyte explains, “might just include losing more money than you planned.”When those losses are incurred on a credit card, interest and fees can far surpass the initial bet. And if you’re not careful, late payments or spikes in credit utilization can have a long-lasting negative impact on your credit score.Plus — because gambling policies vary widely by credit card issuer, payment processor, and betting site — fees can be unpredictable and add up quickly. These can include transaction fees, cash advance fees and even foreign transaction fees if the betting site happens to be offshore.Sites like FanDuel do offer tools for gamblers to self-limit deposits, wagers and time spent . But in most cases gamblers have to opt into — not out of — such guardrails, and the options aren’t prominently displayed. Representatives from FanDuel did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.ROUGH ROAD TO VICTORYOnline sports betting is changing quickly, and researchers, payment processors, and state and federal regulators will haggle for years to come over the appropriate credit card guardrails. Instead of chasing bets on this year’s road to the Final Four, Cappelen is beginning the long trudge to recovery. To tackle that $83,000 debt, Cappelen sought help through Take Charge America, a nonprofit organization that works with debt holders to close problematic credit card accounts, negotiate interest rates and consolidate payments.“The plan itself is going to take four years and eight months to pay off,” Cappelen said. “It’s going to be tough, but it’s doable. And at least there’s an end in sight.”If you or anyone you know has a gambling problem, resources are available through the National Council on Problem Gambling.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844944,"Cost of India quitting coal is $900 billion, think tank says","BENGALURU, India (AP) — If India stopped burning coal tomorrow, over five million people would lose their jobs. But for a price tag of around $900 billion over the next 30 years, the country can make sure nobody is left behind in the huge move to clean energy to curb human-caused climate change, according to figures released by New Delhi-based think tank Thursday.The International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST, released two reports detailing how much it will cost for India to move away from coal and other dirty fuels without jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions who still are employed in coal mines and thermal power plants.Ensuring that everyone can come along in the clean energy shift that's needed to stop the worst harms of climate change and guaranteeing new work opportunities for those in fossil fuel industries, known as a just transition, has been a major consideration for climate and energy analysts.“Just transition should be viewed as an opportunity for India to support green growth in the country’s fossil fuel dependent states and districts,” said Chandra Bhushan, the head of iFOREST.To get the $900 billion figure, the group researched four coal districts in India and identified eight different cost factors, like setting up infrastructure and getting workers ready for the transition.The biggest single investment to enable a just transition will be the cost of setting up clean energy infrastructure, which the report estimates could be up to $472 billion by 2050. Providing workers with clean energy jobs will cost less than 10% of the total amount required for a just transition, or about $9 billion.The think tank said $600 billion would come as investments in new industries and infrastructure, with an additional $300 billion as grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities.“The scale of transition is massive. If formal and informal sector workers are included, we are talking about an industry that is the lifeline for 15-20 million people,” said Sandeep Pai, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C. based think tank. “Reports like this are extremely important since the just transition conversation is beginning only now in India ... we need much more of the same.”India is one of the largest emitters of planet-warming gases, behind only China, the U.S. and the EU. The country depends on coal for 75% of its electricity needs and for 55% of its overall energy needs.The country is still a far way off quitting coal. Earlier this month, the Indian government issued emergency orders stipulating that coal plants are run at full capacity through this summer to avoid any power outages. The country’s coal use is expected to peak between 2035 and 2040, according to government figures.Prime minister Narendra Modi announced in 2021 that the country will achieve net zero emissions — where it only puts out greenhouse gases that it can somehow offset — by 2070. On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged nations to speed up their net zero goals, calling for developing countries to set a target of 2050. He was met with a muted response.The reports recommends that the Indian government focuses on retiring old and unprofitable mines and power plants first. Over 200 of India's more than 459 mines can be retired in this way.“The energy transition has to start with coal,"" said Jayant Sinha, who represents the coal-rich Hazaribagh constituency in the central Indian state of Jharkhand, adding that the switch to clean energy needs both funds and institutions to ramp it up. ""Both of this must happen together for a successful transition,” he said.Deals to help the coal-reliant nations of South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam make a just energy transition have been made in recent years. Energy experts say while these deals are moving in the right direction the scale of them are far short of what's needed to make a real impact.It's still not clear if India will be open to a similar just energy transition deal.Indian leaders have expressed skepticism over climate funds promised by developed nations, pointing to a promise to give low-income and developing countries $100 billion every year to help with climate challenges back in 2009 that is still yet to be met.___Follow Sibi Arasu on Twitter at @sibi123___Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

It said it will not provide any additional details until they’re safely in Ukraine.On Friday, the Slovak government approved a plan to give Ukraine its fleet of 13 Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets, becoming the second NATO member to heed the Ukrainian government’s pleas for warplanes to help defend against Russia’s invasion.Slovakia grounded its MiGs in the summer due to a lack of spare parts and expertise to help maintain them. Fellow NATO members Poland and the Czech Republic stepped in to monitor Slovak air space.Slovakia previously signed a deal to buy 14 U.S. F-16 Block 70/72 fighter jets, but delivery was pushed back two years with the first aircraft to arrive in early 2024.The Slovak Defense Ministry said Wednesday the United States has offered Slovakia 12 new military helicopters as compensation for the fighter jets the European country is giving to Ukraine.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844946,"Nebraska trans health bill advances, despite filibuster vow","LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — The Nebraska Legislature voted Thursday to advance a contentious bill that would ban gender-affirming care for minors, despite threats from some lawmakers that they would filibuster the rest of the session.The vote came on the third day of debate, in which lawmakers angrily accused one another of hypocrisy and a lack of collegiality early on. By Thursday, the chamber had turned somber as some lawmakers opposed to the bill broke down in tears and pleaded with their Republican colleagues to reconsider their support for the bill.“I can't stop thinking about the parents,” Sen. John Fredrickson said through sobs before reading a letter from a constituent who said her son would have likely taken his own life if he had not been able to get gender-affirming care as a teen.Fredrickson, the first openly gay man elected to the Nebraska Legislature, expressed his heartbreak at not being able to change the outcome of the vote.“To my LGBTQ family ... regardless of what happens today, heads up. Chins up. We're survivors,” he said.Members of the LGBTQ community who had gathered in the Capitol to protest the bill showed their displeasure with the outcome, booing and cursing lawmakers who voted to advance it as they left the legislative floor.“I am a ball of rage,” said Wrenn Jacobson, 29, of Lincoln, after the vote. “I've had to go back to therapy when this bill was introduced. I know so many people — so many kids — who will be hurt by this.”“They come for the kids first,” Jacobson said. “Then they'll come for the adults.”With the bill’s advancement, Omaha Sens. Megan Hunt and Machaela Cavanaugh promised to filibuster every bill that comes before lawmakers for the rest of the 90-day session. By the end of Thursday's debate, other lawmakers had vowed to join that effort, including Omaha Sen. Jen Day and Lincoln Sen. Danielle Conrad.Hunt took to the floor of the Legislature on Wednesday to confess that the debate is deeply personal for her, because her teenage son is transgender. She called the bill an affront to her as a parent and called out by name lawmakers she would hold accountable if they vote to advance it.“If this bill passes, all your bills are on the chopping block, and the bridge is burned,"" she said. “I'm not doing anything for you. Because this is fake. This has nothing to do with real life. This is all of you playing government.”The proposal had caused tumult in the legislative session long before debate began on it earlier this week. It was cited as the genesis of a nearly three-week, uninterrupted filibuster carried by Cavanaugh, who followed through on her vow in late February to filibuster every bill before the Legislature — even those she supported — declaring she would “burn the session to the ground over this bill.”She stuck with it until an agreement was reached late last week to push the bill to the front of the debate queue. Instead of trying to eat time to keep the bill from getting to the floor, Cavanaugh decided she wanted a vote to put on the record which lawmakers would “legislate hate against children.”The Nebraska bill, along with another that would ban trans people from using bathrooms and locker rooms or playing on sports teams that don’t align with the sex listed on their birth certificates, are among roughly 150 bills targeting transgender people that have been introduced in state legislatures this year.Bans on gender-affirming care for minors have already been enacted several other Republican-led states, including Arizona, South Dakota, Utah and Mississippi. Arkansas and Alabama have bans that were temporarily blocked by federal judges.Other states legislatures have given final approval to measures similar to the Nebraska bill, with Georgia sending a bill that would ban most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors to the governor Tuesday. In Kansas, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly last week vetoed a similar bill. The attorney general in Missouri issued an order earlier this week to limit access to gender-affirming care for minors.The Nebraska bill, introduced by freshman Republican Sen. Kathleen Kauth, would outlaw gender-affirming therapies such as hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgery for those 18 and younger. The purpose of the bill, she has said, is to protect youth from undertaking gender-affirming treatments they might later regret as adults, citing research that says adolescents’ brains aren’t fully developed.That position overlooks the damage taking away the option of treatments will have on teens, said 17-year-old Elliott Braatz, of Lincoln. Braatz, a transgender boy, took a day off from school to hold signs protesting the bill. He said lawmakers supporting the bill aren't taking into account that “the trans suicide rate is horrifying.”“I'm very scared,” he said. “This bill says to people like me: 'You're trans, and that's not OK.'”That fear was echoed by several lawmakers, including Day, who wept as she read from an email sent Wednesday to all lawmakers by a clinical psychologist in Lincoln who said calls to the clinic from trans teens reporting feeling suicidal have jumped significantly in the past week. The psychologist warned that voting to advance the bill “will result in the deaths of transgender and gender diverse adolescents, likely before the end of the school year.”“I want all of you to go into the rotunda and look into the eyes of those parents and tell them that you're voting for this bill knowing that it could potentially kill their child,” Day said through sobs.The bill advanced on a 30-17 vote, with two lawmakers not voting. Although bills can advance with a simple majority, it takes 33 votes to end debate to overcome a filibuster. The Nebraska Legislature is currently made up of 32 registered Republicans and 17 registered Democrats — just enough for the minority to block bills they don’t like if they stick together.In this case, Democratic Sen. Mike McDonnell voted with Republicans to end debate and later voted to advance the bill.“There’s a world of difference between 9 and 19,"" he said. “I think adult decisions should be made by adults.”The bill will have to survive two more rounds of debate to pass in the unique one-house, officially nonpartisan Legislature. Republican Gov. Jim Pillen has said he will sign the bill into law if it reaches his desk.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844947,"NC approves Medicaid expansion, reversing long opposition","RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A Medicaid expansion deal in North Carolina received final legislative approval on Thursday, capping a decade of debate over whether the closely politically divided state should accept the federal government's coverage for hundreds of thousands of low-income adults.North Carolina is among states with Republican leaders that are considering expanding Medicaid after years of steadfast opposition. Voters in South Dakota approved expansion in a referendum in November. And in Alabama, advocates are urging lawmakers to take advantage of federal incentives to expand Medicaid in order to provide health insurance to more working people.When Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a longtime expansion advocate, signs the bill, it should leave 10 states in the U.S. that haven't adopted expansion. North Carolina has 2.9 million enrollees in traditional Medicaid coverage. Advocates have estimated that expansion could help 600,000 adults.“Medicaid Expansion is a once in a generation investment that will make all North Carolina families healthier while strengthening our economy, and I look forward to signing this legislation soon,” Cooper tweeted.There’s no set start date in the final bill for expansion under the legislation, but it still comes with one caveat: It can’t happen until after a state budget is approved. This usually happens in the early summer. Cooper panned that provision, which could give GOP leaders leverage to include unrelated items he may strongly oppose.The House voted 87-24 in favor of the deal, after little debate and a preliminary vote on Wednesday. Many Democratic members on the floor stood and clapped after it passed, which is usually not permitted under chamber rules. Almost two-thirds of the House Republicans also voted yes. The Senate already approved the legislation last week in near-unanimous votes.The final agreement also included provisions scaling back or eliminating regulations that require state health officials to sign off before medical providers open certain new beds or use equipment. Senate Republicans demanded the “certificate of need” changes in any deal.Republicans in charge of the General Assembly for years had been skeptical about expansion, which originated from the federal Affordable Care Act signed into law by President Barack Obama 13 years ago Thursday.GOP legislators passed a law in 2013 specifically preventing a governor's administration from seeking expansion without express approval by the General Assembly. But interest in expansion grew over the past year as lawmakers concluded that Congress was neither likely to repeal the law nor raise the low state match that coverage requires.A financial sweetener contained in a COVID-19 recovery law means North Carolina also would get an estimated extra $1.75 billion in cash over two years if it expands Medicaid. Legislators hope to use much of that money on mental health services.A turning point came last May when Senate leader Phil Berger, a longtime expansion opponent, publicly explained his reversal, which was based largely on fiscal terms.In a news conference, Berger also described the situation faced by a single mother who didn't make enough money to cover insurance for both her and her children, which he said meant that she would either end up in the emergency room or not get care. Expansion covers people who make too much money for conventional Medicaid but not enough to benefit from heavily subsidized private insurance.“We need coverage in North Carolina for the working poor,” Berger said at the time.The Senate and House approved competing measures in 2022 but negotiations stalled over certificate of need changes. Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore announced an agreement three weeks ago.In 2019, Cooper’s insistence on advancing expansion contributed to a state budget impasse with GOP legislators that never got fully resolved.House Minority Leader Robert Reives of Chatham County wished the budget passage requirement was left out of the expansion measure but remained celebratory.“I’m just really happy because health care means everything,” Reives said. “Now the onus is on all of us to put together a budgetary document that everybody can live with.”The state’s 10% share of expenses for Medicaid expansion recipients would be paid through hospital assessments. Hospitals also are expected to receive larger reimbursements for treating Medicaid patients through a federal program that the legislation tells the state to participate in.The program's proceeds should help shore up rural hospitals in a state where several have closed.“This landmark legislation will have lasting benefits for our state by helping hardworking North Carolina families, stabilizing rural health providers and improving the overall health of our communities,” said Steve Lawler with the North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals and hospital systems.In a news release, Moore called Thursday’s passage a “historic step forward to increase access to healthcare for our rural communities” and he said he looked forward to passing ""a strong conservative budget” so expansion can begin.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844948,"IMF warns without reforms, Lebanon could see hyperinflation","BEIRUT (AP) — The International Monetary Fund gave a grim assessment Thursday of Lebanon’s prospects for getting out of its deepening financial crisis, saying that without reforms, the country is headed for hyperinflation.Since late 2019, tiny Lebanon has fallen into the worst economic crisis in its modern history, rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement by a political class that has ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. Three-quarters of Lebanon’s population of over 6 million, including a million Syrian refugees, now lives in poverty and inflation is soaring.Ernesto Ramirez Rigo, the head of the IMF mission visiting Lebanon, said at a news conference Thursday at the end of their nine-day visit that continued inaction by Lebanese leaders would leave the nation in a “never-ending crisis” in which it could spiral into hyperinflation, “affecting the quality of life of many Lebanese for years to come.”The IMF visit came as progress towards finalizing a sorely needed IMF bailout package for the struggling country has largely stalled.Since reaching a preliminary agreement with the IMF nearly a year ago, Lebanese officials have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal, which include restructuring the country’s debts and its ailing banking system, reforming its barely functioning public electricity system and making governance reforms.The visit was part of the regular assessments the IMF conducts of all member countries and was not directly related to the negotiations for a bail-out. However, Rigo expressed frustration at the slow rate of progress on the reforms required to reach a deal.He denied that the IMF is thinking of walking away from the deal altogether.“There is no deadline, we never walk away from our country members,” Rigo said. However, he said, “One would have expected a lot more in terms of implementation.""Rigo noted that even the legislation that has been passed to enact reforms has in some cases fallen short. Amendments to the country’s banking secrecy law approved in October, intended to facilitate accountability in the financial sector, and a draft capital controls law do not meet the IMF’s requirements, Rigo said.The preliminary deal reached last year would have provided a bailout of about $3 billion, but Rigo said that figure would have to be revisited as the country's economic situation has changed.Lebanon's currency, officially valued at 15,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, is trading at more than 100,000 for $1 on the black market, which is used for nearly all transactions.The pound hit a new low on Tuesday, hitting 140,000 pounds to the dollar, before rebounding slightly. On Wednesday, hundreds of protesters, mainly retired soldiers, tried to break through a fence leading to the government headquarters and parliament building in downtown Beirut before security forces drove them back by firing teargas.The IMF released a statement at the end of the visit, saying that economic activity had stabilized slightly in 2022, compared to the first two years of the crisis, in part due to some recovery in tourism and large volumes of remittances sent from abroad.But it noted that inflation remains in the triple digits and said the collapse of public revenues has led to “drastic and disorderly cuts” to public spending and services. Lebanon’s foreign reserves declined from $36 billion before the crisis to $10 billion in December, it added.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844949,Nigerian politician found guilty in UK organ harvesting plot,"LONDON (AP) — A senior Nigerian politician and his wife were found guilty Thursday of conspiring to transport a street trader to the U.K. as part of an organ-harvesting plot.Ike Ekweremadu, who was deputy president of the Nigerian Senate and a lawyer, and his wife, Beatrice, were accused of arranging the travel of a 21-year-old man to the U.K. with a view to exploiting him for a kidney donation.Prosecutors said the politician and his wife were behind the recruitment of the man at a Lagos street market, and that they arranged for the victim to provide a kidney to their 25-year-old daughter, Sonia, in an 80,000-pound (nearly $100,000) transplant operation at a London hospital.The victim, who was transported to London in February 2022, believed he was being taken to the capital for work, and that under the agreement he would be paid thousands of pounds, prosecutors said.Kidney donations are lawful in the U.K., but it's a criminal offense to reward someone with money or other material advantage for doing so.The verdict is the first to convict suspects of an organ-harvesting conspiracy under the U.K.’s modern slavery laws.As part of the ruse, the victim was described as Sonia's cousin in his U.K. visa application, and the Ekweremadus pretended to doctors that the young man was related to Sonia.But a doctor at the Royal Free Hospital became suspicious about the circumstances surrounding the proposed operation, and decided it couldn't go ahead. The Ekweremadus then tried to find more potential donors in Turkey, prosecutors said.The case came to light when the victim reported to British police that he had been trafficked from Nigeria and that someone was trying to transplant his kidney.Chief Crown Prosecutor Joanne Jakymec described the case as “horrific.”“The convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim’s welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here,"" she said in a statement.Dr. Obinna Obeta, described by prosecutors as a medical “middleman” in the plot, was also found guilty Thursday at London's Central Criminal Court. Sonia Ekweremadu, who has a serious kidney condition, was cleared by the jury.The defendants were ordered to remain in custody, and their sentencing was scheduled for May 5.",2023/03/23,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844950,Oxford school shooter's parents can face manslaughter trial,"DETROIT (AP) — The parents of a teenager who killed four students at a Michigan high school can face trial for involuntary manslaughter, the state appeals court said Thursday in a groundbreaking case of criminal responsibility for the acts of a child.The murders would not have happened if the parents hadn't purchased a gun for Ethan Crumbley or if they had taken him home from Oxford High School on the day of the shooting, when staff became alarmed about his extreme drawings, the appeals court said.The court noted that the legal threshold at this stage of the case is fairly low under Michigan law.""Whether a jury actually finds that causation has been proven after a full trial, where the record will almost surely be more expansive — including evidence produced by defendants — is an issue separate from what we decide today,"" the court said in a 3-0 opinion.James and Jennifer Crumbley are accused of failing to secure a gun and ignoring the mental health needs of their son before the shootings. Besides the deaths of four students, seven people were wounded.Crumbley, 16, has pleaded guilty to terrorism and murder and could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. He was 15 at the time of the November 2021 shooting.Attorneys for the parents insist that what would happen that day was not foreseeable. They acknowledge that bad decisions were made but not ones that should rise to involuntary manslaughter charges.Judge Michael Riordan said parents shouldn't be hauled to court for ""subpar, odd or eccentric"" care of their kids. But the evidence against the Crumbleys, he added, is much more serious.“The morning of the shooting, EC drew a picture of a body that appeared to have two bullet holes in the torso, apparently with blood streaming out of them, which was near another drawing of a handgun that resembled the gun his parents ... had very recently gifted to him,” Riordan said.It was “visual evidence” that Ethan was contemplating gunshot wounds on someone, the judge said.The Crumbleys were summoned to school for a meeting about the drawing but didn't take Ethan home.The parents' lawyers declined to comment Thursday, citing a gag order. They'll likely ask the Michigan Supreme Court to review the case, particularly because that court had ordered the appeals court to hear arguments.Meanwhile, state lawmakers gave final approval to legislation that was partly influenced by the Oxford shooting. It would require gun owners to keep weapons locked around children. A violation would be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on what a child does with the accessible gun.When he pleaded guilty, Ethan Crumbley said the gun he used was not locked in a box at home.__Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwritez",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4844951,South Carolina's top accountant to resign after $3.5B error,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's embattled top accountant will step down next month after a $3.5 billion error in the year-end financial report he oversaw, according to a resignation letter written Thursday that was obtained by The Associated Press.Republican Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom's decision to leave the post he has held for 20 years came after intense scrutiny of his performance following the blunder and amid rising calls for him to either quit or be removed.The Senate panel investigating the financial misstatement issued a damning report last week accusing Eckstrom of ""willful neglect of duty.” As recently as last week, however, Eckstrom had said he would not resign.“I have never taken service to the state I love or the jobs to which I have been elected lightly, endeavoring to work with my colleagues ... to be a strong defender of the taxpayer and a good steward of their hard-earned tax dollars,” Eckstrom wrote in the letter to South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. “They deserve nothing less.”The governor accepted the resignation, effective April 30.The Senate report concluded that Eckstrom was solely responsibile for the mapping error, which happened during the state's transition to a new internal information system from 2011 to 2017. State officials testified that Eckstrom ignored auditors' yearslong warnings of a “material weakness” in his office and flawed cash reporting.Eckstrom has said the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report exaggerated the state's cash balances for a decade by double counting the money sent to colleges and universities. The mistake went unsolved until a junior staffer fixed the error this fall.Officials have said the overstatement did not affect the state budget. But lawmakers alarmed by Eckstrom's inconsistent testimony slammed his failure to fulfill one of his primary constitutional duties: to publish an accurate account of state finances.The fallout for the state agency that typically flies under the radar is expected to continue. A Senate subcommittee recently approved a joint resolution that would let voters decide whether the comptroller general should continue as an elected position or be appointed by the governor. Eckstrom reiterated his support for that change Thursday in his resignation letter.The next comptroller general may also lead a much weaker office. The investigating panel suggested its responsibilities be transferred to one or more agencies. State Treasurer Curtis Loftis, an elected Republican, has testified that his office could absorb the main tasks.Republican Sen. Larry Grooms, who led the investigation, said the comptroller general’s office could also be “done away with altogether.”Grooms thanked Eckstrom for doing the “honorable thing” and sparing the General Assembly from using an obscure state constitutional provision to remove him from office.Between a 104-7 House vote to cut the comptroller general’s annual salary to $1 and the Senate’s scheduled April 11 vote to oust Eckstrom, Grooms suggested the rising heat had grown too intense for him to remain on the job.The Senate must now select a replacement to serve out the rest of Eckstrom’s term, which ends in 2027. Grooms said the next comptroller general should be someone who recognizes that their job is to spend the next three years overseeing the office’s incorporation into other state agencies. He does not anticipate any other heads will roll.“The buck stopped with him,” Grooms said. “The accountability was with him.”A certified public accountant, Eckstrom, 74, spent four years as state treasurer before assuming his current office. He has run unopposed in the past two elections and last faced a Republican primary challenger in 2010.McMaster — who had resisted calls for impeachment and endorsed elections as the proper vehicle for accountability — thanked Eckstrom for his 24 years of “dedicated service.” The governor previously served as the state's attorney general alongside Eckstrom early in the comptroller general's tenure.“The Eckstrom and McMaster families have been dear friends for decades,” McMaster said Thursday in a letter accepting the resignation. “I know that your every wish has been, and always will be, prosperity and happiness for the people of South Carolina.”—-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, “are moving it down the path toward confrontation and potential conflict with its neighbors and possibly the United States.” He said deterring and preparing for war ""is extraordinarily expensive, but it’s not as expensive as fighting a war.

Hal Rogers, R-Ky., pressed the defense leaders on Xi's meeting with Putin and its impact on U.S. competition with China, which he called “the elephant in the room.” The U.S., he said, is “at a crucial moment here.""The growing alliance between China and Russia, two nuclear powers, and Xi's overtures to Putin during the Ukraine war are “troubling,” Austin said.He added that the U.S. had not yet seen China provide arms to Russia, but if it does, “it would prolong the conflict and certainly broaden the conflict potentially not only in the region but globally.”Milley, who will retire later this year, said the Defense Department must continue to modernize its forces to ensure they will be ready to fight if needed. “It is incumbent upon us to make sure we remain No. 1 at all times” to be able to deter China, he said.Two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan eroded the military’s equipment and troop readiness, so the U.S. has been working to replace weapons systems and give troops time to reset. It's paid off, Milley told Congress.“Our operational readiness rates are higher now than they have been in many, many years,” Milley said. More than 60% of the active force is at the highest states of readiness right now and could deploy to combat in less than 30 days, while 10% could deploy within 96 hours, he said.Milley cautioned that those gains would be lost if Congress can't pass a budget on time, because it will immediately affect training.Members of the panel, including Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., also made it clear that while they support the ongoing U.S. assistance to Ukraine, “the days of blank checks are over.” And they questioned the administration’s ultimate goal there.Milley said the intent is to make sure that Ukraine remains a free and independent country with its territory intact, maintaining global security and the world order that has existing since World War II.“If that goes out the window,” he said, “we’ll be doubling our defense budgets at that point, because that will introduce not an era of great power competition, that will begin an era of great power conflict. And that will be extraordinarily dangerous for the whole world.”The hearing was likely one of Milley's last in front of Congress. His four-year term as chairman — capping a 43-year military career — ends in October. While many members took the opportunity to thank him for those years of service, it was also an opportunity to press him on one of the darkest moments of his chairmanship — the loss of 13 service members to a suicide bomber at Abbey Gate during the chaotic American evacuation from Afghanistan.Questions remain about the bombing, and Republicans have criticized President Joe Biden's decision to completely withdraw from Afghanistan in August 2021. During an intense two-week evacuation, which took place as Kabul fell to the Taliban, U.S. forces got more than 120,000 personnel out of the country, but paid a large price in the lives of U.S. service members and Afghans. The withdrawal also left behind many Afghans who worked with and supported U.S. troops during the war, and efforts to get them out continue.“I can think of no greater tragedy than what happened at Abbey Gate. And I have yet to fully reconcile myself to that entire affair,” Milley told the panel members. He called the end state, which left the Taliban in control of the country, a strategic failure.But that “did not happen in the last 19 days or even the last 19 months. That was a 20-year war,” Milley said. “There were decisions made all along the way which culminated in what the outcome was. And there’s many many lessons to be learned.”",2023/03/24,249,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845011,Nigerian politician found guilty in organ harvesting plot,"A jury in London on Thursday delivered guilty verdicts against Nigerian senator Ike Ekweremadu, his wife, and a doctor for conspiring to exploit a young man from Lagos for his kidney.The verdict is the first under the UK's modern slavery laws to convict suspects of an organ-harvesting plot.London's Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, heard that Ekweremadu, 60, and his wife Beatrice, 56, had brought the man to London in February last year with the promise of work in Britain.They were said to have offered up to 3.5 million Nigerian naira (€6,900, or $7,600) to obtain the body part for their sick daughter.The 25-year-old intended recipient of the organ, who has a serious and deteriorating renal condition and needs dialysis, was found not guilty of playing a role in the conspiracy.Prosecutors told jurors that Ekweremadu, a former deputy senate president, and his wife came up with the plan to arrange a transplant for their daughter. They found the proposed donor in Lagos, where he worked as a market trader selling telephone parts.The victim was described as Sonia's cousin in his UK visa application as part of the plot. The Ekweremadus also told doctors that he was a relative.The proposed operation last May never went ahead after a doctor at the became suspicious about the circumstances.The man said he thought he had been going to the UK for work and had been recruited by a doctor working for the politician. He testified that the Ekweremadus flew him to Britain to harvest his kidney, but that he only realized this when he was taken to a London hospital.The court heard that he fled and, after three days on the street, walked into a police station and said someone was trying to take one of his organs.""The convicted defendants showed utter disregard for the victim's welfare, health and well-being and used their considerable influence to a high degree of control throughout, with the victim having limited understanding of what was really going on here,"" said Chief Crown Prosecutor Joanne Jakymec.Ekweremadu, from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, has represented the Enugu West constituency in southeast Nigeria since 2003.However, he did not contest recent National Assembly elections because he was in custody.rc/nm (Reuters, AFP, AP)",2023/03/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845013,European beer giant Heineken fights Vietnam's alcohol tax,"Since 2022, Vietnam's government has debated whether to increase the special consumption tax that applies to harmful products such as alcohol, cigarettes and soft drinks.Doing so, some think, would hit two birds with one stone: increase state revenue and make alcoholic products more expensive, thereby discouraging consumption by people with drinking problems.Vietnam's public debt is falling — down to around 44% of GDP last year, according to official records — but the government needs to recalibrate its revenue collection practices.Free-trade deals have cut tariffs, and the government is under more pressure to invest domestically. As a result, Hanoi knows it needs to rely, more than ever, on domestic sources of revenue. State takings from export-import activities were down 19.4% in the first two months of this year, compared to the same period in 2022, the General Department of Vietnam Customs reports.Tax receipts overall were up 16.7%, and domestic taxation accounted for 96% of the total revenues, according to media reports that cited the General Department of Taxation.In 2019, the average beer consumption per person in Vietnam was 47.6 liters (12.4 gallons), the third-highest in Asia after China and Japan. A study published in 2019 in the Lancet medical journal reckoned the per capita liquor consumption in Vietnam increased 90% between 2010 and 2017, the fifth highest in the world. It's expected to continue growing this decade.That's good news for business. The beer sector in Vietnam was estimated to be worth $26 billion in 2021, the highest in Southeast Asia, according to a recent report by Nikkei Asia. However, a study in 2016 estimated that 12% of all deaths in Vietnam are associated with alcohol use, while a fifth of deaths due to road crashes were caused by alcohol use.A new alcohol-control law came into effect in 2020, which included new restrictions on advertising and on the sale of alcoholic substances to minors, as well banning driving with any concentration of alcohol in the blood.According to the World Health Organization, during debates about the law ""the alcohol industry ... was lobbying hard to nullify or weaken it.""In February, Vietnam's Finance Ministry said it was listening to all opinions about revisions to the Law on Special Consumption Tax. Again, the alcohol industry reckoned higher taxation wasn't the way forward.Since 2003, the Law on Special Consumption Tax has been amended five times and each change has ""destabilized"" the legal, institutional and business environment, said Chu Thi Van Anh, general secretary of the Vietnam Beverage Association, an industry group.Additionally, she said, increasing such taxes so far has yet to achieve the goal of reducing consumption and protecting health, a claim that official data appear to support.One main problem is that a special consumption tax has no impact on illegal alcohol production, which accounts for between 60% and 70% of the market, Van Anh reckons.She estimates that this illegal sector costs legitimate businesses around $750 million (€690 million) each year, hurting not just their own profits but also the government's coffers.Dutch-based Heineken is one of the largest players in Vietnam's market, which is otherwise dominated by Thai and Japanese brands, as well as Vietnam's own brews.Heineken Vietnam's head of communications declined to comment because, the company said, the Vietnam Beverage Association is leading the discussion and media engagement on behalf of all businesses in the alcohol industry.But Heineken has also been doing its own senior-level lobbying. During Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's official visit to the Netherlands last December, he met with the CEO of Heineken, Dolf van den Brink, at the firm's global headquarters in Amsterdam.Around this time, the brewer announced plans to invest an additional $500 million in Vietnam, on top of the around $1 billion in Vietnam it has invested to date.After meeting the company's CEO, Chinh said Hanoi aimed to improve its tax policy in the spirit of ""harmonious benefits, shared risks,"" according to a government statement.Last September, Heineken Vietnam unveiled its largest brewery in Vietnam, an event attended by then Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam. However, it was ordered to pay $39.7 million in back taxes and fines in 2020.The Netherlands is now the largest EU investor in Vietnam, with registered capital of about $13.7 billion, according to government data. Gabor Fluit, director of De Heus Asia, part of a Dutch animal feed conglomerate, was elected chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam this month.The alcohol lobby argues that any increase in a special tax will negatively affect the market, especially during its recovery efforts from the pandemic. If alcohol firms put the extra cost onto consumers, that would also impact the hospitality and tourism sectors, which were decimated by the pandemic and are only now showing signs of recovery.The Vietnam Beverage Association wants the government to delay any increase in the special consumption tax until at least 2024, and even then it will lobby for only a slight uptick in rates.Van Anh, the industry body's general secretary, points out that production costs have climbed massively because of the war in Ukraine, as Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's largest exporters of grain. Global inflation is also harming the industry.Much depends on by how much the tax rate would be hiked. The special consumption tax on alcohol was last increased in 2018, when it rose from 50% to 65%, yet that doesn't appear to have had too much of an impact, said Pritesh Samuel and Thang Vu of consultancy firm Dezan Shira & Associates.""While the 2018 tax increase may have resulted in short term disruption, Vietnam's alcohol industry remains vibrant,"" the firm noted. ""Tobacco and alcohol prices in Vietnam remain among the lowest globally. Therefore we will have to wait and watch and see how much of an increase the government plans to implement.""Some health experts say only a major increase in the special tax would impact the worst of the health costs associated with drinking.The World Health Organization estimates that a special tax only accounts for about one-third of the retail price of alcoholic products in Vietnam, whereas it's usually in excess of half, if not as high as 85%, in many other countries.All this is a headache for a government that reckons that progress and social justice should not be sacrificed for ""simple economic growth,"" as Prime Minister Chinh said this week while welcoming the largest-ever American business delegation to Hanoi.Edited by: John Silk",2023/03/23,,

He said he was prepared to accept unpopularity because the changes were ""necessary"" and ""in the general interest of the country.""Macron has come under heavy criticism for refusing to entertain tax increases on the wealthy as an alternative means of maintaining state revenue.

Belgium is an important donor to the vaccine alliance GAVI, for the operation of COVAX, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative,” said Ramaphosa at a press briefing with the Belgian king on Thursday.He added that Belgium had donated about 10 million doses of vaccines during the pandemic, with a significant proportion going to African countries in need of vaccines.Ramaphosa praised the collaboration between South Africa's Afrigen Biologics firm and Belgium's Univercells Group to develop a novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and to improve preparedness for future health emergencies.The effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine were also to be discussed between the two leaders, with Ramaphosa emphasizing that South Africa supports a peaceful solution to the war. South Africa has not publicly criticized Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.“We look forward to sharing our perspectives on the conflict during our meeting, and to learn more about Belgium’s stance. It is also important to consider the impact of the conflict on the international economy, especially with regards to global food and energy security,” Ramaphosa said ahead of meeting privately with the king.Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said Belgium understands South Africa’s stance on the war in Ukraine and urged South Africa to use its “channels of communications to advance on a path toward peace.”“I think this is the major foreign policy issue for Europe and it will likely remain so, I’m afraid, for the next months. We are fully committed to help Ukraine defend itself. We see this as essential to defend European security but also the U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845016,"Scotland's Sturgeon exits with pride, brickbats from critics","LONDON (AP) — Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon addressed lawmakers for the last time as Scottish leader on Thursday, expressing pride in her government’s achievements to lessen poverty and inequality – but frustrated in her quest to make Scotland an independent country.Sturgeon faced strong criticism from opponents in her 286th and final First Minister’s Questions session in the Scottish parliament. In scrappy exchanges, opposition leaders slammed her for Scotland’s long health care waiting times, homelessness problem and high drug death toll.Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross alleged that, obsessed with independence, “she divided our country and failed in every mission she set herself.”Sturgeon told Edinburgh lawmakers that she had “made my fair share of mistakes in the last eight years. And, of course, there are things I wish I had done better or differently.”“But overall and overwhelmingly, I am proud of what has been achieved,” she said, highlighting work to lift children out of poverty.Sturgeon, 52, announced her resignation last month after more than eight years as first minister in Scotland’s semi-autonomous government and leader of the governing Scottish National Party. The winner of a party contest to replace her will be announced on Monday.She leaves with her main goal, independence from the U.K. for the nation of 5.5 million people, unmet.Scottish voters backed remaining in the U.K. in a 2014 referendum that was billed as a once-in-a-generation decision. The SNP wants a new vote, but the central government has refused to authorize one, and the U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that Scotland can’t hold one without London’s consent.The party is divided on its next steps, but Sturgeon said she was confident her successor “will lead this country to becoming an independent nation.”She said her decision to quit was a personal one and it was “time for Nicola Sturgeon the politician to make a bit of space for Nicola Sturgeon the person.”Sturgeon’s resignation has unleashed a battle for the direction of the SNP, which currently holds 64 of the 129 seats in the Scottish parliament and governs in coalition with the much smaller Greens.Her husband, Peter Murrell, stepped down as party chief executive last week over a kerfuffle about the party’s declining membership and amid claims by some that a clique around Sturgeon wields too much power in the SNP.Some in the party think that the SNP under Sturgeon spent too much time focusing on divisive social issues rather that the economy and independence. Sturgeon’s departure was hastened by a backlash over legislation she championed to make it easier for people in Scotland to legally change their gender.In a farewell statement, Sturgeon said it had been an “utter privilege” to lead her country.Three lawmakers are running to replace Sturgeon: Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes, 32; Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, 37; and 49-year-old lawmaker Ash Regan. Sturgeon said that means Scotland will soon get its second female first minister or its first leader of color.“Either way, that will send the very powerful message that this, the highest office in the land, is one that any young person in Scotland can aspire to,” she said.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845017,'Appalling': Southern Africa counts toll of Cyclone Freddy,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — The death toll from Tropical Cyclone Freddy, which ravaged Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique over the past two months, now stands at more than 600 people, the World Health Organization said Thursday.Aid agencies are scrambling to meet the soaring humanitarian needs amid fears of rising cholera cases, malnutrition and large numbers of displaced families.“The cyclone has left an appalling humanitarian situation in its wake … increased and concerted humanitarian assistance is needed” to support affected people recover and cope with the disaster, WHO regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti said in an online briefing.The long-lasting, brutal cyclone destroyed houses, roads, farmland and hospitals and has “stretched the capacity of health facilities,” claiming 605 lives among the more than 1.4 million affected people as of Mar. 20 in the three countries, she said.Cyclone Freddy first hit Madagascar and Mozambique in February. The storm went back out to the Indian Ocean and then made a second landfall in March that was far more devastating in Malawi where it has killed about 500 people, and also in Mozambique, where about 900,000 people have been affected. Many risk a resurgent cholera outbreak, aid agencies say.Malawi and Mozambique were already among the countries most affected by a cholera outbreak that has resulted in more than 68,000 cases across 12 countries in southern and eastern Africa this year alone, according to humanitarian agencies.In Malawi, cholera had already killed more than 1,600 people and together with Mozambique “millions” of children and their families are now vulnerable to a “potential increase” in cases, the United Nations children’s agency UNICEF said this week.“Devastation and flooding caused by the cyclone have added to the serious vulnerabilities of children and families in the countries, further weakened by inadequate water, hygiene, health and sanitation systems,” said UNICEF in a statement.In Mozambique, cholera cases have risen almost four-fold to about 11, 000 since February, UNICEF said.Other humanitarian needs are mounting in the region and aid agencies are scrambling to pool resources to alleviate the unfolding disaster.About 4 million people — a fifth of Malawi's population — were already facing food insecurity and “more people will now need assistance” after floods destroyed close to 120,000 hectares (297,000 acres) of farmland, said the World Food Program. The price of the staple maize has skyrocketed to between 300% and 400% compared to the same time last year in affected areas, said WFP.Among those in dire need of assistance in Malawi are more than 500,000 people displaced by the floods, according to the International Organization for Migration.In Mozambique, where the cyclone destroyed extensive infrastructure and damaged about 350,000 hectares (865,000 acres) of farmland, aid agencies are struggling to reach desperate communities where roads have been damaged, said the WFP. More than 160,000 people have been displaced and living in temporary shelters in the country, according to the U.N humanitarian agency.Cyclone Freddy is expected to be declared the longest-ever cyclone in recorded history. It is the latest of weather-related disasters such as floods, storms and debilitating droughts that have devastated sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade — a sign of the deadly impact of climate change in a region with weak economies and infrastructure ill-equipped to cope with such ravages.Cyclones have been worsened by human-caused climate change, with warming temperatures making cyclones wetter, more intense and more frequent, according to experts. Richer, more industrialized nations have caused much of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change but the less developed countries often bear the brunt of the weather changes, a reality which led to a “loss and damage” fund for climate disasters being agreed last year.",2023/03/24,139,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845018,Mozambicans vow to keep marching for deceased protest rapper,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) — Mozambican fans of deceased protest rapper Azagaia have vowed to keep marching in his honor, even though police violently dispersed demonstrations in Maputo and other cities last week.Peaceful demonstrations will go ahead with or without police authorization, said David Fardo, an organiser of the marches. He did not say when or where new marches would take place.Thousands assembled in cities across Mozambique last week to pay tribute to Azagaia, a rare outspoken government critic who died on March 9 at the age of 38. Although the assemblies were peaceful police fired tear gas and arrested some marchers.In the capital, Maputo, at least 19 people were injured, two of them seriously. One of those injured lost an eye after a tear gas canister struck his face, according to local reports. Police also beat an unarmed man lying on the ground before dragging him into a police car, according to march organizers and a video circulating online.Across Mozambique, 36 people were arrested, 20 of them in Maputo, according to a police statement, which accused demonstrators of drunken and violent behavior.Organizers of the marches have received threatening messages warning them not to plans any further demonstrations, said Fardo.The police actions to disperse the marches has drawn criticism from human rights watchdogs, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The United Nations Human Rights Office issued a statement expressing concern over the “unnecessary and disproportionate use of force by police amid peaceful marches” and called for the release of those who have been arbitrarily detained.Azagaia, whose real name was Edson da Luz, was known for openly condemning government corruption in his music and garnered a large following, particularly among young Mozambicans. He died of an epileptic seizure.“This march aims to be the first of many marches,” Venâncio Mondlane, a member of Mozambique's National Assembly for the second largest opposition party MDM, told The Associated Press at the demonstration last week. “This march turns a new page in the history of Mozambique, just as we had in 1975 (when Mozambique won independence from Portugal).”These nationwide demonstrations came after Azagaia’s funeral procession, which saw thousands march through the streets of central Maputo chanting protest slogans such as “resistance” and “power to the people.” Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd as it tried to carry Azagaia’s coffin past Ponta Vermelha, the president’s official residence.Mozambique has sometimes seen protests over the prices of fuel and bread but such mass demonstrations celebrating opposition activists are unusual.The day after Azagaia died, a vigil was held in Maputo where hundreds came to hear tributes, many of which explicitly criticised the country's ruling party Frelimo.Azagaia achieved a passionate following, and notoriety, with songs such as “Povo no Poder” (“Power to the People”) which was released in 2008 during protests over rising fuel prices. The rapper accused politicians of stealing from ordinary people to lead lives of luxury. It has since become an anthem of opposition to the government. In other songs Azagaia commented on issues such as police brutality and drug trafficking.While he was alive Azagaia was often treated with hostility by the government. His songs were generally censored on state media and the Attorney General’s Office accused him of inciting violence following the release of “Povo no Poder.”___AP journalist Alexandre Nhampossa in Maputo, Mozambique, contributed.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845019,Manhattan DA rejects GOP demand for info on Trump case,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Manhattan district attorney investigating Donald Trump rebuffed House Republicans’ request Thursday for documents and testimony about the case, dismissing it as an “unprecedented inquiry” with no legitimate basis.In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, the general counsel for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg slammed the congressional request as ""an unlawful incursion into New York’s sovereignty.”“The Letter only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene,” Leslie Dubeck wrote in the letter. “Neither fact is a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry.”The Republican chairmen of three House committees on Monday sent a letter to Bragg seeking information about his actions in the Trump case. The Republicans criticized the grand jury investigation as an “unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority.”The chairmen requested testimony as well as documents and copies of any communications with the Justice Department to be turned over by Thursday. The request came as Republicans in the House quickly rallied around the former president as a grand jury in New York weighs whether to bring an indictment against him.“If a grand jury brings charges against Donald Trump, the DA’s Office will have an obligation, as in every case, to provide a significant amount of discovery from its files to the defendant so that he may prepare a defense,” Dubeck wrote.The five-page response from Bragg's office provides a rare insight into what has remained a secret grand jury process, marking one of the first public acknowledgments that there is a sitting grand jury currently investigating Trump. The DA's office has adhered closely to centuries-old rules that have kept grand juries under wraps to protect the reputations of people who end up not being charged and to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify.In proceedings closed to the public and members of the media, grand jurors listen to evidence presented by prosecutors and hear from witnesses. There is no judge present nor anyone representing the accused, and prosecutors do not have to offer any evidence favorable to the defense.The disclosure comes as the grand jury appears close to finishing its work, after hearing last week from Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, but the timing of a possible decision on whether to charge the ex-president remains uncertain. Prosecutors canceled a scheduled grand jury session Wednesday and planned to hear testimony on other matters Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. But law enforcement in New York has been making preparations for any unrest, should Trump face charges.The case revolves around hush money payments during Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to women who alleged sexual encounters with him. Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization.On Thursday, one of the GOP chairmen, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, expanded his probe into the handling of the Trump case by demanding testimony and documents from Mark Pomerantz and Carey Dunne, two former Manhattan prosecutors who had been leading the Trump case before quitting last year in a clash over the direction of the probe.“Last year, you resigned from the office over Bragg’s initial reluctance to move forward with charges, shaming Bragg in your resignation letter — which was subsequently leaked — into bringing charges,” Jordan, an Ohio Republican, wrote in the letter to Pomerantz late Wednesday. “It now appears that your efforts to shame Bragg have worked as he is reportedly resurrecting a so-called ‘zombie’ case against President Trump using a tenuous and untested legal theory.”Requests for comment from Pomerantz and Dunne were not returned.___Associated Press writer Michael R.

The officials were not authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity.The migration deal eliminates a loophole under existing rules that will allow both countries to turn away asylum seekers at the countries' borders. The loophole resulted in thousands of migrants annually crossing into Canada from the U.S. at a non-official checkpoint, enabling them to stay in the country as they seek asylum instead of letting the process play out while staying in the U.S.As part of the agreement, Canada is expected to announce that 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere will be given slots to apply to enter the country, according to a Canadian official.The new policy applies to people without U.S. or Canadian citizenship who are caught within 14 days of crossing the border between the two countries. Biden and Trudeau did not respond to questions from reporters about the agreement when the president and first lady Jill Biden arrived for a private gathering at the prime minister's residence.The White House declined to comment on the agreement, which is expected to be formally announced Friday.The visit comes as the Biden administration has made strengthening its relationship with Canada a priority over the past two years. Both sides see the meetings in the capital of Ottawa as an opportunity to set plans for the future.National security and air defenses are top of mind after a Chinese spy balloon last month traversed North America. Canada plans to update its radar systems and has agreed to an accelerated timeline for spending billions more on military upgrades for NORAD, which monitors the skies above the continent, according to the senior Canadian government official.Canada announced last year it is investing $3.8 billion (Canadian $4.9 billion) over the next six years to modernize NORAD radar systems and billions more years later, but David Cohen, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, has said the current threat climate calls for quicker investment.The loophole in the U.S.-Canada migration rules allowed thousands of migrants to cross into Canada from the U.S. at a non-official checkpoint, enabling them to stay in the country as they seek asylum instead of letting the process play out while staying in the U.S.A quirk in a 2002 agreement between the U.S. and Canada says people seeking asylum must apply in the first country they arrive in. Migrants who go to an official crossing are returned to the U.S. and told to apply there. But those who arrive in Canada at a location other than a port of entry are allowed to stay and request protection, as has been happening on Roxham Road between Champlain, New York, and Quebec.More than 39,000 claims were filed in 2022 by people who were intercepted by Canadian police, the vast majority of them in Quebec and at Roxham Road.The broadened focus of Biden's visit represents an evolution of a friendship between the two countries that exceeds 150 years. The emphasis had more frequently been on issues like trade that had defined relations between the two countries, which share a 5,525-mile border.“This visit is about taking stock of what we’ve done, where we are and what we need to prioritize for for the future,” said John Kirby, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council. “We’re going to talk about our two democracies stepping up to meet the challenges of our time.”There will still be an emphasis on trade, yet Canada and the U.S. see the partnership as crucial in supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion, reducing their dependence on Chinese goods and shifting toward cleaner energy sources amid the planetary damage caused by burning fossil fuels.The leaders are also expected to discuss tapping critical minerals that will enable the production of electric vehicles, and military and economic commitments at a moment that observers say is the most dangerous since World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping this week visited Russian President Vladimir Putin, pledging to deepen their economic ties in ways that could help fund Putin's ongoing war to take Ukraine.“The United States is coming with big strategic issues on their mind,"" said Vincent Rigby, a former national security adviser to Trudeau. ""It’s a world where they’re looking to allies to help.”Trade between the U.S. and Canada totaled an estimated record of $950 billion (Canadian $1.3 trillion) in 2022. Each day, about 400,000 people cross the world’s longest international border, and about 800,000 Canadian citizens live in the United States. There is close cooperation on defense, border security and law enforcement, and a vast overlap in culture, traditions and pastimes.Biden will address Parliament and Trudeau will host him for a state dinner Friday evening. It is Biden’s first visit to Canada since he became president, but Trudeau also gave Biden a state dinner when he was vice president in December 2016 just before Donald Trump took office.“It didn’t need to have happened. It was an incredibly well timed and wise investment on the prime minister’s part to do that and I think it’s paid dividends,” said Bruce Heyman, who was U.S. ambassador to Canada at the time.Last year, Canada was exempted from the subsidy restrictions for electric vehicles in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Heyman called it a huge win for Canada.The NORAD partnership was in the spotlight recently when NORAD tracked a suspected Chinese spy balloon that passed over the two countries before being shot down over the coast of South Carolina. A U.S. fighter jet later shot down an unidentified flying object in Canadian airspace.The British, Australians and Japanese are all investing more in defense given the threats posed by Beijing and Moscow, and the U.S. expects its northern neighbor to do its part.Canada has long faced calls to increase its defense spending to 2% of its gross domestic product, the agreed-upon target by NATO members. Ottawa spends about 1.2% now. Canada announced in January it will purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets but at the time of the announcement said the first four won't arrive for another three years.The U.S. is also pushing Canada to lead an international force in Haiti but Canada’s top military official has suggested the country doesn’t have the capacity.___Associated Press writer Colleen Long in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845021,1st Black editor named to lead Atlanta Journal-Constitution,"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday named Leroy Chapman Jr. as its new editor-in-chief, making him the first Black editor to lead the newspaper in its 155-year history.Chapman, 52, has worked in journalism for nearly three decades and has spent the past 12 years at the Journal-Constitution, serving as its managing editor since 2021. Publisher Andrew Morse said he's proud that the newspaper found the best person for the job within its own ranks.“There’s truly nobody better suited to lead this newsroom,” Morse said in an interview, adding: “He has the respect of the newsroom, he is an innovative thinker, and he has the highest journalistic standard that you could imagine.”Chapman will take charge of a news staff that serves more than 125,000 print and digital subscribers as well as about 6 million unique online monthly visitors, according to figures provided by the newspaper. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is owned by Cox Enterprises, a privately held company.The newspaper traces its history to 1868, when the Atlanta Constitution published its first edition three years after the Civil War ended. One of its most storied editors, Ralph McGill, wrote columns in the 1940s and 1950s that openly criticized racial inequality, eliciting fury and threats from segregationists.Morse, who became the newspaper's publisher in January, said it's significant that the Journal-Constitution will have a Black editor-in-chief in a city known for its diversity. Black people make up 48% of Atlanta's population, more than any other racial group. And its sprawling metropolitan area has the second-highest number of Black-owned businesses in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Chapman grew up just one generation removed from the segregated South his father and grandfathers knew. His family tree, he said, can be traced “back to colonial America where we were on census reports as property.”“To now lead a newsroom, which is an important organization in an important American city, and being able to write the first draft of history is an extraordinary moment for my family,” Chapman said. “When I got into newspapers back in 1994 with my first reporting job, I don’t think even my wild imagination would say I’d be sitting in this seat someday.”Chapman arrived at the Journal-Constitution in 2011 as a front-page story editor and worked his way up to managing editor, the No. 2 newsroom leader, over the next decade. He takes the helm at a challenging time for a newspaper industry that has been steadily shrinking, with regional and local newspapers struggling to find robust online audiences to compensate for advertisers shifting from print to digital.Morse credited Chapman with playing a critical role at the Journal-Constitution in guiding news coverage on major stories such as an investigation into a critical affordable housing shortage in Atlanta and attempts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. In his new job, Chapman will oversee teams responsible for expanded digital offerings such as emailed newsletters and a true-crime podcast, Breakdown, that's now in its ninth season.Before coming to Atlanta, Chapman worked in South Carolina as a government editor at The State newspaper in Columbia and as a columnist and editorial writer at The Greenville News.He succeeds Kevin Riley, who plans to retire later this year. Riley will remain at the newspaper during a transition period as editor-at-large.___This story has been updated to correct the publisher's quote. He said Chapman has the highest standards “that you could imagine,” not “that you could image.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845022,"Trump grand jury turns to other matters, done for the week","NEW YORK (AP) — The Manhattan grand jury investigating Donald Trump over hush money payments turned to other matters on Thursday, delaying until next week at the earliest any vote on a historic indictment of the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter. The panel does not meet on Fridays.It was not clear whether prosecutors planned to question more witnesses before the grand jurors next week or when a vote might be taken about possibly indicting Trump.The New York panel is an investigative grand jury. That means it hears other cases beyond the highly publicized one focused on hush money paid on Trump’s behalf during the 2016 presidential campaign to a porn actor who says she had a sexual encounter with him years earlier.Even so, the timing has given an opening to the former president and supporters to claim the investigation is somehow stalled. Trump, who has denied any sexual encounter with Stormy Daniels, raised the specter on his social media site of “years of hatred, chaos and turmoil” if charges are brought.In keeping with the secret nature of the grand jury process, prosecutors also on Thursday rebuffed a request from House Republicans for records and testimony on the investigation, a request that the general counsel to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg called an “unlawful incursion into New York’s sovereignty.”The prosecutors said Trump himself had created “a false expectation” of being arrested this week, and they offered no update on the timing for any possible actionThe grand jury does not ordinarily meet on Fridays. It did not convene at all on Wednesday, and on Thursday it considered matters other than the Trump probe, said a person who was knowledgeable about the situation but who was not authorized to discuss the secret proceedings and spoke on the condition of anonymity.There was no explanation from prosecutors on why the panel had not met on Wednesday or heard from Trump-related witnesses on Thursday.Grand jury proceedings are closed to the pubic including the media, with prosecutors prevented by law from sharing any details of what takes place. Still, these proceedings have captivated public attention, each development magnified because the presumed target is a former president and because Trump declared he expected to be arrested.Security is heavy outside the grand jury location as well as Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Demonstrators for and against him wave big signs and chant.Limited snapshots of the investigation have largely come from witnesses and their attorneys, who don't share the secrecy obligation. Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer and a key government witness in this case, has spoken publicly about his appearances, as has another recent witness, Robert Costello, an attorney who presented testimony aimed at undermining Cohen's credibility.The district attorney's office, which is leading the investigation, has offered no public indication of future timing.In a letter sent Thursday to Republican lawmakers who sought documents and testimony about the investigation, the office's general counsel, Leslie Dudek, wrote that Trump had “created a false expectation” on the timing of an arrest, and Dudek reiterated prosecutors' obligation to preserve the secrecy of the investigation.""These confidentiality provisions exist to protect the interests of the various participants in the criminal process — the defendant, the witnesses and members of the grand jury — as well as the integrity of the grand jury proceeding itself,"" the letter said.____Tucker reported from Washington.___More on Donald Trump-related investigations: https:/apnewhttpss.com/hhub/donald-trump",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845023,Average long-term US mortgage rate falls to 6.42% this week,"The average long-term U.S. mortgage fell for the second straight week which, combined with moderating home prices, could give house hunters a break and the housing market a boost as the spring buying season begins.Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate fell to 6.42% from 6.6% last week. The average rate a year ago was 4.42%.Even though financial markets remain jittery over recent bank collapses and the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by another 25 basis points Wednesday, some economists think there may be light at the end of the tunnel for the downtrodden housing market.“On the homebuyer front, the news is more positive with improved purchase demand and stabilizing home prices,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “If mortgage rates continue to slide over the next few weeks, look for a continued rebound during the first weeks of the spring homebuying season.”Last year's big rise in mortgage rates — which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for homebuyers — chilled the housing market. Before surging 14.5% in February, sales of existing homes had fallen for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.In 2022, existing U.S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier this year.But recently there has been some good news for those seeking to move: the national median home price slipped 0.2% from February last year to $363,000, marking the first annual decline in 13 years, according to the NAR.The average long-term rate hit 7.08% in the fall — a two-decade high — as the Federal Reserve cranked up its key lending rate in a bid to cool the economy and stymie persistent, four-decade high inflation.In their latest quarterly economic projections, the policymakers forecast that they expect to raise that key rate just once more — from its new level of about 4.9% to 5.1%, the same peak they had projected in December.While the Fed’s rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investor expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.Treasury yields have fluctuated wildly since the collapse of two mid-size U.S. banks two weeks ago, with the 10-year falling to 3.47% Thursday. The 10-year yield reached 5.07% before the bank collapses, its highest level since 2007.The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, also came down again this week, to 5.68% from 5.9% last week. It was 3.63% one year ago.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845024,"Hungary would not act on Putin arrest warrant, official says","BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Authorities in Hungary would not arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin if he were to enter the country despite him being the subject of an international warrant for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, a Hungarian official said Thursday.Gergely Gulyas, chief of staff to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, said during a news conference in Budapest that arresting Putin would contravene Hungarian law because the country has not promulgated the statute of the International Criminal Court into its legal system.The court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands, last week issued an arrest warrant for Putin that accused him of personal responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine.Gulyas said the statute of the ICC, of which Hungary is a member state, was in conflict with Hungary’s Constitution, and that arresting Putin would therefore violate Hungarian law. Orban's government has not yet taken a position on the warrant, but Gulyas said he considered it counterproductive.“I think these decisions are not the most fortunate because they lead toward escalation and not toward peace,” he said.The chances of Putin facing trial in The Hague are highly unlikely because Moscow does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction or extradite its nationals. However, the warrant could limit the Russian leader's ability to travel to the tribunal's 123 member nations, which could arrest him in accordance with the warrant.Since Russia invaded Ukraine 13 months ago, Hungary has condemned the war but refused to supply Ukraine with weapons or allow their transfer across its borders. It has also threatened to veto certain European Union sanctions against Moscow and has held up the adoption of a major EU funding package to Kyiv.Earlier this week, Hungary refused to join the other 26 EU members in signing a resolution in support of the ICC warrant for Putin.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845025,Here are the countries that have bans on TikTok,"LONDON (AP) — A growing number of countries in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific have banned the popular video-sharing app TikTok from government devices as privacy and cybersecurity concerns increase. A handful have prohibited the app altogether.The company's CEO faced a grilling Thursday from U.S. lawmakers. TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese technology company Bytedance, has long maintained that it does not share data with the Chinese government.The company points to a project its carrying out to store U.S. user data in the U.S., which it says will put it out China's reach. It also disputes accusations it collects more user data than other social media companies, and insists that it is run independently by its own management.But many governments remain cautious about the platform and its ties to China. Here are the places that have implemented partial or total bans on TikTok:AFGHANISTANAfghanistan’s Taliban leadership banned TikTok and the game PUBG in 2022 on the grounds of protecting young people from “being misled.”BELGIUMBelgium temporarily banned TikTok from devices owned or paid for by the federal government, citing worries about cybersecurity, privacy and misinformation. Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said the six-month ban was based on warnings from the state security service and its cybersecurity center.CANADACanada announced government-issued devices must not use TikTok, saying that it presents an “unacceptable” risk to privacy and security. Employees will also be blocked from downloading the application in the future.DENMARKDenmark’s Defense Ministry banned its employees from having TikTok on their work phones, ordering staffers who have installed it to remove the app from devices as soon as possible. The ministry said the reasons for the ban included both “weighty security considerations” as well as “very limited work-related need to use the app.”EUROPEAN UNIONThe European Parliament, European Commission and the EU Council, the 27-member bloc’s three main institutions, have imposed bans on TikTok on staff devices. Under the European Parliament’s ban, which took effect Monday, lawmakers and staff were also advised to remove the TikTok app from their personal devices.INDIAIndia imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps, including the messaging app WeChat, in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.The companies were given a chance to respond to questions on privacy and security requirements but the ban was made permanent in January 2021.NEW ZEALANDLawmakers in New Zealand and staff at the nation’s Parliament will be prohibited from having the TikTok app on their work phones, following advice from government cybersecurity experts. Under the ban, which takes effect at the end of March, the app will be removed from all devices with access to the parliamentary network, although officials can make special arrangements for anybody who needs TikTok to perform their democratic duties.NORWAYThe Norwegian parliament on Thursday banned Tiktok on work devices, after the country's Justice Ministry warned the app shouldn't be installed on phones issued to government employees. The Parliament's speaker said TikTok shouldn't be on devices that have access to the assembly’s systems and should be removed as quickly as possible. The country's capital Oslo and second largest city Bergen also urged municipal employees to remove TikTok from their work phones.PAKISTANPakistani authorities have temporarily banned TikTok at least four times since October 2020, citing concerns that app promotes immoral content.TAIWANIn December 2022, Taiwan imposed a public sector ban on TikTok after the FBI warned that TikTok posed a national security risk. Government devices, including mobile phones, tablets and desktop computers, are not allowed to use Chinese-made software, which include apps like TikTok, its Chinese equivalent Douyin, or Xiaohongshu, a Chinese lifestyle content app.UNITED KINGDOMBritish authorities in mid-March banned TikTok from mobile phones used by government ministers and civil servants with immediate effect. Officials said the ban was a “precautionary move” on security grounds, and doesn't apply to personal devices. The British Parliament followed that up Thursday by announcing a ban on TikTok from all official devices and the “wider parliamentary network.” The semi-autonomous Scottish government also said Thursday it was banning TikTok from official devices, effective immediately.UNITED STATESThe U.S. at the start of March gave government agencies 30 days to delete TikTok from federal devices and systems over data security concerns. The ban applies only to government devices, though some U.S. lawmakers are advocating an outright ban. China lashed out at the U.S. for banning TikTok, describing the ban as an abuse of state power and suppressing firms from other countries. More than half of the 50 U.S. states also have banned the app from official devices, as have Congress and the U.S. armed forces.",2023/03/24,,World

John Fetterman's office said Thursday that he is expected to return soon to the chamber, although Democratic leaders are giving no timeline five weeks after he sought inpatient treatment for clinical depression.Fetterman, 53, was weeks into his service in Washington and still recovering from the aftereffects of the stroke he had last May during his campaign when he checked himself into Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Feb. 15.Aides said at the time that Fetterman had not been his usual self for weeks. He was withdrawn, showing a disinterest in talking, eating and the usual banter with aides. Post-stroke depression is common and treatable, doctors say.Asked about when Fetterman might return, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said only that Fetterman is recuperating.“We want to give him the space to recuperate,"" Schumer said at a Wednesday news conference. ""He needs it, it’s fair, it’s right. There are other people in the Senate who have taken their time to recuperate but I’m confident he’s going to come back and be an outstanding and fine senator.”A spokesperson said Fetterman is getting better and that the recovery is going well.“He'll be back soon, at least over a week, but soon,” spokesperson Joe Calvello said Thursday.Fetterman is receiving daily in-person briefings by chief of staff Adam Jentleson, Calvello said. The senator is reading the news and getting briefings, he said, while issuing statements through his office and sponsoring legislation. Aides are opening new regional offices in Pennsylvania.After Fetterman checked in to Walter Reed, his office said he had experienced depression “off and on throughout his life,” but it had only become severe in recent weeks. The Capitol physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan, recommended Fetterman's hospitalization after conducting an evaluation, his office said then.In the meantime, Fetterman's aides and his wife, Gisele, have released photos of the senator smiling, being briefed or visiting with her and their three school-age children.Fetterman had the stroke last May as he was campaigning in a three-way Democratic primary race. The stroke nearly killed him, he has said, and he had surgery to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator to manage two heart conditions, atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy.He won the primary while in the hospital and went on to beat GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz in November, winning the campaign cycle's most expensive race. Fetterman's victory boosted Democrats to a 51-49 majority.Fetterman was sworn in Jan. 3.One of Fetterman’s main aftereffects from the stroke is auditory processing disorder, which can render someone unable to speak fluidly and quickly process spoken conversation into meaning. Fetterman uses devices in conversations, meetings and congressional hearings that transcribe spoken words in real time.Post-stroke depression is also a common aftereffect, with 1 in 3 stroke patients experiencing it, and is treatable through antidepressant medication and counseling, doctors say.Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said in an interview that he has purposely not called Fetterman to talk — “the last thing he needs is a lot of phone calls,” Casey said — and does not know when Fetterman will return.Casey said his sense from Fetterman's staff is that Fetterman has made “good progress.”“I’m just happy he’s getting the time that he needs and most people understand that these things don’t occur over two or three weeks, it takes a little longer,” Casey said.___Associated Press writer Mary Clare Jalonick in Washington contributed to this report.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845037,Lawmakers tell ex-CEOs 'you must answer' for bank failures,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Leaders of the Senate's banking committee on Thursday warned former chief executive officers at the failed Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank that they expect them to testify before the panel, saying in a letter to each: “you must answer for the bank's downfall.”The committee is examining the events leading up to the closures of the banks, starting with the first congressional hearing on Tuesday. Separate letters were sent Thursday to Gregory Becker, the former head of Silicon Valley Bank, and to Joseph DePaolo, the former head of Signature Bank.Both CEOs had indicated to the committee they would be unable to attend Tuesday's hearing, according to the letter. But the senators said they believe the CEOs can testify to Congress without disclosing confidential information. Nor would the executives need to hand over bank records and files to provide informative testimony, they said.Attorneys copied in on the letters sent to the CEOs did not immediately reply to requests from The Associated Press for comment.Silicon Valley Bank, based in Santa Clara, California, failed on March 10 after depositors rushed to withdraw money amid fears about the bank’s health. It was the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. Regulators convened over the following weekend and announced that New York-based Signature Bank also had failed. They said that all depositors at both banks, including those holding uninsured funds, those exceeding $250,000, would be protected by federal deposit insurance.Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic chairman of the banking panel, and Sen. Tim Scott, the ranking Republican, said the committee needs to understand how the banks managed risk during their rapid growth and what led to them both having a large proportion of uninsured depositors.The senators also asked SVB's Becker for information on the “payment of bonuses in the hours leading up to the seizure of the bank by regulators.”Lawmakers also are scrutinizing the actions of regulators who supervised the two banks, and that will be the focus of Tuesday's hearing with testimony from Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Michael Barr, a vice chairman at the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors; and Nellie Liang, undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department.The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also launched investigations into the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, and President Joe Biden has called on Congress to strengthen rules on regional banks and to impose tougher penalties on executives of failed banks.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845038,Feds: Woman charged in Wyoming clinic fire opposes abortion,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A woman accused of setting fire last year to a Wyoming abortion clinic that was under construction told investigators that she opposes abortion and was experiencing anxiety and nightmares over the facility opening, authorities say in court documents.Lorna Roxanne Green, of Casper, told Matthew T. Wright, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, that she broke into the Wellspring Health Access clinic in Casper on May 25, poured gasoline inside the facility and lit it, according to the court filing.Several tipsters identified Green as a possible suspect after the reward for information in the case was increased to $15,000 this month. Officers arrested Green in Casper on Tuesday.Green, 22, made an initial appearance by video Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kelly Rankin in Cheyenne. She remained jailed in Wheatland, a town of 3,500 people about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of Cheyenne, with no bond set.Dressed in olive green prison garb and wearing glasses, Green said only “yes” and “no” in response to basic questions from Rankin during the 20-minute hearing.She is charged with arson, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Reached by phone, her attorney, Ryan Semerad, declined to comment.The clinic was scheduled to open last summer as the only facility of its kind in the state, offering women’s health care, family planning and gender-affirming health care in addition to abortion services. But the fire delayed those plans.It was then slated to open next month, but those plans were thrown into doubt after Gov. Mark Gordon allowed a broad new abortion ban to take effect on Sunday without his signature. On Wednesday, Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens halted enforcement of the ban after a hearing in which abortion-rights supporters said it harms pregnant women and their doctors, and violates the state constitution.Owens suspended the ban for at least two weeks. Meanwhile, the state's first-in-the-nation ban on abortion pills remains set to take effect in July but also faces a court challenge.Green's arrest followed an investigation that had been stalled for months.In early March, an anonymous donor added $10,000 to the $5,000 reward in the arson case. Investigators received a dozen tips, including four naming Green as a possible suspect.An image in one of Green's social media accounts showed her wearing shoes that matched those worn by the arson suspect. And Green drove a beige, 2007 Toyota Corolla that matched a car in security footage shot at the crime scene, according to Wright's statement.Confronted by investigators Tuesday, Green acknowledged setting the fire amid “nightmares which she attributed to her anxiety about the abortion clinic,"" Wright said in the court filing.Green was living in Laramie at the time at the time of the fire. She told investigators that she bought gas cans and aluminum pans at a Walmart the day before the fire, drove to Casper, and put the cans and pans in a bag she carried to the clinic, matching security video and a witness's account, Wright wrote.She said she used a rock to break glass in a door and, once inside, poured gasoline into the pans in several rooms and on the floor. She set fire to the gasoline in a room and planned to light more, but the fire spread quickly and she decided to leave, Wright's statement said.Green said she slipped on gasoline and fell before she fled out the door she had entered, then drove 150 miles (241 kilometers) back to Laramie without stopping, Wright wrote.Reached by phone Thursday, Green’s father, Stephen Green, declined to comment and referred questions to her attorney.___Hanson reported from Helena, Montana.

Ron DeSantis is walking back his characterization of Russia’s war in Ukraine as a “territorial dispute,” following criticism from a number of fellow Republicans who expressed concern about the potential 2024 presidential candidate’s dismissive description of the conflict.In excerpts of an interview with Piers Morgan set to air Thursday on Fox Nation, DeSantis said his earlier comments referenced ongoing fighting in the eastern Donbas region, as well as Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea. Ukraine’s borders are internationally recognized, including by the United Nations.“What I’m referring to is where the fighting is going on now, which is that eastern border region Donbas, and then Crimea, and you have a situation where Russia has had that. I don’t think legitimately, but they had,"" DeSantis said, according to excerpts. ""There’s a lot of ethnic Russians there. So, that’s some difficult fighting, and that’s what I was referring to, and so it wasn’t that I thought Russia had a right to that, and so if I should have made that more clear, I could have done it.""DeSantis made his initial comments last week in a written response to questions sent to declared and potential GOP presidential candidates by Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The Florida governor, seen as a top rival to former President Donald Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination, said that defending Ukraine wasn’t a national security priority for the U.S., and he downplayed the Russian invasion.​“While the U.S. has many vital national interests — securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Communist Party — becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,” DeSantis wrote, echoing how Russia has characterized its ongoing invasion.In the days that followed, a number of Republican senators weighed in with criticism. In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said DeSantis “doesn’t deal with foreign policy every day as governor,” adding that “foreign policy is all about nuance.” Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has endorsed Trump’s 2024 campaign, told Fox News that DeSantis “is basically taking the Chinese position when it comes to Russia’s invasion.”Republican Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, John Cornyn of Texas and Roger Wicker of Mississippi said they disagreed with DeSantis’ framing.In the interview with Morgan, DeSantis sought to toughen his position toward Russia, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “war criminal” and arguing that his detractors had incorrectly characterized his “territorial dispute” remarks.“I think it’s been mischaracterized,"" he told Morgan, according to excerpts. “Obviously, Russia invaded — that was wrong. They invaded Crimea and took that in 2014 — that was wrong.”Democrats have also seized on DeSantis' apparent shifting stance, blasting out emails rounding up the GOP criticism and saying DeSantis' “stumbling over this answer makes clear he is out of his depth.”Asked by The Atlantic about DeSantis' initial comments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that failure to act on Russia's aggression in his country could ultimately draw the U.S. into a conflict if incursions are also made into NATO member countries.“When they will occupy NATO countries, and also be on the borders of Poland and maybe fight with Poland, the question is: Will you send all your soldiers with weapons, all your pilots, all your ships? Will you send tanks and armored vehicles with your young people? Will you do it?” Zelenskyy said. “Because if you will not do it, you will have no NATO.”___Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845040,"Autism now more common among Black, Hispanic kids in US","NEW YORK (AP) — For the first time, autism is being diagnosed more frequently in Black and Hispanic children than in white kids in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.Among all U.S. 8-year-olds, 1 in 36 had autism in 2020, the CDC estimated. That's up from 1 in 44 two years earlier.But the rate rose faster for children of color than for white kids. The new estimates suggest that about 3% of Black, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander children have an autism diagnosis, compared with about 2% of white kids.That's a contrast to the past, when autism was most commonly diagnosed in white kids — usually in middle- or upper-income families with the means to go to autism specialists. As recently as 2010, white kids were deemed 30% more likely to be diagnosed with autism than Black children and 50% more likely than Hispanic children.Experts attributed the change to improved screening and autism services for all kids, and to increased awareness and advocacy for Black and Hispanic families.The increase is from “this rush to catch up,” said David Mandell, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatry professor.Still, it's not clear that Black and Hispanic children with autism are being helped as much as their white counterparts. A study published in January found Black and Hispanic kids had less access to autism services than white children during the 2017-2018 academic year.Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. There are many possible symptoms, many of which overlap with other diagnoses. They can include delays in language and learning, social and emotional withdrawal, and an unusual need for routine. Scientists believe genetics can play a role, but there is no known biological reason why it would be more common in one racial or ethnic group than another.For decades, the diagnosis was given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But around 30 years ago, the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders.""There are no blood or biologic tests for it. It's diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior.To estimate how common autism is, the CDC checks health and school records in 11 states and focuses on 8-year-olds, because most cases are diagnosed by that age. Other researchers have their own estimates, but experts say the CDC's estimate is the most rigorous and is considered the gold standard.The overall autism rate has been rising for decades and it remains far more common among boys than girls. But the latest study also found, for the first time, that more than 1% of 8-year-old girls had been diagnosed with it.A second CDC report issued Thursday looked at how common autism was in 4-year-olds. That research is important because diagnoses are increasingly happening at younger ages, said Kelly Shaw, who oversees the CDC autism tracking project.Black children with autism have historically been diagnosed at later ages than their white peers, said Rose Donohue, a psychiatrist at Washington University. But the study of 4-year-olds likewise found that autism was less common in white kids in 2020 than it was among Black, Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander children.The 4-year-olds, however, were less likely to have been evaluated for autism than kids in the past. That was likely due to interruptions in child care and medical services during that first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Shaw said.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845048,Berlin votes on climate neutrality by 2030,"This Sunday, Berliners will vote in a referendum on whether to make the capital climate-neutral by 2030, bringing the current official target of 2045 forward by 15 years. About 2.4 million Berliners aged 18 or over will be eligible to vote. For the amendment to pass, at least 25% (roughly 613,000 eligible voters) will need to vote in favor.Berlin, like Germany as a whole, currently aims for a 95% reduction in net carbon dioxide emissions by 2045, compared with 1990 levels. But climate scientists and activists say this does not go far enough, not least because Germany will have already exceeded its carbon budget for a pathway to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2031.According to the initiator of the referendum, a group called Klimaneustart Berlin (Climate Reset Berlin), the target, which was introduced in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, needs to be brought forward. With the referendum, Klimaneustart is seeking to make that legally binding for Berlin's government.Klimaneustart is asking voters to approve a pre-drafted amendment to the existing energy transition law. If passed, it would take immediate effect and require action by the municipal government. A failure to meet the goals could then result in legal repercussions and financial penalties for Berlin's state government.""We wanted to minimize the chances that empty promises could continue to be made, so that just gives us more options to apply pressure on politicians to really hit the 2030 mark,"" Jessamine Davis, an activist from Klimaneustart Berlin, told DW. ""Berlin declared a climate emergency and is not acting accordingly at the moment. There's no sign that emergency behavior is being implemented.""At least 80% of Berlin's energy comes from fossil fuel sources. Few lawmakers in Berlin's state parliament, the Senate, believe seven years is enough to make the transition to renewable energy complete and are concerned about the short-term costs this would incur.The outgoing center-left city government of Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and post-communist Left Party had come out to urge Berliners to vote ""no"" on Sunday. But Berlin's environment and climate protection senator, Green Party parliamentary group leader Bettina Jarasch, has spoken out in support of the proposed amendment, saying the latest climate report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change made it clear that the situation is ""dramatic.""The cost of implementing climate neutrality by 2030 is estimated to run into the billions, as buildings need to be renovated and private transport curbed. Critics warn that bringing the target date forward would mean cutting back on urgent investments in other sectors, for example into childcare and education.The head of the Independent Association of Businesses Berlin-Brandenburg (UVB), Christian Amsinck, described the referendum as ""dishonest"" and said it was ""conning"" voters into believing that Berlin can become climate-neutral by 2030.The initiators of the referendum have presented no plan for how the transition could be financed. But they argue that the transition would trigger investment in the regional economy to create sustainable jobs as part of the energy transition.Burkhard Rhein, head of industry, energy and infrastructure policy at UVB, told DW that this is not the point. ""Our main problem right now is not to create new jobs,"" Rhein said. ""It's that we have a lack of qualified personnel in a lot of industries and companies. What we have as a problem is that we don't get into the doing. With the referendum, we are playing on the meta level. But companies are waiting for the framework.""Organizers at Klimaneustart Berlin are adamant that the 2030 climate-neutral target is achievable, pointing to the untapped potential of renewable energy resources such as solar and wind in the region.""That's probably our biggest resource in terms of renewables, and it's just not being considered and in a climate emergency situation that should be the first thing that is addressed,"" Davis said, adding that Berlin also has 160 square kilometers (62 square miles) of available land in Brandenburg that could be used for wind power.Klimaneustart Berlin was launched in 2021 by a coalition of representatives from politics, science and civil society, with backing from groups including Fridays for Future, Extinction Rebellion, Germany's national cyclists association and the Sustainability Office at Berlin's Humboldt University. Support has also come from an investor couple in New York, Albert Wagner and Susan Danziger. Both have German citizenship and have previously donated to a group campaigning for the introduction of universal basic income in Berlin.The referendum in Berlin is the latest grassroots campaign to take on governments on climate change and pollution. In July 2022, the UN passed a resolution to declare the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a human right and the European Court of Justice has also ruled that citizens can sue governments if their health has been negatively affected by air pollution.The amendment does not set out what sanctions would apply should the obligations not be met. The initiators say that drafting sanctions into the proposed law is a highly complex process and would have been far too time-consuming to make legally watertight — time campaigners say the planet does not have.""The climate crisis is obviously such an urgent topic that we wanted to make the referendum happen as soon as possible and we thought it would make the most sense for the sanctions to be defined by experts in that area,"" Davis said.The initiators of the referendum say 450,000 voters have applied for a postal ballot and they are cautiously optimistic that the amendment will be approved on Sunday.""We're still very much in the stage where we're saying every single person that has the privilege to be eligible to vote needs to vote. It would be devastating if we lost on a handful of ballots,"" Davis said.Edited by: Rina Goldenberg",2023/03/23,,

No such athletes currently compete at the highest elite levels of track.Another set of updates, for athletes with differences in sex development (DSD), could impact up to 13 current high-level runners, WA President Sebastian Coe said. They include Semenya, a two-time Olympic champion at 800 meters, who has been barred from that event since 2019.Semenya and others had been able to compete without restrictions in events outside the range of 400 meters through one mile but now will have to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months before competing to be eligible.Coe conceded there are no easy answers on this topic, which has turned into a societal lightning rod involving advocates concerned with keeping a level playing field in women's sports and others who don't want to discriminate against transgender and DSD athletes.“All the decisions we've taken have their challenges,” Coe said. “If that's the case, then we will do what we have done in the past, which is vigorously defend our position. And the overarching principle for me is we will always do what we think is in the best interest of our sport.”Athletes with sex development differences, such as Semenya and Olympic 200-meter silver medalist Christine Mboma of Namibia, are not transgender, although the two issues share similarities when it comes to sports.Such athletes were legally identified as female at birth but have a medical condition that leads to some male traits, including high levels of testosterone that World Athletics argues gives them the same kind of unfair advantage as transgender athletes.Semenya has been running in longer events. She finished 13th in her qualifying heat at 5,000 meters at world championships last year. In a recent interview, she said she was aiming to run in the Olympics at a longer distance.“I’m in the adaptation phase, and my body is starting to fit with it. I’m just enjoying myself at the moment, and things will fall into place at the right time,” the South African runner said.Now, in order to compete at next year's Olympics, she would have to undergo hormone-suppressing treatment for six months, something she has said she will never do again, having undergone the treatment a decade ago under previous rules.Mboma, who won her silver in Tokyo two years ago but was out of worlds last year because of an injury, has not publicly stated whether she would be willing to undergo hormone therapy.Another athlete, Olympic 800-meter silver medalist Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi, also has said she would not undergo treatment. While Semenya struggled at longer distances, Niyonsaba had relative success, winning Diamond League titles at 3,000 and 5,000 meters and running in the 5,000 at the Tokyo Olympics.Under the new regulations, athletes in the previously “unrestricted” events would have to suppress testosterone levels below 2.5 nanomoles per liter of blood for six months. Ultimately, they would have to stay below those levels for two years.Previously, athletes with differences in sex development had to lower their testosterone to below 5 nanomoles per liter of blood for at least six months before competing, and the rules only applied to distances between 400 meters and one mile.___AP Sports Writer Gerald Imray contributed to this report.___More AP coverage of the Paris Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845061,Mexico president confirms killer of Jesuits was found dead,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president said Thursday forensic tests have confirmed that a body found in northern Mexico was that of a drug gang leader accused of murdering two Jesuit priests last year.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not say whether the tests involved a DNA match or fingerprints.The sister of accused killer José Noriel Portillo Gil, alias “El Chueco,” or “The Crooked One,” had earlier identified his body by sight.The murder of the two beloved Jesuit priests in June 2022 had shocked Mexico. The Jesuits said in a statement Wednesday that the suspect’s death proves the government can’t catch criminals and has lost control of parts of the country.Despite nine months of supposed searches for Portillo Gil, the circumstances of his death suggest he was executed by his own or a rival drug gang. Portillo Gil’s gang was also implicated in the 2018 killing of an American travelling in the area.Portillo Gil was believed to have been shot to death some time Monday. The body was found in a field on Tuesday, after someone called police to report a dead body.The Society of Jesus, as the Jesuits are known, said Wednesday that the mere fact that Portillo Gil had been shot to death didn’t mean justice had been done.“If it is confirmed that this is the person implicated in the murder of the two Jesuit priests, his turning up dead can in no way be considered a triumph for justice, or a solution to the structural problem of violence” in the mountainous Sierra Tarahumara region, the Jesuits said in a statement.“On the contrary, the lack of an adequate legal process in the murder case would only imply the Mexican government has failed in its basic duties and confirm that the authorities do not have control of the territory,” according to the Society of Jesus.López Obrador and the Defense Department had vowed to find Portillo Gil and bring him to justice.It is not uncommon in Mexico for cartels to kill one of their own members, if their misdeeds have resulted in increased police or military pressure that affects the gang’s business.The murdered priests, the Rev. Javier Campos, 79, and the Rev. Joaquín Mora, 80, had spent much of their lives serving the Rarámuri community in the Chihuahua town of Cerocahui, despite fierce violence by drug gangs and illegal loggers in the area.Portillo Gil was also accused in the 2018 killing of Patrick Braxton-Andrew, a 34-year-old Spanish teacher from North Carolina who was traveling in the Tarahumara mountains.Portillo Gil’s gang apparently suspected Braxton-Andrew of being a U.S. drug agent and killed him.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845062,"Lawsuit: Slurs, coercion at BBQ chain with racist history","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina barbecue chain known for its pro-segregation stance in a landmark 1960s case and its embrace of the Confederate flag in 2000 is facing allegations of racism and sexual harassment by the fired general manager of one of its restaurants.According to a lawsuit filed this week by a Black woman who worked at a Maurice’s Piggie Park BBQ location in Columbia, the man who ran it, general manager Jeff Harrison, coerced her early last year into a sexual relationship with promises of a raise, which he paid.She says she quit after he grew “irate” and “more threatening” when she rebuffed his additional sexual advances. The Associated Press isn’t naming the woman because she is an alleged victim of sexual abuse.In a separate lawsuit brought last month by Damien Wooden, another Black former employee, Wooden contends that Harrison left him racist voicemails including slurs and threatening to break his jaw after he told Harrison to stop calling and harassing the female employee who quit.The lawsuits, which seek undisclosed damages, accuse the company of negligent supervision and accuse Harrison of intentionally inflicting emotional distress, assault and battery.The AP did not hear back after leaving messages Wednesday evening with multiple listed phone numbers and an email address believed to be Harrison's.A company receptionist told the AP that Maurice's Piggie Park BBQ had no comment. Its president, Lloyd Bessinger, told ABC Columbia News that the company “does not condone or accept any sexual or racial behavior.”“When I heard of Mr. Harrison’s behavior I fired him imminently,” Bessinger said in the statement. ""We are a local family business that supports the community by providing jobs & great BBQ for 60 years.”But the plaintiffs' lawyers said the incidents show that leaders haven't learned from the company's past bigotry.In 1964, a waitress at a Piggie Park Drive-In refused to take two Black customers' order. Owner Maurice Bessinger justified his refusal to serve Black customers inside his stores — conveyed through window signs — based on his religious opposition to racial integration. In a lawsuit over the matter, a federal judge ruled in 1966 that such beliefs couldn't be practiced “in utter disregard of the clear constitutional rights of other citizens"" — marking a victory for the civil rights movement.The U.S. Supreme Court later called Bessinger's religious freedom argument “patently frivolous” in a 1968 decision that established attorneys' fees could be awarded to plaintiffs in successful civil rights cases.In 2000, Bessinger opposed the South Carolina Legislature's removal of the Confederate flag from the dome of the state Capitol by flying it outside of all his restaurants. Walmart then banned the restaurant chain's famous mustard-based barbecue sauce during an NAACP-led boycott that Bessinger claimed cost him $20 million, according to The State newspaper.“It’s a cultural issue more than anything else and they just haven’t done enough,” said Bakari Sellers, a civil rights attorney and former Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor. “It just shows there’s a long way to go, to say the least.”—-James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845063,Idaho abortion law one reason hospital won't deliver babies,"A rural hospital in northern Idaho will stop delivering babies or providing other obstetrical care, citing a shifting legal climate in which recently enacted state laws could subject physicians to prosecution for providing abortions, among other reasons.Bonner General Health in Sandpoint will discontinue obstetrical services in mid-May. It also cited a decreasing number of deliveries and a loss of doctors among other factors in its decision.Those pregnant in the city of about 9,000 — with an average annual snowfall of about 60 inches (150 centimeters) — will most likely have to travel about 45 miles (70 kilometers) to Coeur d’Alene for care, or to hospitals farther away in Idaho, Washington and Montana.The decision to discontinue providing obstetrical services was emotional and difficult, hospital officials said in a news release.“We have made every effort to avoid eliminating these services,” Ford Elsaesser, Bonner General Health’s Board president, said in the release. “We hoped to be the exception, but our challenges are impossible to overcome now.”The numbers of deliveries had been declining for years with 265 births recorded at the hospital in 2022, the statement said. Births also have been decreasing nationally and older people have been moving into the Sandpoint area, officials said.Hospital officials said Idaho’s legal and political climate was partly to blame.After the United States Supreme Court stripped away constitutional protections for abortion last year, Idaho banned nearly all abortions in measures that subject physicians to prosecution for providing any abortions, even if needed to protect the health of a pregnant patient.“The Idaho Legislature continues to introduce and pass bills that criminalize physicians for medical care nationally recognized as the standard of care,” the hospital statement said. “Consequences for Idaho physicians providing the standard of care may include civil litigation and criminal prosecution, leading to jail time or fines.”Physicians could face felony charges and a medical license revocation for violating the law, which the Idaho Supreme Court determined earlier this year is constitutional. A federal judge has stopped Idaho from enforcing the ban in medical emergencies at Medicare-funded facilities.Highly respected, talented physicians are leaving, according to Bonner hospital officials, who said recruiting replacements would be extraordinarily difficult.Dr. Amelia Huntsberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Bonner General Hospital, moved to Sandpoint in 2012 to work in the area, according to a court filing last year supporting an effort to halt the abortion ban.She told the Idaho Capital Sun in Boise by email that she will leave the hospital and the state because of the abortion laws and because of the Idaho Legislature’s decision to discontinue the state’s maternal mortality review committee.“For rural patients in particular, delaying medical care until we can say an abortion is necessary to prevent death is dangerous,” she said in her court filing. “Patients will suffer pain, complications, and could die if physicians comply with Idaho law as written.”Huntsberger could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press and messages left for her with a hospital spokeswoman were not returned.Leandra Wright told KREM-TV that after having a baby at Bonner General Health in 2020 she had been looking forward to the birth of her son there in August.Wright, who lives in the nearby town of Sagle, said she learned about the hospital's decision from a Facebook post.“It’s nerve-wracking and stressful and my stomach just kind of drops,” Wright said. “Now I have to reestablish with another place and I have to drive to have my baby.”Officials at Kootenai Health in Coeur d'Alene said in a Facebook post that anyone who would have given birth at Bonner General Health can go to Kootenai Health's Family Birth Center, where about 2,200 babies are born each year.“Leadership from both hospitals are working together to identify any barriers to care for the patient population affected by this closure and are creating solutions to ensure a quality birth experience,” the post said.___Associated Press writer Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World

Kim Reynolds has signed a pair of laws restricting the bathrooms transgender students can use and banning gender-affirming medical care amid a flood of legislation nationwide targeting the trans community.Reynolds, a Republican, met with parents of transgender children to discuss the bills before signing them Wednesday, The Des Moines Register reported.“My heart breaks,” Reynolds told reporters. “I’ve sat down and met with them. It’s not easy. It’s not easy for me either. It’s not easy for our elected officials to make these decisions. So I just, I hope they know that.”Her endorsement of the laws, which took effect immediately, came just one day after Arkansas's governor signed a similar bathroom law. And a bill in Idaho is awaiting its governor's signature.In Iowa, the new law bars transgender students from using public school restrooms that align with their gender identity. Students will need parental consent for special accommodations like using a faculty or single-occupancy restroom.The law's enforcement relies on citizen complaint filings that authorities have three days to address. If the school doesn't act, that citizen could file a complaint with the attorney general who would investigate and possibly pursue legal action.Republicans argued these restrictions are intended to protect the privacy and safety of students who may feel uncomfortable sharing a facility with their transgender peers. Democrats countered that there have been no such issues and worry the law could cause additional harassment of transgender kids.Meanwhile, the new ban on gender-affirming care gives doctors six months to cease prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to their patients under 18. They are also prohibited from conducting gender-affirming surgeries, even though Iowa doctors say the surgeries are already rare.Advocates suggest families of transgender youth contact their doctors for referrals to out-of-state treatment, which is still allowed. In neighboring Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz has signed an executive order to protect access to gender-affirming care for minors.Iowa LGBTQ advocacy groups, civil rights organizations and the state’s teachers’ union have condemned both laws. The groups say the bills counter the “parental choice” mantra Republicans often tout and that they force schools to the frontline in policing student liberties, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported.“The Iowa Legislature and Gov. Reynolds have repeatedly targeted the most vulnerable students with rhetoric and legislation designed to suppress, out, target, ban, and censor Iowa’s LGBTQ+ student communities,” said Iowa State Education Association President Mike Beranek.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845067,Authorities: Suspect fatally shot during rescue of migrants,"HOUSTON (AP) — A hostage rescue that left a suspect fatally shot Thursday in Houston began days ago when three migrants were kidnapped from a vehicle in a neighboring county, according to a prosecutor.The three migrants had been traveling in a vehicle on Interstate 10 in the southern part of Waller County on March 18 when they were stopped by kidnappers and forced into another vehicle, said Sean Whittmore, a prosecutor with the Waller County District Attorney’s Office.It is believed the migrants' driver called 911 and informed the Waller County Sheriff's Office about the kidnapping, Whittmore said. The sheriff’s office later worked with the FBI, whose agents were involved in a shooting early Thursday morning in north Houston in which two people were rescued.The kidnappers demanded money from the family of at least one of the migrants and were paid, but then they asked for more, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person said that the kidnappers sent the family videos, which they shared with law enforcement, showing that the kidnappers were armed and the hostages were alive, including one of them beating one of the hostages, an older man.Gunfire broke out between FBI agents and the hostage-takers before daybreak Thursday, leading to one of the kidnappers being killed and another being arrested, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.Agents with the FBI’s hostage rescue team were rescuing the migrants when the shots broke out, said James Smith, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Houston office, during a brief Thursday news conference where he took no questions.Smith said one suspect was fatally shot while another suspect was taken into custody by the Harris County Sheriff's Office. Senior Deputy Thomas Gilliland, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said he could not provide any information on the suspect as that person was arrested by the FBI.Smith said agents rescued two people who were being held at a motel.After the news conference, Whittmore told The Associated Press it was still his understanding that three people had been kidnapped. He referred questions on the discrepancy to the FBI. Smith did not address the discrepancy during his news conference.Smith said no agents were injured and an FBI review team will investigate the shooting.""In the interest of protecting the integrity of the ongoing investigation, we cannot provide any more details at this time,"" Smith said.The FBI’s Houston office declined to comment on how they found the migrants, what led up to the shooting or how many agents were involved.The FBI said that following the shooting, there was no longer a threat to public safety.The kidnapped migrants had crossed into the U.S. illegally from Mexico, according to the person familiar with the case.Whittmore declined to comment on the migrants' immigration status, nationalities or whether they were being illegally transported at the time of their kidnapping.In an email, Tim Oberle, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman, declined to discuss the people's immigration status, referring all questions to the FBI.___Bleiberg reported from Dallas.___ Follow Juan A.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845068,House China panel turns focus to plight of Uyghurs,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two women who experienced life in Chinese “reeducation” camps for Uyghurs told lawmakers Thursday of lives under imprisonment and surveillance, rape and torture as a special House committee focused on countering China shined a light on human rights abuses in the country.Qelbinur Sidik, a member of China's ethnic Uzbek minority who was forced to teach Chinese in separate detention facilities for Uyghur men and women, told lawmakers of male Uyghur detainees held chained and shackled in cells so tiny they had to crawl out when authorities summoned them. “They were called by numbers for interrogations. And then you would hear horrible screaming sounds from torture,” she said.Innocent female Uyghur detainees were held by the thousands, heads shaved, in gray uniforms, Sidik said. Guards tortured the women by electric shocks and by gang rape, sometimes combining both.Reeducation camps intended to drain the Uyghur inmates of their language, religious beliefs and customs forced men and women into “11 hours of brainwashing lessons on a daily basis,” testified Gulbahar Haitiwaji, a Uyghur who spent more than two years in two reeducation camps and police stations.“Before eating, we have to praise them, say that we are grateful ... for China's Communist Party and we are grateful for (President) Xi Jinping,” Haitiwaji said. “And after, to finish eating, we have to praise them again.”Accused of “disorder” and detained with 30 to 40 people in a cell meant for nine, the Uyghur woman said, she and other female detainees were chained to their beds for 20 days at one point.Detention left her gaunt. Freed and sent to France thanks to a pressure campaign by her family there in 2019, she was given more food by Chinese authorities before her release, so her appearance would not speak of her mistreatment.In parting, Chinese officials warned Haitiwaji that “whatever I had witnessed in the concentration camp I should not talk about it,” she said. “If I do, they will retaliate against my family back home.”The U.S. and many other governments, the United Nations, and human rights groups accuse China of sweeping a million or more people from its Uyghur community and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups into detention camps, where many have said they were tortured, sexually assaulted, and forced to abandon their language and religion. China denies the accusations, which are based on evidence including interviews with survivors and photos and satellite images from Uyghur's home province of Xinjiang, a major hub for factories and farms in far western China.The accusations also include draconian birth control policies, all-encompassing restrictions on people’s movement and forced labor.“For a long time, some U.S. politicians have repeatedly used Xinjiang-related issues to stir up rumors and engage in political manipulation under the pretext of human rights, in an attempt to tarnish China’s image and curb China’s development,” said Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington.The Chinese government's actions in Xinjiang were about “countering violence, terrorism, radicalization and separatism,” the embassy spokesman insisted.The early focus on the plight of Uyghurs by the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party is designed to show the Chinese government's true nature, said Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the committee's Republican chairman.“They are the first-hand witnesses to the systemic, unimaginable brutality, witnesses to the attempted elimination of a people, a culture, a civilization,” Gallagher said Thursday.Between 1 million to 2 million members of China’s Uyghur minority have been held in mass internment centers, said Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the Xinjiang camps at the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. More exact estimates are not possible, given China’s concealment, Zenz said.Expert witnesses praised U.S. actions, including passage of a bill on forced labor and the levying of penalties on companies shown to be using the forced labor of Uyghurs. They denounced businesses and investors still profiting from suspect supply chains and possibly complicit Chinese enterprises there.Nury Turkel, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and a Uyghur-American, said crimes against humanity cannot be treated merely as an area of disagreement or an irritant in a bilateral relationship. “Genocide is defined as an international crime for a reason,” Turkel said. “Confronting is not an option,"" it's a necessity, he said.Chinese technology is enabling and facilitating total control and collective punishment of vulnerable populations, Turkel said.And Naomi Kikoler, director of the Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide, which is affiliated with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, urged the U.S. to start working with allies in a more comprehensive way to confront China on the abuses in Xinjiang.“The United States alone cannot prevent these crimes,” Kikoler said. “We must work with other governments, Uyghur civil society and the private sector to develop a swift, coordinated and global strategy to protect the Uyghur community. Thus far no such strategy exists.”The hearing comes following Chinese President Xi's trip to Russia to show support for President Vladimir Putin, underscoring just how badly U.S. relations with China have deteriorated.“What we're seeing here is increasingly a de facto alliance against America and our allies to try and undercut our interests,” Gallagher said.The formation of the special China committee this year was a top priority of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., but close to 150 Democrats also voted for the committee’s creation, and its work has been unusually bipartisan so far.Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the ranking Democrat, said more needs to be done to protect the Uyghurs and the new committee can help lead the way. “Make no mistake, CCP leaders are absolutely listening to us closely this evening,” he said, adding: “Let's make sure the CCP hears us loud and clear. Their genocide must end.”Haitiwaji, the ethnic Uyghur woman testifying before the committee, said she is speaking out because she feels an obligation to speak for those still languishing in detention centers. She called on lawmakers to follow the example of Canada, which has adopted a policy of accepting 10,000 Uyghur refugees from around the world.“Please rescue Uyghur and other Turkic refugees, like Canada has done,” she said. “Please stop American companies from continuing to be complicit in surveilling our people and profiting from their labor.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845069,Review: Rehabilitating Richard III in 'The Lost King',"Richard III didn't need a horse for his kingdom. He just needed Philippa Langley.Langley, a single mother and amateur historian living in Edinburgh, Scotland, became increasingly obsessed with the late English monarch, long portrayed as one of the great villains of history. In the supposedly hunchbacked king who was said to have killed his nephews, Langley and others suspected a centurieslong smear campaign.The long-held consensus on Richard III had been shaped by the Tudors, who killed Richard and assumed the throne. It's a narrative, of course, forever since solidified by Shakespeare's great play. For Richard and his sympathizers, it's been not just a winter of discontent but some 500 years. “Every tale condemns me for a villain,” the king says in “Richard III.”Except for “The Lost King.”Stephen Frears' new film, which opens in theaters Friday, dramatizes the true tale of Langley's dogged pursuit to unearth the true story of Richard as well as his actual, long-lost remains — a journey that leads, remarkably, to a parking lot in Leicester.It's the kind of comic, eminently British underdog story that Frears excels at. And with Sally Hawkins playing Langley as a woman undeterred by pompous academics and condescending naysayers, “The Lost King” makes for a charmingly droll tale of long-ago and not-so-long-ago reappraisal.“The Lost King” — which could make a good double feature with Al Pacino's “Looking for Richard” — reteams much of the creative team behind Frears' Oscar-nominated 2013 film “Philomena.” It's penned by Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope and based on Langley's memoir. Coogan also plays Langley's estranged husband, who maintains a mostly supportive relationship with her while sharing custody of their sons.Despite it being a far more modest mystery than “North by Northwest"" — playing out mostly at kitchen tables, bookstores and the pub meetings of the Richard III Society — Frears gives his modest film a few big-screen flourishes, including Saul Bass-like opening credits and a Bernard Herrmann-like score by Alexandre Desplat. There's an innocent man here, too. He just happens to be half a millennium old.But mostly, Frears sensibly sticks to capturing every quicksilver gesture of the brilliant Hawkins. When we meet Hawkins' Langley, she's reached a middle-age ebb. Troubled by chronic fatigue syndrome, Langley is passed over at work. Her marriage has fallen apart. She's withdrawing from life. But after attending a performance of “Richard III,"" she's captivated by the monarch and recognizes in him someone else who's been unfairly written off for their supposed disability. When she dives into researching Richard and eventually spearheads a dig in Leicester, Langley's crusade is a doubled one: to resurrect a marginalized monarch and to assert her own place in the world.Along the way, Langley is visited by Richard III himself, in the form of the actor (Harry Lloyd) who played him in the production that inspired her in the first place. These are muted scenes as far as apparitions go. I can't help wondering if here might have been Coogan's chance to play a war general and trot out his “Gentlemen to bed” line from “The Trip.” But as it is, Coogan is nicely low-key in “The Lost King” and gets one of the film's best monologues, lamenting both the demonizing and sanctifying of historical figures, or anybody. “We're all in the middle,” he says.“The Lost King” very contentedly resides in that middle with a protagonist who accomplishes something extraordinary despite being repeatedly told how ordinary she is. Frears, who has found humanity in royalty and nobility in nobodies, animates every scene with little comic touches of everyday life. Richard may be validated but there are bad guys, here, too. In the film's final third, University of Leicester officials descend to take the spotlight from Langley — a characterization the university has called unfair and inaccurate. The wheel goes round: If one villain leaves the stages, another must enter.“The Lost King,” an IFC Films release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for some strong language and brief suggestive references. Running time: 109 minutes. Three stars out of four.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845070,"Will Levis set for pro day, another chance to impress scouts","Will Levis had no hesitation about throwing at the NFL scouting combine because he wanted to “show off” his “canon” of an arm.He’ll get another opportunity to impress scouts at Kentucky’s pro day Friday.“It’s been a lot of fun, a lot of new experiences, a lot of new people in my life, and it’s just been very challenging, very difficult,” Levis said about the pre-draft process on the AP Pro Football Podcast. “Just in taking the challenges head on and remembering to have fun with it. This is going to be a time of my life that I’ll remember for the rest of my life. And I’ll remember that I did it the right way and I did what I needed to do to help live out my dream.”The 23-year-old, strong-armed quarterback is expected to be one of the top players selected in next month’s NFL draft. Levis, Ohio State’s C.J. Stroud, Alabama’s Bryce Young and Florida’s Anthony Richardson are the top four prospects at the most important position in football.They’ve already been scrutinized and analyzed by teams and their medical staffs. They’ve answered the same questions in numerous interviews with coaches and reporters, too. They’ll go through it again at their pro days and with visits to various clubs.Levis addressed one odd criticism about his muscular build. The chiseled, 6-foot-4, 232-pound Levis heard it mentioned that he might be too “jacked up” to play quarterback.“I just take it as a compliment,” Levis said. “I definitely know there’s nothing about my stature that limits my ability as a quarterback and as a passer. If anything, it empowers it. So, I think it’s just funny and people can say whatever they want to say.”Levis spent two seasons at Penn State, starting two games before he transferred to Kentucky. He was 17-7 as a starter for the Wildcats, completed 65.7% of his passes for 5,232 yards, 43 touchdowns with 23 interceptions.Three of the teams who own the top four picks — the Carolina Panthers, Houston Texans and Indianapolis Colts — need franchise quarterbacks. Two others — the Las Vegas Raiders and Atlanta Falcons — are among the top eight.Levis has no preferences.“All of my experiences (with teams) have been great,” he said. “I’d love to play for anyone who has interviewed me.”Levis, who earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from Penn State, recently participated in Cash App and Uninterrupted’s new NIL game show series, “The Road to NILion$,” hosted by former NBA player Richard Jefferson. Levis and three other star student-athletes are featured in the four-part series that aims to educate student-athletes and their parents about ways to help sustain their lives and finances beyond their playing careers.“It was a lot of fun. It was a campaign pretty much just centered around NIL, bringing awareness to the importance of paying attention to that and handling it with care,” Levis said. “It’s such a different kind of opportunity for these boys and girls that are going to be getting this money for the first time in their lives so as someone who’s been through that. ... To be there and give advice and have some fun was a great opportunity.”___Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/robmaaddi___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845072,Fed's unwanted ally in bid to tame inflation: Credit crunch,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve is getting some unwanted help in its drive to slow the U.S. economy and defeat the worst bout of inflation in four decades: a cutback in bank lending.The upheaval in the financial system that's followed the collapse of two major U.S. banks is raising the likelihood that lending standards will become sharply more restrictive. Fewer loans would mean less spending by consumers and businesses. That, in turn, would make it harder for companies to raise prices, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.At the same time, some economists worry that the slowdown might prove so severe as to send the economy sliding into a painful recession.On Wednesday, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate for the ninth time in just over a year. The central bank's policymakers are struggling with a persistently high inflation rate that has bedeviled American households and heightened the uncertainties overhanging the economy. At roughly 6%, U.S. inflation remains well below last year's peak yet is still far above the Fed's 2% annual target.But the Fed also signaled that it might be nearing the end of its rate hikes. In part, that is because a decline in bank lending could help the central bank achieve its overarching goal of slowing the economy and taming inflation.Speaking at a news conference Wednesday after the Fed's announcement, Chair Jerome Powell suggested that stricter lending standards, resulting in a pullback in loans, could have the same slowing effect on inflation that a Fed hike can.“It doesn’t all have to come from rate hikes,"" Powell said. “It can come from tighter credit conditions.”Similarly, after the European Central Bank raised its own benchmark rate by a substantial half percentage point last week, its president, Christine Lagarde, said the ECB was not locking itself into a preset plan for rate hikes and that future rate decisions would be made on a meeting-to-meeting basis.Anxieties surrounding the European banking system “might have an impact on demand and might actually do some of the work that might otherwise be done by monetary policy,” Lagarde said just days after two major U.S. banks collapsed and the Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse required a rescue by its rival UBS.Indeed, if Europe were to experience a credit crunch, analysts say, last week's ECB rate hike might be its last for a while.ECB officials have said their banks are “resilient” and have strong enough capital buffers and cash to cover whatever deposit withdrawals they face. European supervisors have applied international standards, requiring more ready cash on hand. By contrast, U.S. regulators exempted all but the very largest U.S. banks. Silicon Valley Bank was one of those exempted banks.And when loans are more expensive and harder to qualify for, consumers, who drive most of the U.S. economy's growth, are less likely to spend.Gregory Daco, chief economist at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon, said he thinks a significant credit squeeze would have “slightly more’’ of an economic impact than the quarter-point rate hike the Fed announced Wednesday.Edward Yardeni, an independent economist, said he would estimate that the impact would be even larger — the equivalent of a full percentage point hike by the Fed.Inflation could slow as a result, helping the central bank accomplish its long-standing goal. But the toll on economic growth could be substantial, too. Most economists have said they expect a recession to occur in the United States by the second half of this year. The main question is how severe it might be.Signs of a possible credit crunch in the United States had begun to emerge even before Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on March 10, raising worries about the stability of the financial system. In the face of rising rates and a deteriorating economic outlook, banks were already becoming stingier about approving loans to businesses at the end of 2022, according to a Fed survey of bank lending officers.And bank “commercial and industrial’’ loans to businesses dropped last month for the first time since September 2021, according to the Fed.Since then, the stress on banks has only grown. Silicon Valley Bank, which had been the nation's 16th biggest bank, failed after accumulating huge losses on its bond portfolio that led worried depositors to withdraw their money. Two days later, regulators shut down New York-based Signature Bank.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits up to $250,000, said that banks were sitting on $620 billion of paper losses in their investment portfolios at the end of last year. That was largely because higher interest rates had sharply reduced the value of their holdings in the bond market.Powell declared Wednesday that the banking system is “sound’’ and “resilient."" Yet fear remains that more depositors will pull their money out of all but the biggest American banks, intensifying pressure on financial institutions to lend less and conserve cash to meet withdrawals.Cash-short banks were still lining up this week to borrow money from the Fed. The Fed said Thursday that emergency lending to banks fell slightly in the past week – to $164 billion – but remained high.More than $110 billion in borrowing went through a longstanding program called the “discount window."" That was down from a record $153 billion the week before. Banks can borrow from the discount window for up to 90 days. In a normal week, they only borrow about $5 billion that way.The Fed also lent nearly $54 billion over the past week from a special lending facility it set up two days after the Silicon Bank failure. That was up from nearly $12 billion the week before — when the program was just getting set up.Banks with less than $250 billion in assets account for about half of all business and consumer lending and two-thirds of home mortgages, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.“Credit is really the grease that oils the U.S. economy and allows it to function and grow at a stable pace,’’ Daco said. “Without credit — or with slower credit growth — we’re likely to see businesses be more hesitant when it comes to investment decisions, when it comes to hiring decisions.”A tightening of bank credit, he said, “noticeably increases the risk of a recession.’’ ____AP Business Writer David McHugh in Frankfurt and AP Economics Writer Christopher Rugaber in Washington contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845073,Paraguay launches corruption probe of former president,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Paraguay’s attorney general launched a criminal investigation Thursday into U.S. allegations that a former Paraguayan president and the current vice president were involved in corruption and had ties to a terrorist group.Paraguay’s Attorney General Emiliano Rolón Fernández said a team would look into the U.S. allegations that former President Horacio Cartes and Vice President Hugo Velázquez engaged “in systemic corruption that has undermined democratic institutions in Paraguay.”Cartes and Velázquez have previously denied the allegations.The U.S. government, meanwhile, added three people to a list of Paraguayan officials it suspects of “significant corruption” and who would be barred from entry into the U.S. along with their family members. That list, started in 2019, now numbers nine officials.The U.S. in January issued explosive allegations that Cartes and Velázquez had ties to the Mideastern militant group Hezbollah, which Washington has designated a terrorist organization.The U.S. has long said the porous tri-border region that connects Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay is a hub for terrorism financing through money laundering of illicit activity. The U.S. has identified what it has described as members of Hezbollah who use front companies in the region to finance terror activities in the Middle East.The U.S. government also accused Cartes, who it has described as one of Paraguay’s wealthiest men, of widespread bribery of government officials and lawmakers.The latest officials added to the corruption list were the former director of the Paraguayan Civil Aviation Authority, Edgar Melgarejo as well as Jorge Bogarín, a member of a panel that disciplines judges and proseuctors, and Vicente Ferreira, a court clerk.The designations came after the State Department “received credible information” that Melgarejo “misappropriated public funds for personal gain during his tenure” and that Bogarín and Ferreira “interfered in judicial proceedings for their own personal benefit,” U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay Marc Ostfield said Thursday.“Acts of corruption like these undermine the institutions, processes, and people’s faith in the ability of the Paraguayan government to serve its people,” Ostfield said.Melgarejo told local media he was “surprised” by the designation and said he was unaware of the reasons behind his inclusion in the U.S. corruption list.The investigation by Paraguay’s chief prosecutor also will look into claims of corruption involving Juan Carlos Duarte, legal adviser for the entity that runs the bi-national Yacyretá Dam that is jointly owned by Paraguay and Argentina.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845074,Army Corps further delays decision on Great Lakes oil tunnel,"TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — A federal review of plans for a Great Lakes oil pipeline tunnel will take more than a year longer than originally planned, officials said Thursday, likely delaying completion of the project — if approved — until 2030 or later.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had intended to release a draft report later this year on how the proposed tunnel beneath Michigan's Straits of Mackinac would affect the environment. Enbridge Energy wants it to house a section of its Line 5 oil pipeline that crosses the bottom of the straits connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan.But under the new timeline, the report won't be issued until spring 2025. An approval decision would be expected in early 2026.The Corps' Detroit district office said it revised the schedule after receiving more than 17,000 public comments during an initial “scoping” period. The agency in December ordered Enbridge to redo measurement of wetlands that could be damaged from roads and structures for tunnel construction.“We greatly appreciate the meaningful input received throughout scoping and will use this information to shape studies and continuing consultations throughout development of our draft environmental impact statement,” District Commander Lt. Col. Brett Boyle said.The slowdown is a setback for a project that Enbridge originally planned to complete as early as next year, spending about $500 million. Mike Fernandez, a senior vice president of the Canadian company based in Calgary, Alberta, told The Associated Press the cost has risen but did not have a new estimate. The new timeline could push tunnel completion to 2030.""It's really, really disappointing,” Fernandez said in an interview ahead of the Corps' announcement, adding that the delay “flies in the face” of the Biden administration's pledge to quicken environmental permitting for infrastructure projects.“To borrow a phrase from the president when he was running, we want to build back better and sooner,” Fernandez said. “But right now, it appears that the federal government, or at least the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, has not gotten that message.”He said Enbridge remains committed to the tunnel for the underwater segment of Line 5 that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, environmental groups and Native American tribes want shut down.They contend the nearly 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) section is vulnerable to a rupture. Line 5 moves about 23 million gallons (87 million liters) of oil and natural gas liquids daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.Enbridge insists the nearly 70-year-old dual pipes are in good condition and monitored regularly. But the company agreed in 2018 with Whitmer's predecessor, Republican Rick Snyder, to drill a tunnel that would encase a new pipeline section in concrete.Many Line 5 critics also oppose the tunnel, even though Whitmer's Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy granted a permit. Opponents say it would risk water pollution and promote continued reliance on fossil fuels, which generate planet-warming gases.The Bay Mills Indian Community, based in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, says construction near the straits would harm sensitive wetlands, rare plants and cultural artifacts. Tribal aquatic biologist Brad Wesolek said he raised concerns with the Corps during a September visit to the area and was convinced Enbridge had undercounted wetlands that would be affected.“It's a very unique site,"" Wesolek said. “It has plants and animals that are only found in the Great Lakes.”The shorelines host a plant community called limestone bedrock glade, he said, which the Michigan Natural Features Inventory labels imperiled. The plants include the dwarf lake iris and Houghton's goldenrod, both listed as threatened.The proposed construction zone has resources of cultural significance, said Whitney Gravelle, the Bay Mills tribal president.“It's where we went historically for trade,” she said. “It's where we performed ceremony. It's where we would have our fishing camps and our hunting camps.”Enbridge says its onshore work would damage less than a half-acre of wetlands. But in a Dec. 21 letter, the Army Corps said its September inspection and other evidence showed more work was needed to confirm that.Fernandez said the Enbridge will conduct another survey but said the initial one was thorough.The tribe recently asked an administrative law judge to invalidate the state tunnel permit, saying it had relied on faulty wetlands information.“It needs to be redone or completely thrown away,” said Debbie Chizewer, an attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law firm representing Bay Mills.Enbridge also awaits a ruling from the Michigan Public Service Commission on its request to relocate the underwater pipeline segment. The commission last July requested more information about tunnel engineering and hazards.“As we continue to delve into this permit process, we're going to find more evidence of why this tunnel should not be built,” Gravelle said.Fernandez said impeding the tunnel project will only lengthen the time that oil flows through the straits pipes. The company has rejected Whitmer's order to shut down Line 5. Two lawsuits over its future are ongoing.Pro-tunnel groups criticized the Corps' new schedule.“Every month the project is delayed pushes this important economic and environmental investment down the line,” said Brian Calley, president and CEO of the Small Business Association of Michigan.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845075,NTSB: Crews failed to de-ice road before massive Texas crash,"DALLAS (AP) — The company responsible for maintaining a Texas interstate where 130 vehicles crashed in icy conditions two years ago, killing six and injuring dozens, failed to address the deteriorating road conditions, federal officials said Thursday.That portion of Interstate 35 West in Fort Worth was not treated with salt the morning of the Feb. 11, 2021, crash, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The NTSB said that the failure of North Tarrant Express Mobility Partners Segment 3 to address the conditions contributed to the crash, as did drivers' speeds.The NTSB said that because of the forecasted freezing rain and sleet, North Tarrant Express Mobility Partners Segment 3 had pretreated the southbound lanes of I-35W two days earlier with a liquid brine solution. But, the NTSB said, with precipitation and freezing temperatures continuing, crews checking the road about 45 minutes before the crash didn't recognize that the elevated portion of the interstate where the crash occurred needed additional de-icing treatment.Before the crash, the area experienced 36 consecutive hours of below-freezing temperatures. On the morning of the crash, crews had spot-treated sections of the interstate with salt but not the portion where the wreck happened, the NTSB said. The agency said that the crews visually checking the road 45 minutes before the wreck didn’t detect any moisture and applied no salt.North Tarrant Express Mobility Partners Segment 3 spokesman Robert Hinkle said, “Given the extraordinary circumstances, we are confident in the actions taken by the company.”Hinkle said the company had fully activated its winter storm program and coordinated with the Texas Department of Transportation on best practices, and he noted the pretreatment of the road two days before.Hinkle said that video footage showed “precipitation began mere minutes before the accident unfolded.” He also noted that hours earlier, dynamic signage began warning drivers of icy conditions and to drive with caution, while permanent signage warned drivers that bridges could ice in cold weather.The pileup that involved vehicles, trucks and semitrailers began just after 6 a.m. in the southbound toll lanes, which had a speed limit of 75 mph (120 kilometers per hour). Concrete barriers separated the southbound toll lanes from the northbound toll lanes and from the southbound general-use lanes.The NTSB said that the crash began when a vehicle struck the concrete barrier on the right side of the toll lanes. Other vehicles then began sliding, spinning and striking the barriers. Then a large truck crashed into some of those vehicles, and other vehicles that were unable to stop also became part of the massive crash that blocked all of the southbound toll lanes.The NTSB said that two of those killed were struck after getting out of their vehicles.Local officials said at the time that the road was so treacherous from ice that several first responders who responded to the crash ended up falling as they tried to help.The recommendations from the NTSB include the installation of variable speed limit signs, adding sensors to reduce response times to hazardous road conditions and providing training on how to better respond to winter weather conditions.In a statement Thursday, TxDOT said it appreciated the “careful and thorough work of the NTSB in looking into this tragic incident.""“TxDOT continuously improves its winter weather operations, and the department has begun to carefully review the analysis and recommendations,” the statement said.Three days after the crash, Texas’ power grid buckled when another winter storm dropped temperatures below freezing for days. Millions were left without electricity for days, leading to hundreds of deaths.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845076,Darren Waller's journey to NFL success included obstacles,"Darren Waller had just returned from his honeymoon with Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum when the Raiders traded him across the country to the New York Giants.Welcome to married life as a professional athlete.“It’s been a lot of processing, a little bit of anxiety. I’m a human being and it’s a lot of change, a lot of new chapters,” Waller said on the AP Pro Football Podcast. “But just seeing how supportive my wife is about this new opportunity, we’ll make it work on the marriage front for sure. Then meeting everybody with the Giants organization and just seeing how they do things and the excitement they had to have me there, I think it’s going to be a great opportunity. So I’m excited.”A Pro Bowl tight end in 2020, the 30-year-old Waller has missed 14 games because of injuries over the past two seasons. He had 107 catches for 1,196 yards and nine touchdowns in 2020 after a breakout season in 2019 when he had 90 receptions for 1,145 yards and three TDs.The Giants are counting on Waller to produce the way he did when he was healthy to give quarterback Daniel Jones a primary option.“Daniel actually came by the facility the day I was up there just to meet me, and I thought that was pretty cool of him doing that,” Waller said. “He seems like a good guy, great head on his shoulders. He already hit me up about trying to get some work in before we report on April 17 for the offseason program. So I’m excited to get to know him. I feel like our personalities are kind of similar in a way, a little bit introverted, but once you kind of get close to people, your personality comes out more. So I’m excited to work with him.”Waller’s journey to NFL stardom has been complicated. He was a wide receiver at Georgia Tech and was selected by the Ravens in the sixth round of the 2015 NFL draft.Waller spent most of his rookie season on injured reserve, was suspended four games in 2016 and received a full suspension for 2017 for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. He fought hard to overcome his addiction and thrived in Jon Gruden’s offense after the Raiders signed him off Baltimore's practice squad in 2018.Throughout his career, Waller has dealt with plenty of criticism. Recently, former NFL general manager Michael Lombardi blasted Waller’s work ethic. Lombardi’s two sons, Mick and Matt, are assistants on Raiders coach Josh McDaniels’ staff.“This is about ‘I’m getting ready to pay you $11 million, we redid your contract and on the bye week, instead of rehabbing, you went home for four days and accrued the fines. On the bye week, you went home and just didn’t talk to anybody. Just went home and left a message saying ‘hey, fine me. I don’t care. I’m going to Southern California,” Lombardi said on his podcast.Waller explained his absence from the facility to the AP.“That was when I proposed to Kelsey,” Waller said. “I was going there and didn’t really want to share with anyone. ... because you’re mandated to get off Thursday through Sunday (during bye weeks). ... I wanted to keep it ultimately private.”Waller was back in California this week taking part in NFL Career Tours. Waller, Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf and 17 other current and former players spent Wednesday at Interscope Geffen A&M Records getting a comprehensive introduction to the business of music.Waller released an album last month called “Walking Miracle.” The project is made up of 13 tracks, nine of which he produced himself.“It’s been really cool learning from different people in a lot of different roles with Interscope and picking their brains on how they try to bring artists’ vision to life because I’m a creator myself,” Waller said.“I record, I make beats. ... I just love creating so much and whatever comes with it, I don’t need to be a megastar in music. I just love to do it like any other hobby somebody else may have. It’s what I love to do in my free time, and I always devote all I can to football and then just enjoy music because I love to do it.”___Follow Rob Maaddi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/robmaaddi___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845077,Russian officials seek another opposition activist's arrest,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian court on Thursday issued an order to arrest an opposition activist on charges of disparaging the military, and auhorities declared other activists and bloggers “foreign agents” amid efforts to muzzle criticism of Russia's action in Ukraine.Moscow’s Basmanny District Court ordered the arrest of Maxim Katz, an opposition activist and blogger who has left Russia. He is accused of spreading false information about the Russian military, charges that carry a prison sentence of up to 10 years.Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine last February, Russian lawmakers approved legislation outlawing the disparagement of the Russian military or the spread of “false information” about what the Kremlin calls “the special military operation” in Ukraine.Courts across the country have increasingly handed out prison terms to critics of Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.They included a prominent opposition politician, Ilya Yashin, who was sentenced to 8½ years in prison on charges of discrediting the military, and another top opposition figure, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who has been jailed on the same charges and is now facing trial.Katz was declared a “foreign agent” last year, a designation that brings additional government scrutiny and carries strong pejorative connotations. After he left the country, the authorities put him on a wanted list last fall.The authorities have used the label to raise pressure on independent media and nongovernmental organizations.On Thursday, the Justice Ministry further expanded the list of “foreign agents,"" adding leading human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov and popular blogger Ilya Varlamov, among others.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845081,Track stymies Russian path to Olympics due to war in Ukraine,"Track and field leaders signaled Thursday that it will be nearly impossible for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in that sport at the Paris Olympics next year if the war in Ukraine continues.The World Athletics Council kept its ban on Russian athletes in international events in place “for the foreseeable future,"" a move that goes directly against the International Olympic Committee's efforts to find a way for Russian athletes to compete as neutrals in upcoming events.World Athletics will form a working group to determine under what conditions Russians might return to international competition, but for now, there is no apparent pathway.“The death and destruction we have seen in Ukraine over the past year, including the deaths of some 185 athletes, have only hardened my resolve on this matter,” said World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, who has been the most outspoken sports leader on the topic since Russia's invasion.The move came on the same day World Athletics finally lifted a seven-year suspension of Russia's track federation for a doping scandal that dates back a decade.Though the federation is back in good standing so long as it adheres to nearly three dozen “special conditions,” the reinstatement did nothing to change the reality that Russians will not be allowed at track meets for at least several months, if not years.Coe said he knows this policy will not be popular at the IOC meetings he is attending next week.“There will be plenty of opportunities” to discuss the topic, Coe said. “But I think you can probably conclude the IOC is not in any doubt about where I sit on that issue.”Russian reaction to the World Athletics' decision was predictably outraged. Sports minister Oleg Matytsin referenced a speech IOC President Thomas Bach gave this week reiterating his position.“We consider these politicized restrictions unacceptable,” Matytsin said. ""The Olympic Games must remain neutral, and international federations must give all of the strongest athletes in their sport the right to compete.”Coe said decisions coming out of the doping scandal have left it up to international sports federations (IFs) to determine eligibility for athletes at the Olympics. World Athletics took the toughest stance of all sports when they were allowing Russians back into the games. During the seven-year ban of the Russian track federation, only a handful of athletes were ever allowed into world and Olympic track competitions.The sport is taking the same tact regarding the war. While some IFs are following the IOC's lead and trying to find ways for Russians who meet certain, still-unspecified criteria regarding neutrality to qualify for Paris — namely by bypassing events in Europe, where Russia was a traditional competitor, and heading to qualifiers in Asia — Coe said Russians were banned from qualifying events in track.By itself, that's not a huge problem — most spots in track and field are allocated at Olympic trials in individual countries — but ultimately, World Athletics is expected to be able to control the list of entrants for this year's worlds in Hungary and next year's Olympics in France.“There's no ambiguity about it,” Coe said. “The primacy for the decision around eligibility rests with the international federation.”All of this pushed what should have been big news — the official end of Russia's role as a doping pariah — down a notch. Barring a drastic shift, either in the war or the World Athletics policy, the country is still not expected to be a presence at the track meet in Paris.“On the basis of what we know now, we're very clear that this is not the right moment,” Coe said.___AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845082,"Missouri Senate OKs limits on transgender treatments, sports","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri youths no longer could receive gender-affirming treatments under a bill passed Thursday by the state Senate.The bill, which now heads to the GOP-led House for consideration, would prohibit doctors from providing puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries to minors for the next four years. Minors already receiving treatment and intersex youths would be exempt from the ban.The bill also would ban the federal low-income health care program Medicaid from paying for gender-affirming treatments for adults and prohibit gender-affirming surgeries for Missouri prisoners and inmates.“Children need love, compassion and counseling, not a doctor’s prescription to cut off their breasts or genitals,"" Sen. Denny Hoskins said before he joined 23 other Republicans in voting for the measure. Eight Democrats voted against it.Under clinical guidelines, children diagnosed with gender dysphoria and who receive counseling and guidance about transgender medical treatment are first offered medication that temporarily blocks puberty. After puberty blockers, kids can either go through puberty while still identifying as the opposite sex or begin hormone treatment to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. Transgender surgeries are another option, though usually for older teens and young adults.Democratic Sen. Greg Razer, the only openly gay senator in the state, called the Missouri bill an example of government overreach into private health care and warned colleagues that they will regret supporting it.“The day will come, and it will come sooner rather than later, that you regret this vote,” Razer said. “You will look back and realize it was the wrong vote and the wrong thing to do, just like so many of you regret the decisions you’ve made to discriminate against the LGBT community for decades.”The measure reflects a national push led by Republicans to restrict transgender health care, drag shows, bathroom access and how LGBTQ topics are discussed in schools.Missouri senators also sent on Thursday the House legislation that would require transgender girls and women to compete on boys’ and men’s K-12 and collegiate sports teams. Schools that violate the rule would lose all state funding.If the Missouri bill on transgender health care becomes law, doctors who perform a gender-affirming surgery or otherwise prescribe “cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs” to minors could have their medical licenses revoked and face potential lawsuits from their patients until patients reach age 36.The Missouri bill banning certain health care treatments is scheduled to take effect Aug. 28 if passed.A rule proposed by Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey to require an 18-month waiting period for gender-affirming treatments for minors could act as a stopgap. Bailey has not yet officially filed the rule after announcing plans to do so Monday.Razer warned that enacting the Missouri bill will drive transgender people and their families to leave the state.“If someone is disappointed in Missouri because they can’t harm kids here, we are better if they are gone,"" Republican Sen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845083,"A fish can sense another's fear, a study shows","WASHINGTON (AP) — Our capacity to care about others may have very, very ancient origins, a new study suggests.It might have been deep-rooted in prehistoric animals that lived millions of years ago, before fish and mammals like us diverged on the tree of life, according to researchers who published their study Thursday in the journal Science.“Some of the mechanisms that underlie our ability to experience fear, or fall in and out of love, are clearly very ancient pathways,” said Hans Hofmann, an evolutionary neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the research.Scientists are usually reluctant to attribute humanlike feelings to animals. But it’s generally accepted that many animals have moods, including fish.The new study shows that fish can detect fear in other fish, and then become afraid too – and that this ability is regulated by oxytocin, the same brain chemical that underlies the capacity for empathy in humans.The researchers demonstrated this by deleting genes linked to producing and absorbing oxytocin in the brains of zebrafish, a small tropical fish often used for research. Those fish were then essentially antisocial – they failed to detect or change their behavior when other fish were anxious.But when some of the altered fish received oxytocin injections, their ability to sense and mirror the feelings of other fish was restored — what scientists call “emotional contagion.”“They respond to other individuals being frightened. In that regard, they behave just like us,"" said University of Calgary neuroscientist Ibukun Akinrinade, a co-author of the study.The study also showed that zebrafish will pay more attention to fish that have previously been stressed out – a behavior the researchers likened to consoling them.Previous research has shown that oxytocin plays a similar role in transmitting fear in mice.The new research illustrates ""the ancestral role"" of oxytocin in transmitting emotion, said Rui Oliveira, a behavioral biologist at Portugal's Gulbenkian Institute of Science and a study co-author.This brain processing ""may have already been in place around 450 million years ago, when you and me and these little fish last had a common ancestor,” explained Hofmann.Oxytocin is sometimes thought of as a “love” hormone, but Hofmann said it’s actually more like “a thermostat that determines what is socially salient in a particular situation – activating neural circuits that may make you run from danger, or engage in courtship behavior.”That could be fundamental to the survival of many animals, especially those who live in groups, said Stony Brook University ecologist Carl Safina, who was not involved in the study.“The most basic form of empathy is contagious fear – that’s a very valuable thing to have to stay alive, if any member of your group spots a predator or some other danger.”—-Follow Christina Larson on Twitter at @larsonchristina.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.Elliott, which formerly owned Italian club AC Milan, is also prepared to offer capital or finance to other bidders.Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus has also declared his interest in United. He said he plans to fund 50% of the purchase and ask fans to provide the rest of the money in a shared ownership scheme.___James Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845086,Rioter charged in Pelosi laptop theft sentenced to prison,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Pennsylvania woman linked to a far-right extremist movement was sentenced on Thursday to three years in prison for storming the U.S. Capitol, where she invaded then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office with other rioters.Riley June Williams, 23, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was charged but not convicted of helping steal a laptop from Pelosi’s office suite during the riot on Jan. 6, 2021.A federal jury convicted Williams in November of six charges, including a felony count of civil disorder, after a two-week trial. But it deadlocked on two other counts, including “aiding and abetting"" the laptop's theft.Jurors also deadlocked on a charge of obstructing an official proceeding, the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress for certifying President Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory. Then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress evacuated the House and Senate chambers when rioters attacked the Capitol.Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to sentence Williams to seven years and three months in prison.“Everywhere she went, Williams acted as an accelerant, exacerbating the mayhem. Where others turned back, she pushed forward,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.Defense lawyers requested a term of imprisonment of one year and one day for Williams, who was 22 in January 2021.“In some respects, she is starkly different from the average January 6th defendant – particularly given her youth and that she is a female,” they wrote. “In other ways she is similar to many of other January 6th defendants with no prior criminal record, that were caught up with the mob that day, acting on impulse and without thought to the consequences of their actions.”Jackson also sentenced Williams to three years of supervised release after her prison term and ordered her to pay $2,000 in restitution, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia.Williams was an ardent supporter of the white nationalist “Groyper” movement led by internet personality Nick Fuentes, according to prosecutors. They said Williams was “obsessed"" with Fuentes and fixated on baseless claims — amplified by Fuentes — that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.Williams' attorneys argued that her political beliefs shouldn't be a factor in her sentencing. They said the First Amendment protects her interest in Fuentes and his “Groyper Army” of followers.Fuentes has used his online platform to spew antisemitic and white supremacist rhetoric. In November, former President Trump dined at his Mar-a-Lago club with Fuentes and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, who is now known as Ye.Other Fuentes followers have been charged with Jan. 6-related crimes, including former UCLA student Christian Secor, who waved a flag associated with Fuentes’ movement when he entered the Capitol. Secor was sentenced last year to three years and six months in prison.Williams wore a green “I’m with Groyper” T-shirt when she traveled to Washington, D.C., with her father and his friends on Jan. 6. They attended Trump's “Stop the Steal” rally before heading to the Capitol. Williams entered the building through the Senate Wing Door two minutes after other rioters breached the entrance.Williams used men wearing helmets and body armor like a “human battering ram,” pushing them forward to break through police lines inside the Capitol, prosecutors said. Entering Pelosi's main conference room, she stole a gavel and encouraged another rioter to take a laptop from atop a table, according to prosecutors.“As the other rioter later manipulated the laptop and its cords, Williams filmed the theft that she had just commanded and encouraged, and further instructed the rioter, 'Dude, put on gloves!'” prosecutors wrote.Williams then went to the Rotunda, where she shouted insults at police and urged other rioters to join her in pushing against officers.Williams spent roughly 90 minutes in the Capitol. After leaving, she climbed on the roof of a parked police car.Williams destroyed evidence before her arrest, deleting her social media accounts, resetting her iPhone and using software to wipe her computer, according to prosecutors.Williams bragged online that she stole Pelosi’s gavel, laptop and hard drives and that she “gave the electronic devices, or attempted to give them, to unspecified Russian individuals,” prosecutors said in a June 2022 court filing.“To date, neither the laptop nor the gavel has been recovered,” they added.A witness described as a former romantic partner of Williams told the FBI that she intended to send the stolen laptop or hard drive to a friend in Russia who planned to sell it to Russia’s foreign intelligence service. But the witness said Williams kept the device or destroyed it when the transfer fell through, according to the FBI.When the FBI questioned her, Williams denied stealing the laptop. She accused an ex-boyfriend of fabricating the allegation.Williams was taken into custody after the jury convicted her on Nov. 21.Approximately 1,000 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. More than 400 have been sentenced, with over half of them receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from seven days to 10 years.",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Kim English is just 34 years old, but has already moved around a lot in his coaching career, serving as an assistant at three schools over six years before landing his first head coaching job at George Mason in 2021.It was going to take a special opportunity for him to pack up and move again.“Every place I’ve been, I’ve wanted to stay there forever. I really want to stay at a place for a long time,"" English said Thursday. ""I’m sick of moving,”He believes he has found that place in Providence.English was named the Friars' new basketball coach on Thursday, ending a fast search by first-year Providence athletic director Steve Napolillo that was created after Ed Cooley left to take the job at Big East rival Georgetown.English becomes the 16th coach in school history. Cooley resigned on Monday following 12 seasons. He complied a 242-153 record with the Friars that included seven appearances, but just three March Madness victories.English was 34-29 in two seasons at George Mason, leading the Patriots to a 20-13 record this past season. It was the first time the school reached the 20-win milestone since 2016-17.George Mason president Gregory Washington said it would begin a national search to replace English.In English, the Friars get a hungry, young coach who has built his reputation on recruiting. He said his secret sauce finding players is simple.""You work at it. You do it every day. You’re relentless,"" English said.He played college basketball at Missouri and was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round in 2012. But his NBA tenure was short and he was waived in 2013. He had a brief stint with the Chicago Bulls in 2014 and also played two years professionally overseas.English began his coaching career as an assistant under Frank Haith at Tulsa in 2015 and spent two seasons there before being hired by Tad Boyle in 2017 as an assistant coach at Colorado. In 2019, former Friars coach Rick Barnes brought English to Tennessee as an assistant coach and he stayed until being hired by George MasonHe feels as if he has found a kindred spirit in Napolillo, who sold him on the passion the administration and community have for the Friars' basketball program.The intel he got about Providence and Napolillo aligned with what he observed when he got the chance to meet him.“His passion, his fire, his love for Providence basketball really speaks to me. It really spoke to me what he was looking for,” English said. ""As a first-year athletic director to be in this situation and to go at it and not just do what other people may have been comfortable with. ... That's what you want in a partnership.”English also said he’s impressed by facilities at Providence that he said are among the best he’s seen.Napolillo said the reason he was able to move so quickly on the hire was because he heeded the advice of his mentors who told him to always be prepared to have to fill a coaching vacancy.“You always need to have names in a drawer for any coaching situation. You never know what’s going to happen,” he said. ”This year, as noise kept growing and growing, I had a list in my drawer.""That list also included a Sports Illustrated article he saved from last year that listed some rising coaches. He can't recall why, but for some reason he highlighted English's name in the story.English has already started working and began recruiting not long after signing his contract on Wednesday night, he said.He also confirmed that Dennis Felton, one of his assistants at George Mason, will join him at Providence. Felton served as a Friars assistant under Barnes from 1992 to 1994.In a Big East that is stacked from top to bottom with coaching talent, English feels as if the pieces are in place to build something special.“I've had no reason to take a bad job,"" English said. “I was a 20-something-year-old assistant in the SEC. I didn't have to rush. If I'm going to have interest in it, it's going to be really good.”For him, that translated into being in a position to bring the Friars a national championship.“If you want to win the big trophy, you've got to be in the big dance,” English said. “At the mid-major level it's getting increasing harder to get to the big dance. This gives us an opportunity. If we are competing for Big East championships, we're going to be in the show.”___March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

Governors in Mississippi, Utah and South Dakota have signed similar bills.“I appreciate the many hours of respectful debate and deliberation by members of the General Assembly that resulted in final passage of this bill,” Kemp said in a statement. “As Georgians, parents and elected leaders, it is our highest responsibility to safeguard the bright, promising future of our kids — and SB 140 takes an important step in fulfilling that mission.”Opponents say they believe the new law is an unconstitutional infringement on parents' rights. The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia said it would “use every legal means at our disposal” to overturn the law shortly after Kemp signed it. Judges have — at least temporarily — blocked laws limiting gender-affirming treatment of transgender youth in Arkansas and Alabama.""It’s disturbing how quickly the governor acts to sign bills that take away people’s rights,” ACLU of Georgia Executive Director Andrea Young said in a statement.Doctors would still be able to prescribe medicines to block puberty under the Georgia law, which takes effect July 1. It also says that minors who are already receiving hormone therapy will be allowed to continue.Supporters say the law's restrictions prevent children from making decisions they might later regret. Cole Muzio, president of the conservative Christian group Frontline Policy Action, had pushed for even stronger prohibitions. While he applauded Kemp signing the measure, he also called it “one of the weakest in the country,"" promising more efforts at restrictions.“Gov. Kemp has never been afraid to protect children and we appreciate his continued commitment to standing against radical and harmful agendas,” Muzio said in a statement.But opponents say the measure is founded on disinformation and a desire to open a new front in the culture war to please conservative Republican voters, arguing it attacks vulnerable children and intrudes on private medical decisions.Critics said the measure will require physicians to violate medical standards of care and that Republicans had abandoned their previous support for parents' rights to make choices.“This legislation is a clear attack on the rights of transgender children, their parents, and the medical community in Georgia as a whole,” Jeff Graham, the executive director of LGBTQ-rights group Equality Georgia, said in a statement. “Parents, working in collaboration with their medical teams and adhering to standards of care, should be able to make decisions regarding their child’s healthcare.”The bill was amended to remove a clause that specifically shielded physicians from criminal and civil liability. That change was pushed for by conservative groups that want people to be able to sue their doctor if they later regret their treatment, although it’s unclear how large that group might be.Transgender youth and parents heavily lobbied against the bill in recent weeks, warning lawmakers were further marginalizing a group already prone to taking their own lives at disturbingly high rates.Republicans denied they wish anyone harm, saying they had children's best interest at heart and wanted people to be able to obtain counseling.___Follow Jeff Amy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/jeffamy.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845090,Water contamination in Oregon could prompt EPA to step in,"BOARDMAN, Ore. (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency is urging Oregon to clean up water contamination from nitrates in the eastern part of the state, warning it could step in under the Safe Drinking Water Act in the absence of sufficient local action.It's been three decades since state agencies first noted high levels of nitrate contamination in the groundwater in Morrow and Umatilla counties, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported, and residents have long complained that the pollution is negatively impacting their health.Environmental groups say that large-scale livestock and agriculture operations are largely to blame for the contamination. The two counties have a combined population of more than 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.EPA Region 10 Administrator Casey Sixkiller met with dozens of residents, representatives of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the local nonprofit Oregon Rural Action in Boardman, Oregon, on Monday to hear firsthand how the contamination is affecting people's lives. It was the first time a regional administrator from the federal agency visited the region over nitrate pollution concerns, according to OPB.“We’ll determine whether EPA needs to step in and take any further action,” EPA Region 10 spokesperson Bill Dunbar said.Nitrate levels exceeding 10 milligrams per liter can cause serious health risks if consumed, according to the EPA. In some cases, home tests by area residents have shown nitrates at four to five times that level.High levels of nitrates can lead to increased heart rate, headaches, stomach cramps and vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lists fertilizers, septic systems, animal feedlots and industrial waste as common sources of nitrate pollution.The state and a local committee have worked on voluntary measures to reduce the contamination. But nitrate levels in the area’s main source of drinking water have steadily increased and no mandatory action has been taken to begin cleanup, OPB reported.Residents are calling for stronger action and Oregon Rural Action is treating the situation as an emergency.""We’re going to keep making sure that it’s not comfortable for elected officials and people who have more power than these rural folks,” said Nella Parks, senior organizer for the group. “It’s not gonna be comfortable for them to continue ignoring these people’s situations.”Oregon Rural Action is part of a coalition of environmental groups that petitioned the EPA in 2020 to request it take emergency action on the issue.The EPA has asked the state to conduct more well testing in order to better understand the source and extent of the contamination and whose wells are affected.The Oregon Health Authority announced Wednesday that it will provide vouchers through May to cover testing costs for private well owners in Morrow and Umatilla counties. To be eligible for the free testing, residents must use the well water for drinking, bathing, cooking or washing dishes.So far, the health agency has distributed 38 vouchers in Morrow County and one in Umatilla County, according to OPB. It said it will continue to work closely with both counties to test more wells and use the results to identify which households need treatment or free drinking water.",2023/03/24,,World

It was not immediately clear how many of the officers listed were undercover.Stop LAPD Spying Coalition opposes police intelligence-gathering and says the database should be used for “countersurveillance.”“You can use it to identify officers who are causing harm in your community” the group wrote. “Police have vast information about all of us at their fingertips, yet they move in secrecy.”The department's release of the undercover officers' names and photographs was inadvertent, the Times reported. While the city attorney's office determined the agency was legally required to turn over the records under California law, exemptions are often made for safety or investigative reasons.“We will look to what steps or added steps can be taken to safeguard the personal identifiers of our membership,” Moore said Tuesday.Police officials say the database's photos pose safety risks to officers who are currently undercover, as well as those who might work in that capacity in the future.The Knock LA reporter, Ben Camacho, tweeted that he filed the records request as well as a lawsuit last year to get the photographs. The department had not previously raised the issue of officer safety in arguing against their release, he said.“The only officers they are excluding from disclosure are undercover officers, which is expected,” a deputy city attorney wrote in a 2022 email to Camacho's attorney, according to a screenshot the journalist posted online.The department's inspector general launched the investigation into Moore and constitutional policing director Liz Rhodes after the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file officers, filed a misconduct complaint against them Monday.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845092,Scientists say mine plan claiming no swamp harm has errors,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Scientists for the federal government say documents that Georgia state regulators relied upon to conclude a proposed mine won't harm the nearby Okefenokee Swamp and its vast wildlife refuge contain technical errors and “critical shortcomings” that render them unreliable.Since 2019, Twin Pine Minerals has been seeking permits to mine titanium less than 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, the largest refuge east of the Mississippi River. Scientists have warned that mining near the swamp's bowl-like rim could irreparably harm the swamp's ability to hold water and increasing the frequency of withering droughts.The Georgia Environmental Protection Division moved the project a big step forward in January by releasing a draft plan for how Twin Pines would conduct mining operations and mitigate any environmental damage. The agency said its own analysis “concluded that water level in the swamp will be minimally impacted.”In response, hydrologists for the National Park Service reviewed computer modeling results that Twin Pines had submitted to state regulators with its mining application. In a 28-page analysis sent to regulators last week, the scientists said several flaws cast doubt on regulators' conclusions.“Our analysis revealed a series of critical shortcomings in the modeling used for prediction of impacts"" to the Okefenokee refuge, Park Service hydrologists Kiren Bahm and Rajendra Paudel wrote.The scientists said Twin Pines consultants failed to look at the combined impact on the Okefenokee of groundwater gushing into mining pits, the pumping of additional water from an aquifer and disruption in soil layers at the swamp’s edge. Instead, they wrote, those factors were measured separately.The hydrologists also said computer models didn’t account for seasonal and year-to-year variations in the Okefenokee’s water levels, overlooking potential effects that diverting water from the swamp could have during dry periods when it's vulnerable to drought.Other problems cited by the scientists included mathematical errors in five data tables in Twin Pines' report.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the Okefenokee refuge, said in a March 17 letter to Georgia regulators that because the problems are so significant, the agency will make a renewed push for federal oversight of the proposed mine.The Army Corps of Engineers relinquished any permitting authority over the Twin Pines project following a rollback of environmental regulations under President Donald Trump. The Fish and Wildlife Service asked Georgia regulators to postpone further decisions on the mine until the Army Corps decides whether to reassert jurisdiction.The Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge covers nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) in southeast Georgia and is home to alligators, bald eagles and other protected species. The swamp’s wildlife, cypress forests and flooded prairies draw roughly 600,000 visitors each year, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.The Georgia Environmental Protection Division is working on a final mining plan for Twin Pines after a 60-day comment period on the project ended Monday. The mining plan must be finished for the agency to start drafting permits.The division received more than 77,400 comments from concerned citizens, local officials, government agencies, conservation groups and others, said spokeswoman Sara Lips, in addition to more than 26,800 comments sent previously.“EPD will not be responding to inquiries on technical questions until after staff has had a chance to evaluate all technical comments received,” Lips said in an email Thursday.Steve Ingle, president of Twin Pines, has insisted his company can mine safely on 773 acres (312 hectares) outside the swamp without harming it. He said his company will send regulators a response to the federal agencies' critiques.“With regard to specific issues, it is clear that some comments are based on incorrect or incomplete information, but in other cases we simply disagree and will explain why,” Ingle said in a statement.The federal scientists aren't the only ones to say Twin Pines and Georgia regulators used faulty methods to consider potential environmental impacts to the swamp.C. Rhett Jackson, a University of Georgia hydrologist, sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Division signed by 11 fellow hydrologists from Southern universities saying regulators used the wrong river gauge to evaluate potential decreases in the swamp's water levels.The St. Marys River flows from the swamp's southeast corner and forms the Georgia-Florida state line. The U.S. Geological Survey maintains a gauge for monitoring the river's flows just outside the swamp. But Georgia regulators instead used a river gauge roughly 15 miles (24 kilometers) farther downstream, where the river is far wider and deeper.Jackson said in a Feb. 26 letter that using the more distant river gauge ""is incorrect and unsupportable, and its consequent conclusion that the mine will have no impact on the swamp is also incorrect.”Wei Zeng, a hydrologist for the state environmental division, said in a memo last year that the river gauge regulators used has a longer, more complete history of collected data and has been shown to be more accurate during droughts.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845093,New Starbucks CEO plans to work in stores monthly,"Starbucks’ new CEO Laxman Narasimhan says he plans to work a half-day shift once a month in one of the company’s stores in an effort to stay close to its culture and customers.Narasimhan, who took the reins as CEO earlier this week, said in a letter to Starbucks’ employees Thursday that he also expects the company’s leadership team to be connected and engaged in stores.“While our performance is strong, our health needs to be stronger,” Narasimhan wrote in the letter. “We must care for the artists and the theater in the front of our stores and the factory in the back.”Having a CEO work in stores is new for Seattle-based Starbucks, but not unprecedented among big companies. DoorDash CEO Tony Xu and his executive team make DoorDash deliveries once a month, for example.Narasimhan, 55, issued the letter just prior to the company’s annual meeting, which was held virtually. The former PepsiCo executive has spent the last six months immersing himself in Starbucks, earning his barista certification as well as visiting stores, farms and manufacturing centers across the world.""I felt it was very important to start as a barista. I wanted to really understand what they do and how they do it,"" Narasimhan said in comments emailed to The Associated Press. ""I’ve loved and learned so much about the retail experience from working in our stores, and can now make an excellent French press if I do say so myself.""Narasimhan said his first priority is addressing some of the company's limitations. A reinvention plan announced last fall is updating equipment and layouts to make stores more efficient and increasing employee retention with better pay and benefits, he said. The average U.S. Starbucks worker now makes $17.50 per hour.Narasimhan said he would like to see Starbucks evolve into a more global company, be less wasteful and move with greater speed.""My immersion provided me with exposure to every aspect of Starbucks business, culture, and brand,"" he said. “Together, we have acknowledged the opportunity for a refounding of Starbucks.”Narasimhan succeeds longtime Starbucks leader Howard Schultz, who came out of retirement last spring to serve as interim CEO while the company searched for a new chief executive. Schultz will remain on the company’s board.Some investors were unhappy with that move, saying Starbucks should have had a more robust succession plan in place when former CEO Kevin Johnson retired last April. Among the shareholder proposals investors voted on Thursday was one that would require Starbucks' board to begin succession planning at least three years before an expected transition.Another shareholder proposal would require Starbucks to commission a third-party assessment of its commitment to workers' collective-bargaining rights. That proposal came amid an ongoing unionization movement that Starbucks opposes.At least 293 of Starbucks' 9,000 company-owned U.S. stores have voted to unionize since late 2021. Workers have begun bargaining with the company but so far no store has reached agreement on a new contract.The process has been contentious. Earlier this month, a federal labor judge found that the company violated labor laws “hundreds of times” during a unionization campaign in Buffalo, New York. The company is appealing.On Wednesday, workers at more than 100 U.S. Starbucks stores went on strike across the country, demanding that Starbucks come to the bargaining table and hammer out labor agreements. It was the third time that workers have held a nationwide strike.Starbucks Workers United, the union organizing the workers, said it wanted to send Narasimhan a message that the CEO transition is an opportunity to break with the past and partner with the union. Schultz had a long history of opposing unionization.But in his comments to the AP, Narasimhan struck a similar tone to his predecessor. He said Starbucks respects workers' right to organize but believes the company functions best without a union.“As a company, our experience is that a having a direct relationship with our partners is core to our culture and the experiences we create in our stores,"" Narasimhan said. “I continue to believe a direct relationship with our partners is the best way forward.”Starbucks said it would announce the results of the shareholder votes in the next few days.Starbucks shares closed down less than 1% at $98.42 Thursday.",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — An asteroid big enough to wipe out a city will zip harmlessly between Earth and the moon's orbit this weekend, missing both celestial bodies.Saturday’s close encounter will offer astronomers the chance to study a space rock from just over 100,000 miles (168,000 kilometers) away. That’s less than half the distance from here to the moon, making it visible through binoculars and small telescopes.While asteroid flybys are common, NASA said it’s rare for one so big to come so close — about once a decade. Scientists estimate its size somewhere between 130 feet and 300 feet (40 meters and 90 meters).Discovered a month ago, the asteroid known as 2023 DZ2 will pass within 320,000 miles (515,000 kilometers) of the moon on Saturday and, several hours later, buzz the Indian Ocean at about 17,500 mph (28,000 kph).“There is no chance of this ‘city killer’ striking Earth, but its close approach offers a great opportunity for observations,” the European Space Agency’s planetary defense chief Richard Moissl said in a statement.Astronomers with the International Asteroid Warning Network see it as good practice for planetary defense if and when a dangerous asteroid heads our way, according to NASA.The Virtual Telescope Project will provide a live webcast of the close approach.The asteroid won’t be back our way again until 2026.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845095,Messi mania grips Argentina in 1st match as World Cup champs,"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Messi mania gripped Buenos Aires as the Argentina national team led by Lionel Messi beat Panama 2-0 on Thursday in a friendly match that was essentially a celebration of their World Cup victory last December.Although the world champions dominated the game, they didn’t get a goal until the 78th minute when Thiago Almada scored after a free kick by Messi hit the goal post.Ten minutes later, it was Messi’s turn and he scored the 800th goal of his professional career with a perfectly executed free kick. He is now one short of the 100-goal mark for the national squad.After the match, the celebrations got into full swing and Messi took center stage, smiling from ear to ear as he received awards and accolades.“I want to thank you for all the love we've been receiving . . . We told you we were going to do everything possible to win this,” a visibly emotional Messi said as he was handed the microphone. “Let’s enjoy this because we went a long time without winning it, and we don’t know when we’ll win it again.”When it was coach Lionel Scaloni’s turn to speak, the first thing he did was lead the packed stadium on a chant praising Messi.“Eternally grateful to this group of players,” Scaloni said as tears streamed down his face and he thanked fans for their support.The players’ families later joined them in the pitch and each of the players proceeded to lift a replica of the World Cup trophy in celebration. The players then walked around the pitch waving to fans as fireworks lit the night sky.Earlier in the day, news channels carried live images of the players traveling to the stadium with a police escort as excited fans waited to see the team's first game since it beat France in a thrilling final in Qatar.Outside the Monumental Stadium there was a party-like atmosphere from early in the afternoon as somebody impersonating Pope Francis blessed a World Cup replica, children almost universally donned Messi’s No. 10 jersey and street sellers hawked Messi dolls.Amid the celebrations there were also recriminations as many fans lamented they'd bought tickets for several times their face value from resellers that ended up being fake. The frustration led to scuffles with law enforcement officials who fired tear gas to disperse the angry fans.“We spent all we had for this, we spent $100 for each ticket,” said Marcelo Aguilera, 21, who traveled by bus from neighboring Paraguay for the game with three friends only to find out they had fake tickets.Marcelo Saracho was dressed up like the pope, an Argentine, but with his cheeks painted in the light blue and white colors of the national flag.Messi, the Paris Saint-Germain star who only last week was whistled by a group of fans of the French club that had been knocked out of the Champions League, received a massive ovation when he and his Argentina teammates entered the stadium filled with 83,000 fans.When the anthem played the cameras zoomed in on Messi, who looked to be holding back tears as fans sang along triumphantly.“I can’t believe I’m here,” Sofía Clavero, 12, said as her eyes welled up with tears while describing how she was eager to see her “idol” for the first time on the field.The match culminated a week in which Messi, 35, was widely celebrated as a hero after helping Argentina win its third World Cup title, a marked change for the player who once suffered the indifference and even apathy from many Argentina fans who blamed him for the team’s failings in previous championships.It all started Monday night when hundreds of fans mobbed a steakhouse in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Palermo when word spread that Messi was inside having dinner. He needed a police escort to leave but was all smiles as people shouted “Messi I love you” and “Thank you, Leo.”The next day, a group of fans realized the car next to them on the highway was carrying the man who is often described as the world’s best soccer player. They immediately started shouting, “I love you, Messi!” and “Let’s go, Messi!”That’s when Messi proceeded to roll down his window and wave. The brief video of the encounter quickly went viral.On Wednesday, the hosts of a morning network TV show went wild when they received an audio message from Messi.“Good morning everyone,” Messi said in the message that the hosts huddled to hear. “I’m happy to be here, to enjoy everything we keep experiencing after what happened in December, and excited to enjoy tomorrow’s game.”To avoid any issues, the players were taken to the stadium six hours before the start of the match flanked by a security operation that involved dozens of law enforcement officers. Plans for the transfer had been kept under wraps to avoid a repeat of what happened in December when a celebratory open-top bus throughout the capital had to be cut short when millions of fans made it impossible for the vehicle to advance.Tickets to Thursday’s match sold out quickly but the game was just one chapter of the celebration that included local musicians and a trailer of a documentary about the World Cup-winning squad. The fan who wrote “Muchachos,” which became the unofficial anthem for the Argentina squad in Qatar, was also present.The party continues next Tuesday when the team will play another friendly match against Curaçao in Argentina’s central Santiago del Estero province.___Associated Press journalist Victor R.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845109,"UCLA dances into the Sweet 16, first time since 2019","LOS ANGELES (AP) — When it comes to getting her team ready, UCLA coach Cori Close stresses mental preparation as much as making sure her players know their assignments.During the season, Close motivated them with the quote ""Everything you want is on the other side of hard” from Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams.Over the past couple of weeks, though, Close has turned to Lady Gaga’s “Just Dance” to inspire her team to be at their best during March Madness. The impromptu dance parties before practice have relaxed the young Bruins as they've advanced to their first Sweet 16 in four years. UCLA (26-9) will face top-seeded South Carolina (34-0) on Saturday in a Greenville 1 Regional semifinal.“I don’t want them to play tight,"" Close said. ""I want them to play free. I want them to play focused, and I want them to play with great gratitude and joy.”Close began stressing more joy after a painful loss to Washington State in the Pac-12 tournament final. The Bruins advanced to the championship game after beating top-seeded Stanford in the semifinals but Close saw her players put more pressure on themselves leading up to the final.""I wish I had handled the day before the championship game differently. I learned about them that I don’t need to motivate them to work hard. This is a hard-working group. I know they want it,” Close said. “The 48 hours between when we played -- won in the semi-final and playing in the finals — we got tense. We didn’t play our best basketball in the final. As the day went on, we were putting more and more pressure on ourselves. I think that was a conscious choice on the staff’s part.“If we kept preparing with great focus, then we needed to bring great joy. I think that balance is really important.”So as the Bruins huddled at center court last Friday before practice, Gabriela Jaquez started things off with a couple of moves in the center of the famed UCLA circle at Pauley Pavilion. Emily Bessior and Christeen Iwuala followed before teammates and coaches started chanting, “We want Kiki.” Freshman Kiki Rice took a brief step back from the circle before giving in and dancing into the center while everyone applauded.“That was her example of having us dance to just show that it’s fun,” senior guard Gina Conti said. “We worked hard to get here. It’s okay to be present, enjoy the moment, and take those feelings (of pressure) you’re feeling to flip them to be good for you.”This season has been as much of a learning process for Close as for her players. UCLA missed the NCAA Tournament last season for the first time since 2015 but there was the anticipation of a turnaround with the nation’s top-ranked signing class coming in. The group included Rice, the 2022 National High School Player of the Year.The Bruins began the season unranked but got as high as eighth in January. They went 4-5 during a stretch late in conference play, which put them in danger of not hosting the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament. But three wins in the Pac-12 Tournament got UCLA a fourth seed in the Greenville 1 Regional and the opportunity to play at home the first two rounds.UCLA looked like it was about to succumb to pressure during the third quarter of Monday night’s second-round game against Oklahoma. The Bruins raced out to an 18-point lead during the first half but the Sooners went on a 22-3 run during the third quarter to grab a four-point lead.Charisma Osborne made a three-point play late in the quarter and the Bruins rallied in the fourth for a 82-73 victory.“I think our identity is more solidified. We worked hard at that,” Close said. “It hasn’t been easy, but we are more confident in who we are and when we are at our best.”Despite having to go cross country and facing the unbeaten Gamecocks, UCLA is going into Saturday’s matchup confident. The Bruins lost 73-64 at South Carolina on Nov. 29 but the game was tied at the beginning of the fourth quarter.UCLA is also one of only four teams this season not to lose to South Carolina by double digits.“We know that we held ’em to a close game when we played down there the first time, but we also know that we’re so much better this time around,” Rice said. “I think everyone on our team has grown in so many different ways and we’ve collectively gotten so much better. No lack of confidence going in just because of the No. 1 seed.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845110,Sloppy racing could make it tough for NASCAR road ringers,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The NASCAR field this Sunday will be stacked with two former Formula One world champions, an IndyCar driver and a sports car star who has a 24 Hours of Le Mans win on his resume.What can these so-called ringers expect on the road course at Circuit of the Americas?“To get run over,” Brad Keselowski said. “They are just going to get run over by another driver because we've gotten to this spot where wrecking, yeah, it's cool. And we don't see these guys again, and so what does it matter if you wreck them?”That's hardly what Kimi Raikkonen, Jenson Button, Conor Daly and Jordan Taylor signed up for. Raikkonen, the 2007 F1 champion, made his Cup debut on the road course at Watkins Glen last year and seemed competitive until he was run off course on a restart and his race ended with a crash into a tire barrier.Button, the 2009 F1 champion, is making his NASCAR debut, as is Taylor, a four-time IMSA sports car champion and class winner at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Daly will be making his third career Cup start, and first since he qualified for last month's Daytona 500.The quartet are all seasoned road racers — Raikkonen has made eight career F1 starts at COTA and his 2018 win there was the last of his 21 career victories — but probably don't stand a chance Sunday because of the sloppy state of racing.The Truck Series and Xfinity Series races at Atlanta Motor Speedway last week saw a record number of cautions in both event. Two-time Cup champion Kyle Busch even lashed out at the recent lack of respect being shown on the track.Busch was specifically referencing a last-lap crash the week before at Phoenix, when former teammate Denny Hamlin admitted he intentionally wrecked Ross Chastain. Hamlin has been fined by NASCAR — he's appealing — but Busch couldn't help but note the change in etiquette on the track as a generation of drivers retired and were replaced by a younger, more aggressive group.The days of Hall of Famers Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin and Tony Stewart policing the garage and keeping order are, according to Busch, essentially over.“We have completely lost any sense of respect in the garage area between drivers,” Busch said. “That’s where the problem lies. Nobody gives two (expletive) about anybody else and it’s just a problem where everybody takes advantage of everybody as much as they can.“We’re all selfish, granted. But there was an etiquette that did live here. Mark started it, Tony really lived by it, I think Jeff lived by it. It did exist.”Chastain scored the first Cup win of his career last season at COTA with an aggressive final lap three-driver battle in which Chastain essentially had to knock both AJ Allmendinger and Alex Bowman out of his way to get to victory lane. There were nine cautions in the race that contributed to 19% of it being run under yellow.It could be more of the same Sunday. COTA marks the first road course race of the season for a group of drivers who specialize on ovals.Allmendinger said he forgave Chastain for taking him out of contention last year, but acknowledged road racing has been hit-or-miss for NASCAR in terms of quality of show.“Last year was interesting to me because half the road course races were great races, and then half of them kind of weren't. I don't know what made one race good and the next race maybe not good,” said Allmendinger, who noted the durability of NASCAR's stock cars make it easier for drivers to be overly physical.“It's a unique thing to stock car racing, right? You use the front of (the car), use the sides of it, and for the most part, it's kind of ‘Have at it.’ I think it's probably more aggressive than it's ever been ... but it's on us to fix it. Otherwise you start asking NASCAR to make calls and I don't think anybody wants that. You don't want NASCAR up in the tower making a black flag on one guy for doing something and then the next person does something and nothing happens. It's just super aggressive and we've got to police it ourselves.”Keselowski doesn't understand the mentality of many racers tearing up equipment instead of patiently trying to preserve a good finish.“It’s a crazy thing to me because I am watching drivers right now who are incredibly fast and in very good cars and they are just wrecking the hell out of them, and it’s like ‘Dude, you don’t have to do that,'” Keselowski said. “I see guys now wrecking each other for 20th and you get out of the car and everyone is praising it as ‘good, hard racing’ and I’m sorry, but no, that’s just stupidity. You just destroyed a half-million dollar car going for 20th. That does not make any sense at all.”Busch, for one, is fed up, weary of trying to address the issue and has a solution in mind should someone wreck him.“I’ve tried to talk to guys. They don’t listen. So, I’ve lost interest in talking to them,"" Busch said. ""When you intentionally drive over somebody because they made a move on you or something that you didn’t like, then, you know, you’re gonna get punched in the face afterwards.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845111,Judge denies defense bid to prevent release of Otieno's body,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — A Virginia judge has denied a request from attorneys for one of seven sheriff’s deputies charged in the death of a mental patient to prevent the man’s body from being released until they decide whether they will seek an independent autopsy.Dinwiddie Circuit Court Joseph Teefey Jr. ruled Wednesday that defense attorneys could instead ask for an independent examiner to be present during the autopsy currently being performed by the state medical examiner’s office.Irvo Otieno died on March 6 while he was being admitted to Central State Hospital. Dinwiddie Commonwealth's Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill has said that Otieno was suffocated to death, but an autopsy has not been completed. Video released this week shows the deputies and hospital employees pinning the 28-year-old Black man to the floor for more than 10 minutes.Defense attorneys have said that the deputies and hospital employees were trying to restrain Otieno after he became combative during the transfer process from a Henrico jail to the hospital.Otieno’s family said he had longstanding mental health struggles and was brutally mistreated at the hospital and in jail. He was initially taken to a Richmond-area hospital by police for psychiatric care on March 3. But after authorities said he became combative, he was charged with three counts of assaulting a law enforcement officer and transferred to the jail. His family says he was denied access to needed medication during his time there.In their motion, attorneys for Sgt. Kaiyell Sanders of the Henrico County Sheriff's Office asked that Otieno's body be preserved as physical evidence. They said it would be “highly unlikely” that they would ask for a second autopsy, but because the cause of death “will be an essential element” of the state's case against Sanders, their request to preserve Otieno's body is “imminently reasonable.”“Without an order from this Honorable Court ordering the preservation of the physical evidence, namely the body of Irvo N. Otieno, the Defendant will be unjustly deprived of his ability to inspect the physical evidence through an independent autopsy,” Sanders' attorney, W. Edward Riley IV, wrote in the motion.Riley did not immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment on the judge's denial of the request.WRIC-TV reports that during a bond hearing in court Wednesday, Sanders’ attorneys said the state medical examiner informed them it could be up to 12 weeks before the autopsy report is released.Mark Krudys, an attorney for Otieno's family, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the defense request.In denying the motion, Teefey said the defense request was “speculative in nature,"" WRIC reported.“We're not talking about a T-shirt or a vial of blood,” Teefey said. “We're talking about the dignity of a human body.”A total of 10 people have been charged in the case. All have been granted bond and have pre-trial hearings scheduled in court in April and May.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845113,"Why the religious fast for Ramadan, Lent and other holy days","Muslims around the world are welcoming the start of Ramadan, a month of fasting, increased worship, heightened charity, good deeds and community. Christians are also fasting during Lent, the 40-day period of penance and prayer ahead of Easter, which marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.Fasting across religions is practiced for a wide range of reasons that include spiritual purification and self-discipline. Here is a quick look at fasting as an act of faith:BUDDHISM-- In Buddhism, fasting is recognized as one of the methods for practicing self- control. Buddhist monks generally refrain from taking solid food after noon every day.CHRISTIANITY-- In Christianity, fasting is used as a way to purify the body, practice self-control and save resources to give to the poor.— Many Pentecostal Christians fast in anticipation that it will equip them to experience the Holy Spirit more powerfully.-- During Lent, many Christians observe a 40-day period of penance, prayer and fasting. It is observed from Ash Wednesday through Holy Saturday, the day before Easter, which marks their belief in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. This year, Easter falls on April 9 for most Christians. During Lent, Christians replicate the biblical account of Jesus withdrawing to the desert to pray and fast for the 40 days.-- Christians often abstain from eating meat on Fridays during Lent, and some for the entire period. Some also give up coffee, candy or another item they see as a personal sacrifice. “You’re showing your seriousness and your willingness to suffer for your religion,” said Deana Weibel, an anthropology and religious studies professor at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan.-- The Catholic Church does not consider fish, lobster and other shellfish to be meat, so they can be consumed on days of abstinence, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In many U.S. communities, Friday fish fries are common occurrence during Lent.HINDUISM-- In Hinduism, fasting is not an obligation, but a voluntary act of spiritual purification. The most commonly observed fast is Ekadashi, which falls on the 11th day of each lunar cycle as the moon waxes and wanes. Hindus also fast during several festivals or as part of their spiritual discipline. People may do complete or partial fasts or just give up their favorite foods for a certain period of time.ISLAM— Abstaining from all food and drink -- not even a sip of water is allowed-- and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan is regarded as an act of piety and devotion to God and an exercise in self-restraint.— Islamic scholars say the merits of fasting also include cultivating gratitude and compassion for the less fortunate and poor.— Making donations and helping feed the needy are hallmarks of the month, which also typically sees the devout dedicating more time for prayers, religious studies and reading of the Quran, the Muslim holy book.— Many look forward to the fast as an act of spiritual rejuvenation and purification.— In Islam, fasting is one of The Five Pillars of the faith, along with the profession of faith, prayer, almsgiving, and pilgrimage, which is known in Arabic as hajj. There are exemptions from fasting, including for the sick.— The daily fasting is followed by iftar, or breaking of the fast, often in festive gatherings with family and friends.JAINISM-- Fasting is an important part of Jainism. It is viewed as a way to cleanse one’s body, including one’s bad karma or actions. Jain fasts could last from one day to more than a month. People may do complete or partial fasts or just give up their favorite foods for a certain period of time.JUDAISM-- The holiest day of the Jewish calendar involves a 25-hour fasting period that’s coupled with prayers for forgiveness. During Yom Kippur, Judaism’s day of atonement, Israeli life grinds to a halt -- businesses shut down, roads empty out and even radio and TV stations go silent as the faithful fast for 25 hours and hold intensive prayers of atonement.SIKHISM-- Sikhism is one of few religions that does not regard fasting as meritorious. Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith, regarded fasting as inferior to the “truth” or “right action,” which he said was superior to fasting, penance or other austerities.__Associated Press writers Deepa Bharath and Peter Smith contributed to this report.__Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845114,Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate OK with Jan. 6 participant,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The Republican-backed candidate for Wisconsin Supreme Court said Thursday that he had no problem with someone who was on the U.S. Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection campaigning for him across the state in the waning days of the high stakes race, calling his work “invaluable.”Dan Kelly on Wednesday posted a video on Twitter of himself standing side-by-side with conservative activist Scott Presler and thanking him for his work. Presler, a Virginia native, planned several “stop the steal” rallies in addition to being on the Capitol grounds the day of the insurrection. Presler also described the siege on the Capitol as “the largest civil rights protest in American history.""When asked Thursday about Presler's attendance at the insurrection, Kelly said he was “not really familiar with his background.”“But what I can say, I appreciate a great deal the work that he’s doing here in Wisconsin,” Kelly said. “I think it is invaluable.”Majority control of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is at stake in the April 4 election between Kelly and Democratic-backed Janet Protasiewicz, a Milwaukee County judge. Conservatives have controlled the court for 15 years and came within one vote of overturning President Joe Biden's win in the battleground state in 2020.Protasiewicz has made abortion access, which the court is likely to decide, a key issue of the race. But she has also attacked Kelly over his ties to Republicans.Kelly previously worked for the Republican Party and advised Republican leaders about former President Donald Trump's fake elector scheme following his loss in 2020.“Dan Kelly chooses extremism every chance he gets, and he’s desperate to bring his right-wing partisan agenda back to the court,"" Protasiewicz campaign spokesperson Sam Roecker said in a statement.Presler has been traveling the state and appearing on conservative talk radio to boost Kelly.“As far as I know, he’s going around the state of Wisconsin and talking about how important it is for the people of Wisconsin to exercise their power, their responsibility and authority in deciding who’s going to sit on the Supreme Court,” Kelly said of Presler. “So I don’t know anything about Jan. 6 or anything like that with Scott. But I sure appreciate him and the work that he’s doing (for the campaign).”When asked if it bothers him that Presler was present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Kelly said: “No.”“Everybody’s got a background,” Kelly said. “Everyone’s got a history. And I don’t ask people to sit for an examination before they help me.”Kelly noted that Presler has more than 1 million followers on Twitter.Protasiewicz and her backers have also faulted Kelly for speaking online this week at an event attended by Brookfield pastor Matthew Trewhella, who has called the murder of an abortion provider “justifiable homicide,” supported the creation of anti-abortion-focused militia and compared pandemic-related mask mandates to the Holocaust.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported Thursday on Kelly speaking Tuesday at the same event as Trewhella, although they were not present together.Kelly on Thursday distanced himself from Trewhella, saying “of course not” when asked if he supported Trewhella saying it was justifiable to kill abortion providers.“Obviously, I don’t condone violence at all,” Kelly said. “I’m not associated with him in any way whatsoever. ... I speak for myself. I was invited to deliver comments at an organization. I deliver my comments. I’m not responsible for what anybody else of that organization said.”",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — No one has been able to keep up with Villanova's Maddy Siegrist all season. LSU's Angel Reese has been putting up her own video-game numbers with unrelenting and remarkable consistency.They're both Associated Press All-America first-team picks. And they're headlining the Greenville 2 Region bracket entering Friday's Sweet 16 games, providing star power to the doubleheader at a valuable time in the shared March Madness national spotlight.“I think it's awesome,” Siegrist said Thursday. “It's so important to have female sports really on the forefront right now and to inspire the younger generation. I'm just happy to be a part of it.”Siegrist and the fourth-seeded Wildcats meet ninth-seeded Miami in the first regional semifinal. Reese and the third-seeded Tigers meet second-seeded Utah, which is led by a second-team AP All-American in Alissa Pili. The winners meet Sunday for a Final Four ticket.Siegrist, a 6-foot-2 senior, averages a national-best 29.2 points. She joined fellow first-team AP All-American Caitlin Clark of Iowa, third-team pick Aneesah Morrow of DePaul and Drexel’s Keishana Washington as the only players with multiple games of at least 40 points this year.Reese, a 6-3 sophomore, is fifth nationally in scoring (23.8), second in rebounding (15.7) and first in double-doubles (30). That includes a 26-point, 28-rebound performance against Texas A&M, the most boards in Division I this year.“To have those types of players draw attention to the sport is awesome,” LSU coach Kim Mulkey said. “50 points in a game, not many do that. The young lady at Villanova, Siegrist, she’s done that. To win national championships like South Carolina, not many have done that. Boston can leave here and say she’s done that.""Angel Reese would like to do what Boston has done for South Carolina.”In all, nine AP All-Americans are healthy enough to play for their teams that are still alive. Six of those players are in Greenville, including South Carolina's Aaliyah Boston and Zia Cooke. Maryland's Diamond Miller is in the other bracket here in the NCAA's new double-regional format.The Greenville 2 bracket is the only one with two first-team All-Americans. Their games come as the sport sees gains in TV ratings. Talk about a nice platform to promote the sport.“I embrace it,” Reese said, adding: “You've got NBA players, celebrities watching our games, being able to tune in. ... It's just fun being able to help grow women's basketball, and this is bigger than me.”LONG WAITSThe quartet of teams waited years to return to the regional rounds.LSU (30-2) is the most recent to reach the Sweet 16 in 2014. Utah (27-4) is here for the first time since reaching the Elite Eight in 2006. Villanova (30-6) won multiple games in the same NCAA Tournament only once before, during a 2003 run to the Elite Eight.And for Miami (21-12), the program’s lone Sweet 16 trip came in 1992.HARDEN'S HEROICSDestiny Harden looks at ease in March.Miami's 6-foot graduate guard made the go-ahead late shot to stun 1-seed Indiana on its home court Monday. It marked the second time in roughly a year that she came through in the clutch.Last March, Harden pulled off the one-woman comeback — equal parts incredible and improbable — to beat highly ranked Louisville in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament.“She's got those big eyes,” Miami coach Katie Meier said. “She just has them, and they're big as saucers. And when she's really locked in, they just get bigger and bigger. ... Destiny is never going to let you down.”The Louisville comeback was more than just one shot. It was Harden scoring the game's last 15 points to erase a huge deficit, the last coming on a turnaround jumper at the horn.Still, Harden said the Indiana shot was bigger “because this is March Madness.”“Those were the biggest shots I ever got in my life,” Harden said. “It’s just incredible just to deliver for my team.”MONSTROUS EXPECTATIONSMulkey took over an LSU program that had missed two straight NCAA Tournaments, and she's already 56-8 in two seasons. That creates the challenge for fans to “keep perspective” that more work is ahead.“I don’t think anybody could be fair and say that we were going to do this in two years or even do what we did last year in the first year,"" she said, adding: ""We're doing things at a very fast pace. Might be feeding that monster too quickly, but it sure beats the heck out of losing.”‘A PART OF IT'Villanova has felt the emotional lift from Rachel Grace, a four-year team manager with Down syndrome.The program tweeted in honor of “RG” on Tuesday for World Down Syndrome Day, calling her Villanova's “heart and soul."" Coach Denise Dillon said Grace would attend Friday's game.""She knows the game,"" Dillon said. “She’s a part of it. She’s every bit a part of our program to the highest level. Just to be a part of her life and to have her a part of the Villanova community is really cool.”___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) —A decorated 20-year member of the U.S. Army has been identified as one of the five people killed in a shooting Tuesday night at a South Carolina home.Command Sgt. Maj. Carlos Evans, 38, was killed by a former soldier in an attack that officials say left three sleeping children dead while their surviving mother frantically sought help.The ex-soldier, Charles Slacks Jr., then killed himself. Slacks and the woman were divorced, but he used a key to enter the home in Sumter around 10 p.m. Tuesday, Sumter Police Chief Russell Roark said Wednesday.Slacks, 42, killed his own children, 5-year-old Aayden Holliday-Slacks and his 6-year-old Aason Holliday-Slacks, and also killed their half-sister, 11-year-old Ava Holliday, Sumter County Coroner Robbie Baker said. Before the divorce, Slacks had been Ava’s stepfather.Slacks had just begun working as a budget analyst with U.S. Army Central last month, according to Major Jason Welch. Slacks served as a tracked vehicle mechanic from June 1999 to July 2006, Welch said, and had been deployed to Iraq and Kuwait in two separate stints.Evans worked with the children's mother and happened to be at the home, Roark said. Evans had no relationship with the woman outside of work and investigators do not know why Slacks came to the home, Roark said.“CMS Evans was well known and respected by all, and the influence and impact he made within the unit will never fade,” Lt. Gen. Patrick D. Frank said Thursday in a statement offering condolences to his family. “We collectively mourn the immense loss of his presence in our lives.”The Virginia native joined the Army in July 2002 and served in Iraq and Kuwait among other tours in the Middle East, Welch said. Evans was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and another recognition for valor under fire, according to information from the U.S. Army.“He was a hero,” State Sen.

The game marked the debut of coach Roberto Martínez with Portugal.Ronaldo converted a penalty kick and scored off a free kick while making his 197th appearance with the national team. He had tied Kuwait’s Bader Al-Mutawa with 196 caps after coming off the bench in Portugal’s loss to Morocco in the quarterfinals of the World Cup last year.Ronaldo was benched in the knockout rounds in Qatar and left the field in tears after the defeat to Morocco. He had said his return to the national team was in doubt after the World Cup, but eventually decided it was not time “to throw in the towel.”“To be in the national team, you have to be committed,"" Martínez said of Ronaldo. ""It’s a new cycle. It is very important that a player shows commitment and that he can use his experience. Cristiano has that: A lot of experience and a lot of commitment to the national team.”The 38-year-old Ronaldo is also the all-time scoring leader in men’s soccer and took his tally to 120 goals after scoring with his penalty kick in the 51st and a powerful free kick from just outside the area in the 63rd.Portugal dominated from the start at the José Alvalade Stadium, and João Cancelo opened the scoring in the eighth minute. He also set up Bernardo Silva’s close-range goal in the 47th and the penalty that Ronaldo converted for the third goal.Ronaldo received a standing ovation after being substituted by Gonçalo Ramos in the 78th.He had become Europe’s most-capped player in 2021 after surpassing Sergio Ramos’ mark of 180 appearances with Spain.Martínez arrived pledging to respect Ronaldo's history and said he still counts on Ronaldo. He made the forward one of his captains entering qualifying for Euro 2024.Martínez replaced former Portugal coach Fernando Santos after ending his six-year stint with Belgium following the World Cup.“The result is very important,"" Martínez said. “It was an opportunity for me to get to know the players, the way we can get the best out of the players’ qualities. I get the attitude and the will to work. I am very proud of the result.”Portugal remained unbeaten in eight matches against Liechtenstein, with seven wins and a draw. Portugal has won each of its last five Euro qualifying matches against Liechtenstein, all without conceding a goal and while scoring 32 times.Portugal’s qualifying group also includes Luxembourg, Iceland, Slovakia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its next match is at Luxembourg on Sunday.

He needs surgery for a torn ACL and is expected to miss a significant amount of time.St. Louis Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright (groin) and Atlanta Braves closer Raisel Iglesias (inflamed shoulder) also will begin the season on the injured list.The Phillies didn't say how long Hoskins is expected to be out. Hoskins, who turned 30 last week, hit six homers in Philadelphia’s playoff run last season. The Phillies lost to the Houston Astros in the World Series.Philadelphia is already without DH and two-time NL MVP Bryce Harper for at least two months as he recovers from offseason elbow surgery.Wainwright was in line for his seventh opening day start in what's slated to be his final season. Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol told reporters Thursday before St. Louis' spring training game against the New York Yankees that Wainwright could miss several weeks.The 41-year-old apparently strained his groin in a workout before Team USA lost to Japan 3-2 in the championship game of the World Baseball Classic on Tuesday. Wainwright went 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA over eight innings to help the U.S. reach the final.""We’ll continue to evaluate over the next few days but no timetable at the moment,” Marmol said, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “There is a spot in the rotation now open, and we’re going to have to sit down and make sure that we’re not missing anything that goes into that.”With Iglesias, the Braves said an MRI showed the right-hander has “low-grade” inflammation and will not throw for seven days. Iglesias was expected to move into the closer’s role after Kenley Jansen signed with the Boston Red Sox. Iglesias, 33, had a combined 17 saves last season for the Los Angeles Angels and Atlanta.WECOME BACK, PART IThe Cardinals welcomed back to camp Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt, who played for Team USA, along with Lars Nootbaar, an outfielder for Team Japan. The Cardinals posted a picture of them stretching with the caption: “What do you think they are talking about!?”Goldschmidt and Nootbaar were in the starting lineup Thursday.WELCOME BACK, PART IIYu Darvish returned to the San Diego Padres after helping Team Japan to a WBC title. The right-hander was in Japan for the early stages of the tournament and then in Florida for the final rounds.Darvish started one game and came out of the bullpen twice in the WBC. He also was part of the 2009 squad that won the championship.He said he was “very appreciative” of the Padres letting him spend his preparation time with the Japanese team.“They trusted me going there,” he said through an interpreter Thursday in Peoria, Arizona. ”(It was) a bit tough going there but the beautiful thing about that was that you get to spend time with those young up-and-coming pitchers back in Japan who are very talented and get to know them and get to be friends with them, too. It was a very meaningful time.”Next step, stretching out his arm. He’s not used to coming out of the bullpen: Of his 242 major league appearances on the mound, all have been starts.“Team Japan was trying to win the whole thing. I wasn’t able to build up as I would in a regular spring training,” Darvish said. “I can’t overthink this. We’ll see how I feel as we move along. Try to get back to what I usually do.”Darvish said he would talk with manager Bob Melvin about when he would be pitching. Darvish is looking to go “about four innings” in any tune-up appearance ahead of the regular season, which begins March 30 when the Padres host Colorado.SHIFT WORKBryan Cranston (you know, Walter White, from “Breaking Bad”) wants to “get that shift … outta here!”The actor appeared in an ad for Major League Baseball in which he watched baseball clips and touted how the game has evolved with the new rule changes.“This is the game we all want to see,” Cranston said in the commercial.The pitch clock has sped things up, with spring training games averaging 26 minutes less than last spring.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845119,Abortion-rights supporters prevail in New Hampshire House,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — In a victory for abortion-rights supporters, the Republican-led but closely divided New Hampshire House on Thursday rejected multiple bills to further restrict abortion access while also approving legislation to protect it.The eight abortion-related bills came up for a vote during what has been a hectic week for abortion policy nationwide. Nine months after the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to an abortion, court fights are playing out on multiple fronts, states dominated by Democrats are seeking to protect access and Republicans are trying to tighten restrictions.In New Hampshire, Republicans hold a 201-198 majority in the House, with one seat vacant. That has made attendance on session days extra important, as evidenced by the vote on a measure Thursday that ended in a tie.The proposal in question, backed by virtually all Democrats, would have repealed the state’s ban on abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The bill was tabled after the 192-192 tie.Democrats succeeded, however, in sending the Senate a bill that would remove the civil and criminal penalties associated with the ban, a change Republican Gov. Chris Sununu supports. The House also voted to add an explicit right to abortion up to 24 weeks to state law, though the Republican-led Senate already has defeated a similar bill.“New Hampshire is one of only three states where abortion is legal but not protected,” said Rep. Alexis Simpson, a Democrat from Exeter. “Today we can send a message to Granite Staters – a clear, purposeful message – that the New Hampshire House supports and affirms an individual’s right to an abortion and the tenets of Roe v. Wade.”The House rejected a bill that would ban abortions after the first detectable “fetal heartbeat.” Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they’re pregnant. It also rejected a bill that would have required medical treatment for all infants born alive, including after an attempted abortion, along with measures that would have imposed a waiting period for those seeking abortions and additional audits for abortion providers.A bill that would have asked voters to weigh in on adding “reproductive autonomy” to the state Constitution failed, however. The House voted 193-191 in favor of the bill, but proposed constitutional amendments need a three-fifths majority to advance.Rep. Bob Lynn, a Republican from Windham and former chief justice of the state Supreme Court, said changing the constitution would effectively throw the issue to the courts.“Is there any reason to believe that the court is somehow better equipped to make decisions on these issues than we are? I submit to you that the answer is no,” he said. “Unlike unelected judges, we are the branch of government that is most accountable to the people. If we get it wrong, the voters will let us know about it soon enough at the next election.”",2023/03/24,,World

Now, the Utes are a victory away from the last eight, someplace they hadn't been since 2006.It's been a season of achievements for Utah, picked fifth in the Pac-12 preseason. It routed then-No. 16 Oklahoma 124-78 in November and followed that up with victories over a pair of NCAA teams from the Southeastern Conference in Alabama and Ole Miss.The Utes went 15-3 to win the league and topped Stanford 84-78 in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals. Does Roberts think her team gets its due?“I mean, probably not, but no one in our locker room cares,” Roberts said. “We’ll compete and play and keep doing what we do, and all that stuff doesn’t really matter.”The Utes also have a chance for greatness when Pili, a 6-foot-2 junior transfer from Southern Cal, is in the game. She averaged 20.7 points a game this season to lead her conference and was picked as a second-team AP All-American.Pili is strong and fast, and has the ability to take and make outside shots in critical situations.“All season long, I've been calling her a unicorn because she's just so unique,” Roberts said.Pili will need another sublime showing against LSU and its first-team All-American Angel Reese, who has had 30 out of 32 games with double-figure points and rebounds to help the Tigers to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.Pili expects to count on the same calm, steady approach she typically brings into each game.“I think (it's) just the type of person I am, how I was brought up, I’m very humble, I would say,” Pili said. “So I just kind of stay level-headed and just don’t let all the accolades get to my head or put any extra pressure on me. I just go out there and do what I know how to do.”LSU guard Alexis Morris believes her team has gained experience in defending some of the very best post players in the country like Aliyah Boston at South Carolina and Jordan Horston at Tennessee.“I respect Pili’s game. She’s a versatile post player, but I feel like I’ve got the best post players in the country. I’m sitting right next to her,” said Morris, referencing Reese. “Hey, it's going to be a competitive game and we respect Utah and what they bring to the court.”Utah can certainly add to that respect nationally with a victory over LSU.“I still think there’s a lot of people out there who think we maybe don’t belong at this level or that we can’t compete,"" Pili said, ""so I think just staying hungry and continuing to prove what we can do is just going to get us far.”Perhaps even to the Elite Eight and beyond.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845121,Kane breaks Rooney's England scoring record with goal No. 54,"NAPLES, Italy (AP) — Harry Kane became England’s leading scorer of all time on Thursday — and his record-setting goal just had to come from the penalty spot.Kane tugged on his England jersey and roared with delight in an emotional celebration after converting a spot kick during the 2-1 win over Italy in European Championship qualifying.It was his 54th goal for the national team, one more than Wayne Rooney.And the nature of the goal wasn't lost on the Tottenham striker.“It had to be a penalty, of course,” Kane said, a nod to him missing from the spot late in a 2-1 loss to France in the World Cup quarterfinals last year.Rooney scored his 53 England goals from 2003-2018. Kane made his England debut in 2015 and has reached the landmark having played 39 fewer games than his fellow striker.“I knew it wouldn’t take long but that was quick,” tweeted Rooney, who is still Manchester United's record scorer. “Great man, unbelievable goalscorer and an England legend. Congrats Harry.”Kane recalled being on the field when Rooney became England’s record scorer himself, surpassing Bobby Charlton’s tally of 49.“I remember when I presented him the boot for breaking the record,” Kane said, “and he said, ‘I’ll be giving this back to you one day.’ It’s just a special night.”It was a matter of when, not if, Kane would become England's outright leading scorer. He is 29 and pretty much in his prime as an all-round striker who can drop deep to link up play or be further upfield as an out-and-out center forward.He is on the path to becoming perhaps England's greatest player, having already won the Golden Boot award at the 2018 World Cup for being top scorer at the tournament.“Just a huge thanks to all the players, all the staff, the fans, my wife and family back home, everyone who has helped me get to this stage,” said Kane, who scored on his England debut. “It’s a magical moment.”His latest penalty was awarded following a VAR review after it was determined that Italy defender Giovanni Di Lorenzo touched the ball with his hand while attempting to prevent Kane from reaching a cross.Kane stepped up to the spot and sent Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma the wrong way as he drilled a shot inside the right post in the 44th minute.That put England ahead 2-0 going into the break at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium and the team held on for a statement win, three months after a heartbreaking exit from the World Cup.“The World Cup, it was obviously a difficult way to end. It wasn’t nice to finish it that way but we spoke this week about getting back to it,” Kane said. ""We feel like we are one of the best teams in Europe and we have to keep knocking on the door.“We are getting close. To put in a performance like that today, it shows we are ready for the next challenge.” ___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845122,"Many millions die without clean water or sanitation, UN says","UNITED NATIONS (AP) — A lack of drinking water and healthy sanitation infrastructure is dire around the world and getting worse, United Nations experts warned in a report issued Thursday.The report finds that many millions of the world’s 7.78 billion people don’t have enough clean water or sanitation infrastructure that helps keep humans healthy by taking waste away from their homes.On the second day of a U.N. conference on water, the report calls on the world “to talk about water and take water seriously,” in order to achieve global development goals, said Kaveh Madani, who trained as an engineer with a focus on water resources in Iran and directs the United Nations University, a global think tank.The report “has some alarming statistics and results but it is better to disclose that early on, while we still have time,” Madani told reporters at U.N. headquarters in New York.Report authors pointed out that the lack of access to basic water-related services kills more people globally than floods, droughts and other disasters, even in the age of global warming.“Far more people die from lack of access to water, then die from from lesser climate disasters ... I’m not saying that people aren’t dying,” said Dr. Charlotte McAlister, a British-trained hydrologist and senior researcher at the U.N. University Institute. “But far more people are dying from lack of safe water, safely managed water and safely managed sanitation.”One of several reports issued by U.N. agencies on water this week, it contains no overarching solution. But Thursday's report tries to go beyond despair, saying that ""important progress can be achieved in the remaining years.” Progress can occur even in countries without the infrastructure or the resources to match wealthier nations’ ability to provide their people with clean water and sanitation, the report says.Nearly three-quarters of the world’s people fall into the category of water-insecure, meaning they score below 65 out of 100 on an indicator that combines 10 water-related factors. The report says that over 0.61 billion people (8%) are critically water-insecure.Of water-insecure people, 4.31 billion people live in the Asia-Pacific region, 1.34 billion in Africa, 415 million in the Americas, and almost 66 million in Europe.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845123,"Moore doesn't regret Jets past, excited to start with Browns","CLEVELAND (AP) — Elijah Moore made headlines in New York last season for everything except clutch catches or touchdowns.He grumbled about a diminished role as the Jets shuffled quarterbacks. He clashed with the offensive coordinator. He demanded a trade.Mistakes? A few. Regrets? None.“I wouldn’t do anything over,” he said.Getting a fresh start in Cleveland, Moore spoke excitedly on Thursday about joining the Browns, who looking for another playmaker for QB Deshaun Watson and some needed speed, acquired him from the Jets for the No. 42 pick in this year's draft.New York also parted with the No. 72 pick in the swap, which caught the 22-year-old Moore by surprise.“It was like out of nowhere,” he said.That might be an exaggeration.Moore had made it clear he wasn't happy in New York, and he had to suspect something was coming Wednesday when the Jets added twitchy wideout Mecole Hardman while stocking the cupboard in hopes of completing a deal for Aaron Rodgers. Hardman essentially replaced Moore.Moore has already spoken to Watson. And while praising his new teammate, he seemed to deliver a message to the Jets about their shifting QB situation.“He’s a legit quarterback,” said Moore, who had 37 catches and one TD last season. “It’s someone that has been doing some amazing things around the league. He has respect from everybody around the league. They talk really highly about him here and they believe in him.""And man, with him being my quarterback, I believe in him too. So, I’m just grateful to be one of his guys.”Moore's skillset aligns with what the Browns were desperately missing: a receiver capable of stretching defenses to create space for others along with being a downfield option for Watson.That's what he was doing in New York, and after a promising rookie season in 2021 (43 catches, five TDs), he started well last season before things began to unravel.Frustrated with a lack of touches, he asked for a trade during New York's three-game winning streak. Then, frustrated by not being targeted in a win over Green Bay, Moore had a confrontation with former coordinator Mike LaFleur during practice, was sent home and benched for the next game.In retrospect, Moore believes those experiences helped him mature.“I wouldn’t take anything back,” he said. ""Would I have worded some things differently? Yes, but not take anything back. My heart was always in the right spot. I never move without intention. I’m very intentional.“So especially in a positive way. And I always move with respect. So if that’s my intentions, I don’t have nothing to regret.”He's moving forward with the Browns, who explored other receiving options this offseason before general manager Andrew Berry pulled off his second significant trade for a wide receiver in a little more than a year.Last March, Cleveland dealt for Amari Cooper, who was not only the team's top receiver in 2022 but an invaluable leader.Moore has followed Cooper's career closely and is excited to play alongside one of the NFL's elite route runners, who happens to be a fellow South Floridian.“I’m most excited about that and Deshaun, being in a room with a vet, someone who understands this and not just football but life,” Moore said. ""I’m just eager to pick his brain. A route runner like that, not many people get to witness that, so I’m glad he is on my team.”Moore isn't hiding from past mistakes or excusing them. He's made his fair share, including a lamentable moment at Ole Miss when he celebrated scoring a TD by lifting his leg like a dog at a fire hydrant. He was penalized and the Rebels missed the ensuing game-tying extra point in a one-point loss to rival Mississippi State.He can't change his past. Moore can only grow from it.“I’m in a space right now where I feel like everything happens for a reason — always,” he said. ""If something’s happening in my life, I’m going to take what I can from it. I’m going to capture it.“You make mistakes, and everyone in life has not been perfect. So as long as you learn it from and keep going and try to be a good person after, that’s all that matters.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845124,TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew: 3 things to know,"TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified Thursday at a congressional hearing over concerns about user data collected by the popular video-sharing app and potential Chinese spying.Under his helm, TikTok reached 150 million users in the U.S., the majority of them teens and young adults who are attracted to the app’s simple interface and addictive algorithm that serves up short videos on just about any imaginable topic.Lawmakers have said they're worried about American data falling into the hands of the Chinese government and claim it threatens national security and user privacy and could be used to promote pro-Beijing propaganda and misinformation.Chew attempted to persuade lawmakers not to pursue a ban on the app or force Chinese parent company ByteDance to give up its ownership stake, testifying that TikTok prioritizes the safety of young users. He says the company plans to store all U.S. user data on servers maintained and owned by the software giant Oracle.Here's a closer look at Chew:WHAT IS HIS BACKGROUND?Chew, 40, is a native of Singapore, where he lives with his wife, Vivian Kao, and their two children. He graduated in 2006 from University College London and worked for two years at Goldman Sachs before moving to the U.S. to pursue a master's degree at Harvard Business School. Chew had a two-year internship with Facebook.After earning his MBA, he became a partner at venture capital firm DST Global, where he worked for five years and helped facilitate investment in the company that became ByteDance. He then worked for five years at Xiaomi, a Chinese smartphone company, before being appointed TikTok CEO in 2021, replacing Kevin Mayer, a former Disney executive. Chew reports to ByteDance CEO Liang Rubo.WHAT'S HIS REPUTATION?The U.S. public knows relatively little about Chew compared with Silicon Valley social media giants such as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, said Brooke Erin Duffy, who studies social media platforms as an associate professor of communications at Cornell University.“Chew has been in the background on public discourse until now, so he doesn't have the same reputation we would associate with the Silicon Valley set, especially Zuckerberg,” Duffy said.Most Americans likely first heard of Chew when he released a video this week speaking directly to TikTok's U.S. users, she said, ""so he doesn't have the same reputation as someone we know, and (we) don't have sense of who he is.”But Chew is well-respected within the U.S. and China tech communities, and was considered a good fit for TikTok because of his background in investment banking and his time at Facebook and DST Global, said Dan Ives, managing director of New York-based Wedbush Securities.“He gained a lot of respect just by taking that high risk, in-the-hot seat role at TikTok,” Ives said, adding that the company likely thought he was the right person to ease tensions with U.S. lawmakers.HOW DID HE DO IN HIS TESTIMONY?Chew's decision to emphasize TikTok's reach in the U.S. might have backfired, and “actually strengthened U.S. lawmakers’ argument that TikTok poses a threat to both national security and young people,” said Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Insider Intelligence.Enberg said there was little Chew could say to convince lawmakers that TikTok is not monitored or influenced in some way by the Chinese government.Ives said Chew's testimony was always going to be fraught, but his lack of concrete answers about data access and security was “a disaster” and likely set the stage for a ban.“It was a perfect storm and lawmakers were ready,” Ives said.But Shelly Palmer, a professor of advanced media at Syracuse University who studies social network business models, said Chew did the best he could given the grilling he received from lawmakers who “in my opinion were not actually listening"" but instead were grandstanding.“I don't think he has the ability, because of who he is and what he does, to be satisfying to this audience,” said Palmer, adding that he believed Chew's answers were not unlike those given by CEOs from U.S.-based social media companies who have been questioned in the past about privacy.___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845129,Alabama's Bryce Young throws for NFL teams at pro day,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Nick Saban says his quarterback , Bryce Young, is the best prospect in the upcoming NFL draft.Now, the star Alabama passer and 2021 Heisman Trophy winner is trying to convince NFL teams — the Carolina Panthers, in particular — that the Crimson Tide coach is right, from the combine to Thursday's pro day at his old practice facility.“We think he’s the best player in the draft,” Saban said.Young, who didn't throw at the combine, threw a scripted series of 50 passes mostly to former teammates before a large contingent of NFL coaches, scouts and executives representing all 32 teams. Young and Ohio State's C.J. Stroud are vying to be the first player taken on April 27.“It was great to be back here throwing to my guys again,” Young said. “This was a really cool experience. I always dreamed of having a pro day and to be able to have it means a lot to me.”The Panthers continued their quarterback tour of prospects for the No. 1 pick they acquired from Chicago in a trade. A dozen team officials, including owners Dave and Nicole Tepper, coach Frank Reich and general manager Scott Fitterer, took Young to dinner before taking in his pro day performance.That doesn't mean they're tipping their hand. The Panthers did the same with Stroud this week and attended his pro day on Wednesday. The Panthers said on the team web site that they would head to see Kentucky's Will Levis throw on Friday, with Florida's Anthony Richardson having his pro day next Thursday.Young described the dinner as ""a big feeling-out process.”“I was super honored with all that people that I met with,” he said. “We were able to talk about a lot of things on and off the field. I really enjoyed it.”He said he hadn't set up any meetings with other teams yet.Other head coaches present included Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears), Mike McDaniel (Miami Dolphins), Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints), Pete Carroll (Seattle Seahawks) and Mike Tomlin (Pittsburgh Steelers). There were also nine general managers present, according to Alabama.Young threw passes at various distances to former Tide receiver Slade Bolden, fellow prospects tight end Cameron Latu and tailback Jahmyr Gibbs and current Alabama players Ja'Corey Brooks and Jermaine Burton. He threw on the move, under simulated pressure and after taking some snaps from center, which he didn't do all that much for the Tide.His one obvious slip-up: A deep ball hit the ceiling in the indoor facility.The most talked about issue facing Young is his size at 5-foot-10, 204 pounds. Beyond that, Saban said, “There’s really no negatives.”“The only negative that anybody can bring is what is his height?” the former Miami Dolphins coach said.""Drew Brees was always the biggest nemesis Nick Saban ever had, whether it was at Michigan State when he was at Purdue or in the NFL. And he was 5-11-something. I don’t think it’s an issue. It wasn’t an issue in his college career.“And he’s going to play against some of the same players in that league that he’s played against in the SEC. We think he’s fantastic.”For his part, Young isn't getting into the “Who's No. 1” debate.“I don’t have an argument. I try to be myself,” he said. “I don’t control where I’m picked, who picks me. I’ll be grateful for whatever team takes a chance on me.""Alabama's other potential top-five pick, linebacker Will Anderson Jr., was on hand during pro day as a spectator, standing by his combine performance. He said his only team visit so far has been with the Houston Texans, who pick second and 12th and are also in the market for a quarterback.Like Saban, Anderson doesn't feel Young's height will keep him from succeeding in the NFL.“I don’t think he’s too short to play quarterback,” Anderson said. ""He’s done a phenomenal job here at Alabama. I could put all faith in him to go out there and do what he needs to do.“He’s a great friend, great brother, great teammate. And I wouldn’t rather have anybody else to be my QB on my team than Bryce Young.”___AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Senior Jaylyn Sherrod's emotion-filled post-game interview after Colorado upset Duke reminded Buffaloes coach JR Payne of the time her point guard was interviewed after a 104-46 blowout at Oregon in Sherrod's freshman year.Undaunted, Sherrod narrowed her eyes into the camera and delivered a message to the Ducks.“They have to come to Boulder.""The Buffs were in no position to settle any scores back then; the Ducks rolled to a 101-53 win in the rematch at Colorado a month later.Still, that bravado hit home with Payne, who said, ""that's the mindset, you know? And I think that sort of permeates throughout our program of being respectful of everyone but not fearing anyone.""That mentality is driving the gritty Buffaloes' return to prominence for the first time since coach Ceal Barry made them a perennial power from 1983 to 2005.The 61-53 overtime win over third-seeded Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium this week vaulted Colorado to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 20 years, giving the Buffaloes a matchup against second-seeded Iowa and Hawkeyes superstar Caitlin Clark on Friday in Seattle.“We're so ready,” sophomore guard Kindyll Wetta said. “This is probably the most excited we've been going into any game this season.”Sherrod tearfully told the broadcast crew on Monday night that Colorado was the only Power Five program that offered her a scholarship coming out of high school, so never once has she thought of jumping into the transfer portal.“This is not a place where we have a roster full of McDonald’s All-Americans,” Payne said. “We don’t need to play pretty, we don’t need to be dainty on the floor. We're tough. We’re blue-collar. We work hard.""It’s not easy, you know, but you’ll be loved and supported and challenged and all of our players came here knowing that. So I think we’ve created an identity where we do play really hard, we are really gritty. We love who we are, we love the players that are here and it just works for us.”One tangible connection the Buffs have to their glory days is Shelley Sheetz, the best player in the program’s history and the color analyst on Colorado’s radio broadcasts.Sheetz played point guard at CU from 1991-95 and is the program’s only first-team All-American. She told the team in the offseason that she saw similar traits to the one she guided to a 106-21 record with two Elite Eight appearances.“Shelley, she told us this was going to happen,” Buffs senior center Quay Miller said. “When we went to Spain (in the offseason) she was like, ‘This team is looking like the Elite Eight team that I played for.’ And I think for most people, it went in one ear and out the other.“But I think just hearing somebody who’s been through that and having her see that we have the potential, it really ignited the fire under us and was like OK, we have potential to do what they did, and we can do this.”The Buffs have gone from a non-tournament team three years ago to one that's won 47 games over the last two seasons.“There are so many firsts that we've done, winning at Oregon, winning at Oregon State, winning in the NCAA tournament, going to the Sweet 16,” Payne said. ""All of these things are things that every player on our team came here to help us do. And it's an emotional thing because it takes so much work.“It's different to go somewhere where the train is already, you know, full steam ahead and there’s tons of success and momentum. It takes a lot more work and sort of emotional work to get there.""That's why Sherrod was so emotional after the thriller at Duke.“My whole life I’ve been dreaming of moments like this,” Sherrod said, “because, like a lot of my teammates, we weren’t five-stars, we weren’t McDonald’s All-Americans. We weren’t guaranteed the NCAA tournament. We weren’t guaranteed an NIT bid.""We believed it when nobody else did. That's just the mentality of this team ... we believe we can beat anybody in the country.”___AP women’s college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/womens-college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — It's a fair assumption that Father Time will catch up with Justin Verlander one of these days.The three-time AL Cy Young Award winner is putting up quite a fight.The 40-year-old Verlander signed with the New York Mets during the offseason and looks like he's got plenty of good pitching left. The hard-throwing righty has a 2.25 ERA and 19 strikeouts in 16 innings in four starts during Grapefruit League action.The Mets are hoping to squeeze another elite season out of Verlander and Max Scherzer, who is 38 years old. Scherzer has also had a solid spring training, giving up just one earned run over 11 2/3 innings.Verlander is coming off one of the best seasons of his career, helping the Astros win the World Series and the Cy Young with an 18-4 record and 1.75 ERA.Here are a few more standouts during MLB’s spring training games in Arizona and Florida:Ozzie Albies, 2B, Braves: The two-time All-Star is trying to bounce back from an injury-riddled 2022 season. The 26-year-old looks like he's back to his old self during Grapefruit League action with three homers and 11 RBIs.Shane Bieber, RHP, Guardians: The 2020 AL Cy Young winner has quietly been one of the game's most dominant pitchers over the past four seasons. That success shows no signs of stopping: The 27-year-old has a 1.62 ERA through four spring starts.Jonathan India, 2B, Reds: The 2021 NL Rookie of the Year went through a bit of a sophomore slump, batting just .249 with 10 homers last season. He’s batting .286 in spring training with a .415 OBP, one homer, eight RBIs and three stolen bases.Kevin Gausman, RHP, Blue Jays: The 32-year-old had a slow start to his career but has pitched his best the past two seasons. He was an All-Star with the Giants in 2021 before going to the Blue Jays last season and finishing with a 12-10 record and 3.35 ERA. He's looked great so far in the Grapefruit League, giving up just one unearned run and 18 strikeouts through 13 2/3 innings.Jake Cronenworth, 2B, Padres: The two-time All-Star has turned into a versatile piece in the Padres lineup, playing first, second and third base. He's off to another good start this spring, batting .432 with two homers in 37 spring at-bats.Nick Lodolo, LHP, Reds: The 6-foot-6 lefty had a encouraging start to his MLB career last season, with a 3.66 ERA and 131 strikeouts in his first 103 1/3 innings.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845132,Texas has Terry coaching among March Madness heavyweights,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Of the four coaches who led their teams to the semifinals of the Midwest Region at the NCAA Tournament, the most unlikely of them might feel the most at home when he walks into T-Mobile Center on Friday night.Sure, Kelvin Sampson has taken Oklahoma and Houston to the Final Four and is two wins away from guiding the Cougars back for the second time in three years. Miami coach Jim Larrañaga led George Mason to its own improbable Final Four in 2006 and had the Hurricanes a game away from the national semifinals last season.Xavier's Sean Miller has reached the Elite Eight twice, once at Arizona and once in his first stint with the Musketeers.Then there's Rodney Terry, the assistant-turned-savior of Texas, who not only kept the Longhorns from floundering after the firing of Chris Beard but has them thriving. The same coach that couldn't get Fresno State out of the first round, or get UTEP into the Big Dance, has the Longhorns playing in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2008.At T-Mobile Center, no less, where they just cut down the nets as Big 12 champions less than two weeks ago.“He embodies what we are and what we try to be every day,” said Timmy Allen, who leads the second-seeded Longhorns into Friday night's game against No. 3 seed Xavier. “Somebody who never shakes at adversity. Somebody who wakes up and tries to attack the day, to be great. When I've got somebody like that in my corner, I'll do anything for them.”To be sure, there is a certain Lonestar State feel to the Midwest Region, where top-seeded Houston also will be trying to take another step toward a hometown Final Four when it plays No. 5 seed Miami in the other semifinal.But there also is a feeling of been there, done that on the sidelines.The 67-year-old Sampson, once a coaching pariah, has Houston standing alongside Gonzaga as the only programs to reach the Sweet 16 in the past four tournaments. And led by the dynamic backcourt of Marcus Sasser and Jamal Shead, the Cougars are hoping to finally reach a Final Four with fans in attendance after losing in the national semifinals inside the COVID-19 “bubble” environment two years ago.“Coach Sampson gives his all every day for us. It's only right for us to give our all for him,"" Tramon Mark said. “Everything he's done for us throughout the season, it's only right that we go out and play hard for him.”That same feeling for Larrañaga exists at Miami, where the 73-year-old coach still relates to players that could be his grandkids. Larrañaga recently said he plans to coach “as long as the University of Miami would like me,” and given the way he's elevated the program from the depths of mediocrity, that could be a while.Much like Sampson, Miller has had his share of off-the-court trouble, a big part of his downfall at Arizona.Also much like Sampson's, his coaching acumen has never been questioned. He got Xavier to the Elite Eight in 2008, when he was just 39, and Arizona to regional semis in 2014 and ‘15 — though he has yet to make a Final Four.It's among these esteemed coaches that Terry finds himself.He barely had a winning record when he took over in December. There's every reason to believe, after two shots as a head coach, he never would have gotten another. Yet seizing an opportunity Terry never wanted — at least, in the manner he got it — the Longhorns have a chance to author a memorable ending to a season that began in turmoil.“Any time you’re in a situation that I was in, I think, one, you just have to be yourself. I don’t think you try to be something that you’re not,” Terry said. ""The other thing was continuing to have great chemistry. I think our staff, from the start, we were all committed to trying to try to have a great season and take this team as far as we could take them.“So enjoy this process,"" Terry said. ""You get a chance to do it maybe one time in your life. So just make the most of it.”HOUSTON'S HEALTHAll-American guard Marcus Sasser, who has been dealing with a groin injury, and Houston point guard Jamal Shead, who has had a sore knee, said they are nearing full strength as they prepare to face the Hurricanes.Sasser missed the AAC title game and the second half of the Cougars' NCAA Tournament opener, though he returned to score 22 against Auburn in the second round. Shead played both games last week and expects to be fully healthy.PACK’S FINANCIAL PACKAGEMiami guard Nijel Pack's transfer from Kansas State came with an $800,000 package in NIL money, one of the first deals widely publicized in the name, image and likeness era. And while Pack acknowledged the pressure to live up to expectations, he also said the publicity has “allowed me to look at things differently, made me mentally stronger.”“My parents have helped me manage my money and are making sure I’m not out buying things I don’t need,” he said. “I’m set really well with school, and as long I can do things I do normally, there’s nothing I need to go out and purchase.”___AP Sports Writer Eric Olson contributed to this report. ___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845133,Rap artist Afroman sued by officers who raided his home,"WINCHESTER, Ohio (AP) — Seven law enforcement officers have sued rap artist Afroman, accusing him of improperly using footage from a police raid on his Ohio home last year in his music videos.Four deputies, two sergeants and a detective with the Adams County Sheriff’s Office brought the suit earlier this month, claiming invasion of privacy. Other law enforcement officers who were involved in the raid are not named as plaintiffs.The plaintiffs say the rapper, whose real name is Joseph Foreman, took footage of their faces obtained during the August 2022 raid and used it in music videos and social media posts without their consent. They say that has caused them “emotional distress, embarrassment, ridicule, loss of reputation and humiliation.""The plaintiffs are seeking all of Foreman’s profits from his use of their personas. That includes proceeds from the songs, music videos and live event tickets, as well as the promotion of Foreman’s Afroman brand, under which he sells beer, marijuana, T-shirts and other merchandise. They also seek a court injunction to take down all videos and posts containing their personas.The suit names Foreman, his recording firm and a Texas-based media distribution company as defendants. In an Instagram post made Wednesday, Foreman vowed to countersue “for the undeniable damage this had on my clients, family, career and property.”Law enforcement officers were acting on a warrant that stated probable cause existed that drugs and drug paraphernalia would be found on Foreman’s property and that trafficking and kidnapping had taken place there, authorities have said. Those suspicions turned out to be unfounded, though, and the raid failed to turn up probative criminal evidence. No charges were ever filed.When cash seized during the raid was returned to Foreman, it appeared that hundreds of dollars were missing. A subsequent review by the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation determined that deputies had miscounted the amount seized during the raid itself.Foreman is best known for his songs “Because I Got High” and “Crazy Rap,” which were both featured on his album “The Good Times."" He is also known for his political activism and announced last December that he plans to run for president.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845134,Disney World reaches union deal with minimum $18 hourly wage,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Unions for service workers at Walt Disney World reached a tentative deal with the company on Thursday that would raise the starting minimum wage from $15 to $18 an hour by the end of the year in a pact that could set the basement for starting pay throughout central Florida's sprawling tourism industry.Disney World service workers who are in the six unions that make up the Service Trades Council Union coalition planned to vote next Wednesday on the contract proposal after rejecting an earlier offer that fell short of the $18 hourly minimum wage last month. The agreement covers around 45,000 service workers at the Disney theme park resort outside Orlando. Workers could see their hourly wages rise between $5.50 and $8.60 by the end of the five-year contract if it's approved, union leaders said.""Securing an $18 minimum hourly rate this year, increasing the overall economic value of Disney’s original offer, and ensuring full back pay for every worker are the priorities union members were determined to fight for,” said Matt Hollis, head of the coalition of unions. “Today, we won that fight.”Disney said in a statement that the tentative deal also included “industry-leading” benefits in health insurance coverage and tuition reimbursement.“Our cast members are central to Walt Disney World’s enduring magic, which is why we are pleased to have reached this tentative agreement,"" Jeff Vahle, president of Walt Disney World Resort, said in the statement.The contract with the service workers covers the costumed performers who perform as Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, bus drivers, culinary workers, lifeguards, theatrical workers and hotel housekeepers, representing more than half of the 70,000-plus workforce at Disney World. The contract approved five years ago made Disney the first major employer in central Florida to agree to a minimum hourly wage of $15, setting the trend for other workers in the region dominated by hospitality jobs.The contract proposal with the largest group of workers at the resort comes at a precarious time for Disney World. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the GOP-controlled Florida Legislature recently passed legislation giving the Republican governor the power to appoint the governing board of the district that oversees government services for the 27,000-acre (11,000-hectare) resort. The board previously had been controlled by Disney.The takeover of the Disney district began last year when the entertainment giant, facing intense pressure, publicly opposed the so-called “Don’t Say Gay"" legislation, which bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade and lessons deemed not age-appropriate.DeSantis has built a national reputation as a culture warrior ahead of an expected GOP presidential run.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845135,Creighton bucks March Madness trend in physical South Region,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Creighton's players watched in disbelief last weekend as North Carolina State and Baylor pulled out oxygen masks in Denver's high altitude.The Bluejays were in such good condition they didn't even need them to catch their breath.Now coach Greg McDermott will find out if his fast, sometimes frenetic offense can hold up against March's newest darling, 15th-seeded Princeton, as Creighton vies for its first-ever Elite Eight trip.“The guys playing a bunch of minutes are doing a good job off the floor to manage their bodies,” McDermott said Thursday before revisiting the Denver scene. “I think our guys kind of looked at that with a chuckle like, ‘Really, they’ve got an oxygen mask and we're the ones playing faster?'”Playing with pace is Creighton's trademark.It's one reason McDermott's son, Doug, left campus ranked No. 6 on the Division I career scoring list and how the elder McDermott took Northern Iowa to three straight NCAA Tournaments before earning eight more bids with Creighton.Among the teams left in the South Region, Creighton (23-12) is the exception. The physical group includes the two top rebounding teams and the fourth-best scoring defense in the Sweet 16.The Bluejays' roster features the fewest players listed at 6-foot-8 or taller, the second-lowest rebounding average (37.0) and the lowest rebounding margin (plus-3.7) in the South. And they are the only team with five players with double-figure scoring averages.Creighton's next test, Friday against Ivy League Tournament champion Princeton (23-8), promises to be its biggest yet. The Tigers held an 11-2 edge in second-chance points when they beat No. 2 seed Arizona in the first round, and had an astounding 19-2 advantage in their win over Missouri.McDermott didn't need a video session to notice.“Princeton does a great job of putting their body on you on the offensive glass, so we have to put our body on them first,” he said. “It's that simple. If they get to us first and they create an angle, they create a seal, I have to hope (the ball) bounces somewhere else or they're going to go get it.”Princeton has a more traditional style.Its offense runs through Tosan Evbuomwan, a 6-foot-8 forward with a potential NBA future who averages 14.8 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists in his final season. He could be defending Creighton's mobile 7-foot-1 center, Ryan Kalkbrenner.Tigers coach Mitch Henderson has only one complaint about his talented big man.“I often say to him, and we've spent a lot of time together, ‘I need you to influence the game physically early, right away,'” Henderson said. “He nods and then he doesn’t do it. He absorbs the game. It's exquisite watching him play.”After beating two higher-seeded teams last weekend in Sacramento, California, the Tigers' toughest task Friday may be staying focused.They've spent much of this week dealing with national media attention, speaking with some New Jersey's leading political figures and getting support pretty much everywhere they go.“I got a nice standing ovation at a restaurant back at Princeton, so that was a cool moment,” Evbuomwan said. “That was really special. I got to interact with the fans a little bit there.”If Creighton manages to navigate its way past the Tigers, it'll face another challenging matchup against either top-seeded Southeastern Conference champion Alabama or fifth-seeded San Diego State, the Mountain West champ.The Crimson Tide lead Division I in rebounds (44.4) and are ranked fifth in scoring (82.4 points) and eighth in rebound margin (plus-7.3).The Aztecs rely on a muscular, experienced lineup and a stingy defense that allows 63.1 points. San Diego State held its first two tourney opponents, Charleston and Furman, to their lowest scoring totals of the season.But, just like last week, McDermott and the Bluejays will continue playing their game, their way.“We're in a good place. Our guys are very confident in their teammates' ability to function on the offensive end,"" McDermott said. “I think guys are being champions in their roles.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845136,Kane sets scoring record in England's 2-1 win over Italy,"NAPLES, Italy (AP) — Harry Kane broke Wayne Rooney’s national team scoring record and England held on for a 2-1 win at Italy on the opening night of European Championship qualifying on Thursday.It was a small measure of revenge for England against the team it lost to in the European Championship final two years ago. Italy also won the last meeting in September in the Nations League.It marked England’s first win over Italy in a competitive match since a World Cup qualifier at Wembley back in 1977 — and its first away win over Italy since 1961.“We haven’t won in Italy for so long,"" Kane said. “To score and win the game is special.”It was another blow to an Italy squad that had failed to qualify for a second straight World Cup.“We knew it was a difficult game, but we conceded two goals from two corners,” Italy coach Roberto Mancini said. “The first half was tougher, obviously. But we dominated the second half and tried to get at least a draw, which I think would have been a fair result. It’s disappointing, but there’s a long road ahead.“We might be starting with an uphill struggle this time, but let’s hope we end it better.”Kane earned and converted a penalty toward the end of the first half for his 54th goal with England after Declan Rice’s opener at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium.“It means everything,” Kane said. “It had to be a penalty of course and once it hit the back of the net it was just so much emotion.”Argentine-born striker Mateo Retegui pulled one back for Italy on his debut early in the second half.England played the final 12 minutes with 10 men after Luke Shaw picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Retegui.Also in Group C, North Macedonia beat Malta 2-1.The penalty was assigned following a VAR review after it was determined that defender Giovanni Di Lorenzo touched the ball with his hand while attempting to prevent Kane from reaching a corner.Kane then stepped up to the spot and sent Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma the wrong way as he drilled a shot inside the right post in the 44th minute.Rooney played for England from 2003 to 2018, while Kane made his England debut in 2015.Kane was also involved in the first goal, when he had a shot blocked following a corner and Rice redirected in the rebound.Also, Jack Grealish missed an easy chance to make it 3-0 for England.It was nearly all England until Italy came alive after the break and Retegui finished off a counterattack following a passing sequence involving Marco Verratti and Lorenzo Pellegrini.“(Retegui) had difficulties in the first half, as the England defenders are physically strong and limited him,” Mancini said. “He moved better after the break, but he is young, he plays his football in Argentina, so he needs time.”Italy wore shirts that featured a dedication to former striker and delegation chief Gianluca Vialli, who died in January at age 58 from pancreatic cancer. “Luca, Azzurri per sempre” (Luca, Azzurri forever) was printed on the back of the collars.Italy visits Malta on Sunday, when England hosts Ukraine.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — An endangered hooded vulture escaped from a zoo aviary in the San Francisco Bay Area that was destroyed after a massive tree fell on it during a storm. But the bird has remained on zoo grounds, and officials were working Thursday to entice it back.The male hooded vulture and five other exotic birds, including two pied crows and three superb starlings, flew out from the aviary at the Oakland Zoo on Tuesday amid a wind-packed storm that pummeled the Bay Area, zoo spokeswoman Erin Dogan said.But the birds stayed on zoo grounds, and a team of at least 12 zoo workers armed with binoculars, nets and crates has already recovered the three starlings, Dogan said.“They are choosing to stay near the zoo and near the aviary because it seems that’s where they feel safe,” she said.The team has been working since Tuesday to entice the vulture with dead rats and the crows with mealworms to trap them and bring them back to safety, she said.All the birds hatched in captivity, and it's not clear if they would know how to survive outside the zoo, Dogan said.“These are all birds that were raised in human care, so they haven’t had to fend for themselves,” she said.None of these birds are birds of prey, and they are not a threat to other animals or people, Dogan said.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845150,"Iowa, Louisville bring March Madness experience to Seattle","SEATTLE (AP) — While most of the Sweet 16 is filled with top seeds, the Seattle 4 Regional is the landing place for teams that pulled off NCAA Tournament upsets to advance.Caitlin Clark's second-seeded Iowa squad is the only one of the top four teams in this region to make it all the way West. And though No. 5 Louisville, No. 6 Colorado and No. 8 Mississippi knocked off the top seeds on their home courts to reach the regional semifinals, they're all from Power Five conferences and none see themselves as underdogs.“You aren’t advancing to this time of the year if you aren’t a good basketball team,” Louisville coach Jeff Walz said. “Ole Miss plays in a great league against great teams, same thing as we do. ... Am I completely shocked? No.”Clark and the Hawkeyes will face the Buffaloes in the first semifinal Friday night. The Cardinals play the Rebels in the other one. The winners will square off Sunday with a trip to the Final Four on the line.Sweet 16 experience could be a factor in both matchups. The Cardinals are a regular in the regional semifinals, now appearing in the last six, while Ole Miss is making its first appearance since 2007. The Buffaloes advanced this far for the first time in 20 years after beating Duke in overtime. Iowa is making its third trip to the Sweet 16 in the past four tournaments.Clark was a huge reason why Iowa didn't also lose in the second round. After being upset a year earlier in the round of 32, Clark wouldn't let that happen again in a tough game with Georgia. She either scored or assisted on 30 of Iowa’s 33 second-half points.Now she'll try and get the team to its first regional final since 2019.It's been a lot longer for the Buffaloes. Most of the players on the roster are too young to remember it — or weren't even born. Now they are writing their own piece of Colorado history.“We have such a storied history of success when Ceal Berry was our coach,” Colorado coach JR Payne said. “We knew the potential was here. It had been a long time since we had been on this stage.”The Buffaloes didn't have much time to soak in the moment because of the quick turnaround. Playing a late game at Duke on Monday night, Colorado flew home the next day before flying to Seattle on Wednesday.“This week has been a whirlwind, we were up really late that night,” Payne said. “I was doing laundry, helping my kids with homework and get my children organized.”Mississippi had an easier time as the Rebels stayed on the West Coast after upsetting Stanford on Sunday. The team got to explore Seattle on Wednesday, visiting the Space Needle and other local attractions.“Yesterday we used it as a bonding experience,"" Mississippi guard Myah Taylor said. ""That's very important. Those bonding moments outside of basketball fuel us on the court.”SOCCER SKILLSClark said she grew up playing soccer and probably could have been a Division I player in the sport but gave it up in high school.Clark was clear that her role on the pitch was “definitely not defense.""“I was the forward, I scored the goals. Soccer was the first sport I played and I actually played all the way through my sophomore year of high school,” she said. ""It was really hard to give up, but in Iowa, soccer is in the spring which was when AAU basketball was, so I had to make a decision.""Clark credits her excellent passing — she led the nation in assists this season — to her soccer days.“I’m able to anticipate a lot of things and know where I need to get my teammates the ball and on time,”"" she said. “So I think understanding angles and anticipation is just like the biggest two things that help me be a good passer.”FAR AWAY FROM HOMEIowa is 1,500 miles from Seattle. Still, the Hawkeyes are the second-closest school of the eight teams at the regional. Colorado is 200 miles closer, earning the ""most local” award here.Hawkeyes coach Lisa Bluder would love to see a closer regional to Iowa.“I would hope that Des Moines would bid for this. You look at Iowa, Iowa State and Drake, three of the four Division I schools from Iowa were invited to NCAA Tournament with the automatic bids,” Bluder said. “With how well Iowa State and us draw, it would make sense. Des Moines should try for this, they hosted a site for the men this year ... we'd sell out.”The NCAA has already locked in regionals through 2026.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845151,"Ronaldo, Kane break records in wins for Portugal, England","It was a record-breaking night for Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Kane as qualifying for the European Championship in 2024 got underway on Thursday.Already the leading scorer in men's international soccer, the 38-year-old Ronaldo now has more international appearances than any other male player after racking up No. 197 in Portugal's 4-0 win over Liechtenstein.The former Real Madrid and Manchester United striker marked the occasion by converting a penalty and adding another second-half goal — a powerful free kick from the edge of the area — to move onto 120 in international matches.Kane, meanwhile, became England's outright leading scorer of all time by netting a first-half penalty in a 2-1 win at Italy. It lifted Kane to 54 goals for his country, one more than Wayne Rooney.Qualifying for Euro 2024, which will take place in Germany, started three months after the World Cup finished.BELATED REVENGECall it belated revenge for England.The meeting with Italy in Naples was a repeat of the Euro 2020 final won by the Azzurri at Wembley Stadium. The teams have met since then — twice, in fact, with Italy gaining a win and a draw in Nations League qualifying last year.This time, England held on after first-half goals by Declan Rice and Kane, who tucked away a spot kick awarded following a VAR review after it was determined that Italy defender Giovanni Di Lorenzo touched the ball with his hand while attempting to prevent Kane from reaching a corner.Kane had missed his last penalty attempt for his country, late in the 2-1 loss to France in the World Cup quarterfinals last year.“It had to be a penalty, of course,” a smiling Kane said of his record goal.Argentina-born forward Mateo Retegui, who has Italian citizenship through his maternal grandmother, pulled a goal back on his debut and England played with 10 men from the 80th after left back Luke Shaw collected two yellow cards in the space of 54 seconds.Italy lost to England in a competitive match for the first time since a World Cup qualifier at Wembley back in 1977.It was a disappointing way for the Azzurri to start their latest qualifying campaign for a major tournament, having failed to get into the last two World Cups.“We might be starting with an uphill struggle this time,"" Italy coach Roberto Mancini said, ""but let’s hope we end it better.”North Macedonia beat Malta 2-1 in the other match in Group C, which also contains Ukraine.EASY FOR PORTUGALRoberto Martinez enjoyed a comfortable start to his tenure as Portugal coach after handing Ronaldo a start against Liechtenstein.The striker was left out of Portugal's knockout-stage matches at the World Cup but was selected up front alongside Joao Felix — and repaid the faith shown in him by Martinez, who left his role as Belgium after the tournament in Qatar.Joao Cancelo and Bernardo Silva scored before Ronaldo's double in Lisbon.“It’s a new cycle,"" Martinez said. ""It is very important that a player shows commitment and that he can use his experience. Cristiano has that: A lot of experience and a lot of commitment to the national team.”Also in Group J, Bosnia-Herzegovina beat Iceland 3-0, while Slovakia and Luxembourg drew 0-0.POIGNANT AT PARKENThere was a sense of poignancy when Denmark and Finland met for their opening Group H qualifier at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen.The last time the teams met was at Euro 2020 and it was the game — and same venue — when Denmark playmaker Christian Eriksen collapsed with cardiac arrest.Nearly two years later, Denmark won 3-1 thanks to a hat trick from striker Rasmus Hojlund in his first start for his country.Slovenia beat Kazakhstan 2-1 and Northern Ireland defeated San Marino 2-0.RUSSIA FRIENDLYFor the first time since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, Russia played a soccer match against a nation from outside the borders of the old Soviet Union.A 1-1 draw with Iran in Tehran was played in front of 78,000 spectators and comes after months of Russia seeking closer ties with the Asian Football Confederation. Russia is banned by UEFA from competing in qualifying for Euro 2024.Both goals came from the penalty spot. Iran striker Mehdi Taremi canceled out the opener by Anton Miranchuk, one of those selected in an entirely Russia-based squad.Russia has previously played Kyrgyzstan, winning 2-1, along with 0-0s against Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.___Steve Douglas is at https://twitter.com/sdouglas80___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845152,Xavier's Souley Boum is savoring his only March Madness,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Souley Boum never played on a losing team at his previous two schools. He also never played in an NCAA Tournament.So Boum is savoring every moment of his one and only season at Xavier, the school he chose because he felt it gave him his best opportunity to play in March Madness. The joy on his face was obvious as he sat down with teammates to meet the media Thursday to discuss the Musketeers' Midwest Region semifinal matchup against Texas on Friday night.“I still can’t believe that I’m up here today with these guys,"" Boum said. “It’s just been a dream come true, and I’m happy that I’m here. This is what I came here for.”Xavier might not be at the Sweet 16 if it weren't for the addition of Boum. He's elevated a program that won the NIT a year ago and is now bidding to make a regional final in the first season of coach Sean Miller's second stint at the school.Boum will face his old coach from UTEP, Rodney Terry, who has served as Texas' interim coach since Chris Beard's firing in December.“It's crazy because it just shows you how everything comes full circle,” Boum said. “We have a great relationship. I know he cares about me. I care about him.”Boum said Terry has stayed in touch, and Terry texted him a couple times this week to tell him he's happy for him.“Stuff like this, it rarely happens,” Boum said. “So I’m just trying to soak it all in, appreciate everything about it. I’m just going to try to do my best to give him some fits tomorrow.”Terry said Boum is one of his favorite players to coach, that he's “wired to score,” and that his drive to win is his greatest attribute.“Love him like my own son,” Terry said. “We’ll be major competitors come Friday night, though. He wants to win. I want to win.”Boum has been a do-it-all player for the Musketeers. He's second in the Big East in scoring, third in 3-point shooting, free-throw shooting and minutes, and fourth in assist-turnover ratio. He arrived in Kansas City with more than 2,400 career points.“Could I have projected he would be a first-team All-Big East player? No way,” Miller said. “Not that I didn’t think he’d be as good as he is, but he’s been a super player for us. If you talk to other coaches in the Big East, they’ll tell you he’s a big difference in our team.”Boum was expected to give the Musketeers a big jolt on the offensive end, and he's done that by averaging 16.5 points per game, but he also melded with his teammates immediately.“I feel like we all clicked together,"" Colby Jones said, ""and Souley just kind of came in and was that fifth piece we needed.”Boum has made the difference between winning and losing on multiple occasions. Xavier has nine wins by five points or fewer. He's 33 for 34 on free throws in the final minute of the last 21 games.“He has that clutch gene in him,” Adam Kunkel said.The 24-year-old Boum was born in Oakland, California, two years after his mother, Mariam Diallo Eyenga, immigrated from the West African country of Guinea.He was under-recruited coming out of high school and landed at San Francisco, where he made the West Coast Conference all-freshman team. Boum transferred to UTEP and had to sit out a season under the NCAA's previous transfer rules. Boum played his last season at UTEP for Joe Golding, who took over after Terry left for an assistant's job at Texas. He scored at least 20 points in nine of his last 12 games for the Miners.Miller saw Boum score 16 points for UTEP in a 69-61 loss to Miller’s Arizona team two years ago. When Boum went into the transfer portal after last season, Miller knew he wanted him.“He came to us for all the right reasons,” Miller said, “and he’s meshed with the group and our team and our university, in almost like a seamless way, as if he has been with us longer than a year. It’s going to be sad when he goes.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845154,House GOP fails to override Biden veto of ESG investing ban,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House failed Thursday to override President Joe Biden's first veto — of a Republican-led bill that would have banned the consideration of environmental, social or governance issues in retirement and other investment decisions.Republicans failed to mount the necessary two-thirds votes needed in the House to override the president's veto of the “ESG” investment bill. The override failed on a 219-200 vote mostly along party lines as most Democrats opposed.The standoff was a first test of the strength of the new Republican majority in the House as it confronts the Democratic president in the White House.House Republicans had succeeded in passing the legislation through Congress last month, part of their agenda to undo so-called “woke” government policies that strive to bring new ways of thinking about social and environmental issues with equity and accountability.The legislation was a pushback against the idea of “ESG” investing, which takes into account a company's environmental social and governance record, including on issues like climate change.Including such factors in financial planning has gained in popularity as Americans seek different options for where they park their retirement savings and other investments.The U.S. Department of Labor had issued a rule last December saying investment plan fiduciaries may consider climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors in making investment decisions.But the newly empowered House Republicans sought to roll back the Labor Department rule and effectively reinstate a Trump-era policy banning the investment practice. The measure gained some support in the Democratic-held Senate.Using special procedures, the House and Senate approved the rollback with a simple majority in both chambers, but there was not enough support in Congress to mount the veto override.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845155,Norfolk Southern won't push for one-person train crews,"Railroad Norfolk Southern is backing away from its push to reduce its train crews down to one person, the company said Thursday in a joint announcement with the nation’s largest rail union.The two sides said they will instead focus on quality of life issues for employees, such as scheduling and days off, during their ongoing contract talks.Railroad safety, including staffing levels, has come under scrutiny since a fiery freight train derailment involving cars carrying toxic chemicals in early February led to evacuations in East Palestine, Ohio.No one was immediately injured in the Feb. 3 derailment, but state and local officials decided to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from five tanker cars, prompting the evacuation of half of the roughly 5,000 residents. Billowing smoke above the village and reports from residents that they still suffer from illnesses, turned high-level attention to railroad safety and how dangerous materials are transported.Bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress following the derailment would require train crews to continue to have two people, although the train that derailed in East Palestine had a three-person crew.Railroad worker unions argue that operational changes and widespread job cuts across the industry in the past six years have made railroads riskier. They say employees are spread thin after nearly one-third of all rail jobs were eliminated and train crews, in particular, deal with fatigue because they are on call 24/7The Federal Railroad Administration also is considering a rule that would require two-person crews in most instances.Earlier this week, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw offered support for some parts of the railroad safety bill while testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee, but he declined when pressed to support a two-person requirement for crews.Instead, he said, “We are a data-driven organization and I’m not aware of any data that links crew size with safety.”The International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers union has long opposed attempts by the nation's railroads to cut down crew sizes, citing safety concerns.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845157,"Other states are copying Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" efforts","LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Florida's move to expand its prohibition on teaching sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom comes as Republican lawmakers in other states are pursuing their own versions of what critics have dubbed the “Don't Say Gay” law.The prohibition signed last year by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is widely expected to announce a presidential run soon, is being copied by GOP lawmakers pushing for similar limits on what can be taught in public schools.DeSantis and other supporters of the prohibitions portray them as ways to protect children from being taught about inappropriate material. But critics say they are marginalizing LGBTQ people and creating a chilling effect on what teachers and students can discuss.FLORIDA'S EXPANSIONThe Florida state Board of Education is set to vote next month on an effort by DeSantis' administration to ban lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity from grades 4 to 12, unless required by existing state standards or as part of reproductive health instruction that students can choose not to take.The initial law that DeSantis championed last spring bans those lessons in kindergarten through the third grade, or instruction that could be deemed inappropriate for students.The governor’s education department commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said the DeSantis’ administration’s move to extend the ban to the 12th grade is intended to clarify confusion around what is deemed age appropriate in later grades and to reinforce that teachers adhere to existing state standards that guide curriculums.“This rule basically says that we’re sticking to the standards, and when you’re talking about K through 12 instruction, all the way to 12th grade, these standards don’t incorporate gender ideology or any of these theories in math, social studies, reading or anything else,” Diaz said at a news conference Thursday.OTHER STATESTwo other states — Alabama and Arkansas — have enacted laws similar to Florida’s since last year.Alabama’s law, signed last year by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey, prohibits classroom instruction in public schools on gender identity or sexual orientation from kindergarten through 5th grade “in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”Arkansas’ prohibition was adopted as part of a 145-page education overhaul signed this month by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders that also included a new school voucher program and an increase in teacher minimum pay. The law prohibits classroom instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation before 5th grade.At least 30 proposals similar to Florida’s law have been filed in 16 states, and they vary by ages. They make up more than a quarter of the bills filed this year to restrict what can be taught in the classroom, said Jeremy Young, senior manager of free expression and education at PEN America.“They have become the second most common proposed speech restriction in state legislatures after anti-critical race theory bills,” Young said.The proposals also come as statehouses have seen a surge of bills this year targeting the transgender community, including proposals to ban gender-affirming medical care for trans youth.DeSantis' administration is pushing to expand the state's ban even as GOP lawmakers are advancing a proposal to extend it to the 8th grade.A Missouri bill to ban K-12 public school staff from teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation is pending before a House committee.THE DEBATEThe Florida law reads as follows: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”When he signed the bill last year, DeSantis said the measure would “make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.”Critics have argued that the law’s language is vague and doesn’t make clear exactly what constitutes “instruction” or “age appropriate” lessons.“There's no guidance in any of this, none whatsoever, which has made it the wild, wild west,” said Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association.When the law was first implemented, there were concerns that it would stifle classroom discussions and create an environment where LGTBQ people would feel ostracized. Still, most educators did not expect a major change in lesson plans, given that one of the key criticisms of the law was that teachers do not cover such subjects in early grades.Opponents of the Florida law and similar proposals say the restrictions are creating a chilling effect on teachers.“Teachers are wondering, can I put up a rainbow sticker? Can I talk about this LGBTQ+ historical figure? Can I put up a picture of my wife if I'm a woman?” Courtnay Avant, legislative counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said. “That is a big concern, where does the censorship begin and end with these bills?”THE FALLOUTFlorida's law sparked a feud between the state and Disney, one of the state's largest employers and political donors. Disney publicly opposed the law and said it was pausing political donations in the state.In what was widely seen as retaliation, the Republican-dominated Legislature approved a measure backed by DeSantis to dissolve a self-governing district controlled by Walt Disney World over its properties in Florida. Lawmakers eventually gave DeSantis control of the board.The prohibition has also faced court challenges, though one federal lawsuit was tossed by a judge last month. Another lawsuit filed by LGBTQ students, parents and their families — as well as several civil rights groups — remains pending in federal court.___Associated Press writers Anthony Izaguirre in Tallahassee, Florida; Summer Ballentine in Jefferson City, Missouri; and Kim Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845158,March Madness: Alabama and surprising bunch remain in South,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Alabama was expected to be in the Sweet 16 as the overall top seed in the NCAA Tournament.Few thought the teams standing between the Crimson Tide and a trip to the Final Four would be No. 5 seed San Diego State, sixth-seeded Creighton and 15th-seeded Princeton.A win over Alabama (31-5) could elevate any of those schools to the status of March Madness legend. Coach Nate Oats understands the pressure his team faces when it faces San Diego State Friday night as it seeks its first Elite Eight berth since 2004.“We’ve taken enough losses against good teams and some that weren’t as good to where they know what they have to do on any given night,” Oats said. “From here on out I think we’re going to be playing really good teams.”Friday’s other semifinal in Louisville features Creighton (23-12) against Princeton (23-8), which has proven anything is possible with its wins over No. 2 seed Arizona and No. 7 seed Missouri.The lower-seeded teams that advanced in the South hardly came out of nowhere.San Diego State (29-6) has been ranked in the AP Top 25 most of the season and enters with 12 wins in 13 games, including the past six. The Mountain West champions Aztecs have held their own against Power Five schools, beating Stanford and Ohio State before falling to Arizona and Arkansas during a challenging November slate that helped prepare them for this stage.They’ve averaged nearly 66 points per game during their current streak — which includes a 23-point, second-round rout of No. 13 seed Furman — while holding five of six opponents under 50 points. SDSU faces a tall task against an Alabama squad averaging 82.3 points per game.“We’re just playing good basketball, and our opponent has always been ourselves,” Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher said Thursday. ""Our standards are to play up to whatever our capabilities are, regardless of the opponent. So if we play really good basketball, we’ll have a chance to win the game.”Princeton has also won six straight. Beating the Pac-12 Conference Wildcats 59-55 was impressive enough for the Tigers, who went on to dominate Missouri of the Southeastern Conference 78-63, the biggest margin of victory ever by a No. 15 seed.The Ivy League champions are in their first Sweet 16 since 1967 and embracing the underdog label, even though they feel like they belong.“Personally, I love it,” senior guard Ryan Langborg said. “It allows us to play with a confidence not only amongst ourselves, but amongst our fans and allows us to get the crowd involved. Which I think always helps with momentum.”Princeton will meet a Creighton squad in its second Sweet 16 in three years. The Bluejays went 2-4 against Power Five schools during the regular season but regrouped in the NCAA Tournament to beat North Carolina State and No. 3 seed Baylor, the 2021 national champion.BRAND EXPANSIONAlabama’s status as the No. 1 overall seed has expanded its athletic profile beyond the powerhouse football program. Crimson Tide football coach Nick Saban was at practice this week.“I feel like we have a winning school,” All-America freshman forward Brandon Miller said. “It’s just not about the football team at Alabama. I feel like there’s Alabama basketball, Alabama football, Alabama track. All the organizations there, I feel like it’s just a winning program.”Football still loomed over the news conference, with TVs in the media room showing Alabama’s pro day as basketball players arrived to answer questions.COURSE LOAD MANAGEMENTPrinceton coach Mitch Henderson said his seniors had received welcome extensions to hand in their theses on heavy subjects, such as this offering from Keeshawn Kellman:“My thesis is on how professional sports performance in a season can affect social behaviors in a community,” said Kellman, a sociology major. “Like, crime rates, voter turnout, things like that. It's been a lot trying to balance this along with the tournament, but we're going to get it done.”OMEN FOR SUCCESSThe winner of this regional can feel pretty good about its national title prospects.The last two times the KFC Yum! Center hosted Sweet 16 and Elite Eight games, the eventual national champion played there. Virginia beat Purdue 80-75 in overtime for the South Region title in 2019 on the way to its first NCAA crown. Second-seeded Villanova did so three years earlier, topping No. 1 seed Kansas 64-59 during its run to a second national championship.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845159,"Los Angeles school strike ends, but no deal announced","LOS ANGELES (AP) — A three-day strike by workers in the Los Angeles Unified School District ended Thursday, but it wasn't immediately clear if any progress was made in negotiations for higher pay for teachers’ aides, bus drivers, custodians and other support staff in the nation's second-largest school system.Teachers joined the picket lines in solidarity, shutting down instruction for the district’s half-million students during the walkout by members of Local 99 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 30,000 of the lowest-paid school workers. Support staffers earn, on average, about $25,000 a year in Los Angeles, barely enough to get by in one of the most expensive cities in America.Mayor Karen Bass stepped in as mediator Wednesday after district Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho accused the union of refusing to negotiate.Max Arias, executive director of SEIU Local 99, said the union was grateful that Bass was helping “find a path out of our current impasse.” There was no indication Thursday how the arbitration was going.“Education workers have always been eager to negotiate as long as we are treated with respect and bargained with fairly, and with the mayor’s leadership we believe that is possible,” Arias said.Carvalho has called the school district's offer “historic.” It includes a cumulative 23% raise, starting with 2% retroactive as of the 2020-21 school year and ending with 5% in 2024-25. The package would also give a one-time 3% bonus to those who have been on the job more than a year. It would also add more full-time positions and expand health care benefits.Sofia Munoz, a special education teacher’s assistant, said she hoped the labor action sent a message to Carvalho.“We’re hoping just to bring awareness and let the superintendent know that we’re here to make a difference,"" Munoz said Thursday at a rally marking the strike's final day.The school district confirmed in a statement Wednesday that school officials have been in talks with union leaders with help from the mayor.“We continue to do everything possible to reach an agreement that honors the hard work of our employees, corrects historical inequities, maintains the financial stability of the district and brings students back to the classroom,"" the statement said.The union said employees, including special education assistants, cafeteria workers and gardeners, would return to work on Friday.The strike concluded after putting a spotlight on the issue of notoriously underpaid workers who serve as the backbone of schools across the country.SEIU Local 99 says many of its members live in poverty because of low pay or limited work hours while struggling with inflation and the high cost of housing. The union is seeking a 30% raise for workers.While the Los Angeles Unified School District is unique because of its size, the walkout could have lessons for other systems in the state, said Troy Flint, spokesperson for the California School Board Association.“LAUSD could be the canary in the coalmine when you look at the potential for difficult labor negotiations in school districts across California,” he said.Districts are coping with staff shortages and other challenges exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, while working to address other longstanding issues including student performance that predated the pandemic, according to Flint. In addition, emergency pandemic funding from the state was set to expire next year, which will stretch district finances even thinner after decades of underfunding, he said.“It's natural that employees want to better compensated for their important work,” Flint said. “There is a lot of tension between what districts want to do and what they have the capacity to do.”Leaders of United Teachers of Los Angeles, which represents 35,000 educators, counselors and other staff, pledged solidarity with the strikers.Experts say it is unusual for different unions in the same school district to band together but the unified labor action in Los Angeles could mark an inflection point.Luz Varela, a teacher’s aide, said workers felt like they had to strike.“I feel sad that we have to go through this because we’re missing our kids, but we’re doing this for our kids,"" she said. “I feel that we deserve a little bit more. It’s not all about the money. This is about our future for our kids.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845160,Trump arrested? Putin jailed? Fake AI images spread online,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump getting gang-tackled by riot-gear-clad New York City police officers. Russian President Vladimir Putin in prison grays behind the bars of a dimly lit concrete cell.The highly detailed, sensational images have inundated Twitter and other platforms in recent days, amid news that Trump faces possible criminal charges and the International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin.But neither visual is remotely real. The images — and scores of variations littering social media — were produced using increasingly sophisticated and widely accessible image generators powered by artificial intelligence.Misinformation experts warn the images are harbingers of a new reality: waves of fake photos and videos flooding social media after major news events and further muddying fact and fiction at crucial times for society.“It does add noise during crisis events. It also increases the cynicism level,” said Jevin West, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle who focuses on the spread of misinformation. “You start to lose trust in the system and the information that you are getting.”While the ability to manipulate photos and create fake images isn’t new, AI image generator tools by Midjourney, DALL-E and others are easier to use. They can quickly generate realistic images — complete with detailed backgrounds — on a mass scale with little more than a simple text prompt from users.Some of the recent images have been driven by this month's release of a new version of Midjourney’s text-to-image synthesis model, which can, among other things, now produce convincing images mimicking the style of news agency photos.In one widely-circulating Twitter thread, Eliot Higgins, founder of Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism collective, used the latest version of the tool to conjure up scores of dramatic images of Trump’s fictional arrest.The visuals, which have been shared and liked tens of thousands of times, showed a crowd of uniformed officers grabbing the Republican billionaire and violently pulling him down onto the pavement.Higgins, who was also behind a set of images of Putin being arrested, put on trial and then imprisoned, says he posted the images with no ill intent. He even stated clearly in his Twitter thread that the images were AI-generated.Still, the images were enough to get him locked out of the Midjourney server, according to Higgins. The San Francisco-based independent research lab didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.“The Trump arrest image was really just casually showing both how good and bad Midjourney was at rendering real scenes,” Higgins wrote in an email. “The images started to form a sort of narrative as I plugged in prompts to Midjourney, so I strung them along into a narrative, and decided to finish off the story.”He pointed out the images are far from perfect: in some, Trump is seen, oddly, wearing a police utility belt. In others, faces and hands are clearly distorted.But it’s not enough that users like Higgins clearly state in their posts that the images are AI-generated and solely for entertainment, says Shirin Anlen, media technologist at Witness, a New York-based human rights organization that focuses on visual evidence.Too often, the visuals are quickly reshared by others without that crucial context, she said. Indeed, an Instagram post sharing some of Higgins' images of Trump as if they were genuine garnered more than 79,000 likes.“You’re just seeing an image, and once you see something, you cannot unsee it,” Anlen said.In another recent example, social media users shared a synthetic image supposedly capturing Putin kneeling and kissing the hand of Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The image, which circulated as the Russian president welcomed Xi to the Kremlin this week, quickly became a crude meme.It’s not clear who created the image or what tool they used, but some clues gave the forgery away. The heads and shoes of the two leaders were slightly distorted, for example, and the room’s interior didn’t match the room where the actual meeting took place.With synthetic images becoming increasingly difficult to discern from the real thing, the best way to combat visual misinformation is better public awareness and education, experts say.“It’s just becoming so easy and it’s so cheap to make these images that we should do whatever we can to make the public aware of how good this technology has gotten,” West said.Higgins suggests social media companies could focus on developing technology to detect AI-generated images and integrate that into their platforms.Twitter has a policy banning “synthetic, manipulated, or out-of-context media” with the potential to deceive or harm. Annotations from Community Notes, Twitter's crowd-sourced fact checking project, were attached to some tweets to include the context that the Trump images were AI-generated.When reached for comment Thursday, the company emailed back only an automated response.Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to comment. Some of the fabricated Trump images were labeled as either “false” or “missing context” through its third-party fact-checking program, of which the AP is a participant.Arthur Holland Michel, a fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs in New York who is focused on emerging technologies, said he worries the world isn't ready for the impending deluge.He wonders how deepfakes involving ordinary people — harmful fake pictures of an ex-partner or a colleague, for example — will be regulated.“From a policy perspective, I’m not sure we’re prepared to deal with this scale of disinformation at every level of society,” Michel wrote in an email. “My sense is that it’s going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.”___Associated Press reporter David Klepper in Washington contributed to this story.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845161,Minnesota moves to strengthen status as 'trans refuge state',"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — The Minnesota House was moving Thursday toward strengthening the state's protections for children and their families who come for gender-affirming care by making Minnesota a “trans refuge state,” bucking a national backlash against transgender rights.Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order two weeks ago to protect the rights of people from Minnesota and other states to receive gender-affirming health care in the state. The bill on which the House was slated to begin debate Thursday night covers much of the same ground, but supporters said a statute would provide stronger, more permanent protections. Passage was expected.The chief author of the House bill is Democratic Rep. Leigh Finke, of St. Paul, the state's first openly transgender legislator. She was named Woman of the Year for Minnesota by USA Today on Sunday for her activism on behalf of trans youth. Her bill is meant to protect trans people, families and care providers from a range of legal repercussions for traveling to Minnesota for gender-affirming care.“Gender-affirming care is lifesaving health care,"" Finke said at a news conference before the debate. ""Withholding or delaying gender-affirming care can have a dramatic impact on the mental health of any individual who needs it. Rates of depression, suicide, substance abuse are dramatically higher in transgender and gender-expansive individuals who lack access to care.”“To all those families across the United States that are afraid and wondering where they can go for help, Minnesota is saying, ‘We see you, we love you and you belong here,’” Finke said.Hundreds of protesters chanted for and against the bill outside the House chamber before the debate. Black signs with white text said “Protect Kids” as dozens yelled, “Vote no!” Others shouted back, “Vote yes!” and held signs with colors from the trans flag -- baby blue and pink -- that read, “You belong here.”Cries of “No!” and “Yes!” echoed through the halls of the Capitol as security personnel guarded the locked doors of the chamber.Gender-affirming care includes a wide range of social and medical interventions, including hormone treatments, puberty blockers and gender-reassignment surgery, though doctors who work in the field say such surgeries on minors are very rare.Whether such care is right for minors has become a major flash point in the culture wars across the country. The unicameral Nebraska Legislature gave preliminary approval earlier Thursday to a ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Georgia's governor, Republican Brian Kemp, signed a ban Thursday. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, another Republican, did so Wednesday. The Missouri Senate gave preliminary approval to a ban Tuesday. Bans were enacted earlier in South Dakota,Utah and Mississippi.Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd, medical director for the Gender Health Program at Children’s Minnesota, said her pediatric health system gets calls regularly from frightened parents in states with bans.“Bans on gender-affirming care are creating geographical disparities where the most privileged become domestic refugees, fleeing their home states to access health care, and those families who already struggle to access health care due to racial and socioeconomic barriers, they’re left without any care at all,” Goepferd told reporters.House Republicans held their own news conference before the debate to denounce the bill as misguided. Rep. Peggy Scott, of Andover, said the bill “undermines parental rights, and most concerningly, has zero guardrails to protect our kids.”Minnesota's Catholic bishops, who were at the Capitol Thursday to lobby the governor and lawmakers on a variety of issues, strongly oppose the trans refuge bill. Bishop Robert Barron of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester said in an interview he told Walz that Pope Francis instructed bishops to “stand against the gender ideology.” He said they worry about the long-term repercussions of young people making decisions that could permanently affect the rest of their lives.“Making Minnesota basically a sanctuary state for those that want this kind of surgery, we think that's moving it way too fast,” the bishop said. He added that they worry that Catholic doctors, nurses or health care institutions could be obligated to provide gender affirming care.A similar bill is awaiting further action in the Minnesota Senate after getting a hearing last month. The chief Senate author, Sen. Erin Maye Quade, of Apple Valley, said in an interview Wednesday that she expects a floor vote there soon. But she said she’s still working to make sure it has the necessary support in the Senate, where Democrats hold just a one-seat majority.___Trisha Ahmed contributed to this story.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845163,Judge allows anonymous jury for Trump rape lawsuit trial,"NEW YORK (AP) — Jurors’ names will be kept secret at the upcoming civil trial in a writer’s rape lawsuit against former President Donald Trump, a judge ruled Thursday, citing “a very strong risk” they would otherwise face harassment and more.Anonymous juries are unusual, particularly outside criminal cases. The Associated Press and the Daily News of New York objected to the plan to conceal the identities of jurors in the trial over columnist E. Jean Carroll's claim — denied by Trump — that the Republican raped her in the 1990s.But U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said he was concerned that jurors would be subjected to unwanted attention from the media and “harassment or worse” from supporters of a president who has railed against the judicial process, or from people unhappy with any verdict that might ensue.“On the basis of the unprecedented circumstances in which this trial will take place, including the extensive pretrial publicity and a very strong risk that jurors will fear harassment, unwanted invasions of their privacy and retaliation,” he wrote, “there is strong reason to believe that the jury needs the protection.”Carroll's lawyers declined to comment. Trump lawyer Alina Habba said she didn't want jurors “to feel any outside pressure or influence"" at the trial, set to start late next month.“Anonymity will help ensure that their decision is based solely on the facts presented to them,” Habba said, insisting those facts would “irrefutably vindicate” Trump.Besides having their names kept confidential, jurors will be transported to and from court and sequestered from the public while on breaks there.There is a history of federal courts finding that jurors' names are public record, and reasoning that such openness quells potential public suspicions about the selection process. But courts also have allowed exceptions to protect the jury, sometimes in cases involving allegations of terrorism, organized crime or prior jury tampering.This winter, for example, anonymous juries were used in the Brooklyn federal criminal trials of a New Yorker convicted of fighting for the Islamic State extremist group in Syria, and of a former cabinet-level Mexican official convicted of shielding violent drug cartels from police in exchange for huge bribes.Carroll's case isn't a criminal one, though it involves an alleged rape. The former Elle magazine advice columnist says Trump forced himself on her in a dressing room in a luxury department store after they met by chance and joked about trying on lingerie.Trump denies sexually assaulting or even knowing her, while repeatedly adding that she's “not my type.”They were photographed together with their then-spouses at a 1987 social event, an image Trump has dismissed as a momentary encounter he doesn't remember. He misidentified Carroll as one of his ex-wives when he was shown the picture last year while being questioned under oath in the lawsuit.The Associated Press generally does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.",2023/03/24,,World

The demonstrative display of closeness between him and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and the signed new pact between their two nations are considered to be a sign of a strategic consolidation of relations between the two powers.

Did Putin really kneel before Xi?DW Fact check: False.Putin did not kneel before Xi Jinping: The photo is fake. Aside from the fact that such a gesture of submission would be highly unrealistic on the part of a head of state, our research suggests that the image was generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) app. There are a number of clues that point in that direction, starting with the results produced when the image is run through a reverse image search tool. The oldest result is dated March 20 but a more concrete source cannot be found for the image, even when different tools are used.Upon closer inspection, several puzzling details in the image catch the eye. The rear shoe of the person kneeling — claimed to be Putin —  is disproportiontely large and wide. The calf on the same leg looks stretched. The person's head, while half covered, is also very large and does not match the proportions of the rest of the body. The ear is strangely deformed and features several odd, nondescript lumps that other images of Putin's ear do not show. The ear on — purportedly — Xi Jinping's head also appears strangely deformed if one zooms in. But the most obvious discrepancy does not regard either Xi or Putin, but the person standing left of them. This man's hands appear to be fused together.Experience has shown that these are all noticeable problems that occur in AI-generated pictures. These are graphics created by apps with the help of AI and intended to look real. Recently, an AI app generated fake images of former US President Donald Trump being arrested even though he had not been arrested. AI tools such as Midjourney and DALL-E can create photorealistic images of natural settings and humans that are full of detail and hard to distinguish from real images. However, AI apps regularly produce images that contain errors; especially unrealistic representations of hands and ears are one of the problems AI image generators face.Since there were many signs of artificial intelligence with regard to the Putin-Xi image in social media, we decided to examine it using AI-detecting software. We used the program Hugging Face, which inspects images for abnormalities and then gauges whether they arose more or less artificially. It estimated that the picture of Putin kneeling before Xi Jinping had been 57% artificially generated.Finally, we searched for images of Xi's state visit to Russia. In particular, we were looking for details that might be similar to the image in question. But we found no images, whether in the database of the US-British visual media company Getty Images nor that of the Russian state news agency TASS , that featured the alleged genuflection. Even the furniture depicted in real photos of the state visit did not match.Conclusion: The image purportedly showing Putin kneeling in front of Xi Jinping is fake. It cannot be found in any agency database and our research has found clear evidence that the image was generated by AI software.Find out more about how we uncover fakes here.This article was translated from German.",2023/03/23,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845170,Senate Ethics admonishes Graham for campaign solicitations,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate Ethics Committee is admonishing South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham for soliciting campaign contributions inside a federal building after a Nov. 2022 Fox News interview in which he asked viewers to donate to a GOP candidate.Graham violated Senate rules and standards of conduct because he was in a Senate office building when he did the interview, the leaders of the ethics panel said in a rare public letter released on Thursday.“The public must feel confident that Members use public resources only for official actions in the best interests of the United States, not for partisan political activity,” wrote Senate Ethics Committee Chairman Chris Coons, D-Del., and Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the panel's Republican vice chairman. “Your actions failed to uphold that standard, resulting in harm to the public trust and confidence in the United States Senate. You are hereby admonished.”Coons and Lankford wrote that Graham solicited campaign contributions for Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker's campaign committee “five separate times” during the Nov. 30, 2022 interview on Fox News. They noted that Graham reported himself to the committee after the interview was over.In a statement Thursday, Graham said: “It was a mistake. I take responsibility. I will try to do better in the future.”It is unclear if Graham could face any criminal penalties for his actions. Coons and Lankford said this was the senator's second violation, after he similarly solicited campaign contributions for his own campaign during an unplanned hallway interview in 2020.The ethics committee dismissed that complaint and notified Graham in a private letter, Coons and Lankford wrote. The panel did not publicly reveal that violation until now, having determined at the time that his conduct was ”inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis nature,"" the letter said.The prohibitions on campaign solicitation in federal buildings and the use of federal resources for campaign activity “have been consistent and clear throughout your years of Senate service,” they wrote, and Graham solicited the campaign contributions in the November interview “despite the Committee’s specific guidance following your violation in October 2020.""",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845171,Inflategate? Bouncy basketballs hot topic at March Madness,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Players and coaches in the NCAA Tournament may be breathing life into a new controversy: Inflategate.After last weekend's first and second-round games were plagued by low shooting percentages from 3-point range, murmurs began about whether slick or excessively inflated basketballs may have been the culprit. Even the tourney's top overall seed, Alabama, has been airing it out inside the locker room during March Madness.“We've kind of had the discussion as a staff,” Crimson Tide coach Nate Oats said Thursday. “You can pump up any ball to be too hard. It would be great if the referees actually made sure it was within the guidelines of how hard it's supposed to be because, obviously, if you pump it up to where it's a rock, you're not going to shoot as well.""It's certainly not the first time balls or air pressure have been questioned in the sports world.After home run rates increased following the 2016 Major League Baseball season, some pitchers complained the baseballs didn't feel right. Justin Verlander even contended the balls were juiced. In 2021, MLB responded by announcing it had decided to make balls lighter and less bouncy.In January 2015, seven-time Super Bowl champion and three-time NFL MVP Tom Brady was accused of using deflated footballs in the AFC championship game. Brady was eventually suspended for four games and the New England Patriots were fined $1 million and forfeited two draft picks.Thus far, nobody is all that pumped up about the NCAA's basketballs, but the topic has come up in conversation.“I just feel like sometimes the balls are a little too bouncy,” Crimson Tide guard Jahvon Quinerly said. “I don't think it's affected me personally this tournament, but you know, it's been something the guys talk about in the locker room.”So far, Quinerly and his teammates haven't been adversely affected by the balls.Oats said Alabama's team equipment manager has been collecting balls from different manufacturers and the team practices with whatever brand is expected to be used in its next game. One solution, Oats believes, would be for the NCAA to establish a standardized ball for all Division I games.""(Assistant coach) Charlie Henry was in the NBA and he's like ‘I have no idea why college doesn’t have a uniform ball, like I couldn't imagine. You're in the NBA, everybody plays with the same ball every night,'"" Oats said. “I do think it would be a lot better if the NCAA mandated a particular ball.”But Oats believes the shooting woes in this year's tourney have nothing to do with balls, air pressure or shoes.“I think defenses get better,” he said. “You look at the teams that are still winning, most of them have pretty good defenses. When the defenses get better, the shooting percentages go down.”___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845172,"Official: Willow oil project holds promise, faces obstacles","JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — The Willow oil project on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope is part of a “new era” of large-scale development in the region but it isn't a sure thing, with litigation and costs among the factors that stand as potential impediments, a state official told lawmakers Thursday.John Crowther, deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, said the scale of projects like Willow, which is on federal lands in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and was approved by the Biden administration last week, is “tremendous” and would benefit Alaska. He also lumped in as significant the Pikka oil project, which is on state lands east of the petroleum reserve.But he also said multibillion-dollar, multi-year projects are complex and there is ""significant runway” for the ConocoPhillips Alaska-backed Willow project to get to the development and production stages. Australia-based Santos is working with Repsol to advance the Pikka project.State tax officials on Thursday provided lawmakers an analysis of potential revenue impacts and benefits from Willow for the state treasury but noted uncertainty around the estimates, including when the project ultimately might begin, oil price volatility and industry costs.North Slope oil prices, which were around $115 a barrel this time last year amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, are currently in the $70-per-barrel range.Dan Stickel, chief economist with the state Department of Revenue's tax division, told the Senate Finance Committee the oil and gas industry is a high-risk industry that requires considerable capital. He said the ability for companies to recover costs is a key consideration when they decide whether to invest, and that Alaska's tax structure has elements that support cost recovery. For example, the tax system allows for deductions related to investments and incentives for new production areas.The state tax division’s modeling indicated Willow could lead to billions of dollars in revenue for the state, North Slope communities, federal government and the company over the project’s life, said Owen Stephens, a tax division analyst.Oil has long been the state's economic lifeblood. Alaska political leaders — including Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, the state's bipartisan congressional delegation and the Legislature — have pushed for Willow, in part seeing it as a way to boost the flow of oil through the trans-Alaska pipeline. Many leaders on the remote North Slope or with ties to the region have cast the project as economically vital for their communities. Unions have also spoken in support.Environmentalists, however, have argued the project is at odds with President Joe Biden's climate pledges and worry it could lead to further development in the region.Environmental organizations and an Alaska Native group have filed lawsuits challenging Willow’s approval, arguing in part that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management failed to consider an adequate range of alternatives. A federal judge is expected to decide by early April whether to halt construction activities related to the project pending resolution of the cases, something the groups are requesting.The approved project is smaller than what ConocoPhillips Alaska had earlier sought but the company said it welcomed the decision.Rebecca Boys, a company spokesperson, earlier this week said the company was building ice roads for construction work but agreed to delay gravel mine activities until April 4, unless the judge issues a decision earlier than that denying the injunction requests filed by Willow opponents.ConocoPhillips Alaska is intervening in the litigation in support of the federal agencies being sued over the approval. Arctic Slope Regional Corp., an Alaska Native regional corporation; the North Slope Borough; Kuukpik Corp., an Alaska Native village corporation and the state have also intervened in support of the approval.Willow could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day and more than 600 million barrels over its 30-year life, according to the company.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845173,Surge in eating disorders spurs state legislative action,"DENVER (AP) — Stranded at home amid pandemic lockdowns in spring 2020, Emma Warford stumbled down a social media rabbit hole in her quest to get in shape. Viral 28-day fitness challenges. YouTubers promising “hourglass abs.” Diet videos where slim-stomached influencers peddled calorie-tracking apps.Warford, then a 15-year-old starting volleyball player, bought a food scale and began replacing meals with energy drinks hawked by social media stars.Soon, her calorie cutting became a compulsion. The thought of eating cake for her 16th birthday induced severe anxiety. By season's end, she began volleyball games benched, too feeble to start. A year into the pandemic, her heart rate slowed and she was rushed to the hospital.Stories like Warford’s are why lawmakers in Colorado, California, Texas, New York and elsewhere are taking big, legislative swings at the eating disorder crisis. On Thursday, Colorado lawmakers advanced a bill that would create a state Office of Disordered Eating Prevention, intended in part to patch holes in care, to fund research and to raise awareness.The bill passed committee by a 6-3 vote with Republicans demurring, partly concerned with the creation of a new government office and skeptical of its efficacy.Warford, who’s now in recovery after two years of treatment, is among nearly 30 million Americans — about the population of Texas — who will struggle with an eating disorder in their lifetime. Every year over 10,000 die from an eating disorder, according to data cited by the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.Proposals across the U.S. include restricting social media algorithms from promoting potentially harmful content; prohibiting the sale of weight loss pills to minors; and adding eating disorder prevention to middle and high school curriculums.The slew of legislation follows a spike in eating disorder cases as pandemic lockdowns pushed youth into long bouts of isolation. Hospital beds filled and waiting lists swelled as many struggled to find treatment for an illness that already had few care options. In Colorado, only one hospital was equipped to offer inpatient care for Warford, who was diagnosed with anorexia.Anorexia typically involves restrictive eating habits and can cause abnormally low blood pressure and organ damage. Binge eating disorder is a compulsion in the other direction. Still, having an eating disorder does not invariably mean someone is overweight or underweight — and that's left many who suffer with the mental illness to go undiagnosed, experts say.Colorado’s bill creates a state office that is broadly charged with, in part, closing gaps in treatments, offering research grants, and working to educate students, teachers and parents. Bills in New York and Texas similarly seek to educate students on mental illnesses including eating disorders.Katrina Velasquez, chief policy officer of the national Eating Disorder Coalition, said these policies will give students the tools to catch signs of disordered eating habits in themselves or their peers early — potentially giving them a critical head start in treatment.Colorado is also taking a swing at axing the the use of body mass index, or BMI, even though it remains the industry standard. The measurement is used often to determine the level of care required for those with eating disorders, but mental illness is not invariably linked to body weight or BMI, said Claire Engels, program coordinator for the Eating Disorder Foundation. That means that those who fall outside of the BMI prescription are often denied care, or kicked out of treatment prematurely.“Eating disorders are not necessarily about food. It’s about mental illness, anxiety, depression, trauma” and control, Engels said.When Riley Judd was around 12, she saw a photo of herself on vacation in a bathing suit. Turning to her mom she said, “I look like a whale.” It was the first time she remembered a voice in her head ruthlessly comparing her to the beaming, thin celebrities on the cover of Seventeen Magazine and Girls’ Life. “If I lose all this weight, people will like me,” the voice muttered to her. She attempted suicide at age 13.“It was an all-consuming voice,” said Judd, now a legislative intern and student at the University of Denver.California lawmakers are targeting social media with a bill prohibiting social media platforms from having algorithms or features that expose children to diet products or lead them to develop an eating disorder. Platforms that violate the legislation could be fined $250,000.Another California bill would expand the list of approved facilities that can provide inpatient treatment to people with eating disorders — similar to a Texas proposal that would expand Medicaid coverage for mental health services, including eating disorders.Texas state Rep. Shelby Slawson, a Republican, also introduced a bill to protect minors who use digital platforms.Cathy Johnson, a school counselor of 24 years who testified on the Texas proposal, said “one of the biggest issues” she has seen from social media is an increase in eating disorders.“We have kids having panic attacks in school because their anxiety is so high, they are comparing themselves, they think they are going to be like one of the influencers on TikTok,” Johnson said. ___ Associated Press reporters Sophie Austin contributed from California, Acacia Coronado contributed from Texas, and Michael Hill contributed from New York.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845174,North Korea claims 'radioactive tsunami' weapon test at sea,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea claimed Friday to have tested a nuclear-capable underwater drone designed to generate a gigantic “radioactive tsunami” that would destroy naval strike groups and ports. Analysts were skeptical that the device presents a major new threat, but the test underlines the North's commitment to raising nuclear threats.The test this week came as the United States reportedly planned to deploy aircraft carrier strike groups and other advanced assets to waters off the Korean Peninsula. Military tensions are at a high point as the pace of both North Korean weapons tests and U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises has accelerated in the past year in a cycle of tit-for-tat responses.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the new weapon, which can be deployed from the coast or towed by surface ships, is built to “stealthily infiltrate into operational waters and make a super-scale radioactive tsunami through an underwater explosion"" to destroy enemy naval strike groups and ports.The report came hours before South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol pledged to make North Korea pay for its “reckless provocations” as he attended a remembrance service honoring 55 South Korean troops killed during major clashes with the North near their western sea border in past years.The testing of the purported “nuclear underwater attack drone” was part of a three-day exercise that simulated nuclear attacks on unspecified South Korean targets, which also included cruise missile launches Wednesday.KCNA said the North’s latest tests were aimed at alerting the United States and South Korea of a brewing “nuclear crisis” as they continue with their “intentional, persistent and provocative war drills.” It said the tests were supervised by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who vowed to make his rivals “plunge into despair.""The U.S. and South Korea completed an 11-day exercise Thursday that included their biggest field training in years, and are preparing another round of joint naval drills that will reportedly involve a U.S. aircraft carrier.Hours after the North Korean report, South Korea's air force released details of a five-day joint aerial drill with the United States that began Monday and concluded Friday above waters off South Korea's western coast, which included live-fire demonstrations of air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons.The air force said the exercise, which involved various South Korean fighter jets and at least one U.S. A-10 attack plane, was aimed at verifying precision strike capabilities and reaffirming the credibility of Seoul's “three-axis” strategy against North Korean nuclear threats — preemptively striking sources of attacks, intercepting incoming missiles and neutralizing the North's leadership and key military facilities.The North Korean drone is named “Haeil,” a Korean word meaning tidal waves or tsunamis. The North’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of Kim smiling next to a large, torpedo-shaped object at an unspecified indoor facility, but didn’t identify it.Other photos published with the same article showed sea-surface tracks supposedly caused by the drone’s underwater trajectory and a pillar of water exploding up into the air, possibly caused by what state media described as an underwater detonation of a mock nuclear weapon carried by the drone.KCNA said the drone was deployed Tuesday off the North’s eastern coast, traveled underwater for nearly 60 hours, and detonated a test warhead at a target standing for an enemy port. It said the test verified the operational reliability of the drone, which it said the North has been developing since 2012 and tested more 50 times in the past two years, although the weapon was never mentioned before in state media until Friday.Kim Dong-yub, a professor at Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies, said that it’s impossible to verify North Korea’s claims about the drone’s capabilities or that it had tested the system dozens of times. But, he said, the North is intending to communicate that the weapon has enough range to reach all South Korean ports.Ankit Panda, a senior analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, questioned the wisdom of North Korea devoting resources to the drone system as a means of delivery versus its ballistic missiles when it has limited amounts of nuclear materials suitable for weapons.“This un-crewed underwater vehicle will be vulnerable to anti-submarine warfare capabilities if it were to deploy beyond North Korea’s coastal waters. It will also be susceptible to preemptive strikes when in port,” said Panda.“Indeed, the U.S. and South Korea would have incentives in a crisis to preempt any such systems before they could deploy.”North Korea is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads and may be capable of fitting them on older weapons systems, such as Scuds or Rodong missiles. However, there are different assessments on how far it has advanced in engineering those warheads to fit on the new weapons it has developed at a rapid pace, which might require further technological upgrades and nuclear tests.Speaking to lawmakers on Thursday, South Korean Defense Minister Lee Jong-Sup said the North probably hasn’t yet mastered the technology to place nuclear arms on its most advanced weapons, but acknowledged the country was making “significant progress.”On Wednesday, North Korea also test-fired cruise missiles in launches that were detected and publicized by South Korea’s military. It also staged another nuclear attack simulation with a short-range ballistic missile on Sunday and flight-tested an intercontinental ballistic missile last week that may be able to reach the continental United States.KCNA said Wednesday’s tests were of four cruise missiles and two different types. The missiles flew for more than two hours in patterns over the sea while demonstrating an ability to strike targets 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) and 1,800 kilometers (1,118 miles) away. It said the missiles’ mock nuclear warheads were detonated 600 meters (1,968 feet) above their targets, which supposedly verified the reliability of their nuclear explosion control devices and warhead detonators.KCNA said Kim Jong Un was satisfied with the three-day drills and directed unspecified additional tasks to counter the “reckless military provocations” of his rivals, indicating North Korea will further ramp up its military displays.He “expressed his will to make the U.S. imperialists and the (South) Korean puppet regime plunge into despair” with powerful demonstrations of his military nuclear program to make his rivals understand “they are bound to lose more than they get” with the expansion of their joint drills.Kim issued similar language Sunday after a test-firing of a short-range ballistic missile from what was possibly a silo dug into the ground. The North’s media said a mock nuclear warhead placed on the missile detonated 800 meters (2,624 feet) above water, an altitude that would maximize damage.The North has fired over 20 ballistic and cruise missiles across 10 launch events this year as it tries to diversify its delivery systems and display the ability to conduct nuclear strikes on both South Korea and the U.S. mainland.North Korea already is coming off a record year in testing activity, with more than 70 missiles fired in 2022, as Kim accelerated a campaign aimed at negotiating badly needed sanctions relief from a position of strength and forcing the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845175,March Madness: Alabama's Oats not offended by Saban comments,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Alabama coach Nate Oats said Thursday he was not offended by comments Nick Saban made regarding Saban's handling of a football player's arrest in contrast to how the top-ranked Crimson Tide have dealt with the controversy surrounding All-American freshman Brandon Miller.Saban on Monday suspended freshman defensive back Tony Mitchell after his arrest on a drug charge.In handing down the punishment, Saban said, “everybody’s got an opportunity to make choices and decisions."" He added, “there’s no such thing as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.”The “no such thing as being in the wrong place at the wrong time” comment was perceived by many to be directed at Oats, the Alabama basketball coach who hasn't disciplined Miller for being at the scene of a Jan. 15 fatal shooting involving a former teammate in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Oats initially said Miller was “in the wrong spot at the wrong time” during the shooting death of 23-year-old Jamea Harris. Darius Miles and another man have been charged with capital murder in Harris' death, and police reports state that Miles texted Miller to bring him his gun ahead of the shooting.Miller has not been charged with any crime. Miller’s attorney claims the forward never handled the gun and didn’t know it was going to be used for a crime. Miller, who has a security guard with him at the NCAA Tournament because of threats he’s received, is cooperating in the investigation.Oats said he spoke with Saban Monday night, adding that he did not take Saban's remark as direct criticism.“I’ve got a ton of respect for him,” Oats said during a Thursday news conference. “He has been tremendously supportive of our program since he got here. He says it all the time. He wants the entire athletic department to do well. He has been at multiple games this year.”Saban attended Alabama's practice on Wednesday. The Crimson Tide face No. 5 seed San Diego State in a South Region semifinal on Friday night and Miller is expected to be in the lineup.Miller did not address the subject of Saban's remarks.“It was a great experience in practice for me,” Miller said of Saban's presence. “I always grew up being an Alabama football fan, so coach Saban has always been a great role model for me. It was just great just seeing him an arm’s length away from me.”Oats has apologized for both his comments and for allowing a pregame introduction in which Miller was patted down by another teammate. The fourth-year coach and the top team in the country have been scrutinized for allowing Miller to continue to play. Miller is the Southeastern Conference player of the year.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

Kuriyama, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.One officer, Joshua J.S. Nahulu, 37, pleaded not guilty to a charge for a collision that resulted in serious bodily injury. He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.Officers Erik X.K. Smith, 25, Jake R.T. Bartolome, 35, and Robert G. Lewis III, whose age was not listed in charging documents, each pleaded not guilty to one felony count for hindering prosecution and another felony count for conspiracy. The first charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, the second by up to one year.The four officers were dispatched to respond to a noise complaint at a Waianae beach park at 3:30 a.m. on Sept. 12, 2021, according to court documents.That's when they saw a white Honda exit the parking lot to Farrington Highway. A civil lawsuit alleges Nahulu, Smith and Bartolome separately chased the Honda at high speeds using two marked Honolulu Police Department vehicles and one vehicle subsidized by police. It says the chase continued until the Honda “left the roadway and crashed.""The officers never commanded the Honda's driver to stop nor did they turn on their blue lights and sirens, the lawsuit states.Nahulu, Smith and Bartolome drove past the crash scene without stopping, after which they met Lewis at nearby Waianae Intermediate School, prosecutors said.Smith, Bartolome and Lewis were then dispatched to the crash site, but when they arrived, the officers behaved as though they had no prior knowledge of the collision, charging documents say.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845194,"Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula reach Miami Open 3rd round","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Sixth-seeded Coco Gauff opened her 2023 Miami Open with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Rebecca Marino on Thursday and advanced to the third round where she will face 27th-seeded Anastasia Potapova.After her victory, Gauff, coming off a quarterfinals appearance at Indian Wells, said in a television interview that it wasn't her best outing, despite converting five of her nine break points.“It was a shaky performances honestly,” Gauff said. “I knew it wasn’t going to be a straight forward match, even if I was up a break sometimes.”Gauff came back from a break down twice in the second set to claim her second career win versus Marino. Gauff defeated Marino in the first round at Roland Garros in 2022.Gauff said she was a bit nervous playing in her hometown — she's a native of Delray Beach, Florida, a small city about 40 miles north of Hard Rock Stadium, where the tournament is played. Jimmy Butler of the Miami Heat was among those in attendance Thursday.“Jimmy Butler is here so I was a little bit nervous when I saw him,” Gauff said with a laugh in her post-match interview. “Playing home is something I look forward to, but it's also a little bit of extra pressure because everyone wants you to do well here.”Gauff's doubles teammate, world No. 3 Jessica Pegula beat Katherine Sebov 6-3, 6-1 and advanced to the third round. She will face fellow American and No. 30 Danielle Collins next. Collins defeated Viktoriya Tomova on Thursday.Pegula made the Miami Open semifinals in 2022 and is among the favorites to win the tournament this year after No. 1-ranked and defending champion Iga Swiatek pulled out of the tournament because of a rib injury.No. 21 Paula Badosa won 7-6(2), 4-6, 6-2 against Laura Siegemund in a match that lasted two hours and 51 minutes. Badosa will face either Elena Rybakina, who defeated Badosa en route to the Indian Wells title, or Anna Kalinskaya.Badosa hit with a ball kid during the match to stay warm after Siegemund called for a medical timeout and left the court for treatment, which took nearly 15 minutes.No. 14-seeded Victoria Azarenka beat Camila Giorgi 6-3, 6-1 to reach the third round, where she will face No. 20 Magda Linette.Azarenka has the second-most career wins at the Miami Open among active women with 38. The mark trails only Venus Williams, who has 67. The 33-year-old Azarenka won the tournament in 2009, 2011 and 2016.In other action, Elise Mertens eliminated No. 8 seed Daria Kasatkina 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 to advance and face No. 29 Petra Martic next; No. 23 Qinwen Zheng picked up a 2-6, 6-1, 6-1 win over Irina-Camelia Begu; and No. 13 seed Beatriz Haddad Maia defeated Tereza Martincová 7-6 (4), 0-6, 6-0.___More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845195,SC Senate OKs bill barring 'foreign adversary' land holdings,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina's Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill Thursday that would bar citizens of “foreign adversary” nations from buying property in the state, an anti-espionage measure that critics fear will chill overseas investments over outsize concerns.The measure approved Thursday by a 31-5 vote would apply to citizens of so-called adversarial countries on a U.S. Department of Commerce list that currently includes China, Russia, Cuba, Iran and North Korea.The bill is one of numerous like-minded measures that have arisen across the country after a suspected Chinese spy balloon recently floated over U.S. territory and was brought down off the South Carolina coast. The overflight fueled lawmakers' worries that nefarious actors may advance surveillance efforts under the guise of land ownership. At least 11 state legislatures are considering similar proposals.The leading sponsor of the South Carolina bill, Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, said he was spurred to action by a Chinese biomedical company's pending $28 million purchase of 500 acres near the U.S. Army's Cyber Command headquarters in the state. He drew a parallel between some foreign land purchases and the Trojan Horse of Greek mythology.“We need to look inside that wooden horse before we let it in the gate. And there are some countries that have given us more of a reason to look inside the wooden horse before we let it in the gate,” Massey said. “These five have specifically given us reason to have more scrutiny and to be a little bit more concerned.”Massey said the law would no longer apply to countries if they are removed from the federal list and could apply to any that are added to it.Democratic Sen. Dick Harpootlian, who opposed the bill, questioned the premise that a Chinese company’s purchase of land equated to “establishing a nest of spies.” While acknowledging his distaste for the government in Beijing, he said the matter would better be left to federal officials.“This is a bumper sticker,” Harpootlian said. “This is not legislation that is going to improve the quality of life for anybody in this state.”Democratic Sen. Mike Fanning expressed concern that it could hamstring rural counties with fewer options for outside investment.Massey acknowledged that some areas are desperate for economic development but said the listed countries have “earned additional scrutiny.”The measure lets businesses operating in the state before 2023 acquire land for expansion with approval from the Secretary of Commerce and governor. Massey noted that it would not force current landowners to divest any property and only applies to future acquisitions.It would also cover companies with partial “adversary” nation ownership. Citizens from such countries could not collectively hold more than a 20% stake in a landowning company, and no single individual could own over 10%.Immigrants from those countries who hold permanent residency could acquire no more than 5 acres of land, and only for residential use.During debate, Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto asked if someone with a green card, for example, could open a restaurant. Massey replied that such a person could do so but not own the building where it is housed.“Why is that?” Hutto asked. “I thought the American Dream was kind of to own your own business?”“Once they become a citizen, they could do that,” Massey said, adding: “They are still citizens of foreign adversaries.”___James Pollard is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845196,Rory McIlroy powers his way to another win in Match Play,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Rory McIlroy had every reason to love the long ball Thursday.Taken to the 18th hole in the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play, McIlroy unleashed the shot of the tournament. He smashed a drive on the 375-yard closing hole so magnificently that it pitched on the green and rolled out to just inside 4 feet.That all but clinched his 2-up victory over Denny McCarthy as McIlroy led a parade of top seeds into the final round of group play at Austin Country Club.“It was good,” McIlroy said with a smile, which was like saying Michelangelo did a good job on the Sistine Chapel.He capped a rally from 3 down through six holes. McIlroy didn't take his first lead in the match until another power show — a big drive into the wind on the par-5 16th to set up a two-putt birdie from 18 feet.Defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who had to make a 12-footer on the last hole to win his first match, had seven birdies in a nine-hole stretch in the middle of his match against Alex Noren for a 5-and-4 victory.Patrick Cantlay (4), Max Homa (5) and Xander Schauffele (6) also won their matches as four of the top six seeds took a 2-0 record into Friday in a bid to win their group and advance to the knockout stage on the weekend.The exception was Jon Rahm, who recovered from his opening round loss by driving the green on the par-4 fifth on his way to a 4-and-3 victory over Keith Mitchell. That means Rahm winning his group is in his hands, as Rickie Fowler lost his match.It capped another blustery day of momentum shifts and uncertain outcomes, typical of this format that is being played for the last time.Matt Kuchar was on the cusp of tying Tiger Woods’ tournament record of 36 wins, but then he missed a 5-foot birdie putt on the last hole and had to settle for a halve with Chris Kirk.Cameron Young never led in his match against Corey Conners — they halved 14 of the first 15 holes — until the rising American star made eagle on the par-5 16th, holed a 12-foot birdie on the 17th to take his first lead and then made a wild scramble for par to win.“Obviously it’s windy and difficult today but there’s enough holes you should still make four, five or six birdies. It’s just keeping myself patient knowing that those are probably coming,” Young said. “I would have liked them to be a little bit earlier, but I’ll take them right where they were.”The McIlroy drive was the topper, though.“I was imagining the driver was going to land into the upslope and sort of stay 10, 20 yards short,” McIlroy said. “I didn’t imagine I could fly it on the green.”As for where it rates, McIlroy laughed.“I was 1 up and there’s certainly a lot of other ways to make birdie on that hole without having to do that,” he said. “But yeah, it was a great swing and it was great time to do it.”It came during a week in which McIlroy said to “No Laying Up” that he favored the USGA and R&A proposal to roll back the distance golf balls travel for elite competition. The governing bodies chose not to address the driver.“I think you're gonna see people with more well-rounded games succeed easier than what the game has become, which is a bit bomb-and-gouge over these last few years,” he said.This was more bomb-and-putt, and it was a beauty.The shot was similar to Robert MacIntyre driving the 18th green at Austin Country Club two years ago when he needed to win the final hole to win his group, and it knocked out top-seeded Dustin Johnson.McIlroy's work is not done, and none of the top seeds can be assured to advancing even without having lost a match.Two players can speak from experience. Cantlay two years ago was 2-0 when he lost on the third day and then faced a sudden-death playoff against Brian Harman — whom he had beaten on the first day — and lost with a three-putt on the second extra hole.Lucas Herbert was in the same position last year when he lost to Takumi Kanaya and then faced him in a playoff, four-putting the first green.This is no time to get comfortable.“Comfort is the devil in golf,” Herbert said. “As much as it is a great position to be 2-0, I got work to do tomorrow.”Twenty players face the worst day because they have been eliminated, a group that includes Will Zalatoris, the No. 7 seed, and eighth-seeded Viktor Hovland.Jordan Spieth will need some help. A crowd favorite in Austin, where he played for the Longhorns for three semesters, Spieth was 1 up over PGA Tour rookie Taylor Montgomery when he drove into the water and lost the 13th, went long of the 14th green and missed a short par putt and Montgomery made a 10-foot birdie on the 15th to seize control.Montgomery won on the 17th hole to go 2-0. Spieth would need to beat Shane Lowry and have Mackenzie Hughes beat Montgomery to have a chance.Montgomery never fared well in match play when he was at UNLV, though he did just fine in plenty of money games at Shadow Creek with a few high rollers.With side bets, he recalled having a few putts worth $10,000 or $15,000. He didn't miss.“That was a good thing, too, because that was everything in my bank account,” he said.As for Keegan Bradley, he had a 6-and-5 win which was noteworthy for a couple of reasons. It was his first win in Match Play since 2012 — what followed were nine losses and seven halves — and he only needs to win Friday to win his group.Next up is McIlroy, who beat Bradley in the Ryder Cup at Medinah in 2012 when Europe pulled off a stunning comeback. McIlroy nearly missed his tee time that day because he said he forgot Chicago was in the Central time zone. So is Austin.“Listen, I know I got a really tough match. It's Rory McIlroy,” Bradley said “But I'm playing well, too, so I’m going to go out there and try to win the match.”___AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845197,Court blocks COVID-19 vaccine mandate for US gov't workers,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — President Joe Biden’s order that federal employees get vaccinated against COVID-19 has been blocked by a federal appeals court.The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, in a decision Thursday, rejected arguments that Biden, as the nation’s chief executive, has the same authority as the CEO of a private corporation to require that employees be vaccinated.The ruling from the full appeals court, 16 full-time judges at the time the case was argued, reversed an earlier ruling by a three-judge 5th Circuit panel that had upheld the vaccination requirement. Judge Andrew Oldham, nominated to the court by then-President Donald Trump, wrote the opinion for a 10-member majority.The ruling maintains the status quo for federal employee vaccines. It upholds a preliminary injunction blocking the mandate issued by a federal judge in January 2022. At that point, the administration said nearly 98% of covered employees had been vaccinated.And, Oldham noted, with the preliminary injunction arguments done, the case will return to that court for further arguments, when “both sides will have to grapple with the White House’s announcement that the COVID emergency will finally end on May 11, 2023.”The White House defended the order, citing the high compliance rate among the federal workforce and saying in a statement Friday that “vaccination remains one of the most important tools to protect people from serious illness and hospitalizations” against COVID.Opponents of the policy said it was an encroachment on federal workers’ lives that neither the Constitution nor federal statutes authorize.Biden issued an executive order in September 2021 requiring vaccinations for all executive branch agency employees, with exceptions for medical and religious reasons. The requirement kicked in the following November. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas by Trump, issued a nationwide injunction against the requirement the following January.The case then went to the 5th Circuit.One panel of three 5th Circuit judges refused to immediately block the law.But a different panel, after hearing arguments, upheld Biden’s position. Judges Carl Stewart and James Dennis, both nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton, were in the majority. Judge Rhesa Barksdale, nominated by President George H.W. Bush, dissented, saying the relief the challengers sought does not fall under the Civil Service Reform Act cited by the administration.The broader court majority agreed, saying federal law does not preclude court jurisdiction over cases involving ""private, irreversible medical decisions made in consultation with private medical professionals outside the federal workplace.""A majority of the full court voted to vacate that ruling and reconsider the case. The 16 active judges heard the case on Sept. 13, joined by Barksdale, who is now a senior judge with lighter duties than the full-time members of the court.Judge Stephen Higginson, a nominee of President Barack Obama, wrote the main dissenting opinion. ""For the wrong reasons, our court correctly concludes that we do have jurisdiction,"" Higginson wrote. ""But contrary to a dozen federal courts — and having left a government motion to stay the district court’s injunction pending for more than a year — our court still refuses to say why the President does not have the power to regulate workplace safety for his employees.""___The date of President Joe Biden's executive order has been corrected to September 2021, not last September.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845208,Yellen tries to assuage investor fears as bank stocks slide,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sought to reassure jittery investors that American bank deposits were safe and promised policymakers had more firepower to battle any crisis even as bank stocks resumed their slide on Thursday.Investors have dumped banking stocks globally over the past two weeks, with rapid interest rate hikes to rein in inflation blamed by some as the root cause of the debacle. U.S. bank stocks slid again on Thursday, pushing the S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK down to its lowest close since November 2020.U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank's collapse over bond-related losses tied to a surge in interest rates was the initial trigger for the turmoil, and JPMorgan Chase & Co analysts estimate the ""most vulnerable"" U.S. banks likely lost a total of about $1 trillion in deposits since last year. Half of the outflows occurred in March after SVB's collapse, they said.Policymakers have stressed the turmoil is different from the financial crisis 15 years ago, and Yellen repeated that she was prepared to take more action to protect bank deposits if needed - one of the issues investors are concerned about.""As I have said, we have used important tools to act quickly to prevent contagion. And they are tools we could use again,"" Yellen said in prepared remarks to the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee hearing.""The strong actions we have taken ensure that Americans’ deposits are safe. Certainly, we would be prepared to take additional actions if warranted.""BOE HIKES AGAINIn Europe, the Bank of England became the latest central bank to hike rates this week.After its eleventh straight hike, the BoE said it had noted the ""large and volatile moves"" in financial markets, but that Britain's banking system remained resilient.""We have learnt a lot of lessons from the financial crisis. Of course, we keep learning lessons, but I’m confident that the banks in (Britain) are in a much stronger position,"" BoE governor Andrew Bailey told broadcasters.While some of the panic over the fate of banks has abated, investors are now adjusting to more challenging economic and lending conditions ahead.The index of top European banks .SX7P fell 2.5%, with German banking giants Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and Commerzbank CBKG.DE falling 3.2% and 4.1%, respectively. London-headquartered HSBC HSBA.L dropped 2.9%.U.S. banking shares initially rose on Thursday with traders citing the Fed's hints that it could soon pause further increases in borrowing costs as a source of some relief, but later turned negative.Troubled U.S. regional lender First Republic Bank FRC.N, which is among banks speaking to peers and investment firms about potential deals, closed down 6%. About 90% of the bank's stock market value has evaporated this month, leaving it with a market capitalization of just over $2 billion.""Despite the strong efforts to protect, particularly First Republic, the crisis continues and investors are left wondering what is it that I'm not seeing,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.Other U.S. banks under the microscope after the demise of SVB and Signature Bank SBNY.O added to recent losses. PacWest Bancorp PACW.O, Comerica CMA.N and Zion Bancorp ZION.O each tumbled more than 8%.Truist Securities cut its price targets on regional banks including Zions and Comerica, warning of slower growth and higher credit costs.The S&P 500 banks index .SPXBK, which closed down 1.2%, has now fallen over 40% from its record high in February 2022.BANK BOND PRESSUREEarlier on Thursday, the Swiss National Bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and said the takeover of Credit Suisse - the biggest name ensnared by recent turmoil - by its Swiss rival UBS UBSG.S had averted a financial disaster.To stop investor panic from spreading, the Swiss bank was rushed into the deal on Sunday with UBS Group AG, which along with Swiss authorities is racing to close the takeover within as little as a month, according to two sources with knowledge of the plans.Spokespeople for UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.""At this moment the focus has to be that we can maintain financial stability and that the closing of the deal is smooth and fast,"" SNB Chair Thomas Jordan told a news conference.Separately, Credit Suisse and UBS are under scrutiny in a U.S. Department of Justice probe into whether financial professionals helped Russian oligarchs evade sanctions, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.The rescue of Credit Suisse has ignited broader concerns about investors' exposure to a fragile banking sector. The decision to prioritise shareholders over Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bondholders rattled the $275 billion AT1 bond market and some Credit Suisse AT1 bondholders were seeking legal advice.The convertible bonds were designed to be invoked during rescues to prevent the costs of bailouts falling onto taxpayers as it happened during the global financial crisis in 2008.Politicians are also wary of public perceptions that banks are being bailed out again, after anger over the sector's costly rescue in 2008. The U.S. Senate Banking Committee called on the former chief executives of SVB and Signature Bank to testify as lawmakers weigh possible action.Citizens Financial Group Inc CFG.N is working on a bid to acquire the private banking business of Silicon Valley Bank, two people familiar with the matter said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845218,Shopee Consumer Trends report reveals key digital habits among Singapore shoppers,"80% of Singaporean users attest to the usefulness and convenience that e-commerce platforms like Shopee offer as a one-stop shopping platform
SINGAPORE -  Media OutReach - 24 March 2023 - Shopee Singapore officially unveils its report, 'Past the Starting Line: Adapting to Singapore's Digital Consumers in 2023'. To better understand e-commerce usage and attitudes of consumers, Shopee Singapore conducted an online survey in Singapore on 5 December 2022 among 1,361 Shopee users aged 15 to 70 years old. These data-driven insights will allow businesses to more strategically leverage e-commerce and digital services to stay relevant and achieve their goals in this changing digital landscape.     Zhou Junjie, Chief Commercial Officer, Shopee said, ""As digital consumers continue to shape the future of the digital economy, it is important to be able to identify their evolving needs and preferences while adapting quickly to meet them. This year, we are sharing key trends that we have observed among Singaporean users, which indicate increasing and savvier use of digital services, the rise of more purposeful buyers alongside the growing adoption of e-commerce and online entertainment among older users. This builds on our commitment of helping our partners better engage digital consumers and unlock more opportunities in the long term. We will also continue to adopt a user-centric approach using these insights to create a positive experience for all Shopee users.""   1. Increased and savvier use of digital services      The pandemic has left a lasting impact on online shopping behaviors and the use of digital services. With the availability of a greater variety of items on e-commerce platforms,  87% of respondents shared that e-commerce shopping offers convenience and has made a significant positive impact on their lives. Users are also making more orders and buying more products online, with  more than 70% of respondents receiving up to five packages from e-commerce platforms per month.    E-commerce platforms are expected to remain popular among consumers in Singapore. When asked about their general sentiment about shopping on e-commerce platforms,  2 in 3 surveyed users shared that Shopee is now a part of their daily routine. Furthermore, Shopee has also become crucial in users' entire end-to-end shopping journey, with over 75% of users in Singapore choosing to search, compare and eventually buy a product on Shopee. With consumers turning to Shopee to address their shopping needs, it remains an important platform for brands and sellers to reach and deepen their connection with these digital-first shoppers.   2. The rise of more purposeful buyers     Trust is more important than ever, with consumers in Singapore becoming more discerning of quality. They scrutinise the authenticity of what they buy and the sellers they buy from. They are also actively reading and leaving reviews, to ensure they and others alike can make informed purchasing decisions. In fact,  3 in 4 respondents find customer reviews on Shopee reliable and believe that they help with their purchasing decisions. Besides encouraging more users to leave product and shop ratings, Shopee is also committed to continually improve the shopping experience on the platform, enabling users to shop confidently.   Digital consumers are also turning to Shopee's diverse Key Opinion Leaders and affiliates for their recommendations on which brands and sellers to buy from. Additionally,  over 60% of respondents aged 35 and above shared that product features on Shopee Live are key to influencing their purchase decisions on Shopee. The real-time reviews and recommendations from hosts on Shopee Live and affiliates allow users to get a better understanding of the products, and ultimately influence their purchasing decisions. With Shopee's existing  Affiliate Marketing Solution (AMS) as well as strong network of talent and expertise in content creation on Shopee Live, brands and sellers can strengthen their brands' reputation, and in turn, increase their sales. This is also another creative way for sellers to communicate their brand story, build awareness of their store promotions, and grow their brand presence.   3. Growing adoption of e-commerce and online entertainment among older users    With the silver generation becoming more tech-savvy in recent years, more older users are coming online to not only shop but to also be entertained.  70% of all silver generation respondents (aged 55 and above) said they  have integrated e-commerce into their daily routine, while  84% said they are buying a larger variety of items online, compared to 80% for Gen Z and Gen X.   There is also increasing interest among older users in engaging with Shopee's in-app games and livestream content.  1 in 2 seniors say that the Shopee app and games have kept them engaged during their free time. For businesses, this presents more opportunity to access this growing user segment, if they are able to tap on the right mix of content at the right time to reach these users.  Hashtag: #Shopee

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845220,"Nowell breaks NCAA assist record, KSU beats MSU 98-93 in OT","NEW YORK (AP) — Markquis Nowell walked the ball up the floor with the score tied in the final minute of overtime and exchanged animated hand signals with his coach, Jerome Tang.Standing on the March Madness logo at Madison Square Garden, the 5-foot-8 Kansas State point guard who grew up in Harlem glanced at the basket for a split second and flicked a chest pass into the lane. Keyontae Johnson slipped behind the Michigan State defense, elevated with his back to the basket, grabbed the ball and slammed it down.It was the signature play of a towering performance by the shortest player on the floor.Nowell broke the NCAA Tournament record for assists in a game with 19, his last two on spectacular passes in the last minute of OT, and Kansas State beat Michigan State 98-93 on Thursday night in a Sweet 16 thriller.“Today was a special one, man,” said Nowell, who fought through a second-half ankle injury. “I’ve got to give a lot to credit to my teammates for battling, for fighting through adversity when we was down. I can’t even explain how I’m feeling right now. I just know that I’m blessed and I’m grateful.”Nowell's alley-oop to Johnson with 52 seconds left in overtime gave the Wildcats (26-9) the lead for good in this back-and-forth East Region semifinal.“I mean, it was just a basketball play between me and Keyontae,” Nowell said. “We knew how Michigan State plays defense. They play high up, and Keyontae just told me, we got eye contact, and he was like, lob, lob. I just threw it up, and he made a great play.”Michigan State cut the lead to one before Nowell bounced an inbound pass from under the basket to Ismael Massoud, who knocked down a jumper with 17 seconds left that put Kansas State ahead 96-93 and gave Nowell the assists record.With Michigan State needing a 3 to tie, Nowell stole the ball from the Spartans' Tyson Walker and drove for a clinching layup at the buzzer. Nowell finished with 20 points and five steals in a signature performance at basketball's most famous arena that drew tweets of praise from Patrick Mahomes and Kevin Durant.“That was a legendary display of controlling a basketball game Markquis,” Durant tweeted.UNLV’s Mark Wade had the previous NCAA tourney assists record with 18 during the Runnin’ Rebels 1987 Final Four win over Indiana.Tang, the energetic, 56-year-old first-year head coach who was hired to lead the Wildcats after two decades as an assistant at Baylor, gave all the credit to his senior point guard.“Well, what really helps is that all 10 eyes on the defense have to pay attention to him, and that’s what allows everybody else to get open,” Tang said. “It’s not just that he sees it, but they all have to pay attention to him when he has the ball in his hands.”Johnson — the Florida transfer who was sidelined for nearly two years after he collapsed on the court during a game in December 2020 — scored 22 points for the No. 3 seed Wildcats. Kansas State will face ninth-seeded Florida Atlantic on Saturday as it seeks the program's first Final Four berth since 1964.A.J. Hoggard scored a career-high 25 points for seventh-seeded Michigan State (21-13). Joey Hauser added 18 points and Walker had 16, including a layup with 5 seconds left in regulation that forced the first overtime of this year's NCAA Tournament.Nowell turned his ankle early in the second half, was helped off the court and had it taped. Michigan State took the lead with him sidelined, and when he returned, he pushed off the ankle to bank in a 3-pointer that beat the shot clock and tied the game at 55-all.Turns out he was just getting started. Neither team led by more than seven points in the final 15 minutes of regulation, and Nowell steadied Kansas State's offense down the stretch, finding Massoud for a 3-pointer that made it 80-75 and hitting a jumper with 1:04 left for the Wildcats' final basket of regulation.Massoud, who like Nowell honed his game on the playgrounds of Harlem, finished with 15 points for the Wildcats, who shot 55.9% from the field. They become only the second team to shoot better than 50% against the Spartans this season. Cam Carter added 12 points.Jaden Akins added 14 points for coach Tom Izzo’s Spartans, the final Big Ten team in the tournament. Michigan State outrebounded Kansas State 37-31 and finished 31 of 63 from the field (49.2%).“We got caught mesmerized on Nowell,” Izzo said. “He’s a special player. We actually did a pretty good job on him. ... It was the assists that really killed us, and the back cuts.”Both teams were efficient from 3-point range in a tournament that's featured shaky outside shooting, with Michigan State hitting 13 of 25 (52%) and Kansas State connecting on 11 of 24 (45.8%).Nowell was the difference, putting his name alongside New York City point guard greats like Kenny Smith, Kenny Anderson, Mark Jackson and Bob Cousy, and sending Kansas State to its first Elite Eight since 2018.BIG PICTUREMichigan State: The 68-year-old Izzo has led the Spartans to 25 straight NCAA Tournaments but is still seeking his second national title. Since their championship in 2000, the Spartans have made six Final Fours, most recently in 2019.Kansas State: Nowell has 64 points and 42 assists in three games, including 14 assists in the first round against Montana State. He had nine assists against Kentucky; one more would have given him double-doubles in all three games.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845221,Utah social media law means kids need approval from parents,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Children and teens in Utah would lose access to social media apps such as TikTok if they don’t have parental consent and face other restrictions under a first-in-the-nation law designed to shield young people from the addictive platforms.Two laws signed by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox Thursday prohibit kids under 18 from using social media between the hours of 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., require age verification for anyone who wants to use social media in the state and open the door to lawsuits on behalf of children claiming social media harmed them. Collectively, they seek to prevent children from being lured to apps by addictive features and from having ads promoted to them.The companies are expected to sue before the laws take effect in March 2024.The crusade against social media in Utah's Republican-supermajority Legislature is the latest reflection of how politicians’ perceptions of technology companies has changed, including among typically pro-business Republicans.Tech giants like Facebook and Google have enjoyed unbridled growth for over a decade, but amid concerns over user privacy, hate speech, misinformation and harmful effects on teens’ mental health, lawmakers have made Big Tech attacks a rallying cry on the campaign trail and begun trying to rein them in once in office. Utah’s law was signed on the same day TikTok’s CEO testified before Congress about, among other things, the platform's effects on teenagers’ mental health.But legislation has stalled on the federal level, pushing states to step in.Outside of Utah, lawmakers in red states including Arkansas, Texas, Ohio and Louisiana and blue states including New Jersey are advancing similar proposals. California, meanwhile, enacted a law last year requiring tech companies to put kids’ safety first by barring them from profiling children or using personal information in ways that could harm children physically or mentally.The new Utah laws also require that parents be given access to their child's accounts. They outline rules for people who want to sue over harms they claim the apps cause. If implemented, lawsuits against social media companies involving kids under 16 will shift the burden of proof and require social media companies show their products weren’t harmful — not the other way around.Social media companies could have to design new features to comply with parts of the laws that prohibit promoting ads to minors and showing them in search results. Tech companies like TikTok, Snapchat and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, make most of their money by targeting advertising to their users.The wave of legislation and its focus on age verification has garnered pushback from technology companies as well as digital privacy groups known for blasting their data collection practices.The Electronic Frontier Foundation earlier this month demanded Cox veto the Utah legislation, saying time limits and age verification would infringe on teens’ rights to free speech and privacy. Moreover, verifying every users’ age would empower social media platforms with more data, like the government-issued identification required, they said.If the law is implemented, the digital privacy advocacy group said in a statement, “the majority of young Utahns will find themselves effectively locked out of much of the web.""Tech industry lobbyists decried the laws as unconstitutional, saying they infringe on people’s right to exercise the First Amendment online.“Utah will soon require online services to collect sensitive information about teens and families, not only to verify ages, but to verify parental relationships, like government-issued IDs and birth certificates, putting their private data at risk of breach,” said Nicole Saad Bembridge, an associate director at NetChoice, a tech lobby group.What’s not clear in Utah's new law and those under consideration elsewhere is how states plan to enforce the new regulations. Companies are already prohibited from collecting data on children under 13 without parental consent under the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. To comply, social media companies already ban kids under 13 from signing up to their platforms — but children have been shown to easily get around the bans, both with and without their parents’ consent.Cox said studies have shown that time spent on social media leads to “poor mental health outcomes” for children.“We remain very optimistic that we will be able to pass not just here in the state of Utah but across the country legislation that significantly changes the relationship of our children with these very destructive social media apps,” he said.The set of laws won support from parents groups and child advocates, who generally welcomed them, with some caveats. Common Sense Media, a nonprofit focused on kids and technology, hailed the effort to rein in social media's addictive features and set rules for litigation, with its CEO saying it “adds momentum for other states to hold social media companies accountable to ensure kids across the country are protected online.”However, Jim Steyer, the CEO and founder of Common Sense, said giving parents access to children’s social media posts would “deprive kids of the online privacy protections we advocate for."" Age verification and parental consent may hamper kids who want to create accounts on certain platforms, but does little to stop companies from harvesting their data once they're on, Steyer said.The laws are the latest effort from Utah lawmakers focused on the fragility of children in the digital age. Two years ago, Cox signed legislation that called on tech companies to automatically block porn on cellphones and tablets sold in the state, after arguments about the dangers it posed to children found resonance among Utah lawmakers, the majority of whom are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Amid concerns about enforcement, lawmakers ultimately revised that legislation to prevent it from taking effect unless five other states passed similar laws.The regulations come as parents and lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about kids and teenagers’ social media use and how platforms like TikTok, Instagram and others are affecting young people’s mental health. The dangers of social media to children is also emerging as a focus for trial lawyers, with addiction lawsuits being filed thorughout the country.___Ortutay reported from Oakland, California.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845222,Scandal-plagued Japan tech giant Toshiba gets tender offer,"TOKYO (AP) — Scandal-embattled Japanese electronics and technology manufacturer Toshiba has accepted a 2 trillion yen ($15 billion) tender offer from Japan Industrial Partners, a buyout fund made up of major banks and companies.If the proposal succeeds, it will be a major step in Toshiba’s yearslong turnaround effort, allowing it to go private and delist from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. But overseas activist investors own a significant part of Toshiba’s shares, and it’s unclear if they will be happy with the latest bid.Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp. announced its board accepted the bid at 4,620 yen ($36) a share late Thursday, after trading closed in Tokyo. Toshiba closed at 4,213 yen ($32) a share Thursday, and gained 4.2% to 4,390 yen ($34) on Friday.The move comes at a time of market jitters over ripple effects from the recent collapse of banks in the U.S.The buyout would keep Toshiba’s business Japanese in an alliance with Japanese partners.Japan Industrial Partners, set up in 2002 to restructure Japanese companies, lists big names among where it has invested, such as Sony, Hitachi, Olympus and NEC.The consortium includes about 20 Japanese companies, such as Orix Corp., a financial services company, electronics manufacturer Rohm Co. and the megabanks, including Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., according to Japanese media reports.The deep troubles at Toshiba began with a sprawling accounting scandal in 2015, involving books being doctored for years. That added to its woes related to its nuclear energy business.Its U.S. nuclear arm Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy in 2017, after years of deep losses as safety costs soared. Toshiba is also involved in the decommissioning effort at the Fukushima nuclear plant heavily damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.Toshiba has gone through several presidents over the years, as the brand once prized for making household appliances, laptops, batteries and computer chips, became the target of overseas activist shareholders.The latest proposal still needs to go through regulatory reviews in several countries, including the U.S., Vietnam, Germany and Morocco. The process is expected to take several months.Toshiba has been trying to go private in recent years. Proposals to split Toshiba into three, and then two, companies were rejected by shareholders. Delisting would allow Toshiba to leave behind the activist investors.Toshiba had its humble beginnings in a telegraph equipment factory in 1875. The brand had been synonymous with the power of modern Japan’s manufacturing sector. It has sold parts of its operations, including its flash-memory business, now known as Kioxia, although Toshiba remains a stakeholder in Kioxia.Whether Toshiba can get back on a solid growth track remains uncertain. Last month, Toshiba lowered its profit forecast for the fiscal year through March to 130 billion yen ($1 billion), down from an earlier projection for a 190 billion yen ($1.5 billion) profit.___Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",2023/03/24,,World

Good thing the brusque Stanley Cup winner isn't paid by the word.James van Riemsdyk scored the only goal in a shootout, and Philadelphia beat the Minnesota Wild 5-4 on Thursday night for Tortorella's 700th victory.Tortorella is 700-573-181 in 1,454 games as an NHL head coach. His 700 wins rank 12th in NHL history and his career games rank ninth in NHL history. He led Tampa Bay to the Stanley Cup in 2004. In his first season coaching the Flyers, Tortorella joined Peter Laviolette as the second American-born coach to win 700 games.“I think the culture's kind of changed around here,” Flyers forward Joel Farabee said. “I think he's done a really good job of keeping the group together.”Farabee, Scott Laughton, Rasmus Ristolainen and Tyson Foerster scored for Philadelphia. The Flyers have two straight games for the first time since Jan. 9-14 when they won three straight. Yeah, it's been that kind of season.“Farabee’s starting to pop, he’s looking real good. Tyson is looking real good,” Flyers defenseman Tony DeAngelo said. ""This is all about laying the foundation for next year but we get a lot of money to do this job. It’s something we love, so we’re gonna go out and give it our best every night.”Matt Boldy had two goals for the Wild, and Oskar Sundqvist and Marcus Foligno also scored.“We weren’t very good. They were good,"" Wild coach Dean Evason said. ""We knew they were playing well, they played well tonight. We were loose. We were not firm, turnovers, it didn’t look like our hockey club.”The Flyers and Wild were tied 1-all at the end of the first period, 3-3 at the end of the second and 4-4 headed into OT.The rebuilding Flyers have been plucky of late. They had won two of three coming into the game, with the lone loss in overtime. They showed some of that grit in the final two periods, scoring late tying goals.“It’s a credit to their group, to their coaching staff, that they’ve got them playing the right way,” Evason said.Boldy poked a backhander past Carter Hart with 6:28 left for a 4-3 lead. The Flyers, playing more for the No. 1 pick and for pride, tied the game on Foerster’s second goal of the season.Farabee tipped in Cam York’s shot early in the second for a 2-1 lead.The Wild got going when Boldy ripped one top shelf past Hart for his 24th goal of the season that tied the game 2-all. Foligno scored his seventh goal for the 3-2 lead.Ristolainen buried a hard slapper from the blue line on the power play for the tying goal with 23 seconds left in the second.“I think it’s good to try to lay this foundation, kind of get ready for next year. You see guys getting confidence,” DeAngelo said.The Flyers only played ahead in the first period.Laughton scored off the rush for his 17th goal of the season and a 1-0 lead. Sundqvist celebrated his birthday with a deflection for the tying goal with 3:24 left in the period.The Flyers had been one of the lowest-scoring teams in the NHL until the start of this seven-game homestand (3-2 so far). They have scored at least three goals in every game and at least four in the last four.“We have definitely gotten to the net better,” Tortorella said. “We have spent a lot of time on the ice and with tape as far as getting to that area.”UP NEXTWild: Host Chicago on Saturday.Flyers: Host Detroit on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845225,New Mexico tribe keeps title to portion of national preserve,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — A Native American tribe has been granted title to a portion of a national preserve in northern New Mexico following a yearslong court battle against the federal government, a ruling that could provide hope to other tribes seeking to regain rights to their traditional homelands.The 10th U.S. Circuit of Appeals issued a split ruling Wednesday in the case brought by Jemez Pueblo over lands it was seeking to reclaim in the Valles Caldera National Preserve.The pueblo had argued its aboriginal property rights — or rights to occupy and use land as their ancestors did — were never extinguished despite a lower court ruling in 2019 that found the U.S. government had clear title to the expansive preserve. Following an appeal and a subsequent trial, the pueblo opted to narrow its claims to four specific areas within Valles Caldera’s boundaries.The latest ruling acknowledged the pueblo's title to an area known as Banco Bonito but rejected claims to three other areas, with the court saying the tribe had not put the government on notice that it was seeking claim to those specific areas.Legal experts say the partial victory marks the first time in the U.S. that a tribe has ever demanded the return of an aboriginal title that has not been extinguished, or terminated, and gone to court successfully to recover it. Still they say it's unclear what the broader implications will be for future land disputes as more tribes seek to reclaim traditional homelands.Jemez Pueblo officials could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday, and the National Park Service declined to comment on the decision, saying only that the litigation was pending.Both the pueblo and federal government still could appeal Wednesday ruling.Robert Coulter, executive director of the Indian Law Resource Center in Montana, called it a long and complex case.“I think one of the most significant things is that it made what I believe is a breakthrough in determining that tribes can reclaim land to which they have aboriginal title that has not been lawfully extinguished,” he said. “That point was not at all clear in the past.”The appellate ruling unwinds a previous lower court finding that Jemez Pueblo would have had to maintain control over Banco Bonito before and after 1860 — when the government granted the land to private owners — in order to keep its title. Judge Gregory Phillips wrote that creating such a hurdle would likely keep other tribes from ""establishing aboriginal title into the modern era.”In a dissenting opinion, Judge Nancy Moritz argued that relying on a tribe’s exclusive use of an area “for a long time” during any time period could subject the government to new aboriginal title claims.“There is no reason tribes nationwide could not file similar claims seeking aboriginal title to lands within the 18 other national preserves scattered throughout the United States or, for that matter, to any lands owned or later acquired by the government,” Moritz wrote.Jemez Pueblo considers Valles Caldera a spiritual sanctuary and part of its traditional homeland. It's home to vast grasslands, the remnants of a massive volcanic eruption and one of New Mexico’s most famous elk herds.The court record states that for over 800 years, many tribes and pueblos have used Valles Caldera for hunting, gathering and various cultural and religious practices. Redondo Peak, the highest mountain in the caldera, is a site long used as part of religious pilgrimages and is home to several shrines.Jemez Pueblo first sued the federal government in 2012, saying tribes have legal and just claims to retain possession of land that they have historically occupied within the United States. The legal fight came as members of Congress and others started to push for management of the sprawling preserve to be transferred to the National Park Service.When the tribe first made its case before the appellate court in 2014, then-Pueblo Gov. Joshua Madalena described Valles Caldera as the tribe’s spiritual mother, likening it to the Vatican for Catholics. Many of the court filings are redacted, seeking to keep secret details about traditions and culturally significant locations.Federal attorneys initially argued that the tribe’s aboriginal title was essentially extinguished when surveyors, working under the authority of Congress, determined the land was vacant and turned it over to land grant heirs in 1860 as part of a swap.The federal government purchased the property in 2000 with the goal of operating it as a working ranch while developing recreational opportunities for the public. It was eventually taken over by the Park Service.Coulter said the ruling by the 10th Circuit panel of judges is significant even though Jemez Pueblo didn't get everything it had hoped for.“We’ve seen generations of judicial decisions where the courts simply were not willing to apply the law in a straightforward manner in Indian cases,” he said.",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Paolo Banchero's 21 points included a 3 with 1:26 remaining and two free throws in the final seconds to help the Orlando Magic turn back the New York Knicks 111-106 on Thursday night.“It was the right play. They kicked it to me in the corner and I have to take that shot,” said Banchero, a 28% 3-point shooter. “Otherwise everybody’s mad at me.”Cole Anthony added 18 points for Orlando and Wendell Carter Jr. had 16 points and eight rebounds. Franz Wagner scored 16 points before leaving in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury.Quentin Grimes and Immanuel Quickley scored 25 points each for the Knicks, who lost their third straight. Julius Randle finished with 23 points and nine rebounds.With Jalen Brunson out with an injury and Randle on the bench, the Knicks went almost 5 1/2 minutes without scoring in the second quarter and fell behind 46-27.The first half ended with Randle drawing a technical foul from referee Leon Wood and jawing with Quickley, who was trying to restrain him as they walked off the court.“Everybody’s trying to win. That’s all I can really say about that,” Quickley said. “Sometimes that happens.”New York had a 23-4 run and tied it at 75 on Quickley's two free throws with 49 seconds left in the third quarter, but the Knicks never took the lead in the second half. Anthony and Gary Harris opened the fourth quarter with 3s and the Knicks spent the rest of the game trying to catch up.“We gave up 36 points in the fourth quarter tonight. That’s not who we are,” Quickley said.“In the third quarter we got out of the hole, and then at the start of the fourth quarter we played poorly,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeaux said. “That third quarter our defense got us into the open floor. We got some easy buckets. That helped us a lot, but we exerted so much energy trying to fight out of that hole that we fell short in the end.”Banchero finished with six rebounds, four assists and two steals and spent much of the game guarding Randle, who shot 7 for 20.“He just had 57 points a few games ago, which is ridiculous. I just tried to slow him down,” said Banchero, who is trying to boost the Magic's slim playoff hopes with only eight games left in his rookie season.“Honestly I feel like we haven’t played a game this year that wasn’t meaningful,” he said. “Every game has been competitive. Teams trying to get into playoff position are desperate and it makes it more fun when the level gets raised.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845227,UConn a step from Final Four after 88-65 blowout of Arkansas,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — After UConn lost as a 5 seed to 12th-seeded New Mexico State in the first round of last year's NCAA Tournament, Huskies coach Dan Hurley told his core players they would be back on this stage.Not only would they return, but Hurley said he would surround them with players capable of taking them deep into March.They are certainly doing that.The Huskies' 88-65 victory over Arkansas in the West Region semifinals on Thursday night was their third by double digits in as many games. Jordan Hawkins scored 24 points to lead the dominant effort.Fourth-seeded UConn (28-8) will play No. 3 seed Gonzaga on Saturday for a spot in the Final Four, a stout response to last year's early exit.“We really from that day on really held each other to a higher standard and just told each other we’re going to push for a national championship,” UConn guard Andre Jackson Jr. said. “We’re going to push for that type of standard every day in practice and we’re going to hold each other to that.”UConn is playing like a team capable of winning its fifth national title and first since 2014. The Huskies have outscored their three March Madness opponents by 62 points.“They’ve got a real complete team, probably the most complete team in the country,” Arkansas guard Ricky Council IV said. “I think they can definitely win it all.”The Huskies won their first two games by outscoring Iona and Saint Mary's by a combined 86-49 in the second half. UConn surged early against Arkansas with a 14-point run and took a 46-29 lead into halftime.The Huskies never trailed and led by as many as 29 points.UConn, which has won nine of its past 10 games, shot 57.4% compared to 31.7% for Arkansas. The Huskies dominated inside, outrebounding the Razorbacks 43-31 and outscoring them 42-24 in the lane.Adama Sanogo scored 18 points, Alex Karaban had 11 and Nahiem Alleyene 10 for UConn. Sanogo, who also had eight rebounds, has scored 71 points in 75 minutes in this tournament.Anthony Black led Arkansas (22-14) with 20 points, Council had 17 and Nick Smith Jr. 11.“I’m just proud of the way we’ve built this thing,” said Hurley, who is in his fifth season. ""We’ve got an incredible group of players, and we get the right type of people and we’ve got great culture. We’re right where we thought we would be.""MAKING PROGRAM HISTORYEighth-seeded Arkansas was seeking a third straight appearance in the Elite Eight, which would have been a first for the program. The Razorbacks made three consecutive Sweet 16s for the second time.“There are not a lot of teams that have been to three straight Sweet 16s in the entire country, and we are one of them,"" coach Eric Musselman said. “The culture is strong. As a staff, we’ll start working towards next year tonight as soon as we get back to the hotel.”Senior Kamani Johnson won't be around next season to see if the Razorbacks can get back to this point, but he said the program is in good hands.“We’re doing something special in Arkansas and we’re of building on that,” Johnson said. “It hurts right now, but I’m really proud of this group.”STILL PERFECTUConn improved to 15-0 in nonconference games, all by double digits. Oklahoma State came the closest, losing 74-64 on Dec. 1.“When people see us for the first time, it’s a great advantage to us because we are not a ball-screen heavy team,” Hurley said. “We have a lot of movement on offense. We’ve got the two centers (Sanogo and Karaban) that can dominate a game. We’re a unique team to play against if you haven’t seen us.”SPREADING THE WEALTHAs dominant as UConn was inside, the Huskies also made 9 of 20 3-pointers and had 22 assists.“To me, the most impressive thing is that they had 22 assists,” Musselman said. ""We tried to cause turnovers and rush the quarterback, but 22 assists is a lot of assists.""UConn entered the game averaging 17.4 assists.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World

Eleven minutes later, the Argentine great netted the second with another free kick to the delight of the capacity crowd.“I always dreamed of this moment, celebrating with you,” an emotional Messi said after the match, standing with his family on the pitch. He lifted the World Cup trophy once more in front of his fans and took a slow victory lap with his teammates, who carried miniatures of the same trophy, as fireworks erupted over the stadium.It was Messi's 800th goal in his professional career. If he scores another in Argentina's next friendly against Curacao on Tuesday, he will hit the mark of 100 goals for the national team.Argentina's full squad in Qatar attended the match. Messi and others brought their families to the stadium. Coach Lionel Scaloni was one of the most emotional; he was tearful before and after the match.The match culminates a week in which the 35-year-old Messi was widely celebrated as a hero after helping Argentina win its third World Cup title, a remarkable change from years when some of the same fans accused him of apathy with the national team.___AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845230,"Saudi Arabia, Syria may restore ties as Mideast reshuffles","BEIRUT (AP) — Saudi Arabia is in talks with Syria to reopen its embassy in the war-torn nation for the first time in a decade, state television in the kingdom reported late Thursday, the latest diplomatic reshuffling in the region.The announcement on state TV comes after Chinese-mediated talks in Beijing saw Saudi Arabia and Iran agree to reopen embassies in each others' nations after years of tensions. Syrian President Bashar Assad has maintained his grip on power in the Mediterranean nation rocked by the 2011 Arab Spring only with the help of Iran and Russia, which made a historic call earlier in the day to Oman.Saudi Arabian state television aired a report late Thursday, quoting an anonymous official in the country's Foreign Ministry, acknowledging the talks between the kingdom and Damascus.“A source in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed to Al-Ekhbariyah that ongoing discussions have begun with the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on what was circulated by some international media,” an anchor said on air. “Discussions are underway between officials in the kingdom and their counterparts in Syria about resuming the provision of consular services.”Arabic-language media had been reporting the possible detente in recent days ahead of the Saudi state TV announcement. The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous Saudi and Syrian officials, attributed the talks to reopen the countries' embassies to Russian mediation.Syrian state media did not immediately acknowledge the talks. Officials in both Saudi Arabia and Syria did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press early Friday.Earlier Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Oman's Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, which the Kremlin called the “the first high-level bilateral contact since the establishment of diplomatic relations"" between the nations. Muscat established ties with the Soviet Union in 1985.Oman long has been an interlocutor between the West and Iran. Recent months have seen talks in Oman over Yemen's long-running war, in which Saudi Arabia backs the country's exiled government against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that hold its capital, Sanaa.The kingdom backed the Syrian opposition against Assad during Syria’s uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011. However, in recent years, a regional rapprochement has been brewing. Last month’s devastating earthquake in Syria and Turkey sparked international sympathy and speeded up the process, with Saudi and other Arab countries shipping aid to Damascus.Assad visited Oman in late February. He traveled Sunday to the United Arab Emirates, another nation that earlier had backed fighters trying to topple his government.Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister has acknowledged publicly that there is a growing consensus among Arab countries that dialogue with Damascus is necessary. Saudi Arabia is hosting the next Arab League summit in May, where most states hope to restore Syria’s membership after it was suspended in 2011, the league’s secretary-general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, has said.China's and Russia's interest in the Middle East long has been a concern for U.S. officials, which view the the region as crucial to global energy prices even as America pumps more crude oil than ever before and doesn't rely on Saudi oil as much as it once did. Saudi Arabia has grown closer to Russia as Moscow has rallied allies to back production cuts by OPEC to boost global oil prices amid the coronavirus pandemic.Relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia also have been at a low since President Joe Biden took office calling the kingdom a “pariah” over the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The State Department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.___Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Vladimir Isachenkov contributed to this report.",2023/03/24,,World

I need to step up there,” he said. “I think I will be happy for the goal tomorrow, but we lose today.”Jake Walman and Alex Chiasson also scored for Detroit.Magnus Hellberg and Alex Nedeljkovic combined for 18 saves.Lucas Raymond scored on the only goal during the shootout in Detroit’s 3-2 victory at St. Louis on Tuesday. The Red Wings got off to a quick start in the rematch.Edvinsson's goal came 38 seconds in when he skated in from the left point and took a shot that bounced off a defender's leg and trickled through Hofer's pads.Walman lifted a shot from the left side over Hofer's right shoulder to make it 2-0.Toropchenko scored midway through the period on a shot from the point. Nathan Walker, playing in his 100th career game, had an assist to make it 2-1.“That was a big goal because it got us some momentum,” Blues defenseman Colton Parayko said. “I thought we played well after that.”St. Louis stormed ahead in the second period.Schenn tied it at 2 when he tipped in Jordan Kyrou's shot, and Blais put the Blues in front at 12:40 of the period when he tapped in a rebound of Parayko's shot.“We kind of give up one and they started building momentum,” Chiasson said. “Next thing you know, we were chasing the game.”Nedeljkovic then replaced Hellberg, but Neighbours scored less than two minutes later on a breakaway.“It’s really tough to judge a game overall when four of their first five chances go in,” Detroit coach Derek Lalonde said. “I hated the way we handled it and I hated the way we lost our momentum and energy every time a goal went in.”Chiasson scored on a backhander during a scramble around the net with 2:16 remaining.“I thought we were pretty good once we started playing,” St. Louis coach Craig Berube said. “We weren’t on our toes at the start of the game, so we were slow and they were winning a lot of battles.”NOTES: The Red Wings recalled Nedeljkovic from Grand Rapids of the AHL under emergency conditions.

We find a way to win hockey games.”Nick Suzuki and Kirby Dach each scored power-play goals against Boston's No. 1 penalty kill, Suzuki added an assist and Jake Allen made 17 saves in Montreal's 10th loss in 12 games.The 932nd meeting between the Original Six rivals and their only matchup in Boston this season was chippy. The Bruins were upset early with Rem Pitlick's hit on Patrice Bergeron, leading Brad Marchand to take down Pitlick.“You don't hit our captain like that. It was a three-second late hit,” Montgomery said. “I love the fact that Marchand made the guy pay a price.”There were 31 penalty minutes in the first period, including a game misconduct against the Bruins' A.J. Greer after his crosscheck to the face of Mike Hoffman as they awaited a face-off.“A pretty dirty play,"" Suzuki said.The Canadiens got within 2-1 on the ensuing power play on Suzuki's one-timer. It was the first goal allowed by Swayman after consecutive shutouts.But Swayman made two tremendous saves to start the second period before Pastrnak buried a shot from the low slot to give him a career-high in goals. Allen later robbed Pastrnak in his bid to get No. 50.Krejci's backhander at 12:16 gave Boston a cushion. Pastrnak earned the secondary assist to give him 95 points.“These games against Montreal never get old,” Pastrnak said.Boston took the lead 4:34 in when Bertuzzi earned his first goal since being acquired from Detroit on March 2. And it was an odd one. His feed from behind the net bounced off Canadiens defenseman Mike Matheson's stick, then banked in off the back of Allen's leg.DeBrusk raced past a colliding Joel Edmundson and David Savard and scored seconds after a Montreal power play expired to make it 2-0 at 13:38.But the Canadiens, last in the Atlantic, rallied despite more injury issues. While Montreal welcomed back Jake Evans (knee) after a 28-game absence, it played without Josh Anderson, who appeared to injure his right ankle in the final minute of Tuesday’s win over Tampa Bay.“I thought we were the better team for most of the night,” Suzuki said.MARCHAND SIGNS OFFMarchand, known for hot takes and dust-ups on Twitter, said he deactivated his account after being told his verified blue check mark would be taken away unless he paid a monthly fee.“So I said, ’You know what?

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845240,Dachser sees another leap in growth,"Between economic boom and normalization: Dachser generates an additional billion EUR in revenue and plans investments of over EUR 300 million
KEMPTEN/MUNICH -  Media OutReach - 24 March 2023 - For the 2022 financial year, logistics provider Dachser reports revenue of EUR 8.1 billion (+14.9 percent), marking the second consecutive year of double-digit growth.             A high level of logistics expertise, reliability, and the quality of services were the foundations for Dachser's success last year. ""We're about to break into a new league,"" said Burkhard Eling, CEO of Dachser, at the company's annual press conference in Munich. ""Our customers appreciate the resilience we bring to their supply chains and reward this service. Today, Dachser is increasingly being perceived as the partner for globally interconnected solutions and a consultant for optimized supply chains.""   In addition, the main drivers of this growth were disruption-prone supply chains and scarce capacity, which led to high price levels in the market. Starting in September 2022, the economic boom in logistics transitioned to a clear normalization of business with declining shipment numbers and rates, especially in air and sea freight. Over the year as a whole, Dachser transported 81.1 million shipments (−2.9 percent) weighing the same as last year: 42.8 million metric tons.   Business development in detail   Dachser's  Road Logistics business field—which comprises the transport and warehousing of industrial and consumer goods (European Logistics) and food (Food Logistics)—increased its revenue by 14.2 percent to EUR 5.7 billion in 2022. Transported tonnage rose slightly by 0.4 percent, while the number of shipments fell by 2.8 percent in an environment of high fuel and energy prices and growing consumer restraint.   The  European Logistics business line increased its revenue by 13.4 percent, growing at roughly the same rate as it did in 2021. In contrast, the number of shipments fell by 3.5 percent. Tonnage held constant at 30.0 million. The  Food Logistics business line saw major growth in 2022, with revenue increasing by 17.1 percent. As a catch-up effect after coronavirus-related restrictions had been lifted, there were slight increases in both shipments (+1.8 percent) and tonnage (+1.1 percent) in this business line. Dachser Food Logistics generated revenue of EUR 1.3 billion in the past financial year and thus remains a stable and reliable pillar of the business model.   Following the exceptional revenue growth in 2021, last year's greater capacity in air and sea freight and the sputtering growth in China ensured that growth in the  Air and Sea Logistics business field settled at a lower level. Here, Dachser closed out the year with a 16.7 percent increase in revenue from EUR 2.1 billion to 2.4 billion, even as the number of shipments fell by a total of 7.3 percent.   ""During the coronavirus pandemic, our air and sea freight business raised its profile significantly,"" Eling said. ""Contributing factors were the expansion of the LCL groupage business in sea freight and the air freight charter network, which operated 260 flights last year alone. Our customers appreciate how deeply integrated our services are—on land, at sea, and in the air. We will strengthen this USP even further in the future.""   Business with contract logistics—the intelligent combination of warehousing, value-added services, and transport—developed very positively. In 2022, Dachser offered its contract logistics customers 2.7 million pallet spaces, around 152,000 more than in the previous year. The company currently has 163 warehouse locations on four continents, with plans to add 14 more facilities in 2023.   The workforce grew in 2022 by around 1,100 people to a total of 32,850. Its high equity ratio of more than 60 percent enables Dachser to continue investing significantly in digitalization, climate action, its employees, and the expansion of its network, even when economic times are tough.   Eling stated the company will continue on its chosen course in 2023 and announced that, following the EUR 196 million it invested in 2022, it plans to invest over EUR 300 million in 2023. Dachser has already started the new year with the acquisition of the Dutch food logistics company Müller and the air and sea freight forwarder ACA International, which is based in Melbourne, Australia.   The year has gotten off to a cautious start with comparatively low transport volumes, but Dachser sees no cause for concern. ""We expect that after two years of exceptional revenue growth, but also exceptional burdens on the operational teams, 2023 will now see a return to a bit of normality in logistics and in our business,"" Eling said in Munich.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845260,CKS Memorial Hall military guard in Taipei: Dictator worship or tourist draw?,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Ministry of Defense believes the permanent military guard watching over the large bronze statue in the center of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall (中正紀念堂), depicting the hall’s namesake and Taiwan’s former military dictator, should remain there as a symbol of protection for the head of state, according to reported discussions between government agencies.Legislator Lin I-chin (林宜瑾) raised a general question in the legislature on March 17 suggesting that the removal of the guard would be a simple way for the Ministry of Culture to deny allegiance to a specific individual, per Watchout. Premier Chen Chien-jen (陳建仁) and Minister of Culture Shih Che (史哲) responded, saying that “de-authorization” and “de-individualization” is the consensus between both major parties.Critics of the military guard believe it symbolizes reverence for Taiwan’s authoritarian past, and suggest that the soldiers be moved to guard the flag platform, thus solving the problem of alleged “dictator loyalty” while protecting the guard’s sightseeing value. However, under-secretary for the Ministry of Culture Sue Wang (王時思) told Watchout that ongoing discussions between her ministry and the Ministry of Defense have hit upon a key disagreement; that the latter believes it's inappropriate for the guard to become a purely sightseeing attraction.Wang said that Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall is under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and that while she thinks the guards are inappropriate, her ministry still needs to coordinate with the Ministry of Defense on the matter. She said that in addition to the memorial hall, the Sun Yat-sen memorial hall and the Chiang family mausoleum in Taoyuan still need to be discussed.In 2007, the Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) government removed the guard, renamed the hall National Taiwan Democracy Hall, and the surrounding grounds Liberty Square. The guard and hall’s original name were restored by Ma Ying-jeou’s (馬英九) government in 2009, though the name Liberty Square remains.",2023/03/24,1002,Politics

For me, it was my first one.”Donovan Mitchell scored 31 points, Evan Mobley had 26 points and 16 rebounds and Jarrett Allen finished with 12 points and 10 rebounds against his former team. Cleveland, which beat Brooklyn 115-109 on Tuesday, won for the eighth time in 10 games and reduced its magic number to clinch one of the Eastern Conference's top playoff spots to two.“It was ugly at times,” Mitchell said. “There’s just so much going on (in the playoff race), and at the end of the day all we can do is control what we can control and winning these games instead of praying that other teams lose or win, we just gotta go out there and do what we do, and it’s great to have a win like this tonight.”Mikal Bridges scored 32 points, Spencer Dinwiddie had 25 points and 12 assists and Joe Harris hit five 3-pointers and finished with 15 points as the Nets lost their fifth straight game.“It’s frustrating,” Bridges said. “Obviously, we’ve got to keep the energy and morale high, but it’s devastating losing like that.”Cleveland trailed 112-104 with 2:13 left before closing the game on a 12-2 run, with the help of three crucial Nets turnovers. Trailing by one, Mitchell missed a second free throw that would’ve tied the game, then he missed a put-back, and three different Nets had their hands on the ball for the potential rebound before it bounded to Cleveland guard Caris LeVert.“I thought we did a great job of getting some stops to put ourselves in that position,” Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “You miss the free throw, we had multiple opportunities at it, but guys didn’t quit on the play, and we talk about winning 50-50 balls and winning the scrap.”LeVert, who spent his first four seasons with Brooklyn, found Okoro in the corner, and he drained the 3-pointer to give Cleveland the lead.“The ball goes out to Caris, and I’m just running to the corner and going to my spot, and Caris trusted me,” Okoro said. “Once it left my hand, I knew it was going in.”Bickerstaff said Okoro had no fear of taking the big shot.“But I think what was most important is Caris saw that he was open and got him the ball, and that speaks to this team,” Bickerstaff said.A heave from half court by Bridges at the buzzer fell short.Bridges secured his eighth 30-plus point game as a member of the Nets through three quarters with 14 points in the third quarter. Then Harris heated up with four fourth-quarter 3-pointers in a sub-five-minute span, helping Brooklyn build a 10-point advantage.“I felt like we deserved to win that game because we did a lot of good things throughout the course of the night,” Nets coach Jacque Vaughn said. “This is an opportunity for us to learn who we are.”The Cavaliers rank first in the NBA in points-against per game and defensive rating, but had no answer for the Nets offense, which shot 56% in the first half. Dinwiddie had 19 points, including 11 in the second quarter, and seven assists, helping Brooklyn take a 61-60 lead into the break.Mitchell and Bridges each scored in double figures in the first quarter, seeming to trade baskets in the early going. Mitchell scored 12 in the first, including nine in the first 2:17. Bridges had 10, helping the Nets build a 33-31 lead after one.TIP-INS Cleveland: Mitchell is 35 points from 10,000 for his career. … With two made 3-pointers Thursday, Garland is now four away from tying Wesley Person for eighth place on the Cavaliers’ all-time list. … Guard Raul Neto (left-hamstring tightness) missed his second straight game.Brooklyn: Bridges is averaging 25.8 points and 5.1 rebounds per game for the Nets since joining them via trade Feb. 11. Ben Simmons (left-knee/back soreness) missed his 14th consecutive game. Vaughn said pregame Simmons has been working individually and “not with teammates.”UP NEXT Cavaliers: Host the Houston Rockets on Sunday.Nets: At Miami Heat on Saturday.___AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Brothers Eric and Marc Staal of the Florida Panthers declined to wear special Pride-themed warmup jerseys ahead of the team’s 6-2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday.The jerseys were part of Florida’s Pride night game in support of the area’s LGBTQ community, and the brothers cited their religion as the reason for the decision.“We carry no judgement on how people choose to live their lives, and believe that all people should be welcome in all aspects of the game of hockey,” the Staal brothers said in a statement. “Having said that, we feel that by us wearing a Pride jersey it goes against our Christian beliefs.”After the loss, Eric Staal said he wanted to stick with the brothers' statement and ""try my best to move forward.” Marc Staal was not made available to the media.While the Staal brothers declined to participate, Russian goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky was one of the Panthers who went ahead with the Pride-themed jerseys.The Chicago Blackhawks have decided against wearing special warmup jerseys to commemorate their Pride night on Sunday, citing an anti-gay Kremlin law that could imperil Russian athletes when they return home. The decision was made by the organization after conversations with its players.“My thought is the story is not about them,’’ said Florida coach Paul Maurice, who has coached Eric Staal since he was the second overall draft pick in 2003 by the Carolina Hurricanes.“The story is about the rest of the group being excited, the organization and the fans being excited to celebrate a great night. These are grown men who have lived in their faith their whole lives. This is not new to them. They have the right to take that stand. The rest of the players wore that sweater proudly and I hope we conveyed that message of ‘Welcome to our building, welcome to our franchise and welcome to the great game of hockey.’""Florida forward Matthew Tkachuk wore the warmup jersey, and said he “embraced a night like this.”“A night like tonight, for me, is just about including everyone,” he said. ""It is, in my opinion, the greatest game in the world and everyone is welcome in our locker room and into our organization.”Auston Matthews had two goals for Toronto, and Matt Murray made 33 saves.

Tkachuk tied it at 1 at 14:25 when a replay review determined Murray pulled Tkachuk’s odd-angled shot on a power play from over the goal line.The Maple Leafs went ahead to stay with three goals in the second. Nylander made it 2-1 at 1:20, and Matthews scored again at 2:57.After Cousins got one back for the Panthers at 11:43, Bunting scored with two Florida players in the penalty box at 18:21. Bunting’s 21st goal gave Toronto a 4-2 lead.The Maple Leafs put the game away with 5:37 remaining when Kerfoot scored off a pass from Tavares. Marner scored into an empty net just over a minute later.“We knew they had a lot of offensive power and did not need a lot of space to get chances,’’ Florida captain Aleksander Barkov said of Toronto. “We did not play that well in the defensive zone, gave them too many chances and their power play is one of the best in the league.""WORTH NOTINGFlorida was without C Sam Bennett for the second consecutive game with an undisclosed injury.

He then threw an inbound pass to Ismael Massoud, who knocked down a jumper with 17 seconds left for a 96-93 lead.With Michigan State needing a 3 to tie, Nowell stole the ball from the Spartans’ Tyson Walker and drove for a clinching layup at the buzzer.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845267,Ingram's 1st triple-double lifts Pelicans past Hornets,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Brandon Ingram had 30 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists for the first triple-double of his seven-year NBA career, leading the New Orleans Pelicans to a 115-96 victory over the short-handed Charlotte Hornets on Thursday night.Ingram picked up three consecutive rebounds late in the third quarter to get to double-digits in that category. His 20-foot jumper and free throw put New Orleans up 88-79 with 36 seconds left in the third. The Pelicans' 11-5 run to start the final quarter put the game away.“I just wanted to set the tone,” said Ingram, who did exactly that by scoring 17 points and dishing out six assists in the first quarter. “These games are important for us to be in the postseason. I’m just thinking that every possession counts on offense and defense, and I had to have a sense of urgency.”Pelicans coach Willie Green said Ingram makes the game seem so effortless that he did not realize he was close to his first career triple-double. He said what makes the accomplishment even more special was Ingram’s ability to fight through 37 missed games with a sore toe and a concussion.“I think it speaks to his maturity throughout this process,” Green said. “He understands that he’s going to have the ball in his hands at times. He’s doing a great job of setting the tone, which is just (being a) point-5, passing to his teammates and getting guys open. His rebounding has been huge for us. He’s doing that – and then we all know he can score at any moment.""So on all three levels tonight, he was fantastic.”Jonas Valanciunas scored 20 points and grabbed 19 rebounds for his 38th double-double of the season to help the Pelicans win their third in a row. C.J. McCollum added 20 points, Trey Murphy 19 and Naji Marshall had 16 off the bench.P.J. Washington scored 18 points, including 16 in the first half for Charlotte. Svi Mykhailiuk had 15 points and Gordon Hayward 12 points.The Hornets stayed close by shooting 53% from the floor (24 of 45) heading into halftime. But Kelly Oubre exited in the second quarter with a right shoulder strain after scoring 8 points in 12 minutes. Charlotte guard Terry Rozier left with a sore right foot after scoring 5 points.In the fourth quarter, the Hornets were tired and down to just seven healthy players.“The hard thing was it’s hard to not play without Gordon – and he can’t play every minute,” Charlotte coach Steve Clifford said. “That kind of hurt us and we got disorganized, and frankly we made some mistakes.”Ingram’s first-quarter blitz helped New Orleans open a 37-24 lead, but the Hornets used a 33-25 second quarter to cut the halftime deficit to 62-57. Ingram had 19 points and nine assists in the first half.The Pelicans held the Hornets to 39 second-half points.Ingram said he was grateful his revived play is coming at the perfect time for the Pelicans, who now embark on a critical four-game road trip.“I’m grateful to be out here playing with my teammates, having a chance to be on the floor every single day now in practice,” Ingram said. “I don’t take it for granted. Going those 30 games without being on the floor, you try to find ways to stay with the team, try to find ways to stay positive. And this is not always easy. So being on the floor now, I just I’m super excited and happy.”TIP-INSHornets: Clifford said third-year C Nick Richards, averaging career highs in points (7.9), rebounds (6.1), blocks (1.1) and minutes per game (18.2), deserved his 3-year, $15 million extension. “He’s had some absolutely monster games, and I think his confidence is growing,” Clifford said. “It all comes from his hard work.”Pelicans: Valanciunas entered averaging 20.5 points and 15.8 rebounds in his last three games. “JV is a huge part of our offense, so we are making sure he touches the ball,” Green said. “It settles us down and we get to the free throw line, and we’re also able to create offense from the post.”UP NEXTHornets: Travel to Dallas on Friday night.Pelicans: Open a four-game road trip Saturday night against the LA Clippers.—AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845269,"Do Kwon, wanted in $40B crypto crash, arrested in Montenegro","PODGORICA, Montenegro (AP) — Police in Montenegro have arrested Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, who is wanted in South Korea in connection with a $40 billion crash of the firm’s cryptocurrency that devastated retail investors around the world, the European country’s interior minister said Thursday.“Montenegrin police arrested an individual who is believed to be one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon,” Interior Minister Filip Adzic said on Twitter. South Korea’s Justice Ministry on Friday confirmed the arrest of Kwon and another unidentified individual linked to the cryptocurrency crash and said it will proceed with steps to extradite them to South Korea. Both South Korea and Montenegro are signees to the European Convention on Extradition.South Korea asked Interpol in September to circulate a “red notice” for the 31-year-old Kwon across the agency’s 195 member nations to find and apprehend him.Kwon and the other man had been hiding in Serbia but moved to Montenegro after South Korean investigators tracked their whereabouts and asked Serbian authorities to detain them, the ministry said. The men were arrested at Montenegro’s Podgorica Airport while trying to depart for Dubai using fake Costa Rican passports, the ministry said.Kwon and five others connected to Terraform are wanted because of allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022.TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg in May.___AP writer Kim Tong-hyung contributed to this story from Seoul, South Korea.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845270,New Mexico OKs its 1st wildlife bridges to limit collisions,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — New Mexico will build its first wildlife highway overpasses for free-roaming cougars, black bears, bighorn sheep and other creatures large and small and will also set aside $100 million for conservation projects, under two bills signed Thursday by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.Advocates for the initiatives say the state stands to capture millions of dollars in federal matching funds for wildlife crossings and an array of established conservation programs. New Mexico hopes to expand efforts ranging from river stewardship to outdoor adventures for young people from low-income households.The state's first wildlife bridge is likely to span a state highway that traverses remote desert oilfields and Native American lands of the Navajo Nation, Jicarilla Apache Nation and several pueblo communities, including a treacherous hotspot for wildlife-auto collisions north of Cuba, New Mexico.Several hundred large animals — primarily deer and elk — are killed in the state each year by collisions that can also total cars and severely injure human passengers. The state estimates property damage from such wrecks at nearly $20 million annually, while unbroken roads also fracture habitats for monitored species of concern including the ornate box turtle, white-nosed coati and gila monster.Recent casualties include a roughly 4-year-old mountain lion that previously bore kittens and was struck and killed on State Highway 550 at Santa Ana Pueblo in January at night.Glenn Harper, manager of the Santa Ana Pueblo Range and Wildlife Division, said the pueblo is committed to establishing safe corridors for wildlife and that it shared a trove of GPS tracking data when state agencies were identifying the first crucial locations for bridges. The state Legislature commissioned the plan in 2019.“We have a pretty good sense of where these animals want to cross the highway,” Harper said. “As communities are growing around the pueblo, it becomes a cultural preservation issue. The pueblo is closely tied and entwined with the natural world.”Nearby states including Colorado, Arizona, Utah and Nevada already have invested substantially in wildlife crossings. And California last year broke ground on what it bills as the world’s largest — a bridge over a major Southern California highway for mountain lions and other animals hemmed in by urban sprawl.The second New Mexico bill signed Thursday places $50 million in a permanent trust aimed at generating investment earnings, plus a $50 million spending account to underwrite established programs in environmental stewardship, forest management, watershed health, outdoor recreation, agriculture, historic preservation and species protection.Many Republicans in the legislative minority opposed the conservation trust bill over concerns the state might expand public land holdings by unfairly outbidding individuals including ranchers. Opposition among Republican legislators to the wildlife crossings plan was more muted.The state joins others in the Western U.S. that already fund their own, similar conservation trusts that help them apply for federal financial awards. Such trusts are underwritten by lottery proceeds, taxes on cannabis or money borrowed from bond investors, said Brittany Fallon of the conservation group Western Resource Advocates.At a signing ceremony inside an REI Co-op store, Lujan Grisham highlighted New Mexico's efforts to set aside billions in investment accounts for future spending on conservation programs, infrastructure and early childhood education.More is needed to ensure natural wonders survive the next 50 years amid a financial windfall in state income linked to local oil production, she added.“We have to start thinking big in the context of how expensive it is to do the right public safety and conservation work,” Lujan Grisham said. “It is in fact expensive because it is a generational investment in the well-being"" of New Mexico.Last week the Legislature sent the governor a record $9.6 billion annual spending proposal, along with a $1.1 billion tax relief package. She has until April 7 to veto any provisions.",2023/03/24,,World

(AP) — Alison Lee and Jenny Shin each reeled off four straight birdies in the middle of their rounds and joined Gaby Lopez at 7-under 65 Thursday to share a one-stroke lead after the first round of the LPGA Drive on Championship.Lee, a 28-year-old American looking for her first tour win, birdied four of her first five holes. And, after a bogey at No. 16, her seventh hole, she pieced together a four straight birdies and five in the next six holes to reach 8 under at Superstition Mountain Golf Club before a bogey on her final hole dropped her into a three-way tie for the top spot of a crowded leaderboard.Shin, a 30-year-old from South Korea looking for her first win since 2016, posted seven birdies from Nos. 8 through 18 to earn a share of the lead in the tour's first full-field event of the season.Lopez had a bogey-free round. The 29-year-old Mexican started on the back nine and made the turn at 4-under par before adding three birdies on the front side to tie for the lead.Taiwan's Wei-Ling Hsu and England's Jodi Ewart Shadoff were tied for fourth after opening 66s. Ten players are tied for sixth place at 5 under, as 114 golfers in the 142-player field carded a score of even par or better. Play was suspended with one group left on the course, but none of the players threatening the leaders.Lee, who made the cut in 22 of her 24 events last season with a T-5 as her best finish at the Women’s Scottish Open, felt she left some shots on the course.“This sounds cliche, but I just feel like it was one of those days,” Lee said. “Golf just was easy. ... I honestly was playing so good I feel like I could have shot a lower round out there today.”Shin, who had a third-place finish among her three top-10s last season, was buoyed by her recent finishes in Singapore and Thailand, where she found herself in contention.“I’ve been out here for 13 years and the game of golf has changed so much,” Shin said. “The girls hit it so long and so straight and the putts are going in. ... So it was very refreshing and very nice to know that I was able to keep myself up there and know that I can do it as well.”Lopez, a threee-time winner on the LPGA Tour, played the course for the first time in five years and said her focus this year is to take a lighter approach to her craft.“I’m going to take it lighter this year,” she said. “Not going to play as many tournaments as I’ve done before, so going to take it a little easier on my body. Trying to enjoy a little bit more every single day out there.”The 28-year-old Hsu posted the finest round of the morning wave. She got off to a fast start, one-hopping her second shot on the opening hole into the cup for eagle. She followed that with a birdie at the par-5 second, hitting her third shot from about 60 yards to 2 feet to get to 3 under after two holes. She finished at 6 under.“Of course, I didn’t expect any like hole-out on very first hole,” said Hsu, whose lone win on the LPGA Tour came in 2021 at the Pure Silk Championship. “(This) feels like this is my first event of the year, so you don’t really think about anything. Like my first hole ... I thought my ball went over the green and disappear.”No. 2-ranked Nelly Korda and No. 3-ranked Jin Young Ko opened with a 2-under 70s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845274,Biden: US will 'forcefully' protect personnel in Syria,"OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — President Joe Biden said Friday that the U.S. would respond “forcefully” to protect its personnel after U.S. forces retaliated with airstrikes on sites in Syria used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Revolutionary Guard following a suspected Iranian-linked attack Thursday that killed a U.S. contractor and wounded seven other Americans in northeast Syria.“The United States does not, does not seek conflict with Iran,” Biden said in Ottawa, Canada, where he is on a state visit. But he said Iran and its proxies should be prepared for the U.S. “to act forcefully to protect our people. That’s exactly what happened last night.” Activists said the U.S. bombing killed at least four people.While it’s not the first time the U.S. and Iran have traded strikes in Syria, the attacks and the U.S. response threaten to upend recent efforts to deescalate tensions across the wider Middle East, whose rival powers have made steps toward détente in recent days after years of turmoil.The Pentagon said a drone attack on a U.S. base Thursday killed a contractor and injured five U.S. troops and another contractor. That was followed by two simultaneous attacks on U.S. forces in Syria Friday, according to U.S. officials.The officials said that based on preliminary information, there was a rocket attack Friday at a Conoco plant, and one U.S. service member was injured but is in stable condition. At about the same time, several drones were launched at Green Village, where U.S. troops are also based. One official said all but one of the drones were shot down, and there were no U.S. injuries there. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.Two Syrian opposition activist groups reported a new wave of airstrikes on eastern Syria that hit positions of Iran-backed militias after rockets were fired at a Conoco gas plant that has a base housing American troops. Several U.S. officials, however, said the U.S. did not launch any attacks late Friday, and it wasn't clear if the activists were referring to the attack on U.S. forces at Green Village.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the American intelligence community had determined the drone in Thursday's attack on was of Iranian origin. U.S. officials said that conclusion was based on recovered debris and intelligence threat streams. They offered no immediate evidence to support the claim. The drone hit a maintenance facility at a coalition base in the northeast Syrian city of Hasaka.In retaliation, the Pentagon said F-15 fighter jets flying out of al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar struck several locations around Deir el-Zour. Those strikes, said Austin, were a response to the drone attack “as well as a series of recent attacks against coalition forces in Syria” by groups affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard.Biden, speaking during a press conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, expressed his “deepest condolences” to the family of the American killed and well-wishes for the injured.Iran relies on a network of proxy forces through the Mideast to counter the U.S. and Israel, its arch regional enemy. The U.S. has had forces in northeast Syria since 2015, when they deployed as part of the fight against the Islamic State group, and maintains some 900 troops there, working with Kurdish-led forces that control around a third of Syria.Overnight, videos on social media purported to show explosions in Deir el-Zour, a strategic province that borders Iraq and contains oil fields. Iranian-backed militia groups and Syrian forces control the area, which also has seen suspected airstrikes by Israel in recent months allegedly targeting Iranian supply routes.Reports on the number of killed and wounded in the U.S. strikes varied. Activist group Deir Ezzor 24, which covers news in the province, said four people were killed and a number of others were wounded. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said 11 Iranian-backed fighters were killed — including six at an arms depot in the Harabesh neighborhood in the city of Deir el-Zour and five at military posts near the towns of Mayadeen and Boukamal.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Observatory, said three rockets were fired earlier Friday at the al-Omar oil field in Deir el-Zour that houses U.S. troops, an apparent retaliation to the American strikes.The Associated Press could not immediately independently confirm the activist reports. Iran and Syria did not immediately acknowledge the strikes, and their officials at the United Nations in New York did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, which answers only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been suspected of carrying out attacks with bomb-carrying drones across the wider Middle East.The exchange of strikes came as Saudi Arabia and Iran have been working toward reopening embassies in each other’s countries. The kingdom also acknowledged efforts to reopen a Saudi embassy in Syria, whose embattled President Bashar Assad has been backed by Iran in his country’s long war.U.S. Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, the top U.S. commander for the Middle East, warned that its forces could carry out additional strikes if needed. “We are postured for scalable options in the face of any additional Iranian attacks,” Kurilla said in a statement.On Thursday, Kurilla warned Congress during a hearing that the “Iran of today is exponentially more militarily capable than it was even five years ago.” He pointed to Iran’s arsenal of ballistic missiles and bomb-carrying drones.“What Iran does to hide its hand is they use Iranian proxies,” Kurilla said.According to officials, Iran has launched 80 attacks against U.S. forces and locations in Iraq and Syria since January 2021. The vast majority of those have been in Syria.Diplomacy to deescalate the exchange appeared to begin immediately. The foreign minister of Qatar spoke by phone with U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan as well as Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the Qatari state news agency reported. Doha has been an interlocutor between Iran and the U.S. recently amid tensions over Tehran’s nuclear program.The U.S. under Biden has struck Syria previously over tensions with Iran — in February and June of 2021, as well as August 2022.Dareen Khalifa, a senior Syria analyst with the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, said that while Thursday’s exchange of strikes comes at a sensitive political moment due to the “overall deterioration of U.S.-Iran relations and the stalling of the nuclear talks,” she does not expect a significant escalation.“These tit-for-tat strikes have been ongoing for a long time,” Khalifa said, although she noted that they usually do not result in casualties.Since the U.S. drone strike that killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in 2020, Iran has sought “to make life difficult for U.S. forces stationed east of the Euphrates,” said Hamidreza Azizi, an expert with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.“Iran increased its support for local proxies in Deir el-Zour while trying to ally with the tribal forces in the area,” Azizi wrote in a recent analysis.The strikes come during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Syria’s war began with the 2011 Arab Spring protests that roiled the wider Middle East and toppled governments in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia and Yemen. It later morphed into a regional proxy conflict that has seen Russia and Iran back Assad. The United Nations estimates over 300,000 civilians have been killed in the war. Those figures do not include soldiers and insurgents killed in the conflict; their numbers are believed to be in the tens of thousands.__Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Mroue reported from Beirut.

The committee's chair, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, started off by warning the American public that ""TikTok is a weapon by the Chinese Communist Party to spy on you and manipulate what you see and exploit for future generations.""Early on during her questioning of Chew, Rodgers asked if the platform's moderation tools had been used to delete content relating to the Uyghur Genocide. Chew responded by claiming that TikTok does not remove such content and is a ""place of freedom of expression.""The chair then asked whether the content about the Tiananmen Massacre is removed from TikTok. After first claiming to have not heard the question, and following Rodgers repeating ""the massacre in Tiananmen Square,"" Chew said, ""That kind of content is available on our platform."" Rodgers then warned Chew that ""making false or misleading statements to Congress is a federal crime.""Rodgers next asked him if he could say ""with 100% certainty that Bytedance or the CCP cannot use your company, or its divisions, to make content to promote pro-CCP messages for an act of aggression against Taiwan?"" Chew responded by saying that TikTok does not promote or remove content at the request of Beijing.She then repeated her question to confirm that he is 100% certain that the CCP cannot use TikTok to push such messaging. Chew replied that it is TikTok's ""commitment to this committee and all our users that we will keep this free from any manipulation by any government.""Rodgers said that if Chew is unable to ensure with 100% certainty that the CCP cannot use TikTok as a propaganda platform in this way, ""I'll take that as a no.""Dan Ives, managing director of New York-based Wedbush Securities, was cited by AP as saying that Chew's failure to provide concrete answers to concerns about data access and security was “a disaster” and probably has laid the groundwork for a ban. Jasmine Enberg, a social media analyst at Insider Intelligence, told the news agency that Chew's choice to highlight TikTok's reach in the U.S. might have had the reverse desired effect and “actually strengthened U.S. lawmakers’ argument that TikTok poses a threat to both national security and young people.”During a U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on global security threats held on March 8, committee vice chairman Marco Rubio asked FBI Director Christopher Wray if it is plausible that during preparations to invade Taiwan, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could use TikTok to ""make sure Americans are seeing videos arguing why Taiwan belongs to China"" and why the U.S. should not intervene. Wray again replied affirmatively and warned that there may not be many outward signs if such a propaganda campaign was launched.",2023/03/24,3885,Politics

The measure will take effect July 1, 2024.All wastewater produced at camping sites must be collected and handled properly. Violators risk a fine of up to NT$3 million (US$98,800) and suspension of operations, warned Yen Hsu-ming (顏旭明), an EPA official.This is part of the government’s effort to rein in the exploding number of businesses riding the wave of increased enthusiasm for outdoor recreation. Earlier this year, the authorities vowed a clampdown after it emerged that up to 90% of the 1,790 campsites in Taiwan are operating illegally.Businesses were found to have breached zoning, forestry, agricultural development, or safety regulations, putting both the public and the environment at risk.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845319,Radioactive water leaks at Minn. nuclear plant for 2nd time,"MONTICELLO, Minn. (AP) — Water containing a radioactive material has leaked for a second time from a nuclear plant near Minneapolis and the plant will be shut down, but there is no danger to the public, the plant’s owner said Thursday.A leak of what was believed to be hundreds of gallons of water containing tritium was discovered this week from a temporary fix at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, where 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of water with tritium leaked in November, Xcel Energy said in a statement Thursday.The plant about 38 miles (61 kilometers) northwest of Minneapolis is scheduled to power down Friday so permanent repairs can begin, the company said.There was a monthslong delay in announcing the initial leak that raised questions about public safety and transparency, but industry experts said there was never a public health threat.The new leak, announced a day after Xcel Energy says it was discovered, was found to be coming from a temporary fix to the original leak, the company said in a statement. This time, the leak is anticipated to be in the hundreds of gallons.“While the leak continues to pose no risk to the public or the environment, we determined the best course of action is to power down the plant and perform the permanent repairs immediately,” said Chris Clark, president of Xcel Energy–Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. “We are continuing to work with and inform our state, federal, city and county leaders in the process.”After the first leak was found in November, Xcel Energy made a short-term fix to capture water from a leaking pipe and reroute it back into the plant for re-use. The solution was designed to prevent new tritium from reaching the groundwater until installation of a replacement pipe during a regularly scheduled outage in mid-April, the company said.However, monitoring equipment indicated Wednesday that a small amount of new water from the original leak had reached the groundwater. Operators discovered that, over the past two days, the temporary solution was no longer capturing all of the leaking water, Xcel Energy said.The leaked water remains contained on-site and has not been detected in any local drinking water, Xcel Energy said.Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen that occurs naturally in the environment and is a common by-product of nuclear plant operations. It emits a weak form of beta radiation that does not travel far and cannot penetrate human skin, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Minnesota Department of Health released a statement Thursday saying they were told of the new leak Thursday afternoon and that it is ongoing. The agencies said they will continue to monitor groundwater samples and will inform the public if there is an imminent risk.Minnesota regulars said last week that Xcel Energy voluntarily notified state agencies and reported the leak of tritium to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission soon after it was confirmed in November. The amount of leaked material never reached a threshold requiring public notification and they waited to make a public announcement until they had more information, officials said.Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Associated Press last week that a significant health risk only would occur if people consumed fairly high amounts of tritium. That risk is contained if the plume stays on the company’s site, which Xcel Energy and Minnesota officials said is the case.",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845320,Philippines confronts Chinese diplomats over sea disputes,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Filipino diplomats confronted Chinese officials in closed-door talks Friday with a slew of protests over China’s aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, including targeting a Philippine coast guard ship with a military-grade laser, but no resolution was reached on the issues, an official said.Territorial disputes in the busy waterway have long loomed as a potential flashpoint in Asia and have become a sensitive front in the regional rivalry between China and the United States.Washington lays no claims in the contested waters but has challenged Beijing's extensive claims, including by deploying its warships and fighter jets and repeatedly warning that it would help defend the Philippines — a treaty ally — if Philippine forces, ships and aircraft are attacked. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims in the seaway, which sits atop vast deposits of oil and gas.A Chinese delegation led by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong held two days of talks starting Thursday with Philippine counterparts led by Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro and reviewed overall relations. The two sides focused on their territorial disputes Friday, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said.The talks opened with both sides citing an agreement between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who made a state visit to China in early January, to manage the territorial conflicts amicably while enhancing economic ties and other aspects of a nearly half-century of diplomatic relations.“We should not allow specific differences to define our bilateral relations or allow certain disputes to stand in the way of overall cooperation,” Sun said in an opening speech before journalists were asked to leave the meeting room.A Philippine official involved in the talks told The Associated Press that Filipino diplomats outlined several incidents underscoring China's assertiveness in the disputed waters in the closed-door talks. They cited Chinese “incursions” and a Feb. 6 incident when a Chinese coast guard ship aimed a military-grade laser that briefly blinded some crew members of a Philippine patrol vessel off a disputed shoal, the official said.China's representatives responded mostly by reiterating Beijing's claim of sovereignty in most of the South China Sea and citing intrusions by Philippine vessels, the official said.A Philippine foreign affairs department statement said both sides discussed “different incidents at sea” since 2021, when the last talks on the disputes were held, but it did not mention any resolution. Proposed steps to boost cooperation were discussed, such as establishing a joint coast guard committee and holding annual defense security talks, it said.The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to publicly discuss what transpired in the meetings.Marcos summoned the Chinese ambassador to Manila to express concern shortly after the laser-pointing incident. The Philippine coast guard caught the incident on video, which it made public, but Beijing countered that the Philippine vessel intruded into Chinese territorial waters and that its coast guard used a harmless laser gadget to monitor the vessel’s movement.Manila's foreign affairs department condemned the Chinese coast guard’s action and sent a strongly worded protest to the Chinese Embassy. More than 200 such diplomatic protests have been lodged by the Philippines against China since last year, including at least 77 since Marcos took office in June, underlining how the longstanding conflicts have become a major irritant in relations with China early in his presidency.China and the Philippines first held talks focusing on the disputes in 2017, but no major resolution has been reached as both sides stuck to their territorial stance. The consultations, nevertheless, help both sides understand each other's position better “and make accidental crises a bit less likely,” said Washington-based analyst Greg Poling, who has studied the conflicts extensively.“It has to be done with clear eyes and no expectation that the fundamental issues will be solved in the short term through that format,” Poling told the AP. “China is not interested in compromise and the positions of the two countries are not reconcilable.”In early February, the Marcos administration announced it would allow rotating batches of American forces to indefinitely station in four more Philippine military camps. Those are in addition to five local bases earlier designated under the 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the allies.Marcos told reporters Wednesday the four additional military sites would include areas in the northern Philippines. That location has infuriated Chinese officials because it would provide U.S. forces a staging ground close to southern China and Taiwan.The Chinese diplomats expressed their strong opposition to an expanded U.S. military presence in the Philippines in closed-door talks on Thursday and warned of its future implications, the Philippine official told AP without elaborating.The Filipino diplomats responded to China’s objections by saying an expanded American military presence serves their national interest and would boost Philippine capability to respond to natural disasters, the official said, suggesting the move was not aimed at targeting China.Marcos said American forces would also be allowed to station in military areas on the western Philippine island province of Palawan, adding that the U.S. military presence would boost coastal defense.Palawan faces the South China Sea, a key passage for global trade that Beijing claims virtually in its entirety.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845321,"Florida Atlantic makes first Elite Eight, bounces Tennessee","NEW YORK (AP) — When the horn sounded on the greatest victory in the history of Florida Atlantic athletics, Nick Boyd and Bryan Greenlee hopped onto the press row table to celebrate.Instead of going to the locker room, some of the Owls players made their way up into the stands to sing “New York, New York” with their fans.The Boca Raton, Florida-based school that has only been competing in Division I for the last 30 years, and had just one previous appearance in the NCAA Tournament, is now a victory away from the Final Four.The Owls used a second-half push led by Michael Forrest to upset fourth-seeded Tennessee 62-55 on Thursday night in the Sweet 16.Ninth-seeded FAU (34-3) will play third-seeded Kansas State in the East Region final at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.“Yeah, our guys definitely feel like they belong on this stage,” fifth-year coach Dusty May said.Even before the tournament started, this was the unquestionably the greatest season in FAU history. Now the Owls are one of the biggest stories in all of sports.“We're just a scrappy group,” Boyd said. “Unbreakable.”Johnell Davis led the Conference USA champions with 15 points and Forrest finished with 11, including eight straight when FAU took control in the final 10 minutes.The Volunteers (25-11), who were looking for the second Elite Eight appearance in program history, shot just 33% — including 6 of 23 from 3-point range. Josiah-Jordan James and Jonas Aidoo scored 10 points apiece.“Certainly proud of the effort that these guys have given us all year, through tough times with injuries, but when it ends like this, it’s always disappointing because we want it all and came up short,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said.Barnes has made 27 NCAA appearances with four schools, but he has reached the Elite Eight only three times and gone to one Final Four.The game was slogging along at Tennessee’s style and pace. The No. 1 defense in the country, according to KemPom metrics, out of the rugged Southeastern Conference was making FAU work hard for shots.Then the Owls started hitting the 3-pointers they had been missing for much of the first 30 minutes.“We got great shots even in the first half when they were in us a little bit,” Boyd said. “The second half, they dropped, we broke it open a little bit.”Forrest made consecutive 3s to put FAU up 41-39 with 9:49 left, the Owls' first lead since the opening minute.Forrest capped a personal 8-0 run with driving layup that put the Owls up four.Meanwhile, Tennessee couldn’t buy a bucket. The Vols had a six-minute stretch during which they scored four points.“Obviously we missed open shots, they missed open shots. But we were disappointed in the way we played. We knew we had to play tougher, but we were up five points, so ...” James said, trailing off.Brandon Weatherspoon’s putback of a 3-point miss off the side of the backboard made it 51-41 with 6:47 left.The Vols had one more push left. James swished a 3 with 3:33 left to cut the Owls' lead to 55-50.The Owls turned up the defense, getting a key stop that led to a fast-break layup by Boyd to put FAU up 57-50 with 2:31 left.The Owls salted it away with free throws from there, as the orange-clad Vols fans emptied out of MSG and the outnumbered FAU fans took over.Owls fans serenaded May's wife, Anna, with an “F-A-U!” chant before finally filing out of The Garden.May had compared Tennessee’s defensive physicality to rugby in the run-up to the game. He meant it as a compliment, and his Owls showed they could play tough, too.“We feel like we're physical as well,” Boyd said.BIG PICTUREFAU: The Owls outrebounded the bigger Vols 40-36, including 12 offensive rebounds that they turned into 14 second-chance points.“We know we’re not the tallest team,” 7-foot-1 center Vlad Goldin said. “So we know we have to be quick to the ball. We have to be physical. We have to raise our physicality. But it’s not something to be scared of.”Tennessee: The Vols were challenged offensively much of the season, and became even more limited when they lost point guard Zakai Zeigler.Zeigler blew out his right knee against Arkansas on the last day of February, but there was no way the Long Island native was missing a trip back to New York. Zeigler was on the sideline, using a scooter to roll onto the court at times to join team huddles and provide encouragement.Tennessee went 7-8 from Feb. 1 to the end of the season.UP NEXTThe Owls have never played Kansas State.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845322,Stars beat Pens 3-2 despite Crosby's 1st goal in Dallas,"DALLAS (AP) — Jake Oettinger allowed Sidney Crosby's first career goal in Dallas. The Stars goaltender also made plenty of big saves, including a few on Pittsburgh's high-scoring star.Joe Pavelski scored the tiebreaking goal on a third-period power play, and the Stars overcame Crosby's first tally in Texas in a 3-2 victory over the Penguins on Thursday night.Oettinger made 40 saves, five of them coming in the final 68 seconds when the Penguins had a 6-on-4 advantage with the goalie pulled after Jani Hakanpaa was called for slashing.The 24-year-old Oettinger, who had a breakout performance in a first-round playoff loss last spring, was coming off three consecutive sub-.900 save percentages, and wasn't very happy with himself.He was a little more pleased after helping the Stars slip a point ahead of Minnesota atop the Central Division with the Wild’s 5-4 shootout loss in Philadelphia. Dallas has 10 games remaining.“I feel like I’m one of the best goalies in the world, and I haven’t shown that,” said Oettinger, who has played more than usual with primary backup Scott Wedgewood injured.“A lot of people have been saying they think I’m exhausted,” he said. “No one knows how I feel except for me. I feel great. No one can say that about tonight.”Roope Hintz and Jamie Benn also scored for Dallas, and leading goal-scorer Jason Robertson had a pair of assists.Crosby's 548th career goal was the 35-year-old's first in 10 games at the home of the Stars and gave him at least one in each of the other 31 NHL arenas.Despite the loss, the Penguins held on to the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference because of Florida's 6-2 loss to Toronto.“I think the group feels good about our game,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “I thought we played well enough to win. There was a lot to like about our overall game.”Pavelski tipped a pass from Miro Heiskanen past Casey DeSmith midway through the third period after Chad Ruhwedel had been called for high-sticking.The assist gave the 23-year-old Heiskanen a 12-game point streak, a franchise record for a Stars defenseman. Craig Hartsburg set the previous mark in 1986, when the team was in Minnesota.Pierre-Olivier Joseph pulled the Penguins within 3-2 with six minutes to go, but Oettinger and the Stars held on.With the game tied 1-1 early in the third, Oettinger made a sprawling pad save on Bryan Rust on a chance set up by Crosby’s pass, then made another pad save against Crosby on the rebound.In the frantic final seconds, Oettinger, who earned his 31st win, made a nifty glove grab when Crosby sent an elevated puck toward the net.“We've talked all year, it's about your response,” Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. “His response tonight tells you what he's about. We weren't going to lose that game, and he made sure of it. He was our best player by far.”DeSmith, who had a 1.00 goals-against average in two games against Dallas coming in, stopped 30 shots.After Hintz put Dallas in front with his 33rd goal in the first period, Crosby pulled Pittsburgh even with his 31st in the second a night after scoring in Colorado to tie Mario Lemieux for the most 30-goal seasons in franchise history with 11.SEGUIN'S RETURNStars F Tyler Seguin returned from a six-game absence after getting cut on his left leg March 9 against Buffalo. He had three shots and a team-high three giveaways in 14 minutes.“Everything's just kind of where is your brain, just being around players again,” Seguin said. “Those quick decisions, a couple of them you'd like back. But great win.”JOSEPH'S 20THJoseph’s goal was his fifth and gave him 20 points this season. Dallas' Nils Lundkvist (six goals) is the only rookie defenseman with more goals. Joseph is the 11th Pittsburgh rookie blueliner to record 20 points.ROBERTSON’S 200THRobertson is up to 50 assists on the season, second on the club to Heiskanen’s 51, and finished his 200th career game with 216 points (99 goals, 117 assists).ILLStars F Radek Faksa was a late scratch with an illness.UP NEXTPenguins: Washington at home Saturday.Stars: A three-game homestand ends Saturday against Vancouver.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845338,Chinese 'wolf warrior' Xiao Qian says 'Taiwan will be ours',"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A major Australian newspaper on Thursday (March 23) published an op-ed by a Chinese 'wolf warrior' diplomat with a headline that contained the words ""Taiwan will be ours,"" before later changing it.At 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, Xiao Qian (肖千), China's ambassador to Australia published an opinion piece in the Sydney Morning Herald titled ""Taiwan will be ours, but war with Australia is a fallacy."" However, by Friday (March 24), the headline had been changed to ""Taiwan is always part of China, but war with Australia is a fallacy.""The original headline indicating that Taiwan would be annexed by China contradicted the content of the article, the entirety of which attempted to make the case that Taiwan had been governed by China since the Song and Yuan Dynasties. However, there are no verified records of direct Chinese governance of Taiwan until the Qing Dynasty.Xiao cited the Cairo Declaration as stipulating that Taiwan should be returned to ""China."" What he neglected to mention was that the declaration referred to the government of the Republic of China (ROC), which is now based in Taiwan.He alleged that the CCP's capture of Beijing in 1949 made the People's Republic of China (PRC) the ""successor to the Republic of China."" The ROC, however, currently continues to function as a government based in Taipei.The ambassador described the current situation across the Taiwan Strait as a ""protracted political confrontation."" He alleged that the territory of China has ""never been divided and will never be divided"" although China and Taiwan have separate governments with different militaries, currencies, passports, constitutions, and diplomatic allies.Xiao then cited Resolution 2758 passed by the United Nations in 1971 as ""making it clear there is but one China in the world"" with Taiwan a part of that country. The brief resolution actually says it recognizes the PRC government as the ""only lawful representatives of China,"" while the ""representatives of Chiang Kai-Shek"" are to be expelled, thus potentially leaving the door open for future Taiwan membership under a government not ruled by Chiang's ""representatives"" and not as a part of China.He wrote that Beijing's ""first choice"" is ""reunification by peaceful means."" Yet, as the ROC was never united with the PRC and Taiwan has never been ruled by the PRC, the term ""reunification"" is inaccurate.Xiao then warned that Beijing ""will not leave any room for any form of 'Taiwan independence' separatist activities."" He also railed against Australians who express concerns about a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, comparing them to Don Quixote ""tilting at windmills, fighting against a non-existent enemy.""A poll conducted by the Lowy Institute in 2022 revealed that 63% of Australians believe China is ""more of a security threat"" to their country, while only 33% think of Beijing as ""more of an economic partner."" As of that year, Australians who said they trust China had plummeted by 40 points from 2018 to only 12%.",2023/03/24,7356,Politics

Austin said on Thursday (March 23) that he has formed a ""Tiger Team"" to ensure that Taiwan's military needs are met amid rising threats from China and ""logjams"" with weapons orders due to the war in Ukraine.During a hearing of the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee, Congressman Ken Calvert said every Taiwanese leader he met with during his recent visit to Taiwan had ""remarked at the extremely slow pace of U.S. defense articles."" He asked Austin and Joint Chiefs of Staff Army General Mark A. Milley what are Ukraine and Taiwan's ""most critical defense needs"" and what steps are being taken to expedite the shipment of weapons.Austin responded by acknowledging ""headwinds"" due to the pandemic's impact on supply chains and struggles U.S. manufacturers have had keeping up with demand. He expressed optimism that U.S. weapons makers will eventually be able to alleviate the backlog in Foreign Military Sales (FMS).The Secretary of Defense said that he created a ""Tiger Team"" months ago to deal with FMS shortfalls and ""identify logjams and work through those logjams"" to expedite production of crucial weapons systems. He also formed a group of senior leaders in the Department of Defense to focus on the issue on a weekly basis ""to make sure that we are providing the right kinds of capability that Taiwan needs.""Austin closed by saying ""this remains an area of focus for the department.""According to a report by The Wall Street Journal in September 2022, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks signed a memorandum in August to establish a ""Tiger Team"" led by Sasha Baker, deputy under secretary of defense in charge of weapons procurement and logistical support. The team includes representatives from the armed services to examine inefficiencies in U.S. arms sales to foreign countries.",2023/03/24,3882,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845370,House GOP passes parents' rights bill in clash over schools,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Friday narrowly passed legislation to press a midterm campaign promise to give parents greater say in what's taught in public schools even as critics complained the “parents’ rights” bill would fuel a far-right movement that's resulted in book bans, restrictions aimed at transgender students and raucous school board meetings across the country.Speaker Kevin McCarthy has made the bill, labeled the Parents’ Bill of Rights Act, a top priority during the early weeks of his tenure atop the House. It was an early test of unity for the chamber’s 222 Republicans, who have a thin majority and showed how the adoption of an open amendment process in the House — a concession McCarthy made to win hardline conservatives’ support for his speakership — holds the potential to send legislation down unpredictable twists and turns.Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., successfully added amendments that would require schools to report when transgender girls join girls' athletics teams and if trans girls are allowed to use girls’ school restrooms or locker rooms.House Freedom Caucus members unsuccessfully tried to add provisions that would have called to abolish the Department of Education and endorsed vouchers that would send public funds to private schools.Ultimately, the bill has little chance in the Democratic-held 100-seat Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer promised it faced a “dead end” in his chamber and skewered it as evidence that the House GOP has been overtaken by “hard right MAGA ideologues” — referencing former President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan.In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and racial justice protests, conservatives’ intense focus on parental control over public school classrooms has migrated from local school board fights to Republican-held statehouses and now to the floor of the U.S. House.“Parents want schools focused on reading, writing and math, not woke politics,” Rep. Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said during House debate Thursday.Public school education in the U.S. has long invited concern among some parents — usually conservative — over what children are taught. Historically, the term “parents' rights” has been used in schoolhouse debates over homeschooling, sex education and even the teaching of languages other than English.Recently, Republicans have tapped into frustrations over remote learning and mask mandates in schools, as well as social conservatives' opposition to certain teachings on race that are broadly labeled as critical race theory, a way of thinking about America’s history through the lens of racism. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, won election in 2021 on the slogan “Parents matter,"" and other political action committees poured millions of dollars into school board races nationwide.McCarthy, made the ""parents' bill of rights” a plank in his midterm election pitch to voters to give Republicans a House majority. But the GOP's expectation of a sweeping victory never materialized, and even in school board races, conservative groups' goal of electing hundreds of “parents’ rights” activists largely fell short.But McCarthy pressed ahead with the bill as a priority, making a public appeal earlier this month at an event that featured a chalkboard, schoolchildren and parents who have been on the frontlines of the cause.McCarthy chose the bill's number, H.R. 5, because children enter kindergarten at age 5, and the legislation is built on five pillars: parents' right to examine curricula and school library books, meet with educators at least twice each school year, review school budgets and spending, be notified of violent events in their child’s school and have elementary and middle schools get their consent to change a child's gender designation, pronouns or name.""It’s about every parent, mom and dad, but most importantly about the students in America,” McCarthy said at the introduction event.Democrats like Oregon's Rep. Suzanne Bonamici labeled the bill as the “Politics over Parents Act,"" arguing it would seed enmity between parents and educators and empower conservative activists who want to weed out books that delve into teachings on race and sexuality. Bonamici offered alternative legislation that she argued would foster parental involvement, encourage collaboration with educators and make schools welcoming places to families, including those with LGBTQ students.“We want parents to be involved — peacefully,” Bonamici said.Democrats also raised alarm that the bill as written would force schools to out LGBTQ students to their families, which can sometimes lead to abuse or abandonment.“We’ll fight against this legislation. We’ll fight against the banning of books, fight against the bullying of children from any community, and certainly from the LGBTQ+ community,” House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said.Attempted book bans and restrictions at school and public libraries surged to their highest number in 2022 since the American Library Association began keeping data 20 years ago, according to a new report the organization released this week.The bill's supporters described it as common-sense legislation to foster opportunities for schoolchildren by encouraging parents to have greater input into what their children learn in school. They also insisted it does not ban any books, even though conservative activists have used similar legislation from state legislatures to press school boards to remove books that teach about the country's racist history or LGBTQ sexuality.Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx said, “Our bill is meant to give parents their God-given rights to be involved with their children's education.”___Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed reporting.",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845371,Trevor Bauer pulls on No. 96 for Yokohama's BayStars,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — The Trevor Bauer era in Japan began Friday at an introductory news conference, where he pulled a blue and white Yokohama DeNA BayStars jersey over a white shirt and red tie.The 2020 Cy Young Award winner is in Japan on a one-year deal that could let him prove himself and return to Major League Baseball, where he was unable to find work this season even after an arbitrator reduced his unprecedented 324-game suspension for violating the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy.He was cut in January by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who still owe him $22.5 million this season.Not a single Japanese reporter asked him about his suspension in the United States or the circumstances surrounding it.The only question about it came from The Associated Press. Bauer disputed the fact the question suggested he was suspended from the major leagues.“I don't believe that's accurate,” he said of the suspension. “But I'm excited to be here. I'm excited to pitch again. I've always wanted to play in Japan.”He said afterward the suspension dealt technically with issues of pay, and he said he had contacted major league teams about playing this year. He would have been eligible, but he did not say if he had offers.Bauer was released by the Dodgers three weeks after an arbitrator reduced his suspension imposed by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred from 324 to 194 games.The penalty followed an investigation into domestic violence allegations, which the pitcher has denied.Manfred suspended Bauer last April for violating the league’s domestic violence and sexual assault policy, after a San Diego woman said he beat and sexually abused her in 2021.Bauer has maintained he did nothing wrong, saying everything that happened between him and the woman was consensual. He was never charged with a crime.Bauer joined his hometown Dodgers before the 2021 season and was 8-5 with a 2.59 ERA in 17 starts before being placed on paid leave.Bauer said his goal with the BayStars was to strike out 200 and keep his average fastball velocity at 96 mph — the latter is why he'll wear No. 96. He said he is also working on a better changeup pitch he called a “split change-up.""He said he hoped to play by mid-April — about two weeks after the Japanese season begins — and said he has been training for the last 1 1/2 years.“I've been doing a lot of strength training and throwing,” he said. “I didn't really take any time off. So I've had a year and a half of development time. I'm stronger than ever. More powerful than ever.""Yokohama has not won a title in 25 years, and Bauer said that was his goal in the one-year deal.“First and foremost, I want to help the Stars win a championship,” he said. “That involves pitching well. That involves helping teammates and learning from them. If they have questions — you know — share my knowledge with them.”He also repeated several times about his desire to play in Japan, dating from a collegiate tournament in 2009 at the Tokyo Dome. He said playing in Japan while at UCLA was on his mind even before winning the Cy Young — and also immediately after.“The Tokyo Dome was sold out,” he said. “I'd never played in front of that many people — probably combined in my life. In the United States, college games aren't very big, so seeing that amount of passion. How many people came to a college game in Japan. It really struck me.""He's been practicing with the Japanese ball, which he said was slightly softer with higher seams.“But overall it just feels like a baseball and the pitches move the same. The velocity is similar. I don't notice much of a difference.”He was asked about his level of Japanese, which is about zero.“I don't know very much at all. I'm looking forward to learning,” he said. “The first things I need to learn are the baseball terms.”Other teams in Japan have made similar contentious signings before.Former major league reliever Roberto Osuna — who received a 75-game suspension for violating MLB’s domestic violence policy — signed last season with the Chiba Lotte Marines. He has signed for this season with the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks.In 1987, Dodgers relief pitcher Steve Howe, who had a career plagued with drug problems, tried to sign with the Seibu Lions. But he did not play in the country after the Japanese baseball commissioner disqualified Howe because of his history of drug abuse.Bauer was an All-Star in 2018 and went 83-69 with a 3.79 ERA in 10 seasons for Arizona (2012), Cleveland, (2013-19), Cincinnati (2019-20) and the Dodgers. He won the NL Cy Young Award with Cincinnati during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.___Follow Japan-based AP sports writer Stephen Wade on Twitter at http://twitter.com/StephenWadeAP___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845372,Gonzaga beats UCLA 79-76 in Sweet 16 on Strawther's shot,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Gonzaga and UCLA played one NCAA Tournament game that left the Zags' star player bawling, and another game that stunned the Bruins.Add another to the list. Maybe the maddest one in March yet.Julian Strawther hit a 3-pointer with 7.2 seconds left to answer a 3-pointer by UCLA's Amari Bailey, lifting Gonzaga to a wild 79-76 win over UCLA Thursday night in the Sweet 16.“It’s moments like that you can’t make up,” said Strawther, a Las Vegas native. “Those are literally the moments you dream of. To even make a shot like that in March Madness and just to be back home in Vegas is like the cherry on top.”The Bruins (31-6), the West Region’s No. 2 seed, stormed back from an eight-point deficit in the final 1:05 and took a 76-75 lead on Bailey's 3-pointer with 12.2 seconds left.The Zags (31-5) brought the ball up the floor and Strawther stepped into a 3-pointer after a drop pass from Hunter Sallis, sending Gonzaga fans to their feet.“As soon as it came off, it looked like it was on line,” Strawther said.The Zags still had to sweat it out.Gonzaga's Malachi Smith stole the ball from UCLA's Tyger Campbell, but Strawther only hit 1 of 2 free throws at the other end, giving the Bruins a chance.Campbell's 3-pointer at the buzzer hit the back of the rim, sending the Zags rushing off the bench and into the Elite Eight against UConn on Saturday while leaving the Bruins disappointed again.“Every game, try not to get too high, try not to get too low,” said UCLA's Jaime Jaquez, who had 29 points and 11 rebounds. “He hit a big shot and we lost.”Strawther’s shot was reminiscent of the one Villanova’s Kris Jenkins made off a drop pass to clinch the 2016 national championship — a shot that came after North Carolina's Marcus Paige hit an off-balance 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left.There's a reason it looked familiar.“That’s Jay Wright’s play that he used in Villanova-Carolina, the championship,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. “That’s what we call it. He makes it all the time.”It also is the latest chapter in what's become the best West Coast rivalry in college basketball.UCLA got the better of the teams’ first NCAA Tournament go-around, rallying from 17 points down to send the Zags out of the 2006 bracket and star Adam Morrison to the floor crying.Jalen Suggs crushed the Bruins the last time, hitting a running 3-pointer at the buzzer to send the Zags to the 2021 national championship game.“I can’t even describe what he did. It’s crazy,” Gonzaga’s Drew Timme said of Strawther's game-winner. “It’s just like that Jalen shot, man.""Timme had 36 points for his record 10th NCAA Tournament game with 20 points.The flurry of a finish started off more like a prize fight, each team taking its turn landing blows in a game of wild swings.UCLA led by 13 at the half, but went on an 11-minute field goal drought as Gonzaga went up by 10 with 2:40 left. The Bruins took their rally turn and retook the lead, but left Gonzaga with too much time on the clock.“We should have been tighter on Strawther,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. “We were the whole game. We just weren’t on that play. If we were tighter then he couldn’t have looped behind.”Timme kept Gonzaga in it during UCLA's torrid first half and Gonzaga's porous first-half defense tightened in the second, giving them a seven-point lead with 53 seconds left.Jaquez brought the Bruins back in his final college game.The Pac-12 player of the year scored on a three-point play and a layup to cut it 74-71 with 45 seconds left. Timme then missed two free throws, setting up Bailey’s shot.Thankfully for the Zags, Strawther was on the mark with his long 3-pointer and Campbell was off the mark on his, sending Gonzaga to the Elite Eight for the fifth time under Few.___AP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845373,Thompson makes 37 saves as Golden Knights beat Flames 3-2,"CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Logan Thompson’s triumphant return for Vegas was overshadowed by another injury.Before he departed with just over six minutes to go, Thompson made 37 saves as the surging Golden Knights beat the Calgary Flames 3-2 on Thursday night.“Right now, obviously concerned about Logan,” Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said. “Obviously, Logan missing that much time, we’ll have to look closely at that one.”It was unknown if the latest setback is related to the lower-body injury he suffered on Feb. 9.“I don’t know what happened, to be honest. He just got up and left,” Cassidy said. “He knows his body. I have no idea. At the end of the day, let’s hope it’s not related to the previous injury and it’s something that will be short term.”Up 3-2 at the time, Jonathan Quick came in and turned aside all five shots he faced as Calgary poured on the pressure in search of the tying goal.“It doesn’t happen really often but when he got out there (Quick) made a couple really good saves to keep us in the game,” Vegas forward Ivan Barbashev said.The best chance came off the stick of MacKenzie Weegar with a minute to go but he couldn’t beat Quick from 30 feet out.“I saw the net and I missed my shot,” the Flames defenseman said. “If there was one chance I can get back all year, it would be that one.”Nicolas Roy scored for Vegas (45-21-6) in his return from an 18-game absence. Jonathan Marchessault and Michael Amadio also scored.Milan Lucic and Nazem Kadri scored for Calgary (32-26-15). Jacob Markstrom stopped 29 shots in his 11th start in the last 12 games.In avenging their 7-2 home loss to the Flames last week, the Golden Knights earned their seventh win in eight games and improved to 16-3-2 in their last 21 overall.Vegas opened a four-point cushion on the Los Angeles Kings atop the Pacific Division.It was a tough blow for Calgary's flickering playoff hopes. The Flames dropped six points back of Winnipeg for the second wild card in the Western Conference.It was Calgary's 27th one-goal loss this year, which leads the NHL.“We’re in every game, and we have a chance to win every game we’re playing, so it obviously makes it more frustrating that we lose and it feels like we’re always losing by that one goal,” Flames defenseman Rasmus Andersson said.“I don’t know how many games I’ve played back in my head thinking that ‘Ah, I should have scored that’ or ‘How did we not score that’ and we would have been in a different situation, but it’s the reality.”Up 2-1 entering the third period, Vegas got some breathing room at 5:19 when pressure by Roy created a defensive zone turnover by Rasmus Andersson. Roy then went to the net, received a pass from Phil Kessel and fired a shot over Markstrom.The Flames pulled within one at 12:33 when Kadri ended his 16-game goal drought with a power-play marker, but that’s as close as they would get.Calgary fell to 0-18-3 when trailing after two periods.Vegas, which entered the night having outscored teams 70-45 in the first period this year, jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the opening frame.Jack Eichel sprung Marchessault and Ivan Barbashev on a 2-on-1, with Marchessault patiently holding onto the puck before whipping a shot past Markstrom high on his blocker side at 11:43.Then Amadio got free and rattled in his own rebound at 15:23.Lucic cut the deficit in half with 58 seconds left in the frame. Walker Duehr hustled up the ice after a turnover, fended off some back pressure and zipped a cross-ice pass to Lucic, who sent the puck just under the crossbar and in.SHOW OF SUPPORTThe Flames wore #SnowyStrong stickers on the back of their helmets in support of assistant general manager Chris Snow’s ongoing battle with ALS.STREAK SNAPPEDGolden Knights forward Reilly Smith had his career-best point streak snapped at nine games (four goals, 11 assists). It equaled the franchise best, also held by Alex Tuch, Mark Stone and Max Pacioretty.UP NEXTGolden Knights: Travel to Edmonton to face Connor McDavid and the Oilers on Saturday night.Flames: Host the San Jose Sharks on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845374,Lowry's tiebreaking goal sends Jets to 3-2 win over Ducks,"ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Adam Lowry scored the tiebreaking goal with 9:13 to play and the Winnipeg Jets made progress in the playoff race with a 3-2 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on Thursday night.Kyle Connor scored his 28th goal and Connor Hellebuyck made 18 saves for the Jets, who opened a three-game California road trip with their third victory in four games.After Frank Vatrano tied it for Anaheim early in the third with a power-play goal, Lowry put the Jets back ahead with a short redirection of a pass from Brenden Dillon for his third goal in four games.“That's our group,” said Connor, who snapped his 11-game goal drought in the second period. “We're a resilient type, no matter what we face. We have confidence in here in each other that we'll get out of it, and it's going to make us stronger. Especially coming down to the playoffs, you know you're not going to win every game, so you've got to deal with those situations when they happen.""It's no quit in here from everybody.”Mason Appleton scored the first goal for Winnipeg, which has beaten Anaheim in five straight meetings, including a three-game sweep this season.Winnipeg is in the second wild-card slot in the Western Conference with 85 points and nine games to play, one point behind Seattle. Nashville, which beat the Kraken in a shootout earlier Thursday, is five points behind the Jets, but the Predators have three games in hand.“It's no secret,” Lowry said. “We know where we're at and how critical these games are. We can only control our play, but we're going to try to carry this momentum into Saturday.”Cam Fowler also scored and Lukas Dostal stopped 30 shots for the lottery-bound Ducks, who dropped to 1-4-1 on their eight-game homestand with their third consecutive defeat.Fowler scored his career-best 43rd point with a goal in the first period on a knuckling shot that threaded a path among three Anaheim teammates.“He's been unbelievable,” Anaheim coach Dallas Eakins said of Fowler. “I hope that he's proud of himself to have a career year in a year like this. ... He does a lot of things for us, and especially now he carries a lot of ice time. He's a leader in our dressing room. He basically does it all, so we're all real proud of Cam.”Appleton evened it 45 seconds later and Connor then scored late in the second period on remarkably similar plays, knocking in loose pucks after rebounds trickled underneath Dostal.Connor is Winnipeg's leading scorer, but he hadn't scored a goal in March, and he had gone scoreless in a season-high six consecutive games.“It's something to build on,” Connor said. “We have nine games left now, and we want to continue to move forward improving, and hit the playoffs with a running stride here.”Vatrano tied it with a low shot from the blue line while Derek Grant screened Hellebuyck in a rare mistake by the Jets' second-ranked penalty killers. The goal was Vatrano's 18th of the season, matching his total in each of the past two seasons with Florida and the Rangers.UP NEXTJets: At Los Angeles on Saturday.Ducks: Host St. Louis on Saturday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World

Leonard had the other trey in pushing the Clippers' lead to 101-85.The Clippers kept it up, sinking another three 3-pointers in a row, capped by one from Russell Westbrook that extended their lead to 114-89. They outscored the Thunder 35-25 in the fourth.Los Angeles shot 49% from 3-point range, with Batum and Hyland making four each.Westbrook added 24 points and seven assists for the Clippers.“We played with a lot of pace,” Westbrook said. “Played fast, especially in the second half.”Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 30 points. Josh Giddey added 18 and Jalen Williams had 16.“He was still efficient,” Leonard said of former Clipper Gilgeous-Alexander. “All we could do is try to make it tougher on him.”The Clippers’ bench outscored the Thunder’s reserves, 51-30.“They did a great job coming in and providing energy,” Leonard said.TIP-INSThunder: Outscored the Clippers 46-38 in the paint.Clippers: Westbrook scored 12 points in the second quarter. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845376,Gwyneth Paltrow insists Utah ski collision wasn't her fault,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Gwyneth Paltrow insisted Friday on the witness stand that a 2016 ski collision at an upscale Utah ski resort wasn’t her fault, claiming it began when the man suing her ran into her from behind.The actor-turned-lifestyle influencer testified that the crash shocked her — and the way the man's skis veered between her two legs made her worry at first that she was being “violated,” she said.“There was a body pressing against me and a very strange grunting noise,” she said.“My brain was trying to make sense of what was happening,"" she continued. Paltrow later clarified that after her split-second panic, she realized that the sudden collision wasn't sexual in nature.After sitting in court for four days, Paltrow remained calm and collected for more than two hours on the witness stand. Members of the Park City jury sat transfixed while she categorically denied fault for the collision.Terry Sanderson, the retired optometrist who is suing her, is expected to give an opposing account of the crash when he takes the stand first on Monday.Throughout Paltrow’s heavily anticipated testimony, the founder-CEO of Goop calmly and repeatedly said that Sanderson, sitting several feet away in court, ran into her — causing the two skiers to end up splayed out on the beginner run with Paltrow on top and Sanderson beneath her. In the seconds after the collision, Paltrow acknowledged that she yelled at Sanderson and didn't stop to ask if he was OK. Paltrow testified that she stood nearby on the mountain as one of her family’s four ski instructors promised to give Sanderson her contact information and file an incident report.In an exchange that touched on recurring themes of the trial, Sanderson's attorneys attempted to depict the decision as reflective of celebrity carelessness, while Paltrow insisted that she — not the 76-year-old man suing her — was the wounded party.“You have to keep in mind, when you’re the victim of a crash, your psychology is not necessarily thinking about the person who perpetrated it,” she said.To draw the jury's attention to Paltrow's wealth, Sanderson's lawyers probed Paltrow about the price of ski instructors at posh Deer Valley Resort and her decision to leave the mountain to get a massage the day of the crash.Sanderson and his multiple-member legal team at one point dispersed themselves across the courtroom to possibly reenact the crash for the jury, whose members perked up after days of yawning through jargon-dense medical testimony about his broken ribs, concussion and brain damage.Paltrow's attorneys objected to her participation in such a reenactment, leaving her sitting on the witness stand watching the lawyer questioning her take on the role of the Oscar-winning actor.Next week, Paltrow's team may call her back to the stand, as well as medical experts, ski instructors and her two children, Moses and Apple.The trial has touched on themes ranging from skier’s etiquette to the power — and burden — of celebrity. The amount of money at stake for both sides pales in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit, private security detail and expert witness-heavy trial.Throughout the week in Utah, Paltrow's legal team has asked for special restrictions, including limiting photography both in the courtroom and in the public parking lot outside — where a rope cordons off Paltrow’s entrance and exit paths. Unlike most trials, the court has not published a witness list.Paltrow's attorneys argue both that she didn't cause the crash and that the extent of Sanderson's injuries is exaggerated. They've raised questions about Sanderson's motivation for suing Paltrow, probing his family members about his post-crash communications about her celebrity and his proximity to it.They've asked two of Sanderson’s daughters whether their father thought it was “cool” to collide with a celebrity like Paltrow — characterizations they've denied.After the collision, Sanderson sent his daughters an email with the subject line: “I’m famous ... At what cost?” The oldest daughter, Shae Herath, wrote back: “I also can’t believe this is all on GoPro.”On Friday, Herath attempted to clarify the record amid questions about the possibility that the crash was recorded on a bystander’s helmet camera that have intrigued both the Park City jury — and online viewers who’ve tuned into live footage of the movie star’s trial.Herath testified Friday that she didn't know whether footage existed and said her email referred to an earlier phone conversation in which her father told her he assumed there must be footage of the collision from someone on the crowded run with a GoPro. The camera is a common accessory for skiers at resorts like Deer Valley.While Sanderson’s attorneys have focused on their client’s deteriorating health, Paltrow’s legal team has intrigued the jury with recurring questions about the mysterious, missing GoPro footage. No video footage has since been located or entered as evidence.GoPro cameras are commonly worn by outdoor athletes including skiers to capture action sports.The proceedings have delved deep into the 76-year-old Sanderson's medical history and personality changes, with attorneys questioning whether his deteriorating health and estranged relationships stemmed from the collision or natural process of aging.After a judge threw out Sanderson's earlier $3.1 million lawsuit, Sanderson then claimed damages of “more than $300,000."" Paltrow has countersued for a symbolic $1 and attorney fees, and one of her attorneys has repeatedly waved a $1 bill toward the jury.Sanderson’s attorneys likened the symbolic action of suing for $1 to a 2017 countersuit filed by Taylor Swift against a radio host for the same amount in an effort to draw attention to Paltrow’s celebrity. When asked whether she’s friends with Swift over a parade of objections from her attorney, Paltrow said no, but that she was “friendly” with the singer.__Associated Press writer Anna Furman contributed reporting from Los Angeles.",2023/03/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845377,Kuzmenko sets Canucks mark in 7-2 win over Sharks,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Andrei Kuzmenko scored his 35th goal, a Canucks franchise record for a first-year player, to lead Vancouver to a 7-2 rout of the San Jose Sharks on Thursday night.The Russian forward, who also had an assist, topped the 34 goals scored by Pavel Bure in 1991-92.“Yes, it’s good. But I need to be better,” the 27-year-old Kuzmenko said of the milestone. “I need to score a lot of goals. Maybe 40, 45, I need.""J.T. Miller, Dakota Joshua, Conor Garland and Phillip Di Giuseppe also each had a goal and an assist, and Vasily Podkolzin and Sheldon Dries scored for Vancouver. Tyler Myers had a pair of assists and Thatcher Demko made 17 saves.“It was nice to see a couple of guys finish because they’ve had some chances in the past, but it’s nice to finish,” Vancouver coach Rick Tocchet said. “It gets your confidence (up), loosens you up a little bit.”Tomas Hertl and Andrew Agozzino scored for the struggling Sharks, who are winless in their last eight games (0-5-3). San Jose has not won in regulation since beating Seattle 4-0 on Feb. 20.San Jose’s lineup included six players who weren’t with the team before the league’s trade deadline on March 3.“When you make so many changes, some of the things that are happening out there are not really the fault of the new players,” Sharks coach David Quinn said. “They just haven’t been accustomed to playing the way you want to play and that can happen.“But it’s the guys that have been here that have to keep this thing together and understand that we’ve got a season to finish and we’ve got to do a better job finishing on a strong note.”Vancouver opened the scoring 6:15 into the first after Miller picked off Hertl’s pass at the Sharks’ blue line and snapped a shot past Reimer for his 29th goal.Kuzmenko made it 2-0 when he deftly moved the puck from his forehand to his backhand, then shoveled a shot in. Elias Pettersson earned an assist on the play, extending his point streak to a career-high 10 games.Hertl cut the Sharks' deficit to 2-1, but Joshua restored the Canucks' two-goal lead with a shot past an outstretched Reimer with 0.4 seconds left in the opening period.“It’s happening for us all year long,” Hertl said. “We give up so many last-second goals. I can’t even count it, like first, second, third, just so many times it’s like 2 seconds left and they score and it’s not a good feeling when you give up again.""We just shoot ourselves in the foot.”Vancouver made it 4-1 in the second on Garland's goal, and then the Canucks sealed it with another three-goal period in the third.The Canucks won their ninth straight game against the Sharks, including all four matchups between the teams this season.NOTES: D Filip Hronek played his first game in a Canucks jersey. Vancouver acquired the 25-year-old from Detroit on March 1 for first- and second-round picks in this year’s draft, but an upper-body injury kept Hronek out of the lineup until Thursday. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845378,Why executions by firing squad may be coming back in the US,"CHICAGO (AP) — The image of gunmen in a row firing in unison at a condemned prisoner may conjure up a bygone, less enlightened era.But the idea of using firing squads is making a comeback. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill this week seeking to add the state to the list of those authorizing firing squads, which currently includes Mississippi, Utah, Oklahoma and South Carolina.Fresh interest comes as states scramble for alternatives to lethal injections after pharmaceutical companies barred the use of their drugs.Some, including a few Supreme Court justices, view firing squads as less cruel than lethal injections, despite the violence involved in riddling bodies with bullets. Others say it's not so cut-and-dry, or that there are other factors to consider.A look at the status of firing squads in the United States:WHEN WAS THE LAST EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD?Ronnie Lee Gardner was executed at Utah State Prison on June 18, 2010, for killing an attorney during a courthouse escape attempt.Gardner sat in a chair, sandbags around him and a target pinned over his heart. Five prison staffers drawn from a pool of volunteers fired from 25 feet (about 8 meters) away with .30-caliber rifles. Gardner was pronounced dead two minutes later.A blank cartridge was loaded into one rifle without anyone knowing which. That's partly done to enable those bothered later by their participation to believe they may not have fired a fatal bullet.Utah is the only state to have used firing squads in the past 50 years, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Death Penalty Information Center.WHAT HAS CAUSED THE LETHAL DRUG SCARCITY?Under Idaho’s bill, firing squads would be used only if executioners can’t obtain the drugs required for lethal injections.As lethal injection became the primary execution method in the 2000s, drug companies began barring use of their drugs, saying they were meant to save lives, not take them.States have found it difficult to obtain the cocktail of drugs they long relied on, such as sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Some have switched to more accessible drugs such as pentobarbital or midazolam, both of which, critics say, can cause excruciating pain.Other states have reauthorized the use of electric chairs and gas chambers — or are at least considering doing so. That's where firing squads come in.ARE THEY MORE HUMANE?Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor is among those who say firing squads are a more humane method of execution.That idea is based on expectations that bullets will strike the heart, rupturing it and causing immediate unconsciousness as the inmate quickly bleeds to death.“In addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless,” Sotomayor wrote in a 2017 dissent.Her comments came in the case of an Alabama inmate who asked to be executed by firing squad. A Supreme Court majority refused to hear his appeal. In her dissent, Sotomayor said lethal drugs can mask intense pain by paralyzing inmates while they are still sentient.“What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet,” she wrote.BUT IS DEATH BY FIRING SQUAD REALLY PAINLESS?In a 2019 federal case, prosecutors submitted statements from anesthesiologist Joseph Antognini, who said painless deaths by firing squads are not guaranteed.Inmates could remain conscious for up to 10 seconds after being shot depending on where bullets strike, Antognini said, and those seconds could be “severely painful, especially related to shattering of bone and damage to the spinal cord.”Others note that killings by firing squad are visibly violent and bloody compared with lethal injections, potentially traumatizing victims' relatives and other witnesses as well as executioners and staffers who clean up afterward.ARE FIRING SQUADS MORE RELIABLE?If reliability means the condemned are more likely to die as intended, then one could make that argument.An Amherst College political science and law professor, Austin Sarat, studied 8,776 executions in the U.S. between 1890 and 2010 and found that 276 of them were botched, or 3.15%.The executions that went wrong included 7.12% of all lethal injections — in one notorious 2014 case in Oklahoma, Clayton Locket writhed and clenched his teeth after midazolam was administered — as well as 3.12% of hangings and 1.92% of electrocutions.By contrast, not a single one of the 34 firing squad executions was found to have been botched, according to Sarat, who has called for an end to capital punishment.The Death Penalty Information Center, however, has identified at least one firing squad execution that reportedly went awry: In 1879, in Utah territory, riflemen missed Wallace Wilkerson’s heart and it took 27 minutes for him to die.WERE FIRING SQUADS EVER IN WIDE USE?Firing squads have never been a predominant method of carrying out civilian death sentences and are more closely associated with the military, including the execution of Civil War deserters.From colonial days through 2002, more than 15,000 people were put to death, according to data compiled by death penalty researchers M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla. Just 143 died by firing squad, compared with 9,322 by hanging and 4,426 by electrocution.HAS THE SUPREME COURT WEIGHED IN?High court rulings have required inmates who oppose an existing execution method to offer an alternative. They must prove both that the alternative is “significantly” less painful and that the infrastructure exists to implement the alternative method.That has led to the spectacle of inmate attorneys bringing multiple cases in which they argue the merits of firing squads.In 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in Bucklew v. Precythe that some pain does not automatically mean a method of execution constitutes “cruel and unusual"" punishment, which is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment.The Constitution ""does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death — something that, of course, isn’t guaranteed to many people,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the 5-4 majority.Key factors in deciding whether a method is “cruel and unusual” include whether it adds extra pain “beyond what’s needed to effectuate a death sentence,” Gorsuch said.___ Follow Michael Tarm on Twitter at @mtarm.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845399,Vertical Farming Market Competitive Insights and Precise Outlook 2023-2031,"According to a recent study by strategic consulting and market research firm Report Ocean, the Global Vertical Farming Market was worth USD 3.72 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.5%, earning revenue of around USD 13.2 billion by the end of 2028. The market is booming due to the degradation of land, increasing demand for organic food, and adoption of space-saving farming along with expanding technological advancements in the agriculture sector. The benefits of year-round crop production by vertical farming, as well as the stable crop yields, are also driving growth in the market. Vertical farming reduces the use of water, soil, and saves considerable space, making it a more sustainable method of agriculture. However, factors such as maintenance of temperature, humidity, and air circulation in a vertical farm are the major restraining factors for the growth of the market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR371The market is fragmented into Building-Based Vertical Farms and Shipping Container-Based Vertical Farms. The Building-Based-Vertical Farms segment dominates the market owing to the rising shifting of abandoned buildings in cities. In addition, the use of shipping containers installed with LED lights and drip irrigation is growing in some countries, allowing users to monitor plant growth remotely. The Global Vertical Farming Market is expected to proliferate during the forecast period (2023-2028) around the globe, as it is one of the most booming markets that grow continuously owing to the fast advantages and integration of new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), Hydroponics, Aeroponics, and Aquaponics.Geographically, the Global Vertical Farming Market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific (APAC), Latin America (LATAM), Middle East & Africa (MEA). The Asia-Pacific segment accounts to hold the largest share in the market owing to the rising investments and expanding operations in vertical farming by various companies in this region. Many countries in APAC are densely populated with limited availability of land farming. Since the demand for food is increasing and conventional farming is not sufficient to serve this demand. Thus, growing food locally in limited space is rising thereby resulting in the expansion of farms by companies in this region. Moreover, The sudden outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), initially declines the growth of the Food and Agriculture sector. However, post the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increase in the awareness of health and food safety. Interest in indoor farming and vertical gardens rise during the pandemic. People started growing small crops on their balconies and terrace. which in turn accelerated the growth of the Global Vertical Farming Market. This trend in the market is likely to continue during the forecast period (2023-2028).The leading market players in the Global Vertical Farming market are Signify Holding, OSRAM GmbH, Freight Farms Inc., Aerofarms, Sky Greens, Plenty, Valoya, Everlight Electronics Co. Ltd., Heliospectra AB, Green Sense Farms, Agrilution, BrightFarms, Illumitex Inc., American Hydroponics, Koninklijke Philips N.V., Urban Crop Solutions, and Other Prominent Players.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845401,"Asia-Pacific Cheese Market Evolving Technology, Trends and Advancement 2023 to 2031","The report by Report Ocean highlights the growth of the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market, which is driven by the increasing demand from the fast-food and convenience industries, as well as the introduction of new cheese products by manufacturers. The market was valued at USD 23.1 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.1% to reach USD 34.6 billion by 2028. Factors such as the expanding food industry, changing consumer preferences, and the impact of COVID-19 on eating habits have contributed to the growth of the market. With per capita consumption rates in the region still low, there is significant potential for further growth in cheese sales in the Asia Pacific.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR370Moreover, the producers are dealing with the problem and attempting to add more nutrients with a distinct flavor to smoked cheese products, which is projected to provide a challenge to the market’s growth. However, Cheese, on the other hand, has a high fat content, which in turn, may act as a huge restraining factor for market growth.Growing Interest in Western CuisineThe introduction of numerous flavored cheese products, including pepper, garlic, red chili flakes, and oregano pickle, as well as the rising popularity of western cuisines and rising disposable incomes, are what is driving the cheese business. Despite being a common dish in Western countries, cheese can be adapted to suit a variety of tastes and preferences of consumers worldwide, including those in Asia-Pacific. Although Western cuisines are diverse, they have several characteristics in common that make them unique from other regions’ cuisines. Many different types of cheeses and other fermented milk products are used in Western cuisines. The effects of rapid westernization are driving up cheese demand in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result, the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market is predicted to develop at a significant rate during the forecast period (2022-2028).Expanding the Cheese Market in Developing CountriesIn developing nations like the Asia-Pacific, the demand for cheese is anticipated to increase significantly. Due to altered eating habits, greater wealth, and the growth of restaurant chains that prominently showcase cheese, the consumption of cheese per person in East Asia has increased significantly. The increased urbanization of Asia, rising family incomes, and the growing appeal of the Western way of life to middle- and upper-class individuals all support the cheese industry. The increased popularity of pizza and other fast foods with a European flair appears to be a major consumer trend, especially among young people. This results in offering lucrative opportunities for the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market during the forecast period (2022-2028).Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR370Regulatory ImpactThe tight regulatory legislations governing cheese are expected to make growth in the cheese business difficult. Because of increased health concerns, there is a greater demand for proper labeling, which includes stating the names of all the ingredients in the product and specifying the characteristics of the substances and their nutrient content. Such information is especially relevant in the case of food products that contain numerous additives; for example, cheese is made by combining several ingredients, including whey, caseinate, and maltodextrin. Adherence to these labeling standards may raise the cost of packaging and labeling, affecting the ultimate product price. As a result, consumer acceptance is poor, posing a challenge to the cheese market.Segmental CoverageAsia-Pacific Cheese Market – By ProductBased on the product, the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market is segmented into Mozzarella, Cheddar, Feta, Parmesan, Roquefort, and Others. Furthermore, the price of cheddar cheese is lower than that of other cheeses such as mozzarella, making cheddar cheese inexpensive. Furthermore, cheddar cheese is available in single plastic-wrapped slices, cheese spray, cheese spread, squeeze tubes, and a variety of other packaging alternatives, which has created numerous potential for market growth. This influences the cheddar segment to dominate the market share in the upcoming years.Asia-Pacific Cheese Market – By FormatBased on the format, the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market is segmented into Slices, Diced/Cubes, Shredded, Blocks, Spreads, Liquids, and Others. Cheese slices have the largest market share since they are frequently utilized in homes and restaurants to prepare sandwiches and burgers. All these factors boost the growth of the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market during the forecast period (2022-2028).Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR370Impact of COVID-19 on Asia-Pacific Cheese MarketThe unexpected drop in food service industry sales as a result of COVID-19 has had a substantial impact on the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market. With food service outlets accounting for more than half of cheese sales, the cheese industry is the most susceptible. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the supermarket/hypermarket category because of the worldwide closure of critical distribution channels to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. Furthermore, manufacturers are implementing their strategies and developing novel items. Thus, post COVID-19 the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market has recovered. Also, it is projected to flourish during the forecast period (2022-2028).Competitive LandscapeThe leading market players in the Asia-Pacific Cheese Market are Hansen Holdings, Fonterra, DuPont, DSM, ADM, Sacco s.r.l, Amul Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, Milky Mist Dairy Food Pvt Ltd, Bega Cheese Trading Co Pty Ltd, Colun, Lion Pty, Kraft Foods Limited, Danone, Yili Group, Sodiaal, and other prominent players. The Asia-Pacific Cheese Market is highly fragmented with the presence of several manufacturing companies in the country.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845407,"Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market Growth rate, Opportunity, Industry Analysis to 2031","The Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market is gaining significant traction owing to the growing premium product demand, product innovation, and branding along with the growing awareness of chocolate’s benefits on health. A recent study conducted by Report Ocean revealed that the market was worth USD 9.14 billion in 2021, and it is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.6%, earning revenues of around USD 12.45 billion by the end of 2028. Dark and sugar-free chocolates are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and organic ingredients are now being used by chocolate manufacturers. In addition, numerous chocolate manufacturers have produced functional chocolates that include prebiotic elements and vitamins to attract customers. The rising chocolate demand is a major driver of cocoa demand in the Asia-Pacific cocoa industry. However, fluctuations in cocoa prices may act as a huge restraining factor for market growth.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR369Growing Awareness of Dark Chocolate BenefitsCocoa-based chocolate is high in antioxidants and minerals. Chocolate is also high in calories, so eating it in moderation can help you manage your weight. Chocolate consumption decreases cholesterol levels and lessens the risk of cardiovascular issues. Furthermore, due to its aroma and flavor, chocolate has been regarded as a luxury or premium product since ancient times. All of the aforementioned health benefits and consumer perceptions of chocolate are predicted to increase. Moreover, organic ingredients are increasingly being used by chocolate manufacturers. Consumer tastes, lifestyles, eating habits, and exposure to international brands have all contributed to increased sales in the Asia-Pacific chocolate sector. The Asia-Pacific chocolate industry is increasingly dominated by international brands.Premium Chocolates are becoming Increasingly PopularChocolate is viewed as an exotic pleasure by Asian customers in China, India, Japan, and other countries. It can be offered as a luxury gift or consumed on a special occasion. The market for premium chocolate is expected to benefit from growing sales of ordinary chocolate. The bean-to-bar concept, which predicts that consumers will regard premium chocolate with a higher cocoa content as a luxury rather than a need, is expected to boost demand. The Indian market for premium chocolates is dominated by fierce regional and global competition. As a result, international firms are always producing new things to differentiate themselves from their competition. As a result, the Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market are predicted to develop at a significant rate during the forecast period (2022-2028).Volatile Prices of CocoaThe market’s growth is hampered by unstable cocoa prices and limited production. Products made from cocoa, such as dark chocolate, cacao nibs, and unsweetened cocoa powder, are rich in minerals. Raw cacao goods that have had minimal processing have more antioxidants and less added sugar than those that have undergone extensive processing, which limits the market growth. These factors collectively prevent the Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market from expanding.Segmental CoverageRequest To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR369Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market – By ApplicationsBased on applications, the Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate Market is segmented into Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals, Food and Beverages, and Confectionary. The food and beverages segment now has the biggest market share and is likely to continue to do so during the forecast period (2022-2028). For many years, chocolate has been the most popular sweet utilized in a variety of contexts. It has been used in baking frequently as compound chocolate, a less expensive substitute for pure chocolate made of cocoa vegetable oil and sugars. Additionally, brownies, cakes, creams, mousses, and even for decorative purposes are made with milk, dark, and white chocolate. Additionally, the usage of chocolate in beverages has increased. Trendy options include various healthy chocolate cocktails and hot chocolate. The major purposes of chocolate in beverages are to improve flavor, increase richness, and provide color. Many beverage makers use chocolate as their major ingredient because of its ability to hide flavors, keep a clean label, and possess antioxidant properties.Impact of COVID-19 on Asia-Pacific Cocoa and Chocolate MarketThe cocoa market was affected by low sales volumes caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as supply-side worries over quality and certification. The Fine Cacao & Chocolate Institute (FCCI) conducted a poll to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on exports, and the findings were alarming. According to studies, the rigorous lockdown prevented producers and agricultural workers from accessing the estates for several weeks until officials granted exceptions.

According to the report, the India Vending Machine Market is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 17.2% by the end of 2028.The report suggests that the India Vending Machine Market is flourishing due to the increasing popularity of portable snacks and beverages, which has led to a rise in product sales through vending machines.

To better monitor the equipment, this has made it possible to collect data in real-time and to provide an end-to-end IoT solution.

Soon, strict government regulations governing the sale of junk food in public places like schools and restrictions on the sale of products like cigarettes and tobacco are anticipated to restrain industry expansion.

Furthermore, factors such as rising population, increasing digitization, mobile-based cashless payment options, greater investment in the retail industry, and rising purchasing power drive market expansion. Furthermore, organized retailing growth in India’s malls and multiplexes, BPOs, IT, and ITES sectors would be a major driver of vending machine demand during the forecast period.Impact of COVID-19 on India Vending Machine MarketBecause of lockdowns, the supply chain has suffered, which has hurt the consumer products industry due to the coronavirus outbreak. The impact on food and beverage companies will undoubtedly be complex, affecting both supply and demand.

The report states that the smart agriculture market is projected to grow at a CAGR of more than 11% until 2028, earning revenues of around USD 24.3 billion by the end of 2022.The study conducted by Report Ocean suggests that the global smart agriculture market is rapidly growing due to increasing investments by governments and large enterprises in integrating smart technologies into the agriculture sector. Additionally, the rising awareness about the benefits of smart agriculture is also driving the growth of this market.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR375The report also highlights the growing burden of the global population and surging food demand, which is leading to environmental consequences of agricultural activities and depleting levels of resources such as groundwater. As a result, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics are being adopted for better management of resources in the agriculture sector.Overall, the Report Ocean study suggests that the global smart agriculture market is expected to provide lucrative growth opportunities in the forecast period.Rising Demand For Weather Monitoring Systems Is Driving The Growth Of The Smart Agriculture MarketThe demand for weather monitoring systems is very prominent in the agriculture sector and is also increasing at a high rate owing to the changing climatic conditions and their adverse effects on the crops. The weather monitoring system is highly capable of detecting any sudden changes in the weather and can make real-time alerts. This can help the farmers prevent and reduce weather-related losses. It is also extremely helpful in determining the ideal environmental conditions to grow specific crops.Increasing Investment Towards Human Resources Is Propelling The Overall Market GrowthSmart agriculture technologies may generate data or create insights but it will go in vain without skilled people who are not well-equipped with the knowledge. This also acts as a major restraint for market growth. Therefore, many public and private bodies are focusing and investing in the training of human resources for smart agriculture management. For instance, Tanzania has trained over 12,000 young university graduates on smart agriculture to develop professional skills.Smart Agriculture Market – By Farm SizeBased on farm size, the smart agriculture market is segmented into small farms, medium farms, and large farms. Medium-sized farms account for the largest market share because of high ownership in this type of land size. A high number of peasants working on medium-sized farms, especially in developing countries such as India, also plays a crucial factor in propelling its market growth. Furthermore, the implementation of smart agriculture tools and technologies is much more convenient in this land size along with a high return on investment compared to other farm sizes, which also favor its market growth.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR375Smart Agriculture Market – Regional InsightsGeographically, the smart agriculture market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the smart agriculture market. However, the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to witness the highest CAGR during the forecast period. The rising government support and increasing population density of the developing countries in this region are emerging as the major driving factors for the smart agriculture market. Furthermore, the production of smart agriculture components and hardware in countries such as China, Japan, India, etc., is also increasing its penetration, driving the overall market growth.Impact of COVID-19 on Smart Agriculture MarketThe smart agriculture market was negatively impacted by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Agricultural activities in different parts of the world were halted due to lockdown and social distancing norms. Furthermore, the disruptions in the supply chain and manufacturing activities also hindered the production and distribution of hardware components involved in smart agriculture. However, the market is projected to recover in the post-lockdown period owing to the expanding scope of cloud computing and data analytics and the availability of hardware components.Competitive LandscapeThe leading market players of the smart agriculture market are John Deere, LumiGrow, Trimble, Heliospectra, Topcon Positioning Systems, InnovaSea Systems, DeLaval, Afimilk, AKVA, Antelliq, AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc., Raven Industries, Inc., GEA Group, The Climate Corporation, Autonomous Solutions, Inc., SST Development Group, Inc., Argus Control Systems Ltd, Gamaya, Grownetics, Inc., Granular, Inc., DroneDeploy, Farmers Edge Inc., BouMatic Robotic B.V., and other prominent players.The smart agriculture market is fragmented with the presence of several global and regional industry participants.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845426,"Savory Ingredients Market Size, Share, Trends, Factors and Player and forecast to 2031","The global savory ingredients market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years due to the rising demand for flavor enhancers, driven by the availability of a variety of food choices for consumers. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of around 5% during the forecast period of 2022-2028, with an estimated value of USD 10.8 billion by the end of 2028.

They are also being used as salt replacements and seasonings. Moreover, yeast extracts are increasingly used to impart both umami and kokumi tastes that add ounces of flavor complexity to foods and provide background roundness and richness. Furthermore, the demand for savory ingredients has been incessantly growing in the HoReCa (Hotel, Restaurant, and Catering) sector. Thus, the surge in consumption and usage of soups, sauces, and other seasonings in several countries around the globe is likely to bolster the demand for savory ingredients, such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) and nucleotides during the forecast period 2022-2028.Natural Savory Ingredients Accounted for the Largest Market Share in 2021Based on the source, the savory ingredients market is segmented into natural and synthetic segments. The wide range of natural products now available and the retail channels through which they are traded have revolutionized the demand for clean labeled natural savory ingredients. Moreover, the rising mindfulness about the medical benefits of natural food items and the progress in organic cultivating procedures is anticipated to drive the demand for natural nourishment and drinks, thus bolstering the demand for natural-based savory ingredients, including yeast extract and starch. An increase in the personal disposable income has resulted in the requirement of a high standard of living while making the nature-based savory ingredients affordable.Impact of COVID-19 on the Savory Ingredients MarketAlthough the deadly COVID-19 pandemic had a disastrous impact on various industries, the Savory Ingredients market is one of those markets that gained tremendously due to the pandemic with the increasing consumption of packaged food and frozen meats in the developing economies like India and China. An assortment of COVID-19-related psychological changes also affected food-related behaviors. Even in areas with low disease risks, people were exposed to widespread communication about the jeopardies of COVID-19, which caused some of their stress, thus causing stress-related eating. They attempted to feel better by eating or drinking when under stress. For instance, during the lockdown in Italy, people augmented their feeding of processed comfort foods, like chocolate, chips, and snacks, due to anxiety about their eating habits during COVID-19. Similarly, a study from Denmark also revealed a higher level of emotional eating during the lockdown: greater consumption of alcohol and pastries.

For instance, the surging consumption of noodles in evolving economies like China and India due to increasing working professionals, busy lifestyles, and the growing young population. Countries like China consume large quantities of MSG, specifically in the HoReCa sector.

Food providers invest in infrastructure like setting up warehouses, cold storage facilities, improved logistics, etc., to provide fresh, healthy, high-quality food. Innovation in digital infrastructures like the development of more user-friendly online food delivery apps and websites is also playing an essential part in the market growth.The popularity of Food Delivery Systems Confined to Smartphone Users and Low Acceptance by local Food JointsLack of awareness and digital literacy, skepticism regarding the safety of online monetary transactions, low technical knowledge about online payment methods have led to inadequate adoption of online food delivery systems by local joints, small food business owners, hotels, and restaurants. Moreover, the majority of the online food delivery transactions are confined to the urban clout having smartphones or connectivity to the internet, so the food delivery systems have a lower reach in underdeveloped regions where these things are not accessible.Online Payments Food Delivery Segment Expected to Witness Tremendous Growth In Upcoming YearsAmidst the online payment mode and cash on delivery, the online mode of payment accounts for the larger share in 2021. The cash-on-delivery mode is preferred mainly by the people of emerging economies like India and sub-Saharan Africa. However, banks and other financial institutions are working towards enhancing transaction security and providing additional services. Governments around the globe are working to offer different schemes and incentives to promote digital transactions and cashless economies. The food delivery service providers also incentivize online payments by offering attractive cashbacks, discounts, etc., on using online modes. Such initiatives may further accelerate the share of online payments in the coming years.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR382Impact of COVID-19 on the Global Online Food Delivery MarketAfter the initial setback received by the online food delivery market due to the lockdown restrictions.

According to their research, the market is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.1% and earn revenue of approximately USD 2.83 billion by the end of 2027.The report identifies increasing per capita income of consumers and growing consumption of red meat as the main drivers of this growth. In Malaysia, consumers are increasingly able to afford higher quality meat products, which has led to a surge in demand for red meat. In particular, lamb consumption has seen significant growth over the past few years, with imports of red meat accounting for a majority of the market. Approximately 80% of beef and 95% of lamb are imported, according to the South-East Asia regional manager of Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), Valeska.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR392The report also assesses business solutions, advancements, applications, benefits, breadth, and operations of the Malaysia meat market. Its comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for businesses and investors looking to enter or expand in the market.In summary, the Malaysia meat market presents a significant opportunity for growth and investment, with positive signals indicating a promising future for the industry.Increasing Demand for Packaged Meat Products is Boosting the Malaysia Meat MarketPackaged meat products are gaining huge popularity among Malay consumers mainly because of their busy lifestyles, especially in urban regions. Another crucial factor boosting the sales of packaged meat products is its clear labeling of halal and non-halal products. Islam is the most professed religion in Malaysia with around 61.3% of the population following this religion. The religion strictly bans the consumption of non-halal food. Consequently, consumers are inclined towards packaged meat due to the halal certification of the products, which is favoring the overall market growth.Increasing Import and Export Activities Propelling the Malaysia Meat Market ForwardIn light of the increasing demand for meat production in the country, the Malaysian government is focusing on expanding imports and exports of meat within the country. Malaysia is Australia’s second-largest mutton export market and a major supplier of live goats. As a result of the high protein content, goats and sheep are often consumed in Malaysia. In addition, the multicultural nature of Malaysia contributes to the demand for different types of meat, which influences imports and exports, propelling the Malaysia meat market’s growth.Request To Download Sample of This Strategic Report:-https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR392Malaysia Meat Market – By Distribution ChannelBased on distribution channels, the Malaysia meat market is segmented into on-trade and off-trade segments.

However, the on-trade segment also covers a substantial share in the market because of the increasing demand for meat products in restaurants, hotels, and street-food vendors.Impact of COVID-19 on Malaysia Meat MarketThe growth of the Malaysia meat market came to a standstill due to the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the government-imposed strict lockdown to flatten the infection curve in the country, the distribution channels, such as supermarket/hypermarkets and wet markets, were either closed or operating at reduced times. Consequently, this restricted the consumers accessibility to meat products. Furthermore, the import and export activities were also restricted to prevent further casualties. As a result, the supply of meat products was hindered, incurring huge losses to the market players.Get a Sample Report:- https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR392Malaysia Meat Market – Competitive LandscapeThe leading players in the Malaysia meat market are Darabif Meat Company, Meat Factory Malaysia, The Food Company, Kharisma Vision, Borneo Seafoods, Felsers Rodl, KNA Resources, Yi Kim International Trading Sdn Bhd, Falak Group, Vasano Holdings Sdn Bhd, Mutiara Food Processing Sdn Bhd, and other prominent players.The Malaysia meat market is highly fragmented due to the presence of several industry players and an increasing number of meat importers and exporters.

However, the armed forces have run out of spare engines, requiring them to sign a new contract with Michigan-based RENK America, the manufacturer of the tanks.The agreement, which remains valid until March 2028, also covers the upgrading of the weapons fire-control system, the Liberty Times reported. The new engines will be more reliable, resilient, and easier to maintain, according to the military.The main target for the M60A3 during an armed conflict would be China’s amphibious landing vehicles, which would be at their most vulnerable while operating on beaches due to the absence of heavy armored plating. The tank took part in exercises simulating the repulsion of an enemy invasion on and around a beach in Taoyuan City Thursday (March 23).",2023/03/24,2613,Politics
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845471,Scandal-plagued China soccer hit by new corruption probes,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s scandal-plagued football association has been rocked by new corruption probes into its chiefs of discipline and competition.The sports ministry on Friday said Wang Xiaoping, director the CFA's Disciplinary Committee, and Huang Song, were both “suspected of serious violations” of law and discipline — the government's usual bywords for graft.Huang was being investigated by the ruling Communist Party’s corruption watchdog, the sports ministry’s anti-graft body and by authorities in Hebei province outside Beijing where the national soccer team maintains a training camp, the notice said.The single-sentence announcements said Wang and Huang were cooperating with investigators but gave no details about the charges against them. Chinese prosecutors have wide powers to hold suspects for lengthy interrogations if state secrets are believed to be involved.The announcements come barely a month after the head of China’s national soccer body Chen Xuyuan was arrested on corruption charges.Chen was head of the Chinese Football Association and vice chair of its party committee, underscoring the government’s heavy hand in attempting to direct success in the game.China’s increasingly autocratic president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping declared a plan to make China a football superpower, but funding and enthusiasm have appeared to dwindle. Xi has also made fighting corruption a signature policy, taking down political rivals in the process and further embedding strict policies governing freedom of speech and civil society organizations outside party control.Sports falls under the same yoke of state control and the national team has seen a revolving door of foreign and domestic managers cut loose for their failure to produce results.One of China's most decorated past football leaders, former Everton and Sheffield United midfielder Li Tie, has been jailed amid a graft investigation.Despite its success in Olympic sports such as table tennis and shooting, China has only qualified for one soccer World Cup, more than two decades ago. The men's national team is currently ranked 80th by FIFA, just behind countries such as Uzbekistan, Georgia and Gabon.China’s top division clubs once paid big salaries to attract foreign talent, but the league has virtually collapsed under the now-abandoned “zero-COVID” policy and lingering economic malaise. Top sponsors have gone bankrupt and and efforts to fight match-fixing and other forms of cheating have received little attention of late.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845472,"A sex trafficking case, a plea deal and a mother's pain","SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Irma Reyes changed clothes in the back seat of the pickup: skirt, tights, turtleneck, leather jacket. All black. She brushed her hair and pulled on heels as her husband drove their Chevy through predawn darkness toward a courthouse hundreds of miles from home.She wanted to look confident — poised but hellbent. The outfit was meant to let Texas prosecutors know just what kind of formidable mother they’d be crossing that morning.Weeks earlier, Reyes learned about the plea deal. State lawyers planned to let the two men charged with sex trafficking her daughter walk free.She’d barely been able to eat or brush her teeth since, her mind racing: Why are they doing this? Can I get the judge to stop it? Don’t they know my daughter matters?Reyes' daughter was 16 in 2017, when men she knew only as “Rocky” and “Blue” kept her and another girl at a San Antonio motel where men paid to have sex with them. Now, the cases against Rakim Sharkey and Elijah Teel — the men police identified as the traffickers — have seen years of delay, a parade of prosecutors, an aborted trial and, ultimately, a stark retreat by the government.They are among thousands of cases under a cloud of dysfunction at the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has risen to national prominence fighting court battles that affect people nationwide even while facing legal troubles including a criminal investigation by Justice Department officials. Trafficking cases in particular have cast doubt on how the agency uses millions of state tax dollars on an issue that Republican leaders trumpet as a priority while attacking Democrats’ approach to border security.For Reyes, her daughter, and other victims and families, the politics take a backseat to their pain. To them, the plea deal is a case study in how the agency's troubles are undercutting justice for vulnerable victims.A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, Kristen House, declined to answer questions about the deal, the actions of prosecutors, and other details of the case involving Reyes' daughter.“It’s like a nightmare that I can’t wake up from,” Reyes told The Associated Press.______The case was ready for trial years before that January day Reyes and her husband made their way to the San Antonio courthouse, said Kirsta Leeburg Melton.“You will not find a stronger corroborated case,” said Melton, who oversaw the attorney general’s human trafficking unit until late 2019 and now runs the Institute to Combat Trafficking. “And I’m sick. It’s wrong.”In the courthouse, Reyes’ stomach churned as she thought of the deal for the two men: five years of probation. The original charges carried potential sentences of decades in prison.“I need to puke,” said Reyes, 45, her heels clicking down the hallway to the bathroom.Inside the crowded courtroom, she waited on a back bench for hours, watching people charged with drug crimes and drunken driving draw harsher sentences.One of the defendants walked in and sat for a while on the same bench. Just one person separated them, but he seemed not to recognize Reyes. She squeezed her husband’s hand.When the judge got to their case, she summarized its twists and turns: years lost to the pandemic, delays due to “turnover in the attorney general’s office,” days of testimony last year only for several people to catch COVID-19 and prompt a mistrial.A defense attorney for Sharkey said his client was in a “strong position” for acquittal but would accept the deal to put the case behind him. Reyes listened in disbelief as the new prosecutor told the judge that Reyes’ daughter — now a 22-year-old with whom she keeps up a steady stream of text messages — was “on the run.”Sharkey and Teel pleaded “no contest” to aggravated promotion of prostitution. The judge, Velia Meza, sentenced the men to seven years of probation, despite prosecutors recommending five, adding that they’d be strictly supervised but wouldn’t have to register as sex offenders.Then, it was Reyes’ turn. Meza would allow a victim impact statement.Reyes walked slowly to the front of the court, clutching her handwritten statement. She thought of her daughter: a beautiful soul who blasts Beyoncé and loves her dogs, a fighter who overcame a lifetime of struggles to get sober, a woman who took the witness stand just months earlier against the man charged with trafficking her.Reyes reached the waiting bailiff. She took the microphone.____Reyes’ daughter lost a brother when she was young. Then her estranged father died. She was bullied at school.The AP is withholding the young woman’s name, in keeping with its policy to avoid identifying victims of sexual assault and other such crimes. Reyes told AP she spoke about this story with her daughter, who did not want to comment or be interviewed directly.Reyes said that as a girl, her daughter would run away from the large family’s South Texas home. By her teens, she started using drugs and getting psychological care through the juvenile justice system. In September 2017, she was sent to a rehabilitation center.Court records show it was only days after Reyes’ daughter and another girl ran away from rehab that their photos were advertised online for “dates” out of a motel room off the interstate. They met “Blue” outside a motel, where they couldn't afford a night's stay. He introduced them to “Rocky.” The pair rented the girls a room, helped set up meetings with men who’d pay for sex, and collected half the money at the end of each day, according to the records.Reyes’ daughter later testified that when one of the men hit her, she got scared and called her mom. Reyes found the phone number advertised on Backpages, a classifieds website later shut down by law enforcement. She called police; officers found the girls at the motel that night.Ten days after running away, Reyes’ daughter was in a juvenile lockup talking to a detective who would spend months tracking down the men.“We’re able to get the surveillance video. We were able to get room receipts. We were able to get cellphones, which were extracted for data,” detective Manuel Anguiano told AP. “I don’t think I’ve ever worked a case that had more evidence.”Several people who worked on the case told AP they were outraged by the attorney general's office's final resolution.“It’s absolutely an unfortunate outcome,” said Cara Pierce, who oversaw the agency's human trafficking unit until August 2022. “This was a triable case when I left.”Sharkey’s lawyer, Jason Goss, maintains the jury would have acquitted his client but told AP he had no choice but to plead no contest to the reduced charge because the potential sentence of 25 years to life was too risky. Teel’s attorney, Brian Powers, didn't respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment.After getting out of the detention facility, Reyes’ daughter lived away from home for a while, then returned to her mother’s house on a quiet, residential block.She barely left her spartan bedroom, Reyes said, and couldn’t talk about what had happened. Reyes in turn got anxious when her daughter was around men. They avoided crowds.Reyes coaxed her back into the world. She brought her treats – Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Limón Lays – and the book “Women Who Run with the Wolves.”Gradually, they ventured out, taking morning walks in a nature preserve, watching the birds while eating lunch in Reyes’ car. But the young woman still had panic attacks, sometimes shutting herself in the bathroom.That’s where she was when Connie Spence, a prosecutor who signed on to the case in summer 2020, arrived to talk, Reyes said. Spence got down on the floor, speaking calmly as the young woman hyperventilated.After that, Reyes said, her daughter began weekly counseling. She started volunteering at a library and museum. She reenrolled in school and, last June, mother and daughter drove together to San Antonio to testify.“They built a bond somehow,” Reyes said. “Connie gave her hope.”On the witness stand, Reyes’ daughter struggled to breathe and had difficulty recalling details from years before. But over hours of testimony she recounted how she came to be having sex at the motel to pay ""Rocky.” She testified that he got mad after she spoke to other men there, taking her into a room and hitting her across the face.Asked to identify “Rocky,” the young woman pointed across the courtroom at Sharkey.___Four days later, Reyes and her daughter were relaxing in the summer heat on their patio when Spence called to tell them the judge had declared a mistrial because four people in the courtroom caught COVID-19.They told themselves testifying would be easier the second time. All three women agreed to go back to court as many times as needed.But it would be the last time they spoke to Spence.She left the attorney general’s office the following month, according to personnel files obtained under public records laws. Spence’s resignation letter gives no reason. She didn’t respond to calls and messages seeking comment.Spence left amid a wave of seasoned prosecutors quitting over practices they said were meant to slant legal work, reward loyalists and drum out dissent. The next month, the office dropped a separate series of trafficking and child sexual assault cases after losing track of one of the victims.In October, Reyes was introduced to new lead lawyer James Winters — the last of eight prosecutors to handle the case for the attorney general's office, court records show. Reyes said her daughter told Winters she would testify again.The lawyer later asked that the case be postponed again, but the judge refused. Reyes didn’t hear from prosecutors again until early January, when Winters called about the plea deal. It was a couple weeks after her daughter had left home.In the silence, she’d grown pessimistic about the case. They had a fight, Reyes said. The young woman went to stay with a friend’s family.Reyes worried about her daughter and whether she might turn to old habits. She spent Christmas with the family, but left soon after.Still, a victim’s advocate told prosecutors that Reyes could get her daughter to court, internal office messages obtained by AP show. Reyes doesn’t understand why Winters later told the judge her daughter was “on the run.”Winters, who referred emailed questions to an attorney general's spokesman, submitted his resignation letter three weeks after appearing in court for the plea deal, which was first reported by Texas Public Radio.___In San Antonio, Reyes clutched her jacket around her shoulders as she reached the front of the courtroom and took the microphone for her victim impact statement.She'd spent lunch writing out what she wanted to say, but rage got the better of her planning. She looked at the men accused of trafficking her daughter and two other girls, at the lawyers flanking their clients, at men who'd also gotten probation on charges of soliciting and paying the girls for sex.Reyes began speaking quietly, the statement still crumpled under her jacket.“Rakim, can you look at me?” she said, as Sharkey examined his hands. “You have daughters. Going on your third. Exactly the number of victims.”She told one of the men who'd paid for sex that she's glad his family left him.And she gestured at Winters, the prosecutor. “He doesn’t represent me. I represent myself right now. I'm not afraid of you.”Reyes spoke for nearly five minutes, her voice rising as she turned to face the courtroom and beseeched people who were being trafficked to come forward.“There are victims out there that this minute are being pimped by these types of guys, this type of trash,” she said. “And the trash is supposed to be disposed. But they’re lucky today.”Reyes' voice broke.“What these people do to their victims — nothing will ever fix that,” she said. “We just try to hold on.”___Reyes cried on the way home, but the drive otherwise passed in silence. Her husband, who doesn’t speak much English, hadn’t followed everything in court. Reyes didn’t know how to explain.She also didn’t know how to tell her daughter, who'd already lost hope the men would go to prison.Reyes wanted her to come home, to talk in person. But her daughter’s bedroom was empty.Reyes felt isolated and got little rest, with violent nightmares. She kept the blinds drawn. She struggled to breathe and fantasized about feeling nothing.Two days after the hearing, Reyes sat alone in her bedroom, where crosses line the walls. She felt abandoned by the prosecutors, by the judge, by her family, by God. She thought about how she would take her own life. The idea seemed soothing. Her thoughts grew specific. But then she thought of her children and called a crisis hotline.“I just swim into my thoughts,” she said. “It’s like a big ocean once you let your mind wander. But pulling yourself back up, that’s where I have to be aware that I don’t dive too deep.”Reyes turned 46 the next week. She spent her birthday at the doctor’s office. She cried uncontrollably. The doctor prescribed anti-anxiety medicine.Reyes is in therapy. She’s signed up for dance classes and walks her dogs in the nature preserve, hoping her daughter will join them soon.She's still grasping for closure. Reyes filed complaints with the attorney general’s office, the state bar association and the U.S. Department of Justice, although none will reopen the criminal case. Perhaps her best hope from the legal system is a civil lawsuit that she hopes her daughter will one day be ready to bring.She and her daughter talk more lately. Their texts are filled with worry but also jokes and photos.One day, Reyes’ son shook her awake at 3 a.m. A sheriff’s deputy was on the phone and said her daughter had called 911 having a panic attack; she said she wanted to go home.I’ve lived this before, Reyes thought. She asked the deputy to wait with her daughter.Then she pulled on shoes, climbed into the pickup and drove out into the night.____EDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845474,"Corruption, deep disparity mark Iraq's oil legacy post-2003","NAHRAN OMAR, Iraq (AP) — The oil is pumped 24 hours a day several meters from Raghed Jasim’s home in Iraq’s crude-rich southern heartland. Gas flares from the field light the night sky bright orange, spewing acrid smoke; when the wind picks up, the 40-year old’s clothes are coated black.For Iraq’s poorest, evidence of the country's monumental oil wealth is inescapable. So is the knowledge that very little of it trickles down to them.Jasim’s savings were depleted when he was diagnosed with cancer last year, a disease he is convinced was caused by the toxic plumes. Twenty years since the U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein and remade Iraq’s political order with the promise of democracy and freedom, he has one wish: To find a way to leave.“There is no future here for my children,” he said.Basra province, which boasts most of Iraq’s oil reserves, is symbolic of the deep disparities that have endured since the 2003 invasion. Basra continually bewilders experts, envoys and residents: How can a relatively stable province so rich in resources rank among the poorest and most under-developed in the country?“Of course, I blame the corrupt Iraqi government,” said Jasim, a policeman, echoing a widespread view in the region. “But I blame the Americans too. They replaced our leaders with thieves.”Local leaders in Basra talk of the oil reserves as both a blessing and a curse. They say resources bring affluence but have also given rise to vicious competition between political elites and armed groups at the expense of the Iraqi people.The power-sharing system in place since 2003, which divides the state and its institutions along ethnic and sectarian lines, sucks oil wealth into a pool of corruption and patronage. The higher the oil price, the more entrenched this system becomes as sectarian-based parties claim lucrative ministry portfolios, appoint loyalists in key positions and dole out public jobs to ensure support. According to the International Monetary Fund, public sector employment tripled from 2004 to 2013, but service delivery in health, education and power sectors remained inadequate.The result is that elections keep establishment parties in power. Voter turnout has dropped to record lows.Apart from institutional failures, air pollution is extensive in Basra, and salinity levels arising from a severe fresh water crisis are leading causes of illness, according to local researchers. Unemployment is rampant, with more than half the population below the age of 25.Public anger gave rise to violent protests in 2018, the precursor to mass anti-government protests in the capital a year later. But a swift crackdown by security forces and assassinations by armed groups have created a climate of fear.“The killings silenced many activists,” said Basra activist Ammar Sarhan. “Business continues as usual.”The 2003 toppling of Saddam propelled the oil-rich country into the global economy, opening the doors to foreign investment. In pre-invasion planning, U.S. advisors and their Iraqi opposition allies in exile had envisioned a shock system of reforms that would revamp Iraq’s oil industry and fund post-war reconstruction.Instead, violence hobbled oil production for years. A charm offensive by then-Oil Minister Hussein al-Shahrestani paved the way for major oil contracts to be awarded in 2007 and 2009. Today exports reach over 3 million barrels a day, double the rate in the early 2000s. The state budget, which in 2021 reached up to $90 billion, is financed almost entirely by oil revenues. Still, the government fails to deliver essential services, including water and electricity.In Basra, conditions rank amongst the worst in the country. Unemployment stands at 21%, above the national average of 16% according to a 2022 study by the International Labor Organization. Statistics for poverty rates vary from 10-20% according to various studies and local economists. Meanwhile, the province boasts around 70% of the country's oil production capacity.The road leading to Jasim’s humble home is rocky and unpaved.In 2003, he was a young man bewitched by the Bush administration’s rhetoric of building a democratic Iraq, he said. “We were full of hope,” he recalled. Twenty years on, he is middle-aged, tired of rampant government corruption and recovering from cancer.The loan he had taken out to build a home was used up to pay for $30,000 in private medical bills. Basra’s decrepit public hospitals were overwhelmed and unable to provide treatment, he said.His is a common story in Nahran Omar, a village of fewer than 2,000 people adjacent to a state-run oil field where cancer rates are disproportionately high. Every family here has a story of illness and debt, said Bashir Jabir, the mayor.“After 2003, more and more oil was exported, and we expected to benefit from this,” he said. “Instead, it hurt us.”The government long played down the link between cancer rates in the south and oil production activity, saying cases are only marginally higher than the rest of the country. This changed in 2022, when then-Environment Minister Jassim al-Falahi acknowledged that pollution from the fields was the main reason for the rise in sickness.Nahran Omar highlights a tragic irony: The natural gas burned from the oil fields, if captured, could solve Iraq’s perennial electricity shortages and reduce pollution. But securing investment to do this has been set back by protracted contract negotiations, a common headache for most major foreign investors.The entry of foreign investors also exacerbated competition between tribes, said Sheikh Muhammed al-Zaidawi, who leads an assembly of southern tribal elders. Tribes, which often wield more influence than government institutions in the south, pressure foreign companies for jobs, compensation, training for youth and development of their villages.“Most of the problems between tribes today are caused by the presence of oil companies,” he said, “All of them want to benefit.” Tribal disputes often turn into deadly gun battles.Reliance on the oil industry has stifled private sector development. Nearly every prime minister since the invasion has repeated calls to diversify the economy and boost incentives for Iraqi businesses.Nidhal Musa is one success story.She grew up in a poor suburb of Basra city and was 35 when the U.S. invaded Iraq. She spent subsequent years taking care of her sick and disabled husband. Desperate to earn money, she began sewing clothes to sell in the local market.By 2013, she had gathered a group of women just like herself, beleaguered and in need of money to support their families. She pooled together enough funds to open a garment factory and became known for employing the poor.But not everyone welcomed her success.In 2022, Musa received a slew of death threats. “Be very careful,” one message read. She believes she is being targeted because she refused to use her local fame to back a powerful political party that asked her to promote their campaign in 2021 elections.“They try to keep us weak,” she said. “They know perfectly well, if the people are hungry, they will be preoccupied only by their hunger.”",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845475,Why murder defendant was free before killings in Washington,"SEATTLE (AP) — Kirkland Warren was out on bail pending a long-delayed murder trial in Arkansas. But when he was arrested in southwestern Washington state early this month on charges that he assaulted his ex-girlfriend and fired a gunshot into her apartment, he quickly posted bond and was released again.Just a few days later, his ex-girlfriend, Meshay Melendez, 27, and her 7-year-old daughter, Layla Stewart, vanished. Police named Warren a person of interest in their disappearance.The discovery of their bodies in thick brush down a road embankment on Wednesday has raised questions about why someone facing a murder charge in another state would be released from custody after being arrested for a serious domestic violence offense.Cymber Tadlock, the deputy prosecutor who handled Warren’s case in a 2017 killing in Jefferson County, Arkansas, said the Vancouver Police Department in Washington notified her on March 2 that they had arrested Warren for drive-by shooting and other charges, stemming from an incident in December. They also told her the next day that Warren had a court appearance and his bail was set at $100,000.It wasn’t until March 14, after she had received official paperwork from Clark County, Washington, that she filed a motion to revoke Warren's bail in the 2017 murder case. In the meantime, he posted bail and was released from custody March 8 — four days before Melendez and her daughter vanished.Had his Arkansas bail been revoked sooner, it’s possible Warren would have remained in custody as a fugitive pending his extradition to face trial in Arkansas. But Tadlock said the time it took to obtain an order revoking his bail was typical.“I wish everything could happen more quickly,” Tadlock told The Associated Press. “I wish his murder case could have been resolved by now. It’s had delay after delay, and now it’s had a tragedy.”Even before a man walking his dog reported seeing what resembled two “life-sized mannequins” in a rural area east of Washougal, Washington, on Wednesday morning, the family and friends of Melendez and Stewart had asserted the criminal justice system let them down.Melendez’s brother, Miguel Melendez, and stepdad, Kendrick Taylor, along with Stewart's grandfather, told The Columbian newspaper of Vancouver that they couldn’t believe Warren had been released on bail after shooting at her apartment, especially considering his pending murder trial in Arkansas.But except in cases of aggravated murder, Washington law presumes someone will be released from custody until they are tried and convicted. Courts can impose conditions — such as bail or electronic monitoring — to help ensure public safety and to keep defendants from fleeing.Complicating matters is that when Warren was released, he was not ordered to wear a GPS ankle bracelet — despite a recent state law that allows courts to order people accused of domestic violence to wear them. Under that law, the victim can use a mobile phone app to be alerted if their abuser is near. Police receive the notifications as well and can respond.Vancouver Police Department spokesperson Kim Kapp said Friday that officers were concerned about Warren being released at all, considering the danger he posed. Kapp said the department may urge lawmakers to make the GPS bracelets mandatory for domestic violence defendants deemed high risk.Warren was charged with killing an acquaintance in his vehicle in 2017 and leaving the body in a roadside ditch. He told police the passenger was asking him for money and he shot him because he feared for his safety.His family got him released from custody pending trial by putting up 10% of his $250,000 bond, said his attorney in that case, Mark Hampton, and Warren subsequently moved to Washington state with the knowledge of his lawyer and prosecutors.The case has been delayed pending psychological evaluations, discovery disputes, the pandemic and most recently by a fall that Hampton’s 91-year-old mother took, resulting in a broken hip.Vancouver police previously investigated Warren in 2020 for possession of a stolen gun, and in 2021 for lying on a federal form required to purchase a firearm by saying he was not facing felony charges, according to court records.Under Arkansas legal rules, judges must find reasonable cause that the defendant has committed a felony before revoking bail, according to Tadlock, who said “we had to have a finding by another court"" because the allegations occurred in another jurisdiction.Warren’s March 2 arrest stemmed from a December episode during which police said he assaulted Melendez and then fired a gunshot into her apartment. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and hasn't been charged thus far in the deaths of Melendez or Stewart.At Warren’s initial court appearance on March 3, prosecutors noted he posed an extreme risk to Melendez, The Columbian reported. The court set bail at $100,000 and ordered him to have no contact with her, but prosecutors did not request GPS monitoring in the event of his release.The Clark County Prosecutor's Office did not respond to emailed questions about the case.Warren was the last person seen with the mother and daughter before they disappeared, according to charging documents. On the night of March 11, a friend told police, she had been babysitting Stewart when Warren arrived to pick her up. Melendez was unresponsive in the car, naked from the waist down.The friend reported Melendez missing on March 18. Melendez’s mother also reported her missing, saying the family had not heard from her for a week. The next day, police arrested Warren again. With his bail in Arkansas revoked, and his bail in Washington increased to $1 million, he has been in custody since.",2023/03/25,,World

We can end TB!"" the theme of the World Health Organization’s campaign this year to stem the spread of the bacterial illness, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) made a case for early intervention. About 400 out of 6,000 cases reported annually die of the disease, wrote CNA.Years of prevention efforts have seen the incidence rate of TB in Taiwan drop from 73 cases per 100,000 in 2005, to 28 per 100,000 in 2022, down 62%, said the CDC.Wang Jann-yuan (王振源), head of the Taiwan Society of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, said around 5-10% of latent infections progress to the development of symptoms. Good ventilation, a healthy lifestyle, and cough etiquette are advised to keep the pathogen away.Those who have experienced chest pain, fever, loss of appetite, and coughing for two weeks or longer should seek medical help. An infected individual has to take medications for six to nine months to ensure the TB bacteria are killed.According to WHO, global efforts to end TB have saved 74 million lives since 2000. In 2021, 10.6 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died of it.",2023/03/24,1227,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845524,China threatens consequences over US warship's actions,"BANGKOK (AP) — China threatened “serious consequences” Friday after the United States Navy sailed a destroyer around the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea for the second day in a row, in a move Beijing claimed was a violation of its sovereignty and security.The warning comes amid growing tensions between China and the United States in the region, as Washington pushes back at Beijing's growingly assertive posture in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway it claims virtually in its entirety.On Thursday, after the U.S. sailed the USS Milius guided-missile destroyer near the Paracel Islands, China said its navy and air force had forced the American vessel away, a claim the U.S. military denied.The U.S. on Friday sailed the ship again in the vicinity of the islands, which are occupied by China but also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam, as part of what it called a “freedom of navigation operation"" challenging requirements from all three nations requiring either advance notification or permission before a military vessel sails by.“Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,” U.S. 7th Fleet spokesperson Lt. j.g. Luka Bakic said in an emailed statement.“The United States challenges excessive maritime claims around the world regardless of the identity of the claimant,” Bakic said.China's Ministry of National Defense responded by accusing the U.S. of “undermining the peace and stability of the South China Sea” with its actions.“The act of the U.S. military seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security, severely breached international laws, and is more ironclad evidence of the U.S. pursuing navigation hegemony and militarizing the South China Sea,” ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei said. “We solemnly request that the US. immediately stop such actions of provocation, otherwise it will bear the serious consequences of unexpected incidents caused by this.”He said China would take “all necessary measures” to ensure its security but did not elaborate.Like its statement on the Thursday incident, China again said it drove the American ship away from the islands, which are in the South China Sea a few hundred kilometers (miles) off the coast of Vietnam and the Chinese province of Hainan.Both sides said their actions were justified under international law.Bakic told The Associated Press that the ship “was not driven away” and “continued on to conduct routine maritime security operations in international waters” after concluding its mission near the Paracel Islands.“The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea for all nations,” he said. ""The United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, as Milius did today.”The U.S. has no South China Sea claims itself, but has deployed Naval and Air Force assets for decades to patrol the strategic waterway, through which around $5 trillion in global trade transits each year and which holds highly valuable fish stocks and undersea mineral resources.A United Nations-backed arbitration tribunal ruled in 2016 that the historical claim from China on the waters had no legal basis under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, and Washington maintains that freedom of navigation and overflight of the waterway are in the American national interest.U.S. forces currently operate daily in the South China Sea, and have been present for more than a century. China regularly responds angrily, accusing the U.S. of meddling in Asian affairs and impinging upon its sovereignty.China's claims have frequently brought it into conflict with other nations in the region as well. Filipino diplomats unleashed a slew of protests Friday over China's recent targeting of a Philippine coast guard ship with a powerful military laser and other aggressive behavior.___Find more AP Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific",2023/03/25,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845525,"World shares fall on banking turmoil, recession worries","BANGKOK (AP) — Shares fell Friday in Europe and Asia as worries flared over turmoil in the banking sector and potentially worsening risks of recession.European benchmarks sank as shares in Deutsche Bank plunged more than 10%. Reports said its shares fell because the company was facing higher costs for insuring itself against default. U.S. futures turned lower and oil prices fell more than $2.Investors are worried that more banks might suffer a debilitating exodus of customers following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. That turmoil is clouding the outlook for what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates after hiking them to market-rattling heights over the last year.The fear is that all the turmoil in the banking industry could cause a sharp pullback in lending to small and midsized businesses around the country. That could put more pressure on the economy, raising the risk for a recession that many economists already saw as likely.Germany's DAX lost 2.5% to 14,834.24 and the CAC 40 in Paris tumbled 2.5% to 6,965.01. Britain's FTSE 100 declined 2.1% to 7,245.65. The future for the S&P 500 was 0.9% lower while that for the Dow industrials lost 1.1%.Deutsche Bank's shares plunged 14% after an overnight surge in credit default swaps — a hedge against defaults for bond investors. Other European banks also lost ground. Commerzbank dropped 8.7%, Societe General skidded 7.7% and Credit Suisse, itself subject to a government-arranged buyout by UBS, dropped 8.6%. UBS gave up 8%.Regional banks' shares in Asia were modestly lower Friday, with HSBC Holdings plc losing 2.9% in Hong Kong while mid-sized Japanese bank Resona Holdings declined 2.6%.Shares in Japanese energy and electronics company Toshiba Corp. gained 4.2% after it announced late Thursday that it had accepted a $15 billion tender offer from a buyout fund made up of the nation’s major banks and companies. If regulators approve it, the proposed buyout by private equity firm Japan Industrial Partners would be a major step in troubled Toshiba’s yearslong turnaround effort, allowing it to go private.Japan reported that its inflation rate fell to 3.3% in February from 4.3% the month before, though core inflation excluding fresh food and energy costs rose to 3.5% from 3.2%. The data suggest persisting pressure on the Bank of Japan to adjust its below zero interest rate policy, though economists said they expect price pressures to abate in coming months.“Given the recent market turmoil surrounding the banking sector,” ING economists said, “the BOJ’s move will likely be well communicated with the market before it substantially changes its policy.”Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.1% to 27,385.25 and the Kospi in Seoul gave up 0.4% to 2,414.96. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.7% to 19,915.68 and the Shanghai Composite index sank 0.6% to 3,265.65.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.2% to 6,955.20. Shares fell in Mumbai but rose in Bangkok and Taiwan.On Thursday, the S&P 500 added 0.3% for its third gain in four days while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite held up better thanks to strength in technology shares, gaining 1%.Stocks fell sharply the day before after the Federal Reserve indicated that while the end may be near for its hikes to interest rates, it still doesn’t expect to cut rates this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also insisted the Fed could keep raising rates if inflation stays high.Stocks in the financial industry ended up being the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 despite rising in the morning. First Republic Bank fell 6% after giving up a gain of nearly 10%.In other trading Friday, U.S. benchmark crude oil dropped $3.09 to $66.87 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gave up 94 cents to $69.96 per barrel.Brent crude, the pricing basis for international oil, lost $3.08 to $72.42 per barrel.The U.S. dollar fell to 130.09 yen from 130.83 yen.

It’s interesting to learn that the market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 8.0% during the forecast period of 2022-2028, driven by increasing private car ownership, flourishing cab services, and favorable government policies. It’s also good to know that the growing adoption of InsurTech and digitization in the insurance sector, combined with partnerships between car companies and financial service providers, is expected to present lucrative growth opportunities to the market in the coming years.Download Free Sample of This Strategic Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR531Growing Financial Literacy in India Favoring Car Insurance Adoption in the CountryFor the past several decades, the lack of adequate resources to educate the public about the benefits of car insurance, or the companies that provide car insurance, and the types of policies available, have led to losses in the industry. However, with the increasing penetration of smartphones and easy access to information through Google, consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about financial jargons. These internet resources are used by the younger demographic to search and compare the best car insurance policies for their own benefit, which will drive the market growth in the forecast period.Increasing Adoption of Insurtech is Anticipated to Drive the India Car Insurance Market During the Forecast PeriodThe growing digitization and increasing adoption of Insurtech are providing lucrative growth opportunities to the India car insurance market. Insurance companies are implementing advanced technologies to increase consumers’ access to insurance policies. They are establishing partnerships with financial service providers to implement technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and blockchain into their operations. For instance, in November 2021, PhonePe and Liberty General Insurance announced a partnership to offer motor insurance digitally.India Car Insurance Market – By ApplicationBased on applications, the India car insurance market is grouped into commercial and personal segments. Personal car insurance accounts for the highest market share due to the requirement by law to have cars insured under the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. In addition to an increase in disposable income and private vehicle ownership, there is expected to be a boost in the personal car insurance segment over the next few years. However, the commercial segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate during the forecast period due to the emergence of cab services, such as Ola Cabs and Uber.Get a Request Sample Report: https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=MR531SegmentsBY TYPE-(COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE, THIRD PARTY FIRE & THEFT INSURANCE, THIRD PARTY ONLY), BY APPLICATION-(COMMERCIAL, PERSONAL),BY REGION-(NORTH INDIA, SOUTH INDIA, EAST INDIA, WEST INDIA)India Car Insurance Market – Regional InsightsGeographically, the India car insurance market is segmented into North India, South India, East India, and West India.

As a result of mobility restrictions and declining purchasing power of customers, sales of private and commercial cars dropped significantly. However, the market is anticipated to flourish in the post-COVID-19 period as the demand for private vehicles is anticipated to surge due to the preference of private transport over public transport due to safety and social distancing issues.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845624,US conducts Syria airstrikes after drone kills US contractor,"The US military carried out multiple airstrikes against facilities in Syria used by Iran-aligned forces on Thursday.The attack and the retaliation by the US have threatened to disrupt recent efforts in the region to de-escalate the situation.Earlier on Thursday, a drone suspected to be of Iranian origin struck a facility on a coalition base in Northeast Syria.A US contractor was killed, another employee was injured, and several US service members were left injured.The Pentagon said that, according to an intelligence assessment, the unmanned aerial vehicle was of Iranian origin.""The airstrikes were conducted in response to today's attack as well as a series of recent attacks against coalition forces in Syria by groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps,"" said US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.Syria and Iran have not yet reacted to the strikes which have come during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.Meanwhile, Qatar's state-run news agency reported a call between its Foreign Minister, Khalid Al Attiyah, and US national security advisor Jake Sullivan.Attiyah reportedly also spoke to the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian.Recently, Doha has been an interlocutor between Iran and the US over their tensions about Tehran's nuclear program.Social media videos on Friday showed explosions in Syria's Deir Ez-Zor, a strategic province, which borders Iraq and contains oil fields.Iranian-backed militia groups and Syrian forces control the area. In recent months, the region has been hit by suspected Israeli airstrikes that targeted Iranian supply routes.Iran's paramilitary has allegedly attacked the wider Middle East with bomb-carrying drones.Recently, Russia began using Iranian drones in its attacks across Ukraine.Iran has refused to take any responsibility for these attacks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845625,US charges crypto fugitive Do Kwon after Montenegro arrest,"The US District Court in Manhattan filed an eight-count fraud indictment against Do Kwon on Thursday following news of his arrest on an Interpol warrant in Montenegro.The indictment charges Kwon, a South Korean national who co-founded Terraform Labs and developed the TerraUSD and Luna cryptocurrencies, with two counts each of securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud and conspiracy.Terra and Luna were two paired cryptocurrencies whose value rose rapidly in 2021 and early 2022, only to collapse in May 2022, wiping out at least $40 billion (roughly €37 billion) in market capitalization.The criminal case follows civil charges already filed against Kwon and Terraform.Authorities in Montenegro said on Thursday that they had arrested a man they believed to be Kwon.He was arrested along with a second suspect trying to board a flight to Dubai at Podgorica airport. Police found forged Costa Rican and Belgian passports during the encounter.""The person is suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean national Do Kwon, a co-fonder and CEO of the Singapore-based Terraform Labs,"" Interior Minister Filip Adzic wrote on Twitter.On Friday, South Korean police said the individuals identity had been confirmed including by fingerprint match.""This has been shared with the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors' Office and Interpol in Montenegro,"" an official at the Korean National Police Agency said.South Korean prosecutors have also issued arrest warrants for five other people, in addition to Kwon – all linked to stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token Luna.While stablecoins are generally designed to have a stable price and pegged to a real-world commodity, TerraUSD was algorithmic, and used code to maintain its price at about one US dollar. Luna's value, meanwhile, was supposed to fluctuate.Investigators allege that Kwon misrepresented the stability of the currencies and the mechanism linking them.In May, the Terra/Luna system disintegrated with the collapse of Terraform Labs, and the price of both tokens took a nosedive to near zero. The fallout hit the wider crypto market, contributing to more than $500 billion in losses, though multiple other factors were likely in play.Most cryptocurrencies' values have fallen sharply in roughly the past 18 months. The best known and highest-priced, Bitcoin, for instance, peaked at a value of more than $60,000 in October 2021 and is now trading at less than half that sum.The industry has also faced increased scrutiny and pressure from regulators following a string of recent controversies, including the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange.FTX and its sister trading house Alameda Research went bankrupt late last year.The collapse of US cryptocurrency-focused banks Silvergate and Signature has put further downward pressure on the digital assets.msh/ar (AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/03/24,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845634,Ukraine using Soviet-era choppers to pummel Russia from afar,"DONETSK REGION, Ukraine (AP) — Skimming the treetops, three Soviet-era attack helicopters bank and swoop down on a field after an early-morning mission to the front lines in the fight against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Each day, they might fly three or four sorties, says the commander, whose two-crew Mi-24 helicopter, built about 40 years ago, is older than he is.“We are carrying out combat tasks to destroy enemy vehicles, enemy personnel, we are working with pitch-up attacks from a distance from where the enemy can’t get us with their air defense system,” said the commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity for operational security reasons, in line with military regulations.The conflict in Ukraine is largely an artillery war, with territory being fought for inch by inch under a barrage of shells and missiles. But Ukraine’s aviation capabilities play a significant role in the fight, the pilot said.“The importance of the helicopters is huge,” said the commander, who is part of Ukraine’s 12th Army Aviation Brigade.Footage from a camera attached to the helicopter during a recent combat mission shows it flying over fields pockmarked with craters from artillery bombing, and firing missiles at Russian trenches that cut through the landscape.“We are shooting from the big distance and hit the target clearly, like there’s a cross on the target and (the missiles) go by themselves where they should go,” the commander said.He would, however, like to fly a newer model.“We need to master something new, something from abroad,” the commander said. “It has better characteristics. You can maneuver more on it, there are more rockets on it and the weapons are more powerful. We can do more tasks with better quality and with less risk for us.”Several countries, including the United States and Britain, have pledged to send, or have already sent, helicopters to Ukraine as part of military aid since the start of the war sparked by Russia’s invasion in Feb 2022.___Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine: https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",2023/03/24,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845635,"Guilty of abetting abortion, Polish woman vows to fight on","BRUSSELS (AP) — The way Justyna Wydrzyńska sees it, Ania was a victim of domestic violence just like she was. Another child and she’d be trapped. It was 2020. The pandemic lockdowns. Everyone worried that Poland’s borders might close, halting travel and postal services.Looking to help someone she identified with, Wydrzyńska gave Ania the abortion pills she kept on hand for herself.“I just sent the pills, just shared them, because I thought it would be good for her to have this tool and decide whatever she wants (and can) leave without another kid and be able to get free from this violent relationship,” Wydrzyńska told The Associated Press in Brussels on Thursday.“I knew for myself, the moment when I got pregnant again, living with a violent partner, that if I got stuck with another child, I will never (escape) from this marriage,” she said, explaining why she first bought the tablets. “I really see the same story in our lives.”But Poland’s justice system sees the situation differently. Last week, a Warsaw court convicted Wydrzyńska of abetting abortion by providing Ania — the name used by Polish media to identify the domestic violence victim who already had one child — with abortion pills. Ania’s partner turned them both in.Abortion is illegal in almost all cases in Poland, a predominantly Catholic country with a deeply conservative government. Rare exceptions are granted when a woman’s life or health might be in danger, or if a pregnancy results from rape or incest.Ending a pregnancy due to congenital defects of the fetus was allowed until a top court ruled in 2020 that those grounds were unconstitutional.Some Polish women travel to countries like the Czech Republic, Germany and the Netherlands to obtain abortions. Others order pills from abroad to terminate their pregnancies. Possessing abortion pills, and taking them, is not outlawed, but providing the medication, or helping someone to obtain it, is a crime punishable by up to three years in prison.Wydrzyńska, a mother of three, co-founded the Abortion Dream Team in 2016. The grassroots organization provides Polish women with information and support, including how to acquire abortion pills. Human rights activists see her case as a precedent. They fear it will discourage others like her from helping women to terminate their pregnancies.“Justyna is the first activist to be convicted for providing abortion support. The Polish authorities’ prosecution against her is shameful,” said Eve Geddie, director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office.The Abortion Dream Team says official statistics claiming that 107 abortions were performed in Poland — a country of nearly 40 million people — in all of 2021 are laughable. The group says that each day it helps around 100 women get access to pills and another six or seven to travel abroad for abortions.Since the war started in Ukraine just over a year ago, millions of people have sought refuge in Poland. Allegations of sexual violence committed by Russian soldiers abound. The organization says it has assisted around 2,000 women who claimed to be Ukrainian.“We don’t ask questions,” said Natalia Broniarczyk, another Dream Team activist who was in Brussels with Wydrzyńska seeking financial support from the European Union.The next step for Wydrzyńska is to appeal. Instead of prison, she was sentenced to perform 30 hours of community service a month for 10 months. She says she’s received messages of solidarity from many women, including offers to serve the sentence in her place.It's unlikely her appeal will be heard soon. Poland is in campaign mode ahead of elections expected in the fall. Polls show the conservative Law and Justice party, which has governed the country since 2015, winning the most votes but falling short of a majority in parliament.Surveys also show that most Poles support more liberal abortion laws, and court restrictions on abortion rights triggered the largest street demonstrations in post-communist Poland. But the ruling party’s deeply conservative positions often play well with certain parts of the electorate.“The judge who convicted Justyna was irregularly appointed and given a promotion the very same day as she handed down the verdict. We have no doubt that Justyna’s prosecution was politically motivated,” Geddie said.The hearings were wearing and unpredictable, Wydrzyńska said. Well after the trial started, prosecutors introduced as new evidence a video of remarks she made to the Polish parliament about abortion.“I feel very tired, because it demands a lot of strength to face this jurisdiction system … but in the same time I’m so angry,” she said, speaking in English. “It is the situation when you play with somebody with cards and his cards are marked somehow. I feel like I was cheated.”Ania had to testify in court. Wydrzyńska says she is proud of her for taking the stand.“She was so brave, really, and she was so honest,” Wydrzyńska said. “It showed that our work is so important, and it was the moment I realized that ... even if I receive a jail sentence, we have to do it, no matter what.”One day she would like to meet Ania, this woman she identifies with so well. “I hope there will be a moment soon where we have this opportunity to sit in a quiet place and (share) our own stories,” Wydrzyńska said.___Vanessa Gera in Warsaw contributed.",2023/03/24,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845637,Legislators take aim at migrant workers wiring money home illegally,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Migrant workers wire NT$50 billion ($1.64 billion) per year home from Taiwan through illegal means, often falling victim to scams and threatening the financial order, lawmakers said Friday (March 24).The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the Ministry of Labor needed to highlight the proper financial channels for migrant workers to send their earnings home, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers said at a news conference Friday. The authorities should also tighten their supervision of the use of digital and online platforms for illegal schemes, the Liberty Times reported.The Central Bank said more than half of foreign workers allowed brokers to handle financial transactions for them, underlining the importance of dissuading brokers from using illegal channels. Legal procedures for transferring money out of the country required between two and three days, so if a broker was advertising he could do it in one day, he was probably moving the funds via illegal channels, bank officials said.According to government data, 256,000 Vietnamese workers wired $117,000 home during 2022, but 250,000 Indonesian workers remitted $1.74 billion. The lawmakers concluded from those figures the migrants used illegal agencies to wire home NT$50 billion per year, per the Liberty Times.Lawmakers suggested migrant workers were unable to discern legal from illegal services due to the language barrier, while the operators of the underground schemes offered better exchange rates and lower handling fees. The operators would use compatriots to attract the migrant workers, and send them to the factory dormitories to collect the cash on payday and wire it directly into accounts in Vietnam.",2023/03/24,1930,New Immigrants

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845653,U.S. aims for over $7 billion in aid for 20-year Pacific islands compacts,"WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration is seeking more than $7 billion over the next two decades for economic assistance to three Pacific island countries, a State Department official said on Thursday, funds seen as key to insulating the U.S. allies from growing Chinese government influence.Washington said earlier this year it had reached consensus with the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) on terms of U.S. economic assistance in talks to renew Compacts of Free Association, or COFAs, but had not provided details.Under those pacts, first agreed in the 1980s, the United States retains responsibility for the islands' defense and exclusive access to huge swaths of the Pacific. Current COFA provisions expire in 2024 for Palau, and later in 2023 for the Marshall Islands and the FSM.Jane Bocklage, a senior State Department official involved in COFA talks, told a congressional hearing the Biden administration's fiscal year 2024 budget request included $7.1 billion over 20 years for extended COFA deals. That included $6.5 billion in direct economic assistance and $634 million for the unfunded costs of extending the U.S. Postal Service in the three island countries, she said.""We are working very, very hard with all three countries to complete the final negotiations. We are aiming for weeks, not months,"" Bocklage added.""Absent the new economic assistance provisions, we really leave the three countries open to predatory behavior, coercive behavior,"" she said, alluding to China's efforts to court Pacific island countries.The three countries have complained that assistance has not kept pace with U.S. obligations, and though they still enjoy close ties to Washington, critics warn that a failure to reach new terms could spur them to look to China for funding or increased trade and tourism.U.S. basing and military access rights are not subject to the negotiations, but experts say as sovereign nations the three countries could always terminate those agreements should they be dissatisfied with U.S. support.",2023/03/24,148,World

And we have also advanced our practical cooperation and our mutual trust,"" added Sun, who is on a three-day visit to Manila.Beijing, which claims large parts of the South China Sea, including some areas in Philippine waters, has expressed concern over an increasing U.S. military presence in its neighbour, accusing Washington of increasing regional tensions.Last month, Marcos granted the United States expanded access to military bases, amid China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and towards self-ruled Taiwan.The agreement has been seen as a sign of a rekindling of ties between Manila and its former colonial master, which soured under his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte.Marcos, the son of the late strongman whom Washington helped flee into exile during a 1986 ""people power"" uprising, has repeatedly said he could not see a future for his country without the United States.Last month, the Philippines accused China's coast guard of using a laser against one of its vessels supporting a resupply mission for troops in the disputed Spratly islands. Marcos later summoned the Chinese ambassador to relay his concern over the intensity and frequency of China's activities in the area.Maritime differences with Beijing were a ""serious concern"" but could be resolved through the ""exhaustion of all diplomatic means"", Lazaro said.",2023/03/24,173,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4845676,Malaysia Healthcare Offers Advanced Orthopaedic Treatments,"Employing top-notch medical technology and expertise, Malaysia provides orthopaedic care for optimal recovery.
KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA -  Media OutReach - 24 March 2023 - Keeping pace with the current demands and trends in the healthcare industry, Malaysia Healthcare offers innovative solutions to patients with advanced orthopaedic treatments, employing top-notch medical technology and expertise.            Over the past 20 years, the orthopaedic industry has undergone significant global advancements, some of which include the use of robotics for less invasive procedures and reproducible precision, which shorten hospital stays and expedite recovery. Surgical procedure improvement solutions, such as motion preservation techniques, minimally invasive surgeries, tissue-guided surgeries and cementless joint replacements are a few of the advancements that have evolved over time to promote speedier recovery[1].   The advancement of the industry is shaped by the demand for personalised treatments and implants, as well as advancements that can expedite procedures, improve efficiency and outcomes, and facilitate the recovery and comfort of the patient are currently influencing the orthopaedic field to ensure a better patient experience.   In its commitment to offering world-class healthcare, most of Malaysia's healthcare professionals are trained internationally, and its hospitals are equipped with the latest, cutting-edge medical facilities and equipment, ensuring that patients receive the best health treatments and services.   Robotic-assisted surgery, according to Dato' Dr. Lee Keat Hwa, a Consultant Orthopaedic & Arthroplasty Surgeon at Island Hospital, combines robotics and artificial intelligence. Surgeons carefully examine patients' radiographs to record the anatomy of the relevant body part. The robots will then analyse the data and help determine the best implantation method from there. ""The robots are intelligent, as they assist with accurate data. Thus, we as surgeons do not have to open a big wound when performing major surgeries on patients. Instead, we can make smaller, more precise incisions. As a result, robotic-assisted surgeries have a potential to be more successful and faster than conventional orthopaedic surgery,"" she added.   In the Asian population, knee arthritis is a common arthritis. As a result, we are likely to see more knee replacements than hip replacements. ""I perform a lot of fast-track knee replacements, which allow patients to walk almost immediately after surgery. Typically, patients are operated on in the morning and can walk the same day,"" said Dato' Dr. Siva Kumar Ariaretnam, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Subang Jaya Medical Centre.   The benefit of this is that patients have a lower risk of complications like Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), which are severe blood clots in the leg. ""Many patients, including those from abroad, would undoubtedly want to keep their hospital stays to a minimum while also recovering as quickly as possible. Therefore, I have also created techniques for wound closure that do not require the patient to return to the hospital for the removal of the stitches,"" explained Dato' Dr. Siva.   According to Dr. Prashant Narhari, Consultant Orthopaedic, Traumatologist & Orthopaedic Oncologist at Penang Adventist Hospital, bailout is another treatment aspect that orthopaedic surgeons undertake. ""Basically, we reconstruct the limb after doing a large resection to remove a sizeable piece of the tumour from it. This is also done for severe fractures that develop in elderly people. When using a plate to treat the fracture is not an option, we will remove the broken pieces and apply an implant in their place. The patient can walk the day following surgery since we are employing an implant,"" he said.   Conceived over 10 years ago, Malaysia Healthcare is the backbone that ensures the delivery of seamless end-to-end patient care. Led by the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC), which is under the auspices of the Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia, it brings together the nation's dual heritage of medical innovation and hospitality to provide healthcare travellers with a memorable experience from the moment they begin their enquiries until the time they head back home.
