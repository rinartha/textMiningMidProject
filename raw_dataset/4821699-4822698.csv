https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821700,What does Moscow want with Moldova?,"It was a remarkable gesture by Joe Biden. The US president asked his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu to attend a meeting with representatives of the nine central and southeastern European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) in Warsaw on February 21, even though her country is not yet even seeking membership.During a speech, Biden addressed Sandu directly: ""I am proud to stand with you and the freedom-loving Moldovan people,"" he said. ""Give her a round of applause.""His actions underscore a serious situation. Wedged between Ukraine and northwestern Romania, the Republic of Moldova has long feared Russian aggression, with military threats from Moscow taking on an increasingly belligerent tone lately.Earlier in the week, Russian President Vladimir Putin annulled a 2012 decree in which the Kremlin had guaranteed Moldova's sovereignty. Shortly before that, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had warned that Russia was trying to force out Moldova's pro-European leadership. Moscow responded on February 23 that it was actually Ukraine that was planning a military intervention in Moldova.What is all this saber-rattling about? Why has tiny Moldova, with its population of just 3.5 million, become a topic of increasing interest as the war next door rages on?Moldova was the first country after the collapse of the Soviet Union in which Russia supported separatists, provoking a bloody war that lasted for several months in 1992. The result was a frozen conflict, with pro-Moscow forces ruling Transnistria, a narrow strip of land in the east of Moldova that is home to many Russian speakers, for more than three decades. About 2,000 Russian soldiers are still stationed there, despite the fact that Moscow guaranteed a withdrawal of its troops from the area in 1999. The largest arms depot in Europe, containing some 20,000 tons of ammunition and military equipment, is also located near the Transnistrian village of Cobasna.Since Russia invaded Ukraine one year ago, Transnistria has become more strategically important than ever before. Not only could Russia open a western front in Ukraine from there, but it could also foment domestic chaos in Moldova, creating a crisis on NATO's southeastern external border.The separatist forces in Transnistria would likely have an interest in such a scenario. In recent decades, they have financed themselves, among other things, with massive smuggling operations that also ran through Ukrainian territory. Since the beginning of the war, however, Ukraine has sealed off the border with Transnistria, which now faces economic collapse.Sandu and her pro-European government took a cautious stance of solidarity with Ukraine after the war began, with an eye toward avoiding confrontation with Moscow. But the EU candidate country has sought closer ties to the West since the fall, when Moscow continued to cut gas supplies to Moldova and supported opposition parties in their attempts to destabilize the domestic political situation.Moldova has therefore begun sourcing its energy supply from countries other than Russia at a rapid pace. There is now also open discussion about whether to change the its neutrality status, which is enshrined in the constitution. An upgrade to the virtually unarmed Moldovan military, which received its first Piranha armored vehicles from Germany a few weeks ago, is also on the table.At present, the country could hardly defend itself even against the separatists in Transnistria, who probably have dozens of battle tanks and other heavy military equipment, along with the large stocks of ammunition. Ukraine has therefore offered to provide military assistance if Moscow and the separatists provoke a conflict. But any suggestion that Ukraine is planning a military intervention in Moldova is absurd and at best a pretext for the Kremlin to justify its belligerence. Ukraine can certainly do without committing its military resources to a second front.One thing that Russian President Vladimir Putin has achieved in the region is forcing Moldova to decisively break free of Moscow's stranglehold after three decades of ambivalence. The shift has garnered support beyond symbolic gestures like the one made by Biden in Warsaw: Romania, colloquially known as Moldova's ""big brother,” already shares language, culture and a long common history with its small neighbor, and has been offering increasing levels of support in achieving economic independence from Russia.This article originally appeared in German.",2023/02/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821701,Philippines marks 1986 revolt with dictator's son as leader,"Hundreds of Filipinos took to the streets on Saturday to mark the 37th anniversary of a revolution that overthrew Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos in February 1986.Marcos plunged the country into martial law between 1972 and 1981 and his administration was accused of rounding up thousands of political opponents.The turbulent period prompted a ""people power"" revolution that ultimately overthrew the dictator and sent him and his family into exile in the US.Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son of the late dictator, won elections by a landslide last year. He was 28 at the time his family was forced out of the country.Political dynasties dominate the Philippinesand the Marcos family, following their return to the country in the 1990s, remained a powerful force in local politics.Around 1,400 pro-democracy activists took to the main EDSA highway in capital Manila, where more than a million people had converged in 1986 to protest against Ferdinand Marcos's rule.Demonstrators on Saturday carried signs like ""Never Forget,"" while other activists rallied at a separate pro-democracy monument nearby.Faced with the awkward situation of protests, Marcos Jr. issued a statement to Facebook calling for reconciliation. He didn't call the event a democratic milestone, as his predecessors had done.""I once again offer my hand of reconciliation to those with different political persuasions to come together as one in forging a better society —  one that will pursue progress and peace and a better life for all Filipinos,"" Marcos Jr said in a two-paragraph statement posted to Facebook.Marcos Jr. said he was one with the nation ""in remembering those times of tribulations and how we came out of them united and stronger as a nation.""The elder Marcos died in 1989, and the family has denied siphoning off billions of dollars of state wealth during the dictatorship.rm/rc (Reuters, AP)",2023/02/25,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821702,Met Opera marks 1st year of Ukraine war with concert,"NEW YORK (AP) — Emily D'Angelo made her point with attire before singing a single note at the Metropolitan Opera’s concert to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

            The 28-year-old Canadian mezzo-soprano walked onto the stage Friday night for the Mozart Requiem wearing a dark skirt covered with white tally marks, like on a school chalkboard: four vertical slashes and a diagonal to close out each set of five. There were 365 in all on the outfit created by Berlin designer Esther Perbandt, one to mark each day of Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II.

            “Although an opera house doesn’t have the offensive capacity of an Abrams tank or an F-16 jet, the Metropolitan Opera is proud to be a powerful cultural resource for Ukraine, helping to lead the fight for artistic liberty against (Vladimir) Putin’s cultural propaganda machine,” Met general manager Peter Gelb told an intermission group that included U.N. Ambassadors Sergiy Kyslytsya of Ukraine and Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the U.S. “We demonstrate the free world’s ongoing cultural resolve to defend Ukraine’s liberty in the face of brutal oppression.”











            Met music director Yannick Nézet-Séguin conducted what was titled “For Ukraine: A Concert of Remembrance and Hope,” that also featured Ukrainian tenor Dmytro Popov and bass-baritone Vladyslav Buialskyi and South African soprano Golda Schultz. With the Metropolitan Opera House bathed in the yellow and blue colors on Ukraine’s flag, and an actual flag hung above the stage, they opened with Ukraine’s anthem, followed with the Mozart Requiem and Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 and ended with Valentin Silvestrov’ hymn “Prayer for Ukraine.”

            “The Metropolitan Opera,” Kyslytsya said, “adopted Ukrainian culture, adopted me, adopted my mission.”

            Ukraine First Lady Olena Zelenska addressed the crowd at the start of the evening in a prerecorded video speech.

            “You have proven that art can help and save, literally,"" she said. “I hope that it is on this stage that we will soon be able to celebrate the victory of humanity, of art, of Ukraine, and it will be our common victory.""

            The Ukrainian singers wrapped themselves in flags during the curtain calls. Tickets were priced at $50, with the Met saying it held the amount lower than its usual prices in the hope audience members would donate large amounts to supporting Ukraine’s war effort.

            Gelb dropped Russian artists who refused to distance themselves from Putin from the Met’s roster, most famously star soprano Anna Netrebko.

            “It’s a small price to pay,” he said. “To be on the side of right was what’s important. I wouldn’t be able to look at myself in the mirror and have known Putin supporters performing on our stage.”

            Russian bass Ildar Abdrazakov, who withdrew from a new production of Verdi’s “La Forza del Destino” at the Met next season, was quoted recently as saying artists should remain neutral.

            “My response is they chose a side and they chose the wrong side,” Gelb said. “I feel sorry that he like many other Russians are so misinformed and don’t really understand what’s going on in the world.”

            The Met has hired four interns from Ukraine and Gelb plans to add Ukrainian composers to the Met’s commissioning program. His wife, Canadian-Ukrainian conductor Keri-Lynn Wilson, will again lead a summer tour of the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra. She was back in New York after conducting a Verdi Requiem and Ukrainian composer Viktoriia Poliova’s “Bucha. Lacrimosa” at the Lviv National Opera on Tuesday to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of Russia’s invasion.

            “I felt that I had to go and experience this myself and show Putin that he cannot kill culture, he cannot kill the soul of Ukraine,” Wilson said. “We had to hide in a bomb shelter for the first rehearsal. For the dress rehearsal we were delayed two hours in a bomb shelter. But I didn’t feel any fear -- there was no fear. There was this determination to somehow get through this concert, and it went on beautifully.

            ""The power stayed on. And there soldiers in the audience, young boys, they were in the first two rows. And when I went to make my bow and people were applauding me, I begun applauding the soldiers. And we all applauded the soldiers. And that’s what the power of music does.”NEW YORK (AP) — Emily D'Angelo made her point with attire before singing a single note at the Metropolitan Opera’s concert to mark the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The 28-year-old Canadian mezzo-soprano walked onto the stage Friday night for the Mozart Requiem wearing a dark skirt covered with white tally marks, like on a school chalkboard: four vertical slashes and a diagonal to close out each set of five.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821708,NYC mayor's brother set to leave his City Hall security job,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York Mayor Eric Adams' brother is leaving his volunteer post as a mayoral security adviser, a position he took after controversy over initial plans to hire him in a high-paid city job. 

            In an interview that aired Friday, Bernard Adams told PIX11 News that he'll wrap up at City Hall next week. The mayor then publicly thanked his brother for his role in the Adams administration, now a little over a year old.

            “When it comes to protecting my life, there was no one I trusted more than my baby brother,” the mayor said in a statement tweeted by a spokesperson. 











            Both brothers are retired New York Police Department officers. Bernard Adams went on to work as a parking administrator at a Virginia university as his brother, a Democrat, went into New York politics. He won a state senate seat, the Brooklyn borough presidency and then the 2021 mayor's race. 

            Days after being sworn in, Eric Adams appointed his brother as a deputy police commissioner, a move that stirred questions about how much authority the NYPD's then-new commissioner would have. Next, the mayor proposed making his brother the $210,000-a-year head of the mayoral security detail, a team staffed by police officers and housed under the NYPD. 

            City law bars public servants from using their position to obtain “any financial gain, contract, license, privilege or other private or personal advantage, direct or indirect” for themselves or an associated person, including a sibling. But the city Conflicts of Interest Board can issue waivers. 

            While seeking such a waiver, Adams' administration decided instead to have Bernard Adams serve as a senior security adviser for $1 a year. Prior mayors also have appointed relatives to volunteer posts. 

            At the time, Eric Adams said that bringing his brother into his administration “was never about the money” but about having a trusted hand with security. 

            Bernard Adams told PIX11 News he helped put together a strong security team for his brother and now plans to enjoy more time with his family.

            He said leaving City Hall is “definitely bittersweet because I love him, but I'll still call him, big bro, when I need to talk to him.”NEW YORK (AP) — New York Mayor Eric Adams' brother is leaving his volunteer post as a mayoral security adviser, a position he took after controversy over initial plans to hire him in a high-paid city job.In an interview that aired Friday, Bernard Adams told PIX11 News that he'll wrap up at City Hall next week.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821711,Ireland holds off competitive Italy 34-20 in Rome,"ROME (AP) — Ireland had just enough firepower to suppress Italy and win an entertaining Six Nations rugby contest 34-20 at Stadio Olimpico on Saturday.

            The Irish notched a third win from three matches in the Six Nations for the first time since 2018, when the team last won the title with a Grand Slam.

            Ireland nailed a bonus-point fourth try after 35 minutes but couldn't be certain of victory against the determined Italians until the 71st minute when the visiting side scored a fifth and last try.











            “At a certain point, we weren't sure we'd be able to bring home the win,” Ireland coach Andy Farrell said. “I was told I was shown on TV several times while I was biting my nails. Well, I won't hide the fact there was some nervousness.”

            After beating defending champion France in the previous round, Farrell expected his seven team changes to make a seamless transition. After all, Farrell's Ireland has averaged 41-point wins against Italy.

            But the 14-point difference on Saturday was a good measure of Italy's growing skill set and self-belief over the past year. Italy threatened to shock France at home in the opening round but not the Irish, whom it struck two tries against and pushed all the way.

            Italy's fitness in past years faded in the last quarter but these Azzurri were still firing shots to the end in another immensely respectable effort.

            “We're not stepping on the field against Ireland, the best team in the world, thinking its OK to lose by a few points,” Italy captain Michele Lamaro said. ""We want to smash them and win, that's our mindset.

            “Unfortunately, you can't with only heart. But when you put your heart completely into what you do, you manage to deeply impress observers on the outside, and this is very important.”

            The Irish got the job done with maximum points and take their title bid to Scotland in two weeks.

            “We had to sweat the result because Italy is now a team that never gives up, with a very strong character,” Farrell said. “We had to play to our full potential, also bringing out all our character, to get over it. I congratulate my boys, it wasn't easy.” 

            Ireland started ominously in getting over the tryline after 84 seconds, but wing James Lowe knocked on. Moments later, he turned provider to send caretaker captain James Ryan charging across.

            Italy worked side to side and No. 8 Lorenzo Cannone's break was finished by scrumhalf Stephen Varney. Paolo Garbisi's conversion put them in front.

            Another Cannone surge was turned over by Ireland's Andrew Porter, and the visitors ended up scoring when fullback Hugo Keenan slipped two tackles to reach the posts.

            When Lowe intercepted Garbisi and fed Aki to dot down, Ireland led 19-10 after a breathless first quarter.

            Italy was full of non-stop ambition but it was being outsmarted by the quicker-thinking Irish at the breakdown.

            Ireland notched the bonus-point fourth try in the 35th from a tapped penalty that narrowed Italy's defense too easily for wing Mack Hansen to score out wide.

            Ireland looked set to finish the half scoring again, but Italy wing Pierre Bruno read the move well, intercepted Aki, and sprinted 65 meters up the middle to the posts.

            The visitors deserved to lead 24-17 at the break and Italy deserved to be right on their tail. The crowd was ecstatic.

            Italy's defense tightened up in the second half, and a penalty against Porter was slotted by Garbisi to narrow the gap to four.

            An Aki try was ruled out by a knock on, and a Ross Byrne penalty restored a seven-point lead.

            But Ireland's energy lifted when Caelan Doris moved back to No. 8 and reinforcements arrived in the shape of wise men Conor Murray and Peter O'Mahony. Between them, they freed Hansen to race between the posts and let Ireland finally breathe.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821712,Arsenal beats Leicester 1-0 to stay top of EPL,"LEICESTER, England (AP) — Arsenal maintained its place atop the English Premier League by beating Leicester 1-0 thanks to Gabriel Martinelli’s goal early in the second half on Saturday.

            Leandro Trossard, who had a first-half goal disallowed, slipped a pass through to Martinelli and the Brazil winger cut in from the left to poke a low finish just inside the far post in the 46th minute.

            That ensured Arsenal will end the day where it began — in first place — with second-placed Manchester City behind by five points going into its match at Bournemouth later Saturday.











            Arsenal has bounced back well from a three-game run where the team picked up one point to raise doubts about its title pedigree. Last week, the Gunners twice came from behind to beat Aston Villa 4-2 away and has won again in the Midlands.

            Arsenal was hardly troubled at King Power Stadium despite being without holding midfielder Thomas Partey again, although the Ghana international did make it off the bench for the final few minutes after a muscle injury.

            Trossard, who started up front in place of Eddie Nketiah, thought he gave Arsenal the lead in the 26th when he curled a shot into the top corner from the edge of the area following Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward’s weak punch clear. The goal was ruled out, however. Replays showed Arsenal defender Ben White was holding onto Ward’s right arm at the time of his punch.

            Bukayo Saka also had a goal disallowed in the second half, with Martinelli adjudged offside in the buildup.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821715,Gracia starts reign in style as Leeds beat Southampton 1-0,"LEEDS, England (AP) — Junior Firpo scored the only goal as new manager Javi Gracia launched his Leeds reign in style with a win over fellow struggler Southampton in the English Premier League on Saturday.

            The Elland Road club's first win since Dec. 26 enabled the team to climb out of the bottom three and left Southampton rooted to last place.

            Scoring chances were few and far between until Firpo provided the breakthrough in the 77th minute when he shot low under Southampton goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu to claim his first league goal.











            Leeds midfielders Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie and Brenden Aaronson became the first trio of Americans to start together for a club in the league since Fulham goalkeeper Kasey Keller, midfielder Clint Dempsey and striker Brian McBride at Portsmouth in May 2008. 

            They were the first outfield players to do it since Dempsey, McBride and defender Carlos Bocanegra for Fulham at Middlesbrough in May 2007.

(AP) — Three teenage boys were wounded when gunfire erupted after a funeral reception for a 15-year-old who was fatally stabbed at his St. Paul high school earlier this month, authorities say. 

            The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that none of the wounded teens' injuries are considered life threatening. 

            St. Paul Police Sgt.

The Harding High School student was killed on Feb. 10, and a 16-year-old is charged with murder. 











            After the shooting, the sedan crashed less than half a mile away from the recreation center, and two people fled. Ernster said police apprehended a 16-year-old who was running from the area armed with a modified handgun.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821717,Brandt scores with back to send Dortmund top in Bundesliga,"BERLIN (AP) — Julian Brandt scored with his back and Borussia Dortmund held on to move to the top of the Bundesliga after beating Hoffenheim 1-0 on Saturday.

            It was Dortmund’s ninth win from nine games across all competitions this year and enough for the team to move three points clear of 10-time defending champion Bayern Munich and surprise challenger Union Berlin.

            Bayern, which has seen its four-point lead disappear since the winter break, hosts Union on Sunday.











            Brandt scored for the fourth consecutive league game for Dortmund. Marco Reus whipped in a free kick and Brandt bent forward so the ball skimmed in off his back shortly before the break. 

            “Things are working out for us at the moment,” Brandt said. “A little bit of luck is part of it. We're efficient. Today we were a little less efficient then we've been over the past few weeks, when we played very well. We have many guys in great form and, as we saw in the last few weeks, others who've come in and scored very important goals for us. A lot is coming together.”

            Marius Wolf thought he’d made it 2-0 with a powerful strike inside the near post, but the goal was chalked off for an apparent foul by Nico Schlotterbeck on Ihlas Bebou.

            Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel denied Andrej Kramaric from the resulting free kick but Hoffenheim kept up its pressure to the end.

            “In the past we often lost such games, so from that point of view it’s a positive development,” Brandt said. “Nevertheless, it’s a very, very, very strong moment, what we’ve delivered in the past few weeks. And we have to keep going.” 

            It was American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo's third consecutive defeat since taking over at Hoffenheim.

            SCHALKE AND HERTHA CELEBRATE

            Schalke and Hertha Berlin enjoyed morale-boosting victories in their battles against relegation.

            Last-placed Schalke defeated Stuttgart 2-1 at home for its first win since November and third of the season.

            Dominick Drexler got the home team off the mark in the 10th and Marius Bülter produced a wonderful finish for the second goal.

            Borna Sosa capitalized on a mistake from goalkeeper Ralf Fährmann to pull one back midway through the second half, but Schalke managed to survive a nervy finish. The Gelsenkirchen-based team drew its previous four games, all 0-0.

            Hertha climbed out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Augsburg in snowy conditions in the capital.

            Florian Niederlechner started against his former team for Hertha, which reportedly had to pay Augsburg more money for the privilege following his winter transfer between the clubs.

            Marco Richter broke the deadlock with a shot from distance in the 61st, and nine minutes later Dodi Lukebakio sealed what was only Hertha’s fifth win of the season.

            Also, Leipzig held on to beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1, Cologne lost at home to Wolfsburg 2-0, and Werder Bremen enjoyed a 3-0 win over Bochum.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821718,Mexico regrets Peru's decision to withdraw ambassador,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico said Saturday it regretted the decision by Peruvian President Dina Boluarte to withdraw her country’s ambassador in response to criticism from Mexican President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador.

            Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said in a statement that Mexico “will keep open diplomatic channels of communication to benefit both societies, and also expresses hope that a democratic agreement can be reached soon to resolve the differences in our fellow Latin American country.”

            In his regular morning press briefing Friday, Mexico’s president said he had seen polls “where the spurious president (Boluarte) has 15% acceptance and 85% disapprove of her.” 











            He also said that members of Peru’s Parliament have even less approval. “They have 90% of the rejection and even so they rule with bayonets and with repression, force.” 

            Later Friday, Boluarte rejected López Obrador’s comments “on the internal affairs of Peru and the unacceptable questions that he repeatedly formulates about the constitutional and democratic origin of my government.”

            She reproached López Obrador for hurting ties in order to “privilege ideological affinities.” While the Mexican president's domestic policies and relations with the United States are not particularly leftist, he was made a point of supporting leftist regimes like Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

            While López Obrador has slammed the killing of protesters in Peru, he has been criticized for saying little about the hundreds of Nicaraguans killed or exiled by the government of President Daniel Ortega.

            With the ambassador’s withdrawal, diplomatic relations between Peru and Mexico “formally remain at the level of charge d’affaires,” the president said in a statement at the presidential palace in Lima.

            Dina Boluarte took office on Dec. 7 after then-president Pedro Castillo was ousted by Parliament and jailed after trying to dissolve Congress to avoid a vote on his removal from office. 

            Since then, there have been almost three months of protests that have left 60 dead, 48 of them due to direct clashes with the police. One policeman was burned to death in a patrol car.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821730,Macron defends contested pension plan at French farm fair,"PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron sought to defend his unpopular pension plan Saturday in an effort to show he hears concerns of farmers and other ordinary citizens at France's biggest farm fair. 

            The pension changes meant to raise the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64, amid other measures, were among recurrent topics during the visit at the Paris Agricultural Fair, where Macron was scheduled to spend all day. 

            “I came here to support our farmers who are working hard, who have small pensions that we have substantially improved,” Macron said. 











            A few activists briefly shouted “no to the pension plan” after he had just inaugurated the event early Saturday, brandishing cardboard posters written “64 years, it’s dead” and “metro, work, tomb.” 

            Macron has vowed to go ahead with the reform despite a series of strikes and protests in the country. 

            “That reform is important because it will enable us to save” state pensions that all workers receive, “a French treasure,” Macron insisted. The system is projected to dive into deficit in the coming decade. 

            “We cannot decrease workers’ purchasing power, we cannot decrease our retirees’ pensions, therefore there is only one solution: working more,” Macron argued. 

            Christian Asna, a cattle raiser in southwestern France, urged Macron to deliver on his promise to raise farmers’ minimum pension as part of the changes, now being discussed at parliament. 

            Macron ""promised to remove the farming special pension scheme"" so that farmers can benefit from the more generous mainstream workers' scheme, Asna explained. ""Now, farmers retire with less than 700 euros ($740) per month, and he promised us minimum 1,200 euros ($1,268) per month,” he added. 

            To a woman criticizing the government's pension plan as contrary to social progress, Macron answered: “Social progress is not letting farmers retire with (almost) no pension.”

            Later Saturday, a man could be heard shouting “we want a wealth tax to pay for pensions” instead of raising the retirement age. Macron appeared to disregard the call. 

            Macron met for hours with beef, pork, milk producers, vintners and others in efforts to show he is paying attention to their daily concerns. He faced a few heated discussions and punctual boos — yet he was mostly welcomed with respect, sometimes applause and thank-you's. 

            The Paris Agricultural Fair, one of the world's largest farm fairs, is a popular event drawing crowds every year. 

            Amid other areas of concern, several farmers raised their fears that a potential European trade deal with the South American bloc Mercosur would bring unfair competition to their own products. 

            Macron insisted that he would keep opposing such a deal as long as South American producers don’t respect the same environment and health standards as Europeans.

            Macron also promised a plan to be better prepared for drought and to use water with caution, as some regions of France are already facing restrictions following several weeks with no significant rainfall. Last summer, France suffered its most severe drought ever recorded.

            In reply to an activist who abruptly asked him what he’s doing about the climate, Macron answered: ""I’m trying to move forward, to make useful things.”PARIS (AP) — President Emmanuel Macron sought to defend his unpopular pension plan Saturday in an effort to show he hears concerns of farmers and other ordinary citizens at France's biggest farm fair.The pension changes meant to raise the minimum retirement age from 62 to 64, amid other measures, were among recurrent topics during the visit at the Paris Agricultural Fair, where Macron was scheduled to spend all day.“I came here to support our farmers who are working hard, who have small pensions that we have substantially improved,” Macron said.A few activists briefly shouted “no to the pension plan” after he had just inaugurated the event early Saturday, brandishing cardboard posters written “64 years, it’s dead” and “metro, work, tomb.”Macron has vowed to go ahead with the reform despite a series of strikes and protests in the country.“That reform is important because it will enable us to save” state pensions that all workers receive, “a French treasure,” Macron insisted.

            Jared Smith-Bracy, 21, is charged with four counts of capital murder in the deaths Wednesday night in Daphne. He met briefly with his two court-appointed attorneys before the Friday bond hearing, and they entered a plea of not guilty by reason of mental disease or mental defect on his behalf, WKRG-TV reported. 

            Baldwin County Chief Assistant District Attorney Teresa Heinz asked for no bond, and the judge granted that request. But the judge said that could change as the investigation continues, the television station reported.











            Police have said Smith-Bracy fatally shot his 72-year-old grandmother, Barbara Smith; his 27-year-old brother, Jeremy Smith; and 71-year-old family friend, Sheila Glover, whose bodies were found in the backyard of his grandparents' home. He then used a pickaxe to beat his 80-year-old grandfather, Lenard Smith, to death inside a bedroom in the house, police said, according to WPMI-TV.

            Smith-Bracy lived with his grandparents, who called police Wednesday morning because he had broken a door, WPMI-TV reported. He was charged with criminal mischief and got a ride home from a friend around 5 p.m. that day after bonding out of jail, police said. He then grabbed the friend's handgun and began firing after forcing his way into the home, Daphne police Sgt. Jason Vannoy said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821732,NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Fontana postponed by rain,"FONTANA, Calif. (AP) — NASCAR postponed the Xfinity Series race at Fontana to Sunday night because of steady rain at Auto Club Speedway on Saturday.

            Practice and qualifying sessions for both weekend races at Fontana had already been canceled because of consistent, heavy rain from an extraordinary Southern California storm.

            The Xfinity drivers still went through their introductions, got into their cars and took pace laps during a short break in the weather, but rain began to fall again during the warmup. Track officials used jet driers in an attempt to improve the surface, but the task quickly became impossible.











            Drivers laughed when they saw their breath freeze while they took their pace laps, and they audibly worried about the steadily increasing rain until NASCAR red-flagged them shortly before the start. The cars were parked in pit lane under their rain covers for almost an hour before NASCAR finally gave up on racing roughly 2 1/2 hours after the scheduled start time with the temperature at 41 degrees.

            The Xfinity race will now take place after the Cup Series race Sunday, with an expected local start time of 5 p.m.

            Both the Cup Series and Xfinity Series drivers will have to race without practice on the track east of Los Angeles, with the starting orders determined by the metric used to set the qualifying order.

            Christopher Bell will be on the pole for Sunday's Cup race, with Daytona 500 champion Ricky Stenhouse Jr. joining him on the front row.

            This is the final race weekend on the famously weathered asphalt of the 2-mile track at Auto Club Speedway. A half-mile track is expected to be built on the site over the next two years, which means NASCAR won't race in Southern California next year.

            While drivers uniformly love the racing on the weathered asphalt of Fontana's two-mile track, they also know Sunday could be challenging even if the rain stops as expected overnight. Along with uncommonly cold temperatures, the aged racing surface will be particularly prone to weeping — when moisture seeps through the cracks in a racetrack long after the rain.

            “I’m not as concerned about the cold temperatures as I am about the track weeping,” defending Cup Series champion Joey Logano said. “Older track surface, a lot of cracks within it, I would assume it’s going to be hard to drive this thing. And we’re probably going to start with wet spots on the racetrack. I don’t know if they’re going to be able to get them all, and it’s hard to do it because the track is so wide. The racing groove is so wide.”

(AP) — NASCAR postponed the Xfinity Series race at Fontana to Sunday night because of steady rain at Auto Club Speedway on Saturday.Practice and qualifying sessions for both weekend races at Fontana had already been canceled because of consistent, heavy rain from an extraordinary Southern California storm.The Xfinity drivers still went through their introductions, got into their cars and took pace laps during a short break in the weather, but rain began to fall again during the warmup. Track officials used jet driers in an attempt to improve the surface, but the task quickly became impossible.Drivers laughed when they saw their breath freeze while they took their pace laps, and they audibly worried about the steadily increasing rain until NASCAR red-flagged them shortly before the start. The cars were parked in pit lane under their rain covers for almost an hour before NASCAR finally gave up on racing roughly 2 1/2 hours after the scheduled start time with the temperature at 41 degrees.The Xfinity race will now take place after the Cup Series race Sunday, with an expected local start time of 5 p.m.Both the Cup Series and Xfinity Series drivers will have to race without practice on the track east of Los Angeles, with the starting orders determined by the metric used to set the qualifying order.Christopher Bell will be on the pole for Sunday's Cup race, with Daytona 500 champion Ricky Stenhouse Jr. joining him on the front row.This is the final race weekend on the famously weathered asphalt of the 2-mile track at Auto Club Speedway.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821733,"Watkins scores again, Aston Villa beats Everton 2-0 in EPL","LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Ollie Watkins scored for the fifth successive match as Aston Villa beat Everton 2-0 to end Sean Dyche’s 100% home record and drop his team back into the English Premier League relegation zone on Saturday.

            Watkins' 63rd-minute penalty saw him become Villa’s first player to score in five straight games in the top-flight since Paul Rideout in January 1985.

            Substitute Emi Buendia made the win safe eight minutes from time to halt Villa’s three-match losing run.











            In a game of two goalline clearances by Villa’s Tyrone Mings and Everton’s James Tarkowski, the first goal was always going to be decisive. While it was one of Watkins’ quieter games, Dyche must have looked on enviously.

            The Everton manager, who had overseen wins over Arsenal and Leeds in his previous two games at Goodison Park, started with Neal Maupay — with one goal in his last 28 league matches — and later replaced him with Ellis Simms for just his sixth top-flight appearance.

            The folly of ending the January transfer window without strengthening up front was laid bare as the toothless hosts, who have scored just 17 times in 24 league matches, dominated the game but just had no threat in the penalty area.

            Their woes were compounded as wins for West Ham and Leeds plunged Everton back into trouble just when it looked like it was edging its way out of it.

            Everton has not beaten Villa in eight attempts.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821738,West Ham smashes Forest 4-0 with Danny Ings scoring twice,"LONDON (AP) — Danny Ings scored twice on his first start for West Ham as the team climbed out of the English Premier League relegation zone with a 4-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Saturday.

            Ings, who joined from Aston Villa last month, found the net twice in three second-half minutes to lift both his new team out of the bottom three and the mood at London Stadium.

            Declan Rice added a curling third and substitute Michail Antonio rounded off a much-needed win for manager David Moyes.











            All the goals came in the final 20 minutes after a cagey first 70 between two goal-shy sides.

            West Ham’s livewire winger, Jarrod Bowen, saw a curling effort deflected wide and then almost scored direct from the corner, with Keylor Navas palming the ball over his crossbar.

            At another corner, fit-again Lucas Paqueta’s low drive was deflected onto the foot of the post by Forest defender Felipe.

            Ings had a decent chance from Vladimir Coufal’s cross, but Tomas Soucek’s jump put him off and he made a mess of his header in front of goal.

            Forest was showing about as much ambition as it had in snatching a draw with Manchester City last weekend, although Lukasz Fabianski did have to tip Felipe’s header over and hold a 20-yard shot from Morgan Gibbs-White in the first half.

            After the break, Aaron Cresswell’s corner was met by Soucek at the near post but his glancing header flew just over. Then a slick move involving Paqueta, Ings and Said Benrahma culminated in Bowen slamming a low shot against the foot of Navas’ far post.

            Forest's players were screaming for a penalty when Renan Lodi’s drive hit the hand of Ben Johnson but, for the third match in a row, West Ham got away with one — although in this case the shot was probably too close to penalize.

            The Hammers had to make a change in goal when Fabianski was caught on the side of the head by Felipe, with Alphonse Areola coming on in his place.

            And they immediately took the lead when Bowen drilled the ball low across goal where it was expertly guided in by Ings in the 70th.

            The goal survived a VAR check for offside, and soon Ings had his second, another poacher’s strike from Benrahma’s cross into the six-yard box.

            Suddenly West Ham looked like a side with goals in it, arguably for the first time this season.

            Rice got into the act in the 78th minute, collecting Benrahma’s cut-back and curling a superb effort over Navas and inside the far post.

            With Forest on the ropes, Antonio provided the knockout punch when he headed in a cross from fellow sub Pablo Fornals.

            Krejcikova closed the tournament by beating the top three players in the WTA rankings: No. 3 Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals, then Swiatek. No. 8 Daria Kasaktina was also overcome in the second round.

            The Czech is the fifth woman in the Open era to beat the world's top three at the same event.











            “It's a big achievement and I think it's going to give me a lot of confidence that I can play with the best ones,” Krejcikova said.

            The former French Open champion dominated the final, breaking Swiatek five times. The Pole earned two breaks back in the first set, but Krejcikova then played out a love break and held to love for the set.

            In the second, she broke for 2-1 and 5-2 and easily held serve to win her sixth singles title.

            “I showed my best tennis this week,” Krejcikova said. “I was able to play my tennis but also hold the nerves.”

            Her previous title was in October, when she beat Swiatek for the first time in the Ostrava final.

            “When you play with Iga, you have to suffer, otherwise you're not going to win because she's everywhere,” she said. “She plays great shots. She likes to play long rallies. So you have to suffer. I don't mind that.”

            Nine athletes competing in the Mount Cameroon Race of Hope in Buea town were injured, as well as 10 civilians, including a baby, said Bernard Okalia Bikai, governor of the southwest region.

            The injured have been taken to Buea regional hospital and are receiving treatment, he told The Associated Press. 











            The Central African nation has been plagued by fighting since English-speaking separatists launched a rebellion in 2017, with the stated goal of breaking away from the area dominated by the French-speaking majority country and setting up an independent, English-speaking state. 

            The government has accused the separatists of committing atrocities against English-speaking civilians. The conflict has killed more than 3,300 people and displaced more than 750,000 others, according to the U.N.

            One of the separatist groups claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack, but said the intention was to hit the military.

            “Our primary targets were the Cameroon military who where providing security for the athletes. We regret that civilians were injured. We will continue fighting the military wherever they are until they liberate our territory,” said Capo Daniel, deputy defense chief and spokesman for the Ambazonia Defense Forces..

The results have been mixed at best, even though the effects of the Ukraine war are being felt around the globe. The war in Ukraine took center stage at the Munich Security Conference, arguably the most important security conference in Europe. Our Global Eyes hosts Isha Bhatia and William Glucroft were on location for a special episode. Their guests include Lynn Kuok, senior fellow for Asia-Pacific security at International Institute for Strategic Studies, IISS, and Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI. They talk about hunger, the framing of the Ukraine war, different policy priorities, the US-China rivalry, international law and why the West should treat the Global South with greater respect.Editorial team: Nina Werkhäuser and Matthias von Hein",2023/02/25,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821749,Cleric missing in Lebanon since 5 days killed by relatives,"BEIRUT (AP) — A Muslim cleric who went missing earlier this week was killed by people from his northern hometown with whom he had been at odds with for more than a decade, security officials said Saturday. 

            Sheikh Ahmad Rifai, a Sunni cleric, was last seen in the northern city of Tripoli Monday evening and his car was found days later in a village a few kilometers south of the city. His family said they lost contact with him Monday night after they tried to call him and found that his cellphone was turned off.

            Rifai was the imam of the main mosque in the northern town of Qarqaf in the impoverished northern Akkar region and was known for his fiery speeches in which he used to blast the Iran-backed Hezbollah. 











            There were concerns that Rifai’s case would incite sectarian tensions in the deeply-divided country since he was a harsh critic of the powerful Shiite group Hezbollah as well as the Syrian government and Iran. 

            It turned out Rifai was killed by people from his hometown, including some relatives, with whom he had been at odds with since 2012, the officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. They said that years ago some residents and the cleric accused one of Rifai's relatives who was Qarqaf's mayor of corruption. 

            The killing came at a time when Lebanon has been without a head of state since the term of President Michel Aoun ended in late October with no president elected. Lebanon is currently run by a caretaker government as the country sinks in its worst economic crisis in its modern history that started in October 2019.BEIRUT (AP) — A Muslim cleric who went missing earlier this week was killed by people from his northern hometown with whom he had been at odds with for more than a decade, security officials said Saturday.Sheikh Ahmad Rifai, a Sunni cleric, was last seen in the northern city of Tripoli Monday evening and his car was found days later in a village a few kilometers south of the city.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821751,Mass protests in Israel as controversial overhauls advanced,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis on Saturday protested their far-right government’s plans to overhaul the legal system, three days after parliament advanced a bill that would enable lawmakers to overturn a Supreme Court decision with a simple majority.

            The “Supreme Court override” bill’s approval in a preliminary vote in the Knesset was the latest step by Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling coalition toward realizing the judicial overhaul that is steaming ahead despite calls for dialogue and consensus from American Jews and Israel’s president, and the weekly mass protests.

            In addition to weakening the country's highest court, the protesters say the proposed changes threaten Israel's democratic values and concentrate power with the ruling coalition in parliament. Netanyahu and his ruling coalition believe the court has had unchecked power for years.











            For eight weeks, the weekly protests have gained momentum, with large sectors of Israeli society and businesses joining them. On Saturday, the main protest took place in the central city of Tel Aviv along numerous smaller demonstrations across the country.

            The protesters held Israeli flags, flares, and posters with different messages against the judicial overhauls. “No Constitution, No Democracy,"" said one placard. Some demonstrators stood behind a banner reading “They Shall Not Pass"" and “We Shall Override,” referring to the vote.TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis on Saturday protested their far-right government’s plans to overhaul the legal system, three days after parliament advanced a bill that would enable lawmakers to overturn a Supreme Court decision with a simple majority.The “Supreme Court override” bill’s approval in a preliminary vote in the Knesset was the latest step by Benjamin Netanyahu’s ruling coalition toward realizing the judicial overhaul that is steaming ahead despite calls for dialogue and consensus from American Jews and Israel’s president, and the weekly mass protests.In addition to weakening the country's highest court, the protesters say the proposed changes threaten Israel's democratic values and concentrate power with the ruling coalition in parliament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821753,Bulgaria bans neo-Nazi event after public outcry,"SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Authorities in Bulgaria on Saturday banned an annual torch-lit march in downtown Sofia in honor of a late general who led the pro-Nazi Union of Bulgarian National Legions during World War II.

            Hours before the event, the country’s chief prosecutor called on Sofia's mayor and the interior minister “to ensure the preservation of public order and protection of the rights of the public ahead of the Lukov March.""

            The event has been condemned by human rights groups, political parties, and foreign embassies, which criticized the march organizers for promoting racism, xenophobia, and antisemitism.











            Nationalists gathered in front of the prosecutor’s office to protest the restrictive measures.

            Meanwhile, dozens of anti-fascist activists staged a rally against the nationalist event, insisting that neo-Nazis should be banned. 

            A heavy police presence blocked any clashes between the two sides.

            Held annually since 2003, the march over the years has attracted nationalist admirers of Gen. Hristo Lukov, who supported Germany during World War II and was killed by an anti-fascist resistance movement. 

            The general served as war minister from 1935 to 1938 and led the pro-Nazi Germany Union of Bulgarian Legions from 1942 until his death in 1943.

            Organizers deny that Lukov was antisemitic or that they are neo-fascists, insisting that the general was a war hero and a true Bulgarian patriot, and claiming that the descendants of the murderers of Lukov are afraid of the event.

            On Saturday, police also blocked the streets around the site where Lukov had lived in Sofia to prevent the nationalists from holding a ceremony in memory of Lukov, which in past years was the high point of the event.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821754,Irish leader: Brexit talks over N Ireland close to a deal,"LONDON (AP) — Ireland's prime minister said Saturday that the U.K. and the European Union are “inching” closer to agreeing on a deal to resolve a thorny post-Brexit dispute in Northern Ireland. 

            Leo Varadkar told reporters that he believed an agreement may be possible within days. His comments came amid intense speculation that a breakthrough on months-long wrangling over the trading arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland Protocol, is imminent. 

            “Certainly the deal isn’t done yet,” Varadkar told broadcaster RTE. ”But I do think we are inching towards conclusion.""











            “I would just encourage everyone to go the extra mile to come to an agreement because the benefits are huge,"" he added. 

            The U.K. and the EU have been at loggerheads over Northern Ireland — the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland — since the U.K.'s exit from the trade bloc became final in 2020. 

            When the U.K. left the bloc, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.

            Under the agreement, there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians, who insist that the new trade border undermines Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom. 

            Northern Ireland's power-sharing government has been nonfunctional since the Democratic Unionist Party walked out a year ago in protest of the protocol. 

            The party has insisted that the protocol must be scrapped or substantially changed, and any deal that the U.K. strikes with the EU must secure the backing of the DUP.

            In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak indicated that “anything that we do will tick all of those boxes,” referring to unionist concerns about the trade arrangements. 

            “I’m here all weekend trying to get it done,” Sunak said. “We’re giving it everything we’ve got.”

            Sunak's office raised hopes that an agreement is close after it said “good progress” was made during a Friday call between Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

            British media reported that von der Leyen would travel to the U.K. on Saturday to meet with Sunak and King Charles III, raising more speculation, but the visit didn't materialize.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821758,Six Nations: England tames beleaguered Wales by 20-10,"CARDIFF, Wales (AP) — England piled on the misery for Wales with a 20-10 victory that left the beleaguered host nursing a third straight loss to open the Six Nations on Saturday.

            The Welsh haven’t made this bad a start to the Six Nations in 20 years and it continues a tempestuous campaign for the proud rugby nation, after a pre-tournament racism and bullying scandal and a contract dispute which dominated the buildup this week and made the game hostage to a threatened player strike.

            A match between teams well off the title pace never really caught fire in front of the Prince and Princess of Wales, with England always having the measure of a game but limited Welsh side at Principality Stadium.











            Anthony Watson — on his first England start for two years — went over for the only try of the first half, and prop Kyle Sinckler and center Ollie Lawrence added more after halftime to cap a workmanlike performance for the visitors, who won in Cardiff for the first time since 2017.

            Wales’ sole try came from an intercept on halfway, with winger Louis Rees-Zammit motoring clear for the score. Warren Gatland’s team was in touching distance of the visitors only because of a rare bad day off the kicking tee by England captain Owen Farrell, who had just two successful kicks from six.

            For England coach Steve Borthwick, it’s two wins from three to start his tenure as his team continued to rely on big defense, a solid kick-and-chase game and a strong set-piece — the country’s traditional strengths. France at home and Ireland away makes for the toughest possible finish to the Six Nations for the English, however.

            “There’s bits starting to show,” Farrell said, ""but we’re laying some foundations at the minute. We want to keep building on it all.

            “It was a different challenge for us to come away from home to a place like this, a team that has had a lot going on during the week and have unified to come together for this crowd at the weekend. Fair play to them.""

            Wales, meanwhile, will simply look to avoid a first wooden spoon for last place since 2003 when Gatland’s fellow New Zealander, Steve Hansen, was at the helm.

            That could be determined in Round 4 when Wales travels to Rome to play Italy, which has also opened with three straight losses.

            Wales had a couple of decent spells, near the end of the first half and midway through the second half, but the English defense stood up to the task. England will rarely have had a more straightforward win in the Welsh capital, with a turbulent last couple of weeks perhaps catching up with the hosts.

            “We spoke about the emotion of the last two weeks. We gave massive effort for 80 minutes,” Wales captain Ken Owens said. “We were right in the game throughout. We probably left a couple of opportunities out there but I can’t question the effort of this squad.""

            Watson appeared eager to make amends after his injury-enforced absence from the international scene and the left winger made no mistake with his 19th-minute try, which came when the ball was recycled left after a set move from a scrum made inroads down the middle of the pitch.

            That added to a penalty from Farrell in the 11th but England gave away a sloppy penalty straight from the restart, allowing Leigh Halfpenny to slot over.

            England dominated the collisions, even winning a penalty from a scrum against the head, but couldn't make its power tell on the scoreboard with Farrell missing two of his three first-half goalkicks.

            Wales, somehow, led after Rees-Zammit's converted 41st-minute score, which arrived as the winger came into the line and nabbed a short pass from opposite wing Max Malins. 

            Any Welsh hopes of an unlikely win were snuffed out by an immediate response by England, as Sinckler barged over and through a mass of bodies on the tryline to eventually ground.

            Lawrence's try in the left corner in the 74th minute sealed a victory that won't live long in the memory.

            “I can’t be critical of the effort out there, they tried really hard,"" Gatland said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821759,Osimhen helps Napoli avoid another letdown at Empoli,"ROME (AP) — For Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti, a 2-0 win at Empoli on Saturday meant just as much as recent wins over Juventus, Roma and other big Serie A clubs.

            That’s because Spalletti still regrets how Napoli squandered a two-goal advantage in a 3-2 loss at Empoli toward the end of last season to virtually eliminate the Partenopei from title contention.

            This season, of course, seems altogether different with Napoli holding a comfortable lead. But Spalletti, who grew up as an Empoli fan, played for the Tuscan club and began his coaching career there, warned his side not to show any signs of weakness — since Empoli actually beat Napoli twice last season.











            The players clearly listened, because Napoli was in control from start to finish en route to its eighth straight win in Serie A, extending its lead to 18 points over Inter Milan.

            Pressure from Napoli forwards Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Victor Osimhen led to an own goal from Ardian Ismajli 17 minutes in, then Osimhen doubled the advantage little more than 10 minutes later to mark his eighth straight match with a goal.

            “Difficult ground, we know what happened last season here,” Osimhen said. “We needed these three points.”

            The only negative note for Napoli was a red card to Mario Rui for a reaction foul midway through the second half.

            Ismajli redirected a cross from Piotr Zielinski into his own net following a pass from Kvaratskhelia for Napoli’s opener. Then Osimhen converted a rebound of a shot from Kvaratskhelia for his league-best 19th.

            Also, Napoli defender Kim Min-jae headed off the crossbar toward the end of the first half.

            Diego Maradona led Napoli to its only Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990.

            Empoli remained 12th.

            Osimhen revealed he recently received a message from his childhood idol, Didier Drogba.

            “It’s really amazing when you wake up or go on social media and see someone you have been looking up to growing up sending you a message like Drogba did,” Osimhen said. “I love what he did and I appreciate his confidence in me.”

            Also, Sassuolo won at Lecce 1-0 with a second-half header from Kristian Thorstvedt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821761,"Jill Biden talks safe sex, condoms with Kenya's young adults","NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — It was a Saturday of learning for U.S. first lady Jill Biden in Kenya. 

            She praised young adults for learning about safe sex and dating practices, attended a meeting of women who created their own banking system and chatted with local entrepreneurs who have been helped by a program that connects tractor owners and farmers. 

            All three programs aim to help women and young people take control of their lives so they can support themselves and their families. Biden has been highlighting U.S.-backed efforts to empower these groups during a five-day, two-country visit to Africa this week. 











            “These are issues that really all people need to talk about and yet, somehow, they don't, and the consequences of not talking about it are so dire,” Biden told dozens of young people after talking with them about safe sex, condom use and birth control at the Shujaaz Konnect Festival, a local youth empowerment event. “So I love seeing the young people here."" 

            At a tent where young people were having networking-like conversations, they showed her a questionnaire they use to spur discussion. The first question: ""What would you say if I told you I had a condom in my pocket right now?”

            Biden laughed. “And this is the first time they're meeting?” she asked. 

            A Shujaaz representative said such blunt propositions help teenagers and young adults overcome shyness, saying that it's sometimes easier to ask strangers these types of questions.

            “I’m surprised you don’t start with like, ‘What’s your biggest achievement?’ rather than, ‘I have a condom in my pocket,’” the first lady said.

            The festival is a collaboration with MTV Staying Alive Foundation, which works with the U.S. Agency for International Development and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to help teach young Kenyans how to avoid becoming infected with HIV, which causes AIDS.

            Biden, who is on the fourth day of her five-day trip to Namibia and Kenya, has spent the week promoting HIV/AIDS education programs and initiatives that teach woman and young people skills they need to find jobs or start businesses.

            Her visit is part of a commitment by President Joe Biden to deepen U.S. engagement with the nations of Africa, many of which feel overlooked by the United States. Part of that effort is also about countering China's influence on the continent that Beijing has achieved through increased trade and spending on roads and other public works projects.

            Biden was scheduled to cap her visit by traveling on Sunday to an area near Kenya's border with Tanzania to raise awareness about a severe drought that is endangering lives and livelihoods.

            Earlier Saturday, the first lady went to a government community center in Kibera, an informal settlement in Nairobi, to attend a meeting of women small-business owners who participate in the Joyful Women program. Founded in 2009 by Rachel Ruto, Kenya's first lady, the program promotes women's economic empowerment and financial inclusion. 

            Participants create “table banking” groups, pooling their resources so they can lend each other money they cannot get from traditional banks. Some of the women have used the loans to start businesses. One woman said she opened a day care center.

            “It's pretty ingenious that women found a way to support other women, to lift them up and to increase economic prosperity for families, right?” said Biden, who visited a different empowerment program on a 2010 stop at Kibera.

            “I've always taught my own daughter and my granddaughter the importance of being financially independent and, so now, here, you've found a way to do your own banking system, which is pretty incredible,” Biden said. Her granddaughter, Naomi, 29, sat nearby.

            Before taking her seat at the table, Biden was wrapped from the waist down in an apron-like cloth known as a leso or kanga that women wear in the home. 

            At a separate event, Biden chatted with local entrepreneurs, small farmers and others who have been helped by Hello Tractor, which connects tractor owners and farmers who need the machinery. 

            The first lady also laid a wreath at August 7th Memorial Park to honor those who were killed the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people were killed, including 12 Americans.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821764,DA drops felony charge against officer in train crash case,"DENVER (AP) — Prosecutors have dismissed the most serious charge against a Colorado police officer who locked a handcuffed woman in a parked police car that was hit by a freight train, leaving her with serious injuries. 

            The Weld County District Attorney’s office dismissed the second-degree felony assault charge against Officer Jordan Steinke on Thursday, according to court documents. Steinke and another officer still face less serious charges in connection with the Sept. 16, 2022 incident. 

            The collision occurred after multiple law enforcement agencies responded to a report of a road rage incident in Fort Lupton, Colorado. A Platteville police officer stopped Yareni Rios' car just past a set of railroad tracks and parked the patrol vehicle on the crossing. Another officer handcuffed Rios and placed her in the back of the police vehicle, which was hit by the train as officers were searching her car. 











            The 21-year-old Rios survived with serious injuries, and later filed a lawsuit accusing three officers of asking recklessly and failing in their duty to take care of her while she was in their custody. In the lawsuit, Rios alleges the train tracks were “plainly visible” to Steinke as she put Rios in the back seat of the patrol car belonging to Platteville Sgt. Pablo Vazquez. 

            Court records do not reveal why prosecutors dropped the assault charge against Steinke. Krista Henery, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, said she could not comment because of pending litigation. 

            Steinke still faces other less serious charges in connection with the incident, including felony attempted reckless manslaughter and misdemeanor reckless endangerment. Steinke was placed on administrative leave after the collision and remains on leave, according to the police department.

            Steinke’s attorney, Mallory Revel, said in a statement Friday that dismissing the assault charge was the “right thing” for the district attorney’s office to do, and contended the remaining charges should also be dismissed. 

            Vazquez is charged with five misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and is scheduled for a pretrial conference in March. Vazquez was fired from the police department in December, Platteville police Chief Carl Dwyer said Friday. A phone number for Vazquez could not be found.DENVER (AP) — Prosecutors have dismissed the most serious charge against a Colorado police officer who locked a handcuffed woman in a parked police car that was hit by a freight train, leaving her with serious injuries.The Weld County District Attorney’s office dismissed the second-degree felony assault charge against Officer Jordan Steinke on Thursday, according to court documents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821776,"Oklahoma rallies, then runs past No. 23 Iowa State 61-50","AMES, Iowa (AP) — Jacob Groves led Oklahoma with 16 points as the Sooners knocked off No. 23 Iowa State 61-50 on Saturday.

            The Sooners (14-15, 4-12 Big 12) had lost nine of their previous 11 games — and six in a row on the road — but erased an early 11-point deficit and seized control with a 17-2 run in the second half.

            “For us, it's to keep believing,"" Oklahoma coach Porter Moser said. “Just keep believing and fighting.”











            Groves made 4 of 5 from the 3-point line while Tanner Groves added 9 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. Their efforts helped the Sooners maintain slim NCAA Tournament hopes.

            “That's why they call it March madness,” Moser said. “We've still got two more opportunities in this league. We've still got the Big 12 tournament. This league is crazy.”

            The Cyclones (17-11, 8-8) shot just 31%, including 14 of 43 from inside the 3-point line.

            Gabe Kalscheur led Iowa State with 12 points.

            “It's disappointing,” Kalscheur said. “I don't want to feel like that, so I'm going to give it everything I've got Monday (against West Virginia) so it doesn't happen again.”

            Both teams came into Saturday in a slump.

            Oklahoma missed its first five shots and committed four turnovers while failing to score during the opening 5:33 of the game.

            The Sooners still had just three points at the 11:40 mark of the first half.

            “Iowa State did what they do,” Moser said. “They came out and they punched (us) in the face, with their effort.”

            The Cyclones used that lull to build a 14-3 lead, but Oklahoma eventually pulled within 20-17 and 24-21.

            Neither team shot better than 33% before halftime. Iowa State used a 14-4 edge in paint scoring to maintain a 28-23 lead at the break.

            “We had a lot of looks at the rim, a lot of looks in the paint,” Cyclone coach T.J. Otzelberger said. “And we need to demand that we finish those plays and come away with those points.”

            Oklahoma eventually went ahead as Tanner and Jacob Groves combined to score nine of the Sooners first 11 points of the second half. A steal and layup by Jalen Hill put Oklahoma up 36-32.

            “I really liked our fight back, to get it within five at half,” Moser said. “We've seen it in this building, we've seen it with this team. How hard (the Cyclones) play. They get after you right out of the gate and sometimes it's hard to adjust, because you can't simulate how hard they play in your practice.""

            The lead eventually grew to 42-32 on a 3-pointer by Grant Sherfield.

            “We just have to be aggressive, be more physical, so they can't make those easy passes that led to a lot of open rhythm threes from them,” Iowa State guard Tamin Lipsey said.

            Sherfield finished with 10 points. The Sooners finished 10 of 23 (43.5%) from behind the arc. They also had a 25-14 edge in bench points.

            “We certainly demand more, have higher standards for ourselves,” Otzelberger said. “We're going to learn about who we are as a group and who we are as people... We've got to dig deep. We've got to find a way and that's what we're going to do these next two days.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Oklahoma entered Saturday having lost six of its past seven games and having lost its last six road games. Iowa State has now lost five of its last six while trying to secure an NCAA Tournament berth.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821777,"No. 24 TCU hits late FTs, tops Texas Tech after blowing lead","LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) — JaKobe Coles knew the injury situation for No. 24 TCU would mean a bigger role against Texas Tech.

            The sophomore big man might not have envisioned standing at the free-throw line with a one-point deficit in the final seconds. He calmly came through. 

            Coles made two free throws with 4.3 seconds remaining, and the Horned Frogs held on for an 83-82 victory Saturday despite blowing a 12-point lead in the final eight minutes.











            After De'Vion Harmon's steal and layup put the Red Raiders in front by one with 12 seconds remaining, Coles caught a pass from Emanuel Miller in the lane and was fouled by Fardaws Aimaq. 

            The Horned Frogs (19-10, 8-8 Big 12), who were without center Eddie Lampkin again because of an ankle injury, weren't in the bonus. They went inside anyway after the Red Raiders used one of two fouls to give on TCU leading scorer Mike Miles Jr. on the previous possession.

            Coles, who was a minute shy of his season high with 27, rose for the shot as the ball was knocked loose and he made contact with Aimaq.

            “Emanuel I thought made a terrific play feeding JaKobe,” TCU coach Jamie Dixon said. “We said that would be open, and we wanted to get it inside because we figured they’d foul Mike if we got it out front again.”

            Harmon's desperation 3-pointer as the buzzer sounded wasn't close, ending a four-game winning streak for Texas Tech (16-13, 5-11), which is trying to stay in the hunt for an NCAA Tournament berth despite an 0-8 start in Big 12 play. 

            “These guys have been under a lot of stress,” Red Raiders coach Mark Adams said. “I was proud of our guys for coming back. These guys have been through a lot, and we’re probably a little bit worn out emotionally.”

            Miles scored 24 points and Coles 15 for the Horned Frogs, who had lost five of six and were coming off a loss to No. 3 Kansas at home. Miller had 14 points and 12 rebounds, while Xavier Cork scored 10 points despite foul trouble.

            Aimaq scored 19 points, Harmon had 18 and Kevin Obanor finished with 17 points and nine rebounds for Texas Tech.

            TCU led 74-62 after a 3-pointer by Coles with 7:39 remaining, but Texas Tech went on an 8-0 run and eventually got the deficit to two with three minutes to go.

            Jaylon Tyson's 3-pointer with 1:43 left gave the Red Raiders their first lead since the 10-minute mark of the first half before Damion Baugh, who had nine assists, fed Miles for a dunk.

            With TCU still leading by one, Miles drove to the basket before a kick-out pass that Harmon intercepted and converted into a layup for an 82-81 lead.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            TCU managed to stay ranked through its extended slump, and is 2-5 in February. The Frogs have been ranked in 12 consecutive polls, but that school-record streak could be in jeopardy when the new AP Top 25 comes out Monday. 

            ROUNDING INTO FORM

            Miles, the preseason Big 12 player of the year, bounced back from a 4-of-14 shooting night against the Jayhawks on Monday by making eight of 16 from the floor. It was his third game after missing five with a hyperextended right knee.

            “Mike hit some clutch shots,” Dixon said. “He's back now. I kind of said that we needed probably two games under (his) belt. That’s just how the world works when you’re out that long.”

            BIG PICTURE

            TCU: The Horned Frogs ended a seven-game losing streak in Lubbock, and former Texas Tech player Micah Peavy played an important role in the second half. Both of his baskets came on consecutive put-back baskets during a stretch that helped turn away one of several second-half rallies from the Red Raiders.

            Texas Tech: The Red Raiders might have finished the rally with better defensive rebounding in the second half. The Horned Frogs had several put-back buckets after the break and outscored Texas Tech 20-12 on second-chance points. “They've been rebounding like crazy,” Dixon said of the Red Raiders. “So we had to get that done.”

            No City player has scored that many in a single Premier League. Sergio Aguero's 26 in 2014-15 was the previous best for the club.

            Julian Alvarez and Phil Foden added more for City, and an own goal by Chris Mepham wrapped up the visitors' scoring on an easy night on the south coast.











            It is six matches without a clean sheet for Pep Guardiola's team, however, after Jefferson Lerma's 83rd-minute strike.

            City remained two points behind Arsenal, which beat Leicester 1-0 earlier Saturday, but has played one game more.

            Haaland has broken City's single-season scoring record in the league even though they have 13 more matches to play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821779,French documentary 'On the Adamant' wins top Berlinale prize,"BERLIN (AP) — The French documentary “On the Adamant” (Sur l'Adamant) directed by Nicolas Philibert was named best film Saturday at this year's Berlin International Film Festival.

            The film takes viewers onto a Seine barge in Paris that serves as a floating day-care center for adults suffering from mental disorders.

            “That a documentary is awarded and celebrated, that a documentary can be considered to be cinema in its own right touches me deeply,” said a visibly moved Philibert after the prize was announced by the seven-member jury headed by American actor, screenwriter and director Kristen Stewart.











            Philibert said that in the film he had tried to “reverse the image” that people have of those with mental illness and allow viewers to see “what unites us beyond our differences”

            “As we all know, the craziest people are not those we think they are,” he added.

            The award for best director went to fellow French filmmaker Philippe Garrel for “The Plough” (Le grand chariot) about three siblings who are trying to keep alive the family puppeteering business.

            Best leading performance was awarded to Spanish actor Sofía Ortero, who plays an 8-year-old child searching for identity and acceptance in “20,000 Species of Bees” (20.000 especies de abejas).

            The award for best supporting performance went to Austrian actor Thea Ehre for her role in “Till the End of the Night” (Bis ans Ende der Nacht), while the best screenplay went to “Music” by German filmmaker Angela Schanelec.

            French cinematographer Hélène Louvart received the Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution for her work on “Disco Boy.”

            The 73rd Berlinale kicked off with an address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who asked artists and filmmakers to unequivocally declare their support for his country in its effort to fend off Russia's invasion forces

            Zelenskyy, a former comedian and actor, featured prominently in Sean Penn’s film about the war in Ukraine, “Superpower,” which had its world premiere in Berlin.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821780,"Siakam scores 29 points, Raptors edge Pistons, 95-91","DETROIT (AP) — Pascal Siakam had 29 points and eight rebounds for the Toronto Raptors in their fourth straight win, a 95-91 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Saturday. 

            Gary Trent Jr. scored 19 points and Scottie Barnes added 12, all in the second half, as the Raptors won for the seventh time in eight games. Precious Achiuwa chipped in 10 points off the bench.

            “We just continue to play together, try to minimize the mistakes and fight through everything,” said Siakam, who scored eight points in the final 3:20. “It's not going to be perfect but as long as we're together we'll help each other on defense.”











            The Raptors shot 37.5% from the field, made 22 of 34 free throw attempts and were outrebounded 62-46. They survived by holding Detroit to 40.4% shooting and committing only eight turnovers.

            “We're playing pretty solidly at the defensive end with some intensity and some disruptiveness,” Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. 

            Detroit's Marvin Bagley III piled up a season-high 21 points and 18 rebounds in his first game since fracturing his right hand on Jan. 2. 

            “I love the way he played,” Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. “Rebounding-wise, he had 13 in the first half and that was huge. It was great to have him back.”

            Isaiah Livers, Hamidou Diallo and Bojan Bogdanovic had 11 points apiece for the Pistons, who lost their fourth straight. James Wiseman added 10 points and 10 rebounds before fouling out, and Jaden Ivey had 10 points and 10 assists.

            Both teams scored 22 points in the first and second quarters, but the Raptors finished the third quarter on a 9-1 run to take a 71-70 lead. Toronto extended it to eight points but the Pistons answered with an 8-0 spurt to tie it again. 

            “We didn’t shoot it very well, we didn’t finish very well, we didn’t shoot free throws very well but I liked how we played,"" Nurse said. ""We were getting (the ball) to where it should go about 90% of the possessions.”

            Trent's 3-pointer with 2:38 remaining gave the Raptors an 89-86 advantage. Ivey made two free throws in the final minute to pull Detroit within a point. 

            Bagley missed a shot in the lane that could have given Detroit the lead before Siakam made two free throws with 11 seconds left. 

            Bagley split free throws with 4.1 seconds left and Siakam clinched Toronto's win with two more free throws.

            “Our defense was solid and physical but we fouled way too much,” Casey said. “I liked our toughness and aggressiveness. Our defense has gotten much better but with that we still have to be able to score in today's game.""

            The Raptors can reach the .500 mark for the first time since early December with a win in Cleveland on Sunday.

            “We had a lot of games we could have won and been in a different spot,” Siakam said. “We put ourselves in this situation. That happens in life and we've just got to continue to focus on the task ahead.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821781,Dixon leads Villanova past No. 19 Creighton 79-67,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Eric Dixon scored 18 of his career-high 31 points in the first half, Cam Whitmore added 17 and Villanova defeated No. 19 Creighton 79-67 on Saturday.

            Dixon also set a career high with six 3-pointers for Villanova (15-14, 9-9 Big East), which has won five of six.

            “My teammates kept finding me in spots that I’m comfortable in,” Dixon said.











            Arthur Kaluma scored 19 points and Ryan Kalkbrenner had 18 for Creighton (18-11, 12-6). The Bluejays have lost three of four following an eight-game winning streak.

            “We ran into a buzz saw today,” Creighton coach Greg McDermott said. “Villanova was able to turn our defense inside out with Dixon’s ability to stretch the floor.”

            The Wildcats have been the standard bearer for the Big East since the conference’s realignment in 2013, but they took some lumps for much of this season without Hall of Fame coach Jay Wright, who retired after last season. Now, first-year head coach Kyle Neptune has the Wildcats playing the kind of basketball that led them to seven of the last nine conference regular-season titles, five Big East Tournament titles over that span and national championships in 2016 and 2018.

            Villanova again looks like a team that no one wants to play in March.

            “We just had to grow as a team,” Neptune said. “Thank God our guys have continued to get better and better. Our goal is always to be the best team we can be by the end. Hopefully we can reach that goal.”

            The Wildcats have been playing better since the return of Justin Moore from injury. The senior guard had eight points and eight assists in his ninth game back after tearing his Achilles tendon.

            “You can see it coming as you watch them on film since Justin has returned,” McDermott said. “You can see growth every game. Frankly, I was afraid of this. Unfortunately, I was right.”

            Dixon’s two free throws gave Villanova a 46-29 lead 2:57 into the second half to match the Wildcats’ biggest lead of the game. Creighton chipped away at the deficit and got within 52-45 with 12:37 remaining on Kalkbrenner’s two free throws.

            But then Dixon heated up again, first hitting a 3 from the left baseline and then converting a traditional 3-point play on a drive and free throw to push the lead back to 58-45 with 11:18 to play.

            Creighton couldn’t recover. Whitmore put an exclamation point on the victory with a driving, one-handed jam with 2:47 remaining.

            MOORE FACTOR

            Villanova improved to 5-4 since Moore returned to the lineup on Jan. 29 against Providence. The 6-foot-4 senior guard was projected to be a late first-round or early second-round pick in last spring’s NBA draft before tearing his right Achilles tendon in the Wildcats’ NCAA Tournament semifinal victory over Houston.

            Like his team, Moore’s game has picked up lately. He is coming off his best performance, scoring 25 points while helping the Wildcats rally from a 13-point second-half deficit to win 64-63 at No. 16 Xavier on Tuesday.

            HOME SWEET (OTHER) HOME

            Villanova finished the season 3-1 at the Wells Fargo Center, the home court of the Philadelphia 76ers and the Wildcats’ secondary home floor. They won all three games here last season and are 62-37 all-time.

            BIG PICTURE

            Creighton: With games remaining against league bottom dwellers DePaul and Georgetown, the Bluejays look like a lock for an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament. First, they’ll set their sights on the school’s first Big East Tournament title. Creighton has reached the championship game four times since joining the Big East in 2013 but have lost all four games, including in 2022 and 2017 to Villanova.

            Villanova: The Wildcats likely will need a deep run in the Big East Tournament to have any shot at an NCAA Tournament at-large bid. Villanova is a middle-of-the-pack conference team this season but one that is getting hot at the right time.

                Galloway, in his sixth season after stops at College of Charleston and Boston College, finished with 28 points on 7-of-9 shooting with four 3-pointers and made all 10 of his free throws. Hall had 20 on 9-of-11 shooting with two 3s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821785,Real Madrid scores late to draw with 10-man Atletico,"MADRID (AP) — There was more of the same in the latest Madrid derby at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.

            Again, Real Madrid avoided defeat. Again, Atletico Madrid complained about the refereeing.

            Madrid scored late to draw 1-1 in the Spanish league on Saturday, and extend its unbeaten streak against the city rival at home to seven years. 











            Atletico played with 10 men from the 64th minute after forward Ángel Correa was shown a disputed red card for elbowing Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger.

            “Nothing new at the Bernabéu,” Atletico tweeted after the match. It also complained about the officiating after a Copa del Rey loss at the Bernabéu last month.

            Atletico coach Diego Simeone said Correa's action was not harsh enough to merit a red card.

            “There was contact but it was not a strike,” Simeone said. “Rüdiger immediately got up. Maybe it was a yellow, but it was not enough to take a player out of the game. There wouldn't be any players left if they always called that. This keeps happening all the time against us, it has become normal, and that's not right. It would be nice to be able to compete under the same conditions. Every time we come here, the calls go against us.”

            Atletico also posted on Twitter a photo of a bloody leg of whom it called “our aggressor” during the match. “Still nothing new at the Bernabéu,"" it added.

            “Five derbies in a row with a red card,” Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. “Maybe the next one we start with 10 men.”

            Teenage Madrid striker Álvaro Rodríguez scored in the 85th minute after Atletico opened through José María Giménez in the 78th and was poised to end its winless drought at the Bernabéu dating to 2016.

            The draw left Madrid seven points behind Barcelona ahead of the latter’s match at relegation-threatened Almeria on Sunday.

            “It was tough before this match, and now it can become even tougher,” Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. “All we can do is keep fighting until the last match.”

            Madrid was coming off a 5-2 come-from-behind win at Liverpool in the Champions League, and was trying to win its sixth consecutive game in all competitions.

            The result kept Atletico, unbeaten in the Spanish league since early January, from moving to third place ahead of Real Sociedad, which lost at struggling Valencia 1-0 late Saturday. Atletico stayed one point behind the Basque Country team.

            When Madrid won the previous derby in January, also at the Bernabéu, to advance to the Copa semifinals, Atletico claimed Madrid midfielder Dani Ceballos should have been sent off for a hard foul when Atletico was ahead.

            On Saturday, Atletico defender Reinildo injured his right knee midway through the first half and was carried off on a stretcher.

            Before the match, Madrid honored Amancio Amaro, the 1960s and 70s club great who died last week.

            Madrid on Thursday hosts Barcelona in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semis. Atletico hosts Sevilla in the league on Saturday.

            VALENCIA WINS AGAIN

            Valencia edged Sociedad to end a six-game losing streak in all competitions and leave the relegation zone.

            Valencia's first league win since before the World Cup lifted the club to 17th place, one point outside the relegation zone. The winner came from an own goal by Sociedad midfielder Igor Zubeldia in the 40th.

            It was Valencia's second match under new coach Rubén Baraja. 

            Before the match, thousands of Valencia fans again protested against Singaporean owner Peter Lim. The crowd at Mestalla Stadium also jeered Lim and called for him to leave the club.

            BRAITHWAITE’S BRACE

            Denmark international Martin Braithwaite scored in each half as Espanyol defeated Mallorca 2-1 to move further away from the relegation zone.

            Espanyol, in 12th place, has won two consecutive league matches for the first time this season.

            CADIZ THRIVES AT HOME

            Sergi Guardiola scored a 74th-minute winner as Cadiz defeated Rayo Vallecano 1-0.

            Cadiz is unbeaten in the league at home in nine matches. The southern club was three points above the drop zone.

            Rayo stayed in sixth place.

            Miller delivered his second straight huge game for the Crimson Tide (25-4, 15-1 Southeastern Conference) since police alleged in courtroom testimony that he brought a gun to former teammate Darius Miles, who is charged with capital murder in a fatal shooting.

            The week’s details cast a different light on Miller’s regular pregame introduction, which is a Tide staffer giving him a pat down. Coach Nate Oats said after the game that intro for Miller is now over.











            Fellow freshman Nick Smith Jr. of Arkansas (19-10, 8-8), another potential NBA draft lottery pick who helped keep the Razorbacks in it with a late 3-pointer, scored 24 points. Davonte Davis added 21 points for Arkansas, Council scored 20, and the rest of the team combined for 18 points.

But the Cougars never trailed and led for all but 56 seconds. Ezra Ausar scored 15 points to lead the Pirates.

            LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Dajuan Harris was one point shy of a career high, scoring 17 points to help lift Kansas over West Virginia.

            The Jayhawks' stifling defense kept West Virginia from attempting a shot in the final 20 seconds. The Mountaineers’ Joe Toussaint traveled on their final possession of the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821789,No. 18 UConn rolls to 95-86 win over St. John's at MSG,"NEW YORK (AP) — “Joey California” looked right at home in the heart of New York City as No. 18 UConn knocked off another Big East rival on its self-described ""revenge tour.”

            Jordan Hawkins scored 20 points, Adama Sanogo added 18 points and nine rebounds, and the Huskies topped St. John's 95-86 on Saturday.

            “I was just impressed by the way that we played offensively,” UConn coach Dan Hurley said. “Just making shots, and we looked like a team that had some real offensive punch.”











            Andre Jackson Jr. shook off flu-symptoms to score 15 points on 5-for-6 shooting. Joey Calcaterra also poured in 15 to lead a strong effort by UConn's bench, and the resurgent Huskies (22-7, 11-7) avenged an 11-point loss to St. John's at home last month.

            “This is revenge week,” said Calcaterra, a graduate transfer from San Diego who was playing his first game at Madison Square Garden.

            “We just came in locked in. We just had to get back to our roots and get back to what got us here,"" he added. “We just wanted to bring our best effort the second time around playing them.”

            UConn won for the sixth time in seven games, closing in on a first-round bye in the Big East Tournament. It was the fourth time this month that the Huskies avenged a conference defeat in January, which came during the 2-6 skid that followed their 14-0 start.

            “We're like the best team in the country when our bench plays the way they played today,” Hawkins said.

            AJ Storr had 20 points and Posh Alexander added 18 for the Red Storm (17-13, 7-12), who had won three of four.

            David Jones scored 15 off the bench — all in the second half — and Joel Soriano marked Senior Day with 12 points and 11 rebounds for his 22nd double-double this season, most in Division I.

            Soriano fouled out with 3:02 remaining and St. John's down by 12.

            There was plenty of jawing between the Big East foes before a split Garden crowd of 12,241 in a chippy game that included four technical fouls.

            “It seemed like it was a home game, honestly, all the fans that we had,"" said Huskies point guard Tristen Newton, who had eight assists and seven rebounds.

            “It is Storrs South, as they say,” Calcaterra added.

            UConn scored the first six points of the second half down low and opened the period with a 12-4 surge that gave the Huskies their largest lead, 62-45, with 13:31 remaining.

            St. John's trimmed it to nine with 9:32 left, but technical fouls on Dylan Addae-Wusu and Red Storm coach Mike Anderson led to four free throws by Hawkins over the next 5:10 that helped UConn build its lead back to 15.

            Three reserves — Calcaterra, Nahiem Alleyne and 7-foot-2 freshman Donovan Clingan — keyed two quick spurts that put UConn in control late in the first half.

            Alleyne hit a pull-up jumper and assisted on Clingan's dunk during a 7-0 run capped by Calcaterra's 3-pointer that gave the Huskies a 39-27 advantage.

            St. John's shaved it to seven before another 3 by Calcaterra completed a 10-2 surge that put UConn ahead by 15. Alexander converted a 3-point play and drained a 3 to send the Red Storm into the break down 50-41.

            OFF THE BENCH

            Clingan finished with nine points, six rebounds and five blocks in nearly 13 1/2 minutes. ... The slumping Calcaterra, who didn't play last Saturday against Seton Hall, matched his season high for points and scored in double figures for the first time since Dec. 20 against Georgetown. He played 17:25, his first time exceeding 10 minutes since Jan. 22.

            BIG PICTURE

            UConn: With a pair of regular-season games remaining, the Huskies are two games ahead of Villanova and Seton Hall for fifth place in the Big East. The top five seeds automatically draw into the quarterfinals of the conference tournament. ... UConn improved to 67-59 at Madison Square Garden, which will host the Big East Tournament next month.

            St. John's: Headed for the 8-9 game in the first round of the Big East Tournament on March 8, likely against Butler. “We’ve played everybody in our league. I think we can beat anybody and anybody can beat us. That’s what I see,"" Anderson said. ... Soriano's 22 double-doubles are the most by a St. John's player since Walter Berry had 28 in 1985-86.

            UP NEXT

            UConn: Plays its home finale Wednesday night against DePaul before wrapping up the regular season Saturday at Villanova.

(AP) — A damaged rope led to the plunge of a decorative helicopter into a swimming pool at a New Jersey water park last weekend, injuring four people, state investigators said.

            Just outside New York City, the DreamWorks Water Park at the American Dream complex in East Rutherford reopened Saturday after being closed for four days after the decoration fell from the ceiling last Sunday afternoon. One person was taken to a hospital and three others were treated at the park, all for injuries that were not life-threatening, officials said.

            The state Department of Community Affairs, which oversees New Jersey amusement parks, investigated with an engineering firm, which said ""damage found on the wire rope used to suspend the helicopter was a direct contributing factor to the cause of the wire rope’s failure,” department spokesperson Lisa Ryan said.











            The helicopter was permanently removed, all other remaining park features were deemed safe, and the cease-operations order issued by the Amusement Ride Safety unit was lifted, officials said.

            The complex is about 13 miles (21 kilometers) west of New York City in the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The mall said in a statement earlier in the week that it was reopening “having met all safety regulations and requirements following a rigorous investigation and review” by state and county officials and independent engineering consultants.

Likewise for Filipino-American designer Rhuigi Villasenor at Swiss luxury brand Bally. And Tokyo James, founded a nearly decade ago by British-Nigerian designer Iniye Tokyo James, presented its fourth Milan runway show.

            Some highlights from mostly womenswear collections for next fall and winter on the fourth day Saturday of Milan Fashion Week.

            DOLCE & GABBANA’S SEDUCE WITH SHEERS AND LACE

            The negligee is coming out of the bedroom next season at Dolce & Gabbana, where sheer and lace lingerie looks set the tone during a season when nude dressing is one of the hottest trends on the Milan runway.

            Not to worry, for those who are not ready to go that far, lacy corset tops also become a wonderful element in a suit. 

            Almost never have the designers created such a clear progression: from the seduction of black lingerie with herring bone or feathery details to a all-white looks, including one sheer, that might be fit for a very non-traditional wedding. 

            An audible gasp went through the crowd for a gold-studded dress with a metallic corset. Ashley Graham stunned in a ruched red dress that swathed her form. 

            Like the last season curated by Kim Kardashian, many of the looks drew on the Dolce & Gabbana archives. 

            Kardashian was back this season, this time in the front row as a spectator, wearing a red sequined bra top and skirt that was a cousin to the runway collection’s closing look. 

            SALVATORE FERRAGAMO CHASES YOUTH

            Ferragamo has some sex kitten looks for next fall and winter as creative direction of Maximilian Davis, showing his second collection for the Florentine fashion house, took a dive into the archives when 1950s divas like Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren were setting the mood.

            “With Ferragamo there is so much in the heritage, that I felt we really need to work to present it to the younger generation that we want to bring into the brand,” Davis said backstage. 

            That included an invisible heel on a stiletto, and the Ferragamo red that he employed in smaller ways, like peekaboo slits.

            Davis envisages dressing both mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, with his clean lines and spare, direct point of view.

            To that end there were slightly off-centered suit jackets with culottes worn fetchingly, and modestly, with dark tights. Culottes also paired with knitwear in see-me red. Sons might gravitate toward technical bombers and tank tops in bright shades, or motorcycle jackets and trousers with flashes of red that can be zipped open or closed. 

            Davis struck both an elegant and sexy tone with wrap dresses, elegant when combined with draping and sexy when hugging the body in liquidy metallic shades and short hemlines.

            Front-row celebrities included Uma Thurman and Hunter Schafer.

            BALLY HOST ELLA EMHOFF, ADRIEN BRODY

            Model Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, made her Milan Fashion Week debut this week, which included a stop in the Bally front row to see Rhuigi Villasenor’s second collection for the Swiss luxury brand.

            Emhoff sported a Villasenor creation featuring rows of spikey beads that she likened to a weighted blanked, “which is soothing,’’ she said before the show. The striking black top was styled simply with jeans, slicked hair and just a dot of orange on the eye— and a security service detail in the corner. 

            Villasenor set his collection against the backdrop of a 15th Century mansion that was home to Leonardo da Vinci when he painted in “The Last Supper,” in a church opposite the house. 

            And the luxury looks that evoked a life of active leisure were at home in the opulent surroundings, including a well-adorned map room, where a carving on the ceiling invoked: “Agere, non loqui,” Latin for “Do, don’t speak.”

            Men’s suits tucked into luxury leather waders, while her elegant cape falls perfectly to meet thigh-high boots. For her, there was functional knitwear with a gold-chain belt for daytime outings, and for evening, super-sex dresses that plunged and clung to the form, with asymmetical backs. Waiting by the door, were fake furs and quilted puffer coats. 

            Sitting opposite Emhoff in the map room was Adrien Brody, arriving just in the nick of time with his partner, the designer Georgina Chapman. 

            TOKYO JAMES CODE SWITCHES 

            Tokyo James accented his collection with rows of dead zipper pulls, that offer neither an opening, nor any closure. They are there to amuse, provoke, and jingle, like charms that draw attention away from the fabulousness of the garments, lest they attract jealousy. 

            The collection, dubbed “Code Switch” as an homage to his decade as a designer, featured denim combinations in blue and purple, colorful patchwork shearling, cropped leather jackets and teddy bear coats with mesh-covered openings. Loose-cut suits are covered with the names of places in his Nigerian homeland: Badagry, Surulere, Ikoyi, and one suit jacket proudly declares: “African” in sparkling red. 

            Models had red-makeup smeared on their teeth, and some made the most of the potentially ghoulish accent, sneering at the cameras as they made their turn. But the overall mood was dapper, underlined by the short scarf accessory, tied in an off-skew bow, as the designer himself wears. 

            FERRARI GOES PINK

            Ferrari luxury fashion appears to have a permanent home at Milan Fashion Week, as its performance boosts the lifestyle segment at super sports carmaker. 

            The latest collection by Rocco Iannone features Ferrari pink – ironically the only color that the carmaker declines to offer automotive customers -- alongside the traditional red. On the runway, the colors play nicely off each other in bold combinations of shiny outerwear, puffy utility vests and quilted skirts. Pink also got a turn as an accent in shredded and intarsia knitwear

            Innovation at Ferrari is not confined to car technology. Shiny red jackets and jodhpur shaped quilted pants were made from a new textile developed through a patented process called Q-Cycling that converts old tires into wearable fibers. 

            BENETTON DEMOCRATIZES FASHION

            Andrea Incontri is in his second season of upping the fashion game at Benetton brand, with his first collection – featuring a mélange of knitwear featuring fruit patterns just now in stores. 

            “They tell me it is going well,’’ he said with a smile. 

            His second collection for next fall and winter turns largely on color, with the brand’s famous knitwear the lynchpin element. Lavender, pink and tangerine combine in a casual suit combo, the blouse kept open under a cropped cable-knit sweater. Bunny motifs repeat on black-and-white sweaters, worn over a polka dot shirt. And a shiny, green eco-shearling coat pulls together a pink-and-green floral printed skirt with accompanying pullover.

            Accessories include soft bags with the streamlined octopus logo, which also appears as jewelry.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821793,"Kane incoming? Rangers trade Kravtsov, waive Leschyshyn","WASHINGTON (AP) — On the way out of the arena late in the third period of the New York Rangers' latest loss, Vitali Kravtsov ran into Washington Capitals forward Aliaksi Protas and told him he was heading to Vancouver.

            Patrick Kane could soon be going from Chicago to New York in his place.

            The Rangers on Saturday began the machinations necessary if a trade for Patrick Kane were to materialize. They traded Kravtsov to the Vancouver Canucks and put forward Jake Leschyshyn on waivers, transactions that in combination could clear the cap space to get Kane from Chicago.











            Those moves happened while the Rangers were in the midst of getting drubbed 6-3 by the division rival Capitals, with the background distractions creeping into New York's play.

            “I think everybody is aware of what’s going on around us,” captain Jacob Trouba said. “As a player, that’s not something for you to worry about. Your job is to play the game and be ready to play when the puck drops.”

            It's unclear if Kane could be with the Rangers the next time the puck drops for them, on Sunday at home against the Los Angeles Kings, or if the wait will be longer. But it doesn't appear Kane will play again for the Blackhawks any time soon, with the 34-year-old leaving the team during its road trip.

            “He has left this morning,” coach Luke Richardson said in San Jose. “As as of today, he has flown back to Chicago, I think, just until the situation rectifies itself.”

            The situation is coming into focus after trading Kravtsov for minor leaguer William Lockwood and a 2026 seventh-round draft pick in what's essentially a salary dump. More will come off the cap Sunday when Leschyshyn is either claimed by another team or clears waivers and is sent to the minors.

            Coach Gerard Gallant didn't learn of the trade until after the game and wished Kravtsov the best.

            “He really worked hard and he tried this year, and we just couldn’t find a spot in our lineup for him,” Gallant said. ”It gives him a fresh opportunity. He was a good kid here. He came and he worked hard every day with us, and it’s just an opportunity for our team.""

            An injury to defenseman Ryan Lindgren during the game also could make room for Kane. Lindgren took a hard hit into the boards with his left shoulder first and did not return.

            “Day to day,” Gallant said. ""We’ll know more tomorrow.”

            If Lindgren is expected to be out for more than 10 games and 24 days, he could be placed on long-term injured reserve. That would allow New York to move his $3 million salary off the books and perhaps hasten a trade that the NHL has been waiting for now for a few days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821794,Roslovic's 3rd period goals lift Blue Jackets over Edmonton,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Jack Roslovic scored twice in the third period on his way to a four-point game, and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Edmonton Oilers 6-5 Saturday despite giving up a four-goal lead.

            Kirill Marchenko also scored twice, Patrik Laine contributed a goal and two assists, Boone Jenner had a goal and one assist, and Johnny Gaudreau and Roslovic had two assists. Joonas Korpisalo stopped 48 shots — including 24 in the third period — to help Columbus snap a two-game losing streak.

            Connor McDavid had two goals and two assists for Edmonton, and Warren Foegele and Leon Draisaitl each had a goal. Brett Kulak and Tyson Barrie each had two assists and Jack Campbell stopped 10 shots before being replaced at 5:56 of the second by Stuart Skinner, who also stopped 10.











            “Anytime we can get a win it’s uplifting,” Roslovic said. “It’s good for all the guys.”

            Edmonton is in third place in the Pacific Division, two points behind the Los Angeles Kings. The Blue Jackets are tied with Anaheim for last place in the NHL.

            Columbus seemed to be on its way to an easy win with four unanswered goals to start the game — Marchenko in the first and second period, and second-period goals from Jenner and Laine.

            Foegele put Edmonton on the board at 6:40 of the second and opened the floodgates. The Oilers scored three more times that period. Draisaitl’s notched his NHL-leading 23rd power play goal, McDavid got one at 12:51 and his team-leading third short-handed score less than two minutes later knotted the game at 4 apiece.

            Roslovic put Columbus in front to stay at 9:01 and made it 6-4 with just over 5 minutes remaining. 

            “At 4-2 we had two or three great looks to get to 5-2, which we don’t get,” Blue Jackets coach Brad Larsen said. “Then we gave it up, and they got some momentum from there. They carried that right in the third. They were peppering us. Korpi really stood tall, and then we made them pay for a couple of mistakes, That was the key.”

            Hyman added Edmonton’s final goal at 17:04.

            “I know we mounted a comeback with some people that had some good efforts, but too many passengers today for us,” Oilers coach Jay Woodcroft said. “In the end, we were not detailed enough, and we were made to pay. All credit to Columbus for playing hard ... But I believe we beat ourselves today.”

            SIMPLY THE BEST

            McDavid padded his NHL lead in goals (48) and points (112), including a league-leading 32 multi-point games. He currently has a six-game point streak and has 11 points in his last three games. This was his 10th four-point game this season.

            KIRILL THE THRILL

            Kirill Marchenko’s 16 goals this season put him second in the league among rookie scorers behind Seattle’s Matty Beniers (19). He is tied with Cole Sillinger and Boone Jenner for the third most rookie goals in Blue Jackets history and became the team’s second ever rookie to record at least three multi-goal games in a single season, following Serge Aubin in 2000-01 (the club’s inaugural season).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821795,Hundreds of protesters denounce racism in Tunisia,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) — Hundreds of protesters in Tunisia's capital took to the streets on Saturday to denounce racism and express solidarity towards migrants after the country's increasingly authoritarian leader claimed there’s a plot to erase his country’s identity by bringing in sub-Saharan Africans. 

            People shouting “no to racism,” “solidarity with migrants” and “no to police crackdown” marched through central Tunis as part of the demonstration staged by Tunisia’s journalists union and several nongovernmental organizations.

            President Kais Saied said earlier this week that “urgent measures” were needed to address the entry of irregular immigrants from sub-Saharan countries, “with their lot of violence, crimes and unacceptable practices.”











            The spokesperson for the Tunisian Forum for Social and Economic Rights, Romdhane Ben Amor, deplored an increasing number of racist assaults against sub-Saharan migrants following Saied's remarks. 

            “We noted attempts to drive some migrants out of their homes,” he told The Associated Press. “Others are being prevented from taking public transportation.” 

            Tunisian comedian Fatma Saidane denounced “deplorable actions” targeting some sub-Saharan people and called on people to show a civic-minded attitude.

            “We must not assault or insult people who live on our soil, in the same way we don’t accept our compatriots to be ill-treated in Europe,” she said. 

            In recent days, about 100 sub-Saharan migrants have been detained for having illegally crossed the Tunisian border, according to Riadh Nouioui, the deputy prosecutor of Kasserine, a mountainous region close to Algeria. Other migrants enter the country from neighbouring Libya. 

            Saied’s comments raised a storm on social media and condemnation from NGOs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821797,Media drop Dilbert after creator's Black 'hate group' remark,"The creator of the Dilbert comic strip faced a backlash of cancellations Saturday while defending remarks describing people who are Black as members of “a hate group” from which white people should “get away.”

            Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments by Dilbert creator Scott Adams as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.

            Andrews McMeel Syndication, which distributes Dilbert, did not immediately respond Saturday to requests for comment. But Adams defended himself on social media against those whom he said ""hate me and are canceling me.”











            Dilbert is a long-running comic that pokes fun at office-place culture. 

            The backlash began following an episode this past week of the YouTube show, “Real Coffee with Scott Adams.” Among other topics, Adams referenced a Rasmussen Reports survey that had asked whether people agreed with the statement “It's OK to be white.""

            Most agreed, but Adams noted that 26% of Black respondents disagreed and others weren't sure.

            The Anti-Defamation League says the phrase was popularized in 2017 as a trolling campaign by members of the discussion forum 4chan but then began being used by some white supremacists.

            Adams, who is white, repeatedly referred to people who are Black as members of a “hate group” or a “racist hate group” and said he would no longer “help Black Americans."" 

            “Based on the current way things are going, the best advice I would give to white people is to get the hell away from Black people,” Adams said on his Wednesday show. 

            In another episode of his online show Saturday, Adams said he had been making a point that “everyone should be treated as an individual” without discrimination.

            ""But you should also avoid any group that doesn’t respect you, even if there are people within the group who are fine,” Adams said. 

            
                The Los Angeles Times cited Adams' “racist comments” while announcing Saturday that Dilbert will be discontinued Monday in most editions and that its final run in the Sunday comics — which are printed in advance — will be March 12. 

            
                The San Antonio Express-News, which is part of Hearst Newspapers, said Saturday that it will drop the Dilbert comic strip, effective Monday, “because of hateful and discriminatory public comments by its creator.” 

            
                The USA Today Network tweeted Friday that it also will stop publishing Dilbert ""due to recent discriminatory comments by its creator.”

            
                The Plain Dealer in Cleveland and other publications that are part of Advance Local media also announced that they are dropping Dilbert. 

            “This is a decision based on the principles of this news organization and the community we serve,” wrote Chris Quinn, editor of The Plain Dealer. ”We are not a home for those who espouse racism. We certainly do not want to provide them with financial support.""

            Christopher Kelly, vice president of content for NJ Advance Media, wrote that the news organization believes in “the free and fair exchange of ideas.”

            “But when those ideas cross into hate speech, a line must be drawn,” Kelly wrote.The creator of the Dilbert comic strip faced a backlash of cancellations Saturday while defending remarks describing people who are Black as members of “a hate group” from which white people should “get away.”Various media publishers across the U.S. denounced the comments by Dilbert creator Scott Adams as racist, hateful and discriminatory while saying they would no longer provide a platform for his work.Andrews McMeel Syndication, which distributes Dilbert, did not immediately respond Saturday to requests for comment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821799,Rights to 'Crying Indian' ad to go to Native American group,"Since its debut in 1971, an anti-pollution ad showing a man in Native American attire shed a single tear at the sight of smokestacks and litter taking over a once unblemished landscape has become an indelible piece of TV pop culture. 

            It's been referenced over the decades since on shows like “The Simpsons” and “South Park” and in internet memes. But now a Native American advocacy group that was given the rights to the long-parodied public service announcement is retiring it, saying it has always been inappropriate.

            The so-called “Crying Indian” with his buckskins and long braids made the late actor Iron Eyes Cody a recognizable face in households nationwide. But to many Native Americans, the public service announcement has been a painful reminder of the enduring stereotypes they face.











            The nonprofit that originally commissioned the advertisement, Keep America Beautiful, had long been considering how to retire the ad and announced this week that it's doing so by transferring ownership of the rights to the National Congress of American Indians.

            “Keep America Beautiful wanted to be careful and deliberate about how we transitioned this iconic advertisement/public service announcement to appropriate owners,” Noah Ullman, a spokesperson for the nonprofit, said via e-mail. “We spoke to several Indigenous peoples’ organizations and were pleased to identify the National Congress of American Indians as a potential caretaker.”

            NCAI plans to end the use of the ad and watch for any unauthorized use.

            “NCAI is proud to assume the role of monitoring the use of this advertisement and ensure it is only used for historical context; this advertisement was inappropriate then and remains inappropriate today,” said NCAI Executive Director Larry Wright, Jr. “NCAI looks forward to putting this advertisement to bed for good.”

            When it premiered in the 1970s, the ad was a sensation. It led to Iron Eyes Cody filming three follow-up PSAs. He spent more than 25 years making public appearances and visits to schools on behalf of the anti-litter campaign, according to an Associated Press obituary. 

            From there, Cody, who was Italian American but claimed to have Cherokee heritage through his father, was typecast as a stock Native American character, appearing in over 80 films. Most of the time, his character was simply “Indian,” “Indian Chief” or “Indian Joe.” 

            His movie credits from the 1950s-1980s included “Sitting Bull,” The Great Sioux Massacre,"" Nevada Smith, “A Man Called Horse” and “Ernest Goes to Camp."" On television, he appeared in “Bonanza,” “Gunsmoke” and “Rawhide” among others. He also was a technical adviser on Native American matters on film sets.

            Dr. Jennifer J. Folsom, a journalism and media communication professor at Colorado State University and a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, remembers watching the public service announcement as a child. 

            “At that point, every single person who showed up with braids and buckskins, on TV or anywhere in the movies, I glommed on to that because it was such a rare thing to see,” said Folsom, whose areas of study include Native American pop culture. “I did see how people littered, and I did see how the creeks and the rivers were getting polluted.”

            But as she grew up, Folsom noticed how media devoted little coverage to Native American environmental activists. 

            “There’s no agency for that sad so-called Indian guy sitting in a canoe, crying,” Folsom said. “I think it has done damage to public perception and support for actual Native people doing things to protect the land and protect the environment.”

            She applauded Keep America Beautiful's decision as an “appropriate move.” It will mean a trusted group can help control the narrative the ad has promoted for over 50 years, she said.

            The ad's power has arguably already faded as Native and Indigenous youths come of age with a greater consciousness about stereotypes and cultural appropriation. TikTok has plenty of examples of Native people parodying or doing a takedown of the advertisement, Folsom said.

            Robert “Tree” Cody, the adopted son of Iron Eyes Cody, said the advertisement had “good intent and good heart” at its core.

            “It was one of the top 100 commercials,” said Robert Cody, an enrolled member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona. 

            And, it reminded him of time spent with his father, said Cody, who lives at Santa Ana Pueblo in New Mexico.

            “I remember a lot, even when he went on a movie set to finish his movies and stuff,” Cody said. “I remember going out to Universal (Studios), Disney, places like that.”

            His wife, Rachel Kee-Cody, can't help but feel somewhat sad that an ad that means so much to their family will be shelved. But she is resigned to the decision.

            “You know, times are changing as well. You keep going no matter how much it changes,” she said. “Disappointment. ... It'll pass.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821801,"Haaland breaks scoring record, City keeps pace with Arsenal","Erling Haaland has already taken one of Sergio Aguero's scoring records for Manchester City.

            At this rate, surely more will fall.

            With one of City's goals in a routine 4-1 win at Bournemouth on Saturday, Haaland made it 27 for the season in the English Premier League. That's more than any player has scored in a single campaign for City since the league started in 1992.











            Aguero had the previous highest total of 26 in 2014-15, part of his record all-time haul of 260 for City in all competitions.

            The scary thing about Haaland is that he still has 13 matches remaining in the league. He is closing in on Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah's record haul of 32 in a 38-game season as well as the 34 of Andy Cole and Alan Shearer — achieved back when there were 42 games per season.

            Haaland won't score many easier goals than his finish from three meters at Vitality Stadium that helped City ease to a win to keep on the shoulder of Arsenal in the title race.

            Arsenal earlier won at Leicester 1-0, a result that was more resounding than the scoreline suggested.

            Arsenal stayed two points clear of second-placed City with a game to spare.

            There was more movement at the bottom of the standings, with victories for Leeds and West Ham lifting both teams out of the relegation zone and dropping Everton and Bournemouth into it.

            EASY FOR ARSENAL

            Arsenal looks to have gotten over its blip.

            Since collecting one point from a three-game stretch that let City back into the title race, Arsenal has gained back-to-back wins on the road with manager Mikel Arteta saying the team has gone back to basics.

            Gabriel Martinelli scored the 46th-minute winner at King Power Stadium, poking in a finish after running onto Leandro Trossard's pass. Trossard and Bukayo Saka had goals disallowed either side of Martinelli's strike.

            It built on the 4-2 win at Aston Villa last week. 

            “Sometimes the wave is created very far from the beach,"" Arteta said. “Then it’s too late to avoid what is going to happen. We had to improve on those things and today we’ve done that really well.”

            EASIER FOR CITY

            Haaland scored either side of Julian Alvarez and Phil Foden, with an own-goal by Chris Mepham wrapping up the scoring for City against Bournemouth.

            It is six consecutive matches without a clean sheet for Pep Guardiola’s team, however, after Jefferson Lerma’s 83rd-minute strike for the hosts.

            LIVERPOOL HELD

            After conceding five goals to Real Madrid in the Champions League in midweek, Liverpool at least tightened up at the back in a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace.

            Jurgen Klopp's team was short of attacking inspiration, however, with Darwin Nunez out injured. Mohamed Salah curled a shot against the crossbar in a game of few real chances at Selhurst Park.

            Liverpool moved up one place to seventh and is six points off the Champions League qualification positions with a game in hand.

            WINNING START

            Javi Gracia launched his Leeds reign with a 1-0 win over Southampton in a match between teams who started as the bottom two.

            Junior Firpo scored in the 77th minute to secure Leeds' first win since Dec. 26. Leeds jumped two places and out of the relegation zone, leaving Southampton rooted to last place and four points adrift of safety.

            Bournemouth is in next-to-last place and on the same number of points as Everton, which was beaten at home by Aston Villa 2-0 thanks to goals by Ollie Watkins — who has scored in five straight games — and Emi Buendia.

            West Ham started the day in third-to-last place but swept past Nottingham Forest with a 4-0 thrashing.

            All of the goals came in the final 20 minutes, with Danny Ings scoring twice before Declan Rice and Michail Antonio added others.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821802,"Capitals beat Rangers to end skid, hand NY 4th straight loss","WASHINGTON (AP) — A game that had everything from highlight-reel goals and a fight to a potentially significant injury left one playoff-bound team searching for answers and gave a fading rival a glimmer of hope with plenty of regret about not turning things around sooner.

            T.J. Oshie and Evgeny Kuznetsov each scored twice, Tom Wilson had a goal against the team he's ruffled the most during his NHL career and Washington Capitals beat the New York Rangers 6-3 on Saturday, snapping their six-game skid.

            “Divisional opponent coming in and big rivalry, emotional game, sometimes those are the ones that a team comes together,” Wilson said. “We showed up ready to play.”











            The Rangers' rough run continued with their fourth consecutive loss, which included a costly injury coming on top of another defensive letdown. Top-pairing defenseman Ryan Lindgren left in the first period after taking a hard hit from Oshie into the boards with his left shoulder first and did not return.

            Coach Gerard Gallant had no postgame update on Lindgren's status. But he called the hit “dirty"" and “cheap,” and his players immediately knew it wasn't good.

            “He’s a real heart-and-soul guy who does everything for our team,"" forward Chris Kreider said. “It definitely hurts the team a lot to lose Ryan like that. Really isn’t another Ryan Lindgren, so it’s a big loss for us.”

            Lindgren's injury could affect New York's plans ahead of the trade deadline Friday and possibly open the door to acquire longtime Chicago winger Patrick Kane sooner rather than later. They also made a couple of off-ice moves during the game to set that process in motion.

            But while Kane can produce plenty offensively — his 1,225 points rank fourth among U.S. players — the three-time Stanley Cup champion doesn't solve New York's problem of keeping the puck out of its own net. Even All-Star goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who denied countryman Alex Ovechkin and others with some big saves, couldn't save the day against the Capitals, giving up five goals on 22 shots before getting pulled after two periods.

            “It wasn’t the goalie’s fault, trust me,” Gallant said. ""It was more the team. It was all the team.”

            Kuznetsov scored one time each against Shesterkin and Jaroslav Halak, while Sonny Milano had Washington's other goal. Beyond scoring twice, Oshie fought Barclay Goodrow, who was unhappy with the hit on Lindgren, and assisted on Milano's goal to give him a Gordie Howe Hat Trick.

            “I get paid a lot of money to put offense up on the board and haven’t been doing it as of late,” Oshie said. “Felt good to get a couple.”

            The crowd erupted each time, silencing the many fans in blue who started “Let's Go Rangers!” chants early and had only Goodrow's deflection goal in the first period and one each from Kreider and Kaapo Kakko in the third to celebrate.

            There hasn't been much to be happy about for the Capitals lately, given their struggles and the trade Thursday of defenseman Dmitry Orlov and winger Garnet Hathaway, though this game, with an offensive outburst and Darcy Kuemper's 23 saves, provided a much-needed respite.

            Washington is still expected to trade more pending free agents before the deadline but with the win got to 64 points and remains in the thick of the Eastern Conference wild-card race.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsWASHINGTON (AP) — A game that had everything from highlight-reel goals and a fight to a potentially significant injury left one playoff-bound team searching for answers and gave a fading rival a glimmer of hope with plenty of regret about not turning things around sooner.T.J. Oshie and Evgeny Kuznetsov each scored twice, Tom Wilson had a goal against the team he's ruffled the most during his NHL career and Washington Capitals beat the New York Rangers 6-3 on Saturday, snapping their six-game skid.“Divisional opponent coming in and big rivalry, emotional game, sometimes those are the ones that a team comes together,” Wilson said. “We showed up ready to play.”The Rangers' rough run continued with their fourth consecutive loss, which included a costly injury coming on top of another defensive letdown. Top-pairing defenseman Ryan Lindgren left in the first period after taking a hard hit from Oshie into the boards with his left shoulder first and did not return.Coach Gerard Gallant had no postgame update on Lindgren's status. But he called the hit “dirty"" and “cheap,” and his players immediately knew it wasn't good.“He’s a real heart-and-soul guy who does everything for our team,"" forward Chris Kreider said. “It definitely hurts the team a lot to lose Ryan like that. Really isn’t another Ryan Lindgren, so it’s a big loss for us.”Lindgren's injury could affect New York's plans ahead of the trade deadline Friday and possibly open the door to acquire longtime Chicago winger Patrick Kane sooner rather than later. They also made a couple of off-ice moves during the game to set that process in motion.But while Kane can produce plenty offensively — his 1,225 points rank fourth among U.S. players — the three-time Stanley Cup champion doesn't solve New York's problem of keeping the puck out of its own net. Even All-Star goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who denied countryman Alex Ovechkin and others with some big saves, couldn't save the day against the Capitals, giving up five goals on 22 shots before getting pulled after two periods.“It wasn’t the goalie’s fault, trust me,” Gallant said. ""It was more the team. It was all the team.”Kuznetsov scored one time each against Shesterkin and Jaroslav Halak, while Sonny Milano had Washington's other goal. Beyond scoring twice, Oshie fought Barclay Goodrow, who was unhappy with the hit on Lindgren, and assisted on Milano's goal to give him a Gordie Howe Hat Trick.“I get paid a lot of money to put offense up on the board and haven’t been doing it as of late,” Oshie said. “Felt good to get a couple.”The crowd erupted each time, silencing the many fans in blue who started “Let's Go Rangers!” chants early and had only Goodrow's deflection goal in the first period and one each from Kreider and Kaapo Kakko in the third to celebrate.There hasn't been much to be happy about for the Capitals lately, given their struggles and the trade Thursday of defenseman Dmitry Orlov and winger Garnet Hathaway, though this game, with an offensive outburst and Darcy Kuemper's 23 saves, provided a much-needed respite.Washington is still expected to trade more pending free agents before the deadline but with the win got to 64 points and remains in the thick of the Eastern Conference wild-card race.The Rangers are solidly in as one of the top three teams in the Metropolitan Division, but another defeat hurt their chances of keeping pace with the second-place New Jersey Devils, who could also make a move or two before the deadline in advance of the teams' potential first-round showdown.UP NEXTRangers: Host the Los Angeles Kings on Sunday.Capitals: Visit the Buffalo Sabres on Sunday.___Follow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821803,Official: Heavy ice a possible factor in Alaska gym collapse,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An Anchorage official says thick, heavy ice had accumulated on the roof of a gym that collapsed earlier this month, killing one person and trapping two others. 

            Ross Noffsinger, acting building official for the city, said “tremendous” ice buildup on the roof of the Turnagain CrossFit gym far exceeded the weight listed by the city's design and construction standards, the Anchorage Daily News reported Friday. 

            The collapse happened the evening of Feb. 17, during a fitness competition. One woman was killed in the collapse and two others were temporarily trapped. More than 10 people were inside the gym at the time.











            “The roof area in general is quite large, and it looks like a substantial portion of the roof was sloping in that direction,” Noffsigner said, indicating the northeast corner of the building where the gym was located.

            Noffsinger said the city is still waiting on an engineer's structural report and more analysis must be done before officials reach a final conclusion. But he said the weight of the ice may have been more than double the city's design criteria of 40 pounds of snow or ice per square foot. 

            A contractor hired by the building owner said that while ice may have been a factor, other issues may have contributed to the collapse. Chuck Dunn of Dunn Contractors and Associates said he is working with a structural engineering company and their analysis will include the building's condition, history and building materials. 

            “We have a lot to determine still, so it’s premature to say what the cause was,” Dunn said.ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An Anchorage official says thick, heavy ice had accumulated on the roof of a gym that collapsed earlier this month, killing one person and trapping two others.Ross Noffsinger, acting building official for the city, said “tremendous” ice buildup on the roof of the Turnagain CrossFit gym far exceeded the weight listed by the city's design and construction standards, the Anchorage Daily News reported Friday.The collapse happened the evening of Feb. 17, during a fitness competition.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821804,No. 8 Utah beats No. 3 Stanford to share 1st Pac-12 title,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah will enter the Pac-12 Tournament as a champion.

            Gianna Kneepkens scored a season-high 28 points to lead the No. 8 Utes to an 84-78 victory over No. 3 Stanford on Saturday. Utah earned a share of their first regular-season Pac-12 Conference title with the win.

            Alissa Pili finished with 14 points and Kennedy McQueen had 10 points, five rebounds, four assists and six steals for Utah (25-3, 15-3), which shares the conference title with Stanford.











            The Utes claimed a share of the Pac-12 crown only two seasons after winning just five total games. 

            “That’s my job and I’m stubborn,” Utah coach Lynne Roberts said. “I wouldn’t believe that it couldn’t happen. I knew we could do it. I knew it could happen.”

            Hannah Jump led Stanford (27-4, 15-3) with 24 points. Cameron Brink had 14 points, 12 rebounds and six assists for the Cardinal, while Haley Jones added nine points and eight rebounds.

            Utah led the entire second half, but Stanford pulled within one at 73-72 after Brink and Jones combined to make four straight baskets. Kneepkens knocked down a 3-pointer to keep the Cardinal from erasing the deficit completely.

            The Utes then forced three straight turnovers in the final minute to secure the win.

            “They were more aggressive, and our turnovers were bad,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “Our lack of execution (hurt us). They were the better team.”

            Stanford seized a quick 9-0 lead after making four straight baskets, culminating in back-to-back jumpers from Jump. Utah used stout defense to erase the deficit, going ahead 10-9 on a pair of free throws from Kelsey Rees. The Utes held the Cardinal scoreless for five minutes and forced four turnovers in that stretch.

            Utah built a seven-point lead during the second quarter behind hot shooting from Kneepkens. She scored 12 points in the quarter, culminating in a 3-pointer that put the Utes up 40-33. Kneepkens gave Utah’s offense a spark while Pili sat the final nine minutes of the first half after picking up her third foul.

            She credited Roberts’ trust in her abilities for helping the Utes weather Pili’s absence. 

            “We don’t have to play tentative out there,” Kneepkens said. “We can just play free.”

            The Utes made 5 of 7 shots to open the second half and went ahead 52-40 on back-to-back baskets from Kneepkens and Issy Palmer.

            Second-chance baskets sparked a Stanford rally. The Cardinal scored 11 second-chance points in the third quarter after being held scoreless in that category during the first half. Stanford trimmed the deficit to a basket, cutting Utah’s lead to 59-57 on a layup from Jones.

            The Cardinal never came close enough to go ahead of the Utes after Utah kept getting stops at critical junctures while taking care of the ball.

            “We caught them off-guard a little bit with how we were defending,” Roberts said. “21 turnovers is not normal for them. Conversely, we only had 10. I think that’s where the game was won.”

            PICKING POCKETS

            McQueen keyed Utah’s relentless defense with a career-high in steals. The sophomore guard is pacing the Utes with a team-high 1.1 steals per game this season. 

            Roberts said McQueen has an incredibly high motor and teammates credit her with helping improve their individual games with her defensive tenacity in practices. 

            “She makes all of us better each day,” Kneepkins said. “Kennedy uses her athleticism super well to get boards and just scrap on defense. You can watch her and take pointers from her.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Stanford: The Cardinal dominated on the glass, outrebounding Utah 37-23. That gave Stanford numerous critical extra possessions against a tenacious Ute defense.

            Utah: The Utes were proficient in disrupting Stanford’s offense and capitalizing on turnovers. Utah scored 26 points off 21 Cardinal turnovers. 

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Beating a top-5 Stanford team should boost Utah back into the top 5.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821811,Judge orders ex-jail union boss to be freed in bribery case,"NEW YORK (AP) — A powerful New York jail union boss-turned-prison inmate is poised to go free less than halfway through his sentence in a corruption case, after a judge decided this week that the nearly five-year term should be reduced. 

            Norman Seabrook originally was sentenced to 58 months in prison on his federal conviction for taking bribes to put $20 million in union pension money into a risky hedge fund. The union lost $19 million. 

            But U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein said Seabrook's sentence is now unfair — because a co-defendant appealed and got his own prison term reduced to just over a year. 











            “There is now an unjust disparity” between the defendants' sentences, Hellerstein wrote in an opinion Thursday. Hellerstein himself originally sentenced both defendants.

            Seabrook, 63, has served about 21 months. He remains in custody for now, as Hellerstein put the ruling on hold for 10 days while prosecutors decide whether to appeal.

            Prosecutors declined to comment Saturday. A message was sent to Seabrook's attorney.

            As head of the New York City Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association for two decades, Seabrook became a political powerbroker and held huge influence over how the city's Rikers Island jail complex operated. He made as much as $300,000 per year.

            Prosecutors said he accepted a $60,000 kickback — delivered in a luxury Ferragamo handbag — in exchange for getting the union to invest in the hedge fund. Seabrook maintained that he did nothing wrong, and that the union simply made a bad investment.

            After a 2017 mistrial, Seabrook wasconvicted the next year, though he ultimately didn't have to report to prison until May 2021. 

            Meanwhile, co-defendant Murray Huberfeld, a principal in the hedge fund, pleaded guilty to arranging the payoff. 

            Hellerstein sentenced Huberfeld to 30 months, aiming for “approximate equivalence"" between his and Seabrook's punishment, as the judge explained in Thursday's ruling.

            Then Huberfeld successfully appealed his sentence, which was trimmed to 13 months. 

            In light of that development, Hellerstein concluded that releasing Seabrook now “reflects the seriousness of Seabrook's crime and lack of timely acceptance of responsibility, while also remedying what would otherwise be an unjust sentencing disparity” between the defendants.NEW YORK (AP) — A powerful New York jail union boss-turned-prison inmate is poised to go free less than halfway through his sentence in a corruption case, after a judge decided this week that the nearly five-year term should be reduced.Norman Seabrook originally was sentenced to 58 months in prison on his federal conviction for taking bribes to put $20 million in union pension money into a risky hedge fund.

            “We told them there was going to be adversity, and you had to look adversity in the face and smile and then slap the crap out of it,"" Kansas State coach Jerome Tang said. ""And they did. And I was so proud.”

            The Wildcats lost four of five before going on the streak. Tang said the team has responded because it has stayed focused internally and ignored critics. 

            “You don’t know who’s sick,"" he told reporters. “You don’t know whose family member passed away. You don’t know any of those things. And you just watch them on the floor and make a judgment about, ‘Did they play well, or didn’t they play well.'

            Oklahoma State led 35-31 late in the first half, but Kansas State's Desi Stills got a steal and layup as time expired to cut the Cowboys' lead to two.

            “That was very important because we were down four and we needed to cut the lead to at least two ... And we just came out there in the second half with more energy and we responded well,"" Stills said. 

            Boone went to work early in the second half. He scored a dunk and a layup in the first 63 seconds of the second half to extend Oklahoma State's lead to six.

            Kansas State rallied, and Nowell's deep 3 after a scramble put the Wildcats ahead 40-39.

            The game remained tight throughout the second half until Kansas State went on a run. Back-to-back 3-pointers by Johnson and Ismael Massoud put Kansas State ahead 65-60 with just over five minutes remaining, and the Wildcats hung on.

            “Just didn’t finish well enough,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Boynton said. “We had opportunities, like most of the games in this league save for our last two. These games usually come down to the last four minutes, and the team that executes the best, gets the best shots, is connected defensively, finishes plays with rebounds and makes free throws, usually wins. We didn’t do any of those things well enough.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Kansas State: The Wildcats appear to be back on track. Tang said it was an important win because it came on the road against what he believes is an NCAA Tournament team.

            Oklahoma State: The Cowboys had allowed at least 85 points in its previous three games and allowed 49% shooting in this one. It's a tough slide for a team that had a five-game win streak before the current skid. Their defense will need to step up, or they might not make the NCAA Tournament.

            QUOTABLE

            “I was too demonstrative. I didn’t say anything. I made sure on radio my mom heard that I didn’t say anything that would have gotten me a (technical). But I was demonstrative. I was demonstrative on purpose. I didn’t feel like — there were some tick-tack calls that went their way that resulted in and-ones, and there were some physical plays that didn’t go our way that didn’t result in what I wanted. ... I believe that it inspired our guys to play a little bit harder, to fight a little harder."" — Tang discussing his second-half technical when the Wildcats were down 53-49.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821818,No. 4 UConn pulls out 72-69 win over DePaul,"CHICAGO (AP) — Aaliyah Edwards scored 16 points, including two clutch baskets down the stretch, and No. 4 UConn edged DePaul 72-69 on Saturday to clinch at least a share of the Big East regular season championship.

            DePaul led by as much seven in the second half and was nursing a four-point lead late in the fourth of a tight, physical, contest, but Edwards and Lou Lopez Sénéchal scored to tie it at 65 with 3:10 left.

            Then Edwards scored off a turnover with 2:40 to go to put the Huskies ahead. Nika Mühl nailed 3-pointer from the corner with 1:13 to go for a 70-65 UConn lead.











            Anaya Peoples hit two free throws and then layup with 17 seconds left to pull the Blue Demons to within one. DePaul star Aneesah Morrow raced down the court in the final seconds with a chance to win it, but was forced into a turnover with nine seconds left.

            “It speaks to our maturity as a team,” Edwards said of the wild finish. ""We know that we can close out these types of games.

            “Just us competing and being tough is really what it comes down to. No game is going to be easy. As you know, we've been dealing with stuff like this all season.”

            Little has come easy for the injury-riddled Huskies this season. Just ask coach Geno Auriemma

            “I've seen things this year I haven't seen in 30 years,” Auriemma said. ""They find a way, we're living on the edge, but they find a way to make one big play after another after another after another.

            “We might not play well for 37 minutes and play and play great in three minutes and win the game. It's probably playing better that playing great for 37 minutes and losing the game.”

            Aubrey Griffin finished with 14 points and nine rebounds for UConn (26-5, 17-2 Big East)

            Huskies forward Dorka Juhász scored 13 points and pulled in eight rebounds despite suffering an ankle injury with 1:12 left in the first quarter. She scored 10 of UConn’s first 17 points before getting hurt, then returned in the second quarter after receiving treatment. 

            Morrow scored 25 points and pulled in eight rebounds, but the Blue Demons (15-15, 8-11) lost another tight one to the Huskies. DePaul has dropped 23 straight to UConn, dating to Dec. 29, 1983.

            “You aren't supposed to get any stars of your forehead for playing hard,"" DePaul coach Doug Bruno said. ""We competed, but we didn’t execute in the fourth quarter on both sides of the ball.

            “We needed some defensive stops and didn't get it. We needed some better offensive looks and didn't get it.”

            Morrow was dominant despite frequently facing tight double-team coverage by the Huskies. Darrione Rogers scored 15 and Keke Rimmer had 10 points and 10 rebounds. Peoples finished with 11 points.

            The teams were tied 37 all after a tight, physical first half. DePaul scored the first five points for the biggest lead either team had in the opening 20 minutes.

            Morrow had 10 points and six rebounds in the half while playing 19 minutes. Griffin matched Juhász with 10 points in the half.

            Rimmer hit a jumper from the paint with 25 seconds left in the third to give DePaul a 57-50 lead, a seven-point margin that was the largest in the game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821829,No. 9 Baylor rallies after George injury to beat No. 8 Texas,"WACO, Texas (AP) — Jalen Bridges, birthday big man Flo Thamba and the rest of ninth-ranked Baylor came together after freshman standout Keyonte George hopped off the court injured early with the Bears in a huge hole.

            “He’s young. He has loads of energy. So, when he went out, we just tried to bond together and pick up that energy that he would be out there providing and really just locking in on defense, get stops,” Bridges said. “It just changed the game around for us.”

            
                Bridges had 17 points for the Bears, who went on to beat Big 12 co-leader and No. 8 Texas 81-72 on Saturday after the Longhorns had jumped out to a 14-point lead.











            Adam Flagler added 14 points for the Bears (21-8, 10-6 Big 12), while seldom-used Dale Bonner added 13 points. Thamba, a fifth-year senior playing on his birthday, had 12 points and 12 rebounds for his 13th career double-double.

            
                Dylan Disu had a season-high 24 points for Texas (22-7, 11-5), which never led after halftime. Tyrese Hunter had 13 points for the Longhorns, while Rice and Timmy Allen each had 12. Marcus Carr scored 11.

            The Longhorns went into Saturday tied with reigning national champion and third-ranked Kansas for the Big 12 lead. With two regular-season games left, Baylor avoided being eliminated from a still-slim chance to share in its third Big 12 title in a row.

            George entered the game averaging 16.9 points, third among Division I freshmen. He got hurt when he took an awkward step when dribbling past midcourt, and lost the ball after taking another step. He then left the court, bypassing the Baylor bench and disappearing into the tunnel that leads to the locker room.

            “I don’t know how bad his ankle is or how long he'll be out,” Baylor coach Scott Drew said. “But I do know one thing, and that is coaches really appreciate and value toughness. And he had a 102 (degree) fever yesterday. I didn’t think he’d play and he gave it a go.”

            Without giving a timetable, Drew said he expected George to be back “soon because he’s a tough kid.”

            Sir’Jabari Rice was fouled on a drive as play continued, and hit both free throws to put the Longhorns up 18-4 with 11:32 left in the first half. Baylor then scored 25 of the next 30 points, including 18 in a row. 

            “They got a bit more aggressive on the defensive end and I guess that led to us, you know, turning over the ball and (them) getting easy offense,” Carr said. “They’re a team that once they get into rhythm, then they start hitting shots and they’re much tougher to defend.”

            BONNER'S BIG STRETCH

            Bonner put Baylor ahead by double figures for the first time with a 3-pointer that made it 50-40 with 14:15 left. Bonner had two steals in a 40-second span soon after that, turning both into layups.

            “Dale Bonner played a lot early, was out of the rotation, but was an unbelievable teammate and supported his team, but kept working on his game and stayed ready,” Drew said. “Today I couldn’t be any more happy and pleased for him.""

            The Wildcats (24-5, 13-5 Pac-12) led by 10 before going more than six minutes without a field goal as Arizona State pulled ahead by one.

            The Sun Devils (20-9, 11-7) went up 86-85 on Warren Washington’s layup with just a minute left, but Pelle Larsson put Arizona back up on a layup with 29 seconds left.

            Arizona State’s DJ Horne missed a jumper with four seconds left and the Sun Devils had a final shot after Oumar Ballo hit 1 of 2 free throws.

            Catching the ball with 2.4 seconds left, Cambridge left the fans at McKale Center stunned, launching a shot from beyond half-court that sent his teammates charging onto the floor in celebration.

            “We were sitting on pocket aces and it happens sometimes,” Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said.

            Cedric Henderson Jr. led Arizona with 19 points and Azuoulas Tubelis added 17.

            In the first meeting, Arizona State went on a big run to open the second half, but Lloyd didn’t call a timeout, letting his team play through the adversity. The Wildcats responded with a run over their own for a 69-60 win on a night when neither team shot better than 37%.

            The rematch was all about the offense.

            The Sun Devils hit as many 3-pointers in the first eight minutes as they did the entire first game and shot 20 of 34 from the floor to lead 46-45.

            The Wildcats hit 16 of 27 shots, including Henderson’s buzzer-beating 3, but went 7 of 14 on free throws.

            The good shooting trailed off only slightly to start the second half.

            Arizona went on a short run to build a six-point lead and the Sun Devils started taking questionable shots, allowing the Wildcats to stretch it to 78-68.

            Even after turning up the defensive pressure to get back in it, Arizona State appeared to be down and out — until Cambridge came to the rescue, ending the Sun Devils’ five-game losing streak to Arizona.

            “A lot of people were jumping ship and thinking we’re not that team, but we are that team and the guys proved it tonight by going toe to toe with a team like Arizona on their home floor this late in the season,” Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley said.

            NUNEZ OUT

            Arizona State played without guard Austin Nunez, who was in concussion protocol after being injured against Utah last week.

            The freshman point guard is averaging 4.5 points while giving the Sun Devils an energy boost off the bench.

            FREE THROW WOES

            Arizona had a huge advantage in free throws, outscoring Arizona State by 12 at the line.

            The Wildcats could have used a few more to go in, finishing 23 of 34.

            “You’d like to be make one or two more, it probably makes a difference,” Lloyd said.

            BIG PICTURE

            Arizona State: The Sun Devils needed some kind of boost for their NCAA Tournament chances. One of the most stunning finishes in the history of the rivalry certainly should help.

            Arizona: The Wildcats were in control before going cold from the field at the wrong time. Their seniors will never forget how their final home game ended after Cambridge’s stunner.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821834,Miller leads No. 2 Alabama following pregame pat-down intro,"TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Brandon Miller and No. 2 Alabama eked out another close win in a week that has proved challenging on and off the court.

            Miller scored 24 points and Mark Sears made 7 of 8 free throws over the final 1:04 to help No. 2 Alabama secure an 86-83 victory over Arkansas on Saturday, following an overtime win at South Carolina on Wednesday.

            Miller delivered his second straight huge game since police alleged in courtroom testimony that Miller brought a gun to former teammate Darius Miles, who is charged with capital murder in a fatal shooting.











            The week's details cast a different light on Miller's regular pregame introduction, which is a Tide staffer giving him a pat down. That, coach Nate Oats said, is over.

            “I think that’s something that’s been going on all year,” Oats said to open his postgame news conference. “I don’t watch our introductions. I’m not involved with them. I'm drawing up plays at that time. Regardless, it’s not appropriate. It’s been addressed, and I can assure you it definitely will not happen again the remainder of this year.”

            Miller received a warmer reception at home than in South Carolina, where he heard chants of “lock him up” and “guilty” a day after testimony about the gun, which was allegedly used by another man in the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Jamea Harris on Jan. 15. 

            Miller hasn’t been accused of or charged with any crime — or missed any playing time. Miller’s attorney said Miller never handled the gun and that it had been left in his back seat. Police also said another Alabama player, guard Jaden Bradley, was at the scene. He started Saturday’s game and did not score.

            No players were made available and Oats declined to answer questions on the shooting case.

            But there was plenty on the court to talk about. 

            Miller's fellow freshman Nick Smith Jr. of Arkansas (19-10, 8-8 Southeastern Conference), another potential NBA draft lottery pick who helped keep the Razorbacks in it with a late 3-pointer, also scored 24 points. 

            Miller helped key a 15-0 run for Alabama (25-4, 15-1) by scoring six straight points and eight total for a 56-46 lead midway through the second half — just the second lead of the game for the Tide. Arkansas missed eight straight shots and four consecutive free throws during that span after leading most of the way.

            “We really struggled to start the second half,” Razorbacks coach Eric Musselman said. “That was the difference in the game, was a stretch there to start the second half.”

            The Razorbacks surged back with 20 points over the final 2:48, and Smith netted a 3 with 10 seconds left to make it 85-83. Rylan Griffen made the second of two free throws and Ricky Council IV's potential tying 3 attempt bounced off the rim. 

            Davonte Davis had 21 points for Arkansas, Council scored 20, and the rest of the team combined for 18 points.

            Miller, who scored 41 against South Carolina on Wednesday, missed his first five 3-point attempts while the team got off to a 1-for-20 start. He finally hit one with three minutes left.

            Oats said Miller may be the most mentally tough player he has ever coached. 

            He said his star freshman “completely understands that the situation is tragic, and he takes it very seriously,"" then added: “He's got a special way about getting locked in to where he's currently at, whether it's practice or games or whatever. He's been able to do that this week.""

            Jahvon Quinerly had 16 points and seven assists for the Tide. 

            “We don't win the game if he doesn't play the way he does in the second half,” Oats said. “We don't have a chance.”

            Noah Clowney produced 10 points and 13 rebounds.

            Arkansas held Alabama to only three 3s but the Tide scored 52 points in the paint.

            “You’re not going to take away both,” Musselman said. “You’re not going to do it. That’s why they’re ranked second in the country.”

            The Razorbacks used a 9-0 run followed by Smith's baseline jumper with 6 seconds left to take a 37-28 halftime lead. It was the Tide's lowest scoring first half since trailing No. 1 Houston 31-27 on Dec. 10 before rallying to win.

            BIG PICTURE

            Arkansas: Once a top 10 team, the Razorbacks couldn't pull off a third straight win. Arkansas kept it much closer than the earlier 84-69 Alabama win when Smith was out with a knee injury.

            Alabama: Dominated the boards in the second half 26-14 after both teams collected 22 rebounds in the first. Made 3 of 22 3-pointers (14%).

            NBA INTEREST

            A total of 34 representatives from 18 NBA teams were issued credentials for the showdown between Miller and Smith, who are arguably the two top prospects from the college ranks.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821835,"World Cup qualifying enters final days, with 10 spots left","There are still 10 spots left unclaimed for this summer’s Basketball World Cup, with all but one of them expected to be decided on Sunday.

            Angola became the 22nd team to qualify for the 32-team field, getting in on Saturday.

            Also already having qualified for the World Cup: co-hosts Japan and the Philippines, Australia, Canada, China, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jordan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Sudan, Spain and the U.S.











            SUNDAY LOOKAHEAD

            AMERICAS REGION

            The U.S. is in. Canada is in.

            And on Sunday’s last day of qualifying games, six teams are playing for five World Cup berths.

            It’s a somewhat complex formula. There are two groups of six teams, and the top three teams from each group — plus the best fourth-place team — will qualify.

            Canada won Group E and is 10-1. The U.S. won Group F and is 9-2. Their berths are locked.

            Everything else will be decided Sunday.

            In Group E, Argentina, Venezuela and Dominican Republic are all 8-3. In Group F, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil are all 7-4.

            In Group F, Puerto Rico plays at Colombia, Mexico plays at Uruguay and the U.S. plays at Brazil. It’s a meaningless game for the Americans, standings-wise — but not in terms of pride.

            “We came down here to get two,” U.S. coach Jim Boylen said after the Americans won at Uruguay to clinch their World Cup berth on Thursday.

            The Group E games have Bahamas at Panama, Canada at Venezuela and the Dominican Republic at Argentina. The winner of that game in Mar del Plata is certain to advance.

            EUROPE REGION

            There are three spots still unclaimed from Europe.

            Group I — This will be the last berth to get decided, because the games are on Monday.

            Serbia will advance if it beats Britain. If Serbia loses that game, Belgium would advance by beating Turkey. And if Belgium loses, Serbia advances regardless of its Monday result.

            Group K — Another spot will go to either Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, or Hungary. Montenegro advances with a win over the Czech Republic. Bosnia has to win over Hungary and have Montenegro lose. And Hungary has to not only have Montenegro lose, but it must beat Bosnia by at least 41 points. All those games are Sunday.

            Group L — Georgia and Iceland will play Sunday in Tbilisi to decide the last berth from Group L.

            It’s simple: If Georgia wins, it goes to the World Cup. If Georgia loses by three points or fewer, it still goes to the World Cup. If Iceland wins by four points or more, it goes to the World Cup.

            ASIA REGION

            There’s one spot left. This one doesn’t require much tiebreaker math.

            Iran and Kazakhstan are the last teams left with hope. If Iran beats China, it qualifies. If Kazakhstan beats Australia and Iran loses, Kazakhstan qualifies.

            AFRICA REGION

            Angola is headed to the World Cup for the ninth time.

            The berth was clinched Saturday with an 80-67 win over Cape Verde. Angola became the fourth team to qualify from the Africa Region, joining Ivory Coast, South Sudan and Egypt.

            There’s one spot left, with FIBA saying Tunisia, Senegal, Cape Verde and Nigeria remain in the running.

            Sunday’s schedule has Uganda vs. Guinea, Cameroon vs. Senegal, Cape Verde vs. Ivory Coast, Tunisia vs. Congo, Nigeria vs. Angola and South Sudan vs. Egypt.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821836,MATCHDAY: Man United v Newcastle in English League Cup final,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Sunday:

            ENGLAND

            The first trophy of the season is up for grabs when Manchester United plays Newcastle in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium. United is looking for a first piece of silverware since 2017, when the club won the League Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho. Newcastle has to go back to 1955 for its last major trophy, the FA Cup. It is the first final for Newcastle since the club was bought by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The teams are in third (United) and fifth (Newcastle) place, respectively, in the Premier League. League play continues with fourth-placed Tottenham at home to Chelsea, which is languishing in 10th place.











            SPAIN

            Barcelona looks to increase its league lead over Real Madrid to 10 points when it visits relegation-threatened Almeria. The Catalan club can add to the lead thanks to the rival's home draw against Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Barcelona is coming off elimination to Manchester United in the Europa League, ending its hopes of winning an international trophy this season. It is still mired in the controversy over payments to the vice-president of Spain’s refereeing committee, which has attracted widespread criticism across the country. Almeria has lost three in a row in the league, including 6-2 at Girona last week. Athletic Bilbao hosts Girona, while Valladolid visits Celta Vigo and Sevilla plays against Osasuna.

            ITALY

            With Napoli nearly 20 points ahead, it seems like a battle for second place in Serie A between Inter Milan (47 points), Roma (44), AC Milan (44), Lazio (42) and Atalanta (41). Inter visits Bologna in the lunchtime fixture without Federico Dimarco and Milan Skriniar, who are both injured. Milan hosts Atalanta at the San Siro in the late match with goalkeeper Mike Maignan ready to start his first match in five months.

            GERMANY

            Defending champion Bayern Munich hosts surprise challenger Union Berlin with first place in the Bundesliga at stake. Only goal difference separates the teams and both need to win to join new league leader Borussia Dortmund on 46 points. All three teams started the weekend on 43 but Dortmund won at Hoffenheim on Saturday. While Union is unbeaten across all competitions this year, Bayern drew its first three league games and lost at Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-2 last weekend. The Bavarian powerhouse has seen its four-point lead disappear since the winter break. But Bayern should be fresher for the game after a week to recover from the Gladbach defeat. Union has had little time to recover after beating Ajax 3-1 in their Europa League playoff on Thursday. Also, Freiburg welcomes Bayer Leverkusen in a duel between the other Europa League participants.

            FRANCE

            Marseille faces bitter rival Paris Saint-Germain knowing that a home victory would move it two points behind the league leader and open up the title race. PSG is under big pressure after losing five of its 12 games this year, including a French Cup defeat at Marseille this month. PSG takes on a confident Marseille which has only one defeat in its last 14 games. PSG narrowly avoided a fourth straight defeat last weekend when it trailed Lille at home before winning 4-3 thanks to Lionel Messi’s injury-time free kick. PSG is without injured forward Neymar and right back Achraf Hakimi but Marseille is missing its best defender Chancel Mbemba. The other main game sees high-flying Monaco hosting improving Nice in the Riviera derby.

United is looking for a first piece of silverware since 2017, when the club won the League Cup and Europa League under Jose Mourinho. Newcastle has to go back to 1955 for its last major trophy, the FA Cup. It is the first final for Newcastle since the club was bought by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The teams are in third (United) and fifth (Newcastle) place, respectively, in the Premier League. League play continues with fourth-placed Tottenham at home to Chelsea, which is languishing in 10th place.SPAINBarcelona looks to increase its league lead over Real Madrid to 10 points when it visits relegation-threatened Almeria. The Catalan club can add to the lead thanks to the rival's home draw against Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Barcelona is coming off elimination to Manchester United in the Europa League, ending its hopes of winning an international trophy this season. It is still mired in the controversy over payments to the vice-president of Spain’s refereeing committee, which has attracted widespread criticism across the country. Almeria has lost three in a row in the league, including 6-2 at Girona last week. Athletic Bilbao hosts Girona, while Valladolid visits Celta Vigo and Sevilla plays against Osasuna.ITALYWith Napoli nearly 20 points ahead, it seems like a battle for second place in Serie A between Inter Milan (47 points), Roma (44), AC Milan (44), Lazio (42) and Atalanta (41). Inter visits Bologna in the lunchtime fixture without Federico Dimarco and Milan Skriniar, who are both injured. Milan hosts Atalanta at the San Siro in the late match with goalkeeper Mike Maignan ready to start his first match in five months.GERMANYDefending champion Bayern Munich hosts surprise challenger Union Berlin with first place in the Bundesliga at stake. Only goal difference separates the teams and both need to win to join new league leader Borussia Dortmund on 46 points. All three teams started the weekend on 43 but Dortmund won at Hoffenheim on Saturday. While Union is unbeaten across all competitions this year, Bayern drew its first three league games and lost at Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-2 last weekend. The Bavarian powerhouse has seen its four-point lead disappear since the winter break. But Bayern should be fresher for the game after a week to recover from the Gladbach defeat. Union has had little time to recover after beating Ajax 3-1 in their Europa League playoff on Thursday. Also, Freiburg welcomes Bayer Leverkusen in a duel between the other Europa League participants.FRANCEMarseille faces bitter rival Paris Saint-Germain knowing that a home victory would move it two points behind the league leader and open up the title race. PSG is under big pressure after losing five of its 12 games this year, including a French Cup defeat at Marseille this month. PSG takes on a confident Marseille which has only one defeat in its last 14 games. PSG narrowly avoided a fourth straight defeat last weekend when it trailed Lille at home before winning 4-3 thanks to Lionel Messi’s injury-time free kick. PSG is without injured forward Neymar and right back Achraf Hakimi but Marseille is missing its best defender Chancel Mbemba. The other main game sees high-flying Monaco hosting improving Nice in the Riviera derby.___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821839,Daichi Kamada: too big for Eintracht Frankfurt?,"Daichi Kamada endured a thankless afternoon in Leipzig.The Japanese midfielder worked hard as always, providing options in dangerous areas and tracking back to support the defense. He even set up his team's only goal of the game with a neat pass to Djibril Sow, but it wasn't enough to prevent Eintracht Frankfurt slipping to a 2-1 defeat to RB Leipzig.But now, after 163 games and 37 goals for the Eagles, Kamada's time in Frankfurt is drawing to an end, with the local Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper reporting that the 27-year-old is set to join Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season, where he has reportedly agreed a five-year deal worth €5.5-6m a year - more than double his current salary.It seems a long time ago now that former Frankfurt head coach Adi Hütter kicked Kamada out of his squad and sent him to train in a separate group, before sending him out on loan to Belgian side St. Truiden in August 2018. But it was in Belgium that Kamada rediscovered the form that saw him called up to the Japanese national team, for whom he's since become a key pillar.Upon his return to Frankfurt, Hütter also finally recognized the value of the midfield all-rounder. Suddenly, he was full of praise, saying: ""Daichi is a creative player who can make the difference with his genius.""Nevertheless, Kamada's style of play didn't always convince the notoriously demanding and enthusiastic Eintracht fans, who too often considered him uninvolved, lethargic and hesistant in the tackle.""I know that I'm not necessarily their favorite player,"" Kamada himself told local broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk in December 2021. ""I know that my style of play is seen critically. But, with all due respect, what the the coach and my teammates say is more important. As long as they're satisfied with me, I'm happy.""In the Europa League at least, Kamada's colleagues had no cause for complaints as he netted five times en route to the 2022 final in Seville, where he also scored in the penalty shootout, in which Frankfurt gloriously beat Rangers.Kamada's performances on the European stage didn't go unnoticed. In 2019, Italian side Genoa expressed interest but Hütter vetoed a move to Serie A. Last summer, Kamada had reportedly agreed personal terms with Portuguese giants Benfica, only for Hütter successor, Oliver Glasner, to prevent a move.The €20m offered by Benfica wasn't considered worth it to lose such a key offensive cog - but Frankfurt can't compete with the full packet being offered to Kamada by Dortmund, including a €12m signing-on-fee.The Black and Yellows, of course, have already had a good experience with attacking midfielders from the Land of the Rising Sun. From 2010 to 2012, and then again from 2014 to 2019 after a two-year spell with Manchester United, Shinji Kagawa made 216 appearances for Borussia Dortmund, scoring 60 goals and setting up 55 more.They're big footsteps for his compatriot to follow in, but Kamada has proven that he's ready to make the next step.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/25,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821843,MLBPA's Tony Clark says rising payrolls good for game,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A handful of free-spending owners in Major League Baseball have made some of the game's other owners a little nervous.

            Players' union head Tony Clark doesn't mind that development one bit.

            “Baseball is doing very well,” Clark said on Saturday as the first full slate of spring training games began in Florida and Arizona.











            Clark's perspective isn't shared by all. There's a group of owners — including Pittsburgh's Bob Nutting — who believe that a recent jump in free agent spending is part of the reason smaller market teams, like the Pirates, struggle to remain competitive. It's one of the reasons MLB recently formed an economic reform committee.

            “It’s the single biggest issue facing the Pittsburgh Pirates,” Nutting told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Friday. “Competitive disparity, revenue disparity and payroll disparity are all real challenges.""

            This offseason, salaries have risen following last year’s agreement on a five-year labor contract with the players’ association. Payrolls rose 12.6% to a $4.56 billion last year, breaking the previous record set in 2017, and are set to go even higher this year.

            The New York Mets, entering their third season under owner Steve Cohen, project a payroll upwards of about $370 million — which would smash the previous high of $291 million by the 2015 Los Angeles Dodgers.

            Some so-called smaller market teams have even joined the spending surge. The San Diego Padres have been very active with free agents over the past few years, adding standouts like shortstop Xander Bogaerts.

            Clark said that's evidence that teams from markets of all sizes can compete financially and on the field, noting that the Padres have seen an uptick in fan interest.

            “Teams were competing, engaging in the free agent market and created a level of excitement that I would think is a positive,"" Clark said.

            There's no doubt that economic disparity exists in baseball. While the Mets are set to spend around $370 million on payroll, others like the Orioles, Rays, Pirates and Athletics are expected to be in the $60-80 million range.

            The causes for that disparity are where friction occurs between MLBPA and MLB.

            “The question that should be asked in regards to one team's payroll versus another, is whether or not that team is making a conscious decision to have its payroll there, or whether it has the ability to increase its payroll,"" Clark said. 

            “The answer is the latter, not the former.”

            MINOR LEAGUE UNION

            Clark said he remains “optimistic” that ongoing labor negotiations between the MLBPA's minor-league wing and MLB will continue to progress in a positive direction.

            More than 5,500 minor league baseball players formed a union in September in an effort to boost annual salaries as low as $10,400. Negotiations began in November to secure the first labor agreement for the minor leagues.

            “Has some progress been made? Yes,” Clark said. “But there's still tangible work that needs to be done.”

            Clark said that some of MLB's proposals during the negotiation process have included ways to further contract the minor leagues in exchange for improvements. 

            Clark said that kind of proposal is a “non-starter.”

            “The idea of the league having the ability to cut minor league jobs or contract teams further, on the heels of the 40-plus teams contracted a few years ago, is troublesome,"" Clark said.

            MLB ended the Professional Baseball Agreement that governed the relationship between the majors and minors in late 2020, after minor league seasons were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

            Affiliates were cut from a minimum of 160 to 120, the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues that had governed the minors since 1901 was shut down and MLB took over operation of the minors.

            BROADCAST BLUES

            Commissioner Rob Manfred said last week that MLB is prepared for whatever happens to the financially troubled company that owns regional broadcast rights for 14 teams after Diamond Sports Group skipped about $140 million in interest payments.

            Diamond is a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc., and its regional networks broadcasts games of 14 MLB, 16 NBA and 12 NHL teams. Diamond said as of Sept. 30 it had debt of $8.674 billion. It has nearly $1 billion in rights payments, mostly to baseball teams, due in the first quarter this year.

            If MLB does take over distribution from Diamond, Manfred said it would not be able to replace 100% of the revenue in the short term.

            Clark said the MLBPA has been in touch with Manfred’s office about the issue.

            “They have an ability to address the (regional sports networks) and have told us they have a plan in place,” Clark said. “What we don’t know is anything beyond that and how it’s going to affect the system.

            “That will require a conversation.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821848,Report: 12% of Mexicans suffer from malnutrition,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican officials say about 12% of Mexicans suffer from malnutrition, a situation they blamed in part on consumption of junk food. Officials told legislators the problem is more common in rural areas. 

            The Health Department said Saturday the problem is often reflected in anemia, protein deficit and an imbalance in micronutrients. 

            Simón Barquera, the head of the country’s health and nutrition research center, said marketing and junk food were the main drivers of unhealthy consumption patterns. 











            “Marketing, economic interests and the influence of the junk food industry are the main drivers of consumption patterns in the Mexican population that create health problems,"" Barquera said.

            However, poverty also clearly plays a role. Mexico’s commission for poverty measurement said that in 2020, 22.5% of Mexicans lacked enough income to buy quality, nutritious foods for themselves and their families.

            About 43.9% of Mexicans, or about 55 million people, live below the poverty line, which means they can't pay for all their needs.

            Consumer groups in Mexico have long complained that soft drinks and snacks are heavily marketed in rural areas, where they are sometimes seen as better, more prestigious or more addictive foods than the traditional diet of corn, beans, rice and chiles.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican officials say about 12% of Mexicans suffer from malnutrition, a situation they blamed in part on consumption of junk food.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821858,"Farewell, Fontana: NASCAR's last weekend at a racing gem","FONTANA, Calif. (AP) — Most of NASCAR's Cup Series drivers feel like they're saying their final goodbye to a dear old friend this weekend.

            Auto Club Speedway's racetrack seems to be adored by every professional driver on the continent. Those two miles of gloriously weathered asphalt allow racers to be their best selves, providing the ideal combination of grip and space for nimble maneuvers in the perfectly banked corners, thrilling passes from the apron to the wall, and even five-wide racing at times during a quarter-century of mostly memorable Sundays.

            “I’m going to miss everything about this track,” Martin Truex Jr. said. “Hopefully we can go out on a high note on the last time around here.”











            Indeed, the second race of the current Cup season will be the last before this beloved pavement is torn up, ostensibly to clear the way for a short-track course. Fontana won't host a NASCAR weekend in 2024, and the new setup might not be ready until 2026, if it happens at all.

            So this farewell is happening under a cloud — a whole bunch of them, actually.

            Steady rain and a few tentative snow flurries forced the cancellation of practice and qualifying Saturday. The Xfinity Series race nearly started during a break in the precipitation, but was eventually postponed to Sunday night after the rain kicked up again in 41-degree (5-degree Celsius) temperatures.

            In the meantime, the drivers reminisced about the freedom and speed they've enjoyed on sunnier days in this industrial suburb east of Los Angeles.

            “To me, it’s a driver’s dream,” Ryan Blaney said. “It’s a big racetrack. It’s incredibly wide. The progressiveness of each lane, the banking, is the right kind of degree change. Tires fall off. You ask drivers, ‘What’s your dream racetrack?’ And it’s a wide track where drivers can search around for grip.”

            Southern California native Jimmie Johnson won here six times. Las Vegas' own Kyle Busch has won four times. Most of the great drivers in the past 25 years from the Cup series, IndyCar and the CART series have reached Fontana's Victory Lane.

            But soon the bumpy backstretch, the coarse asphalt and the competitive corners will be gone. NASCAR, which owns and operates the facility, has been planning a short-track redesign since 2020 to service the latest trend in stock car racing. 

            Any faint hope of a reprieve seemingly vanished earlier this week when Sports Business Journal reported NASCAR has reached an agreement to sell about 80% of the large property for a nine-figure sum. It's unclear whether the short-track plans would even happen under new ownership.

            The drivers realize whatever happens after Sunday — or Monday, depending on the weather — is out of their control.

            “Sad is probably the first reaction,"" Joey Logano said. “But business is business, and how do you go against that? When you hear what some of the numbers (for the sale) were, how do you not take that?

            ""And here’s the part that makes me feel a little better about it: Yes, the racing here is spectacular. It’s probably one of the best tracks we have, period. But the facts are, it’s getting old. The asphalt is coming apart, and if we were to repave it and just leave it the same (configuration), the racing would be awful. It’s just the end of an era.”

            FONTANA'S FUTURE

            “I’m sad to see it go, but on the flip side, I’m actually really excited about what’s ahead,” defending champion Kyle Larson said. “For the betterment of our sport, I do think we need more short tracks. I applaud everybody at this racetrack if they’re going to reconfigure it, and taking a financial risk to better their facility and crowd and the sport.”

            Drivers are divided on what they would like to see next in Fontana. Some like the half-mile tracks to create the bumpy, hot-tempered races that get TV ratings, while others favor a little variety.

            “I don’t know that we really need another half-mile,” Truex said. “I think something between there and a mile would be good.”

            LOSERS WEEPERS

            NASCAR is hoping for a Sunday respite from a spectacular storm, but that's not the only problem. Even if the rain abates, old asphalt is notoriously difficult to dry because of weepers — the moisture that collects under the surface and then seeps through the cracks after a rainfall.

            “The track is definitely going to be sad, because it’s getting torn down, so it’s obviously going to weep,” Alex Bowman said with a grin.

            HARVICK'S 750TH

            Kevin Harvick is back at the track closest to his native Bakersfield, and his record 29th start at Fontana doubles as his 750th consecutive Cup start. That's the third-longest streak in Cup history.

            Harvick said he doesn't think much about the milestone — and if he does, it only makes him mad that the number isn't higher because of his suspension in 2002 for rough driving. The 47-year-old Harvick is still happy to be back at one of his favorite tracks.

            “It’s always tough to see a racetrack that is in the fun-to-drive phase go away, because you’ll never put the asphalt down that way again,” he said.

            NO PRACTICE? NO PROBLEM

            Given their familiarity with this circuit, the drivers aren't concerned after the weather kept them off the track Saturday.

            “Everyone kind of got used to that,” Larson said of the pandemic years. “It would be a different question if this was last year and we had a brand-new racing car.”

It’s just the end of an era.”FONTANA'S FUTURE“I’m sad to see it go, but on the flip side, I’m actually really excited about what’s ahead,” defending champion Kyle Larson said. “For the betterment of our sport, I do think we need more short tracks. I applaud everybody at this racetrack if they’re going to reconfigure it, and taking a financial risk to better their facility and crowd and the sport.”Drivers are divided on what they would like to see next in Fontana. Some like the half-mile tracks to create the bumpy, hot-tempered races that get TV ratings, while others favor a little variety.“I don’t know that we really need another half-mile,” Truex said. “I think something between there and a mile would be good.”LOSERS WEEPERSNASCAR is hoping for a Sunday respite from a spectacular storm, but that's not the only problem. Even if the rain abates, old asphalt is notoriously difficult to dry because of weepers — the moisture that collects under the surface and then seeps through the cracks after a rainfall.“The track is definitely going to be sad, because it’s getting torn down, so it’s obviously going to weep,” Alex Bowman said with a grin.HARVICK'S 750THKevin Harvick is back at the track closest to his native Bakersfield, and his record 29th start at Fontana doubles as his 750th consecutive Cup start. That's the third-longest streak in Cup history.Harvick said he doesn't think much about the milestone — and if he does, it only makes him mad that the number isn't higher because of his suspension in 2002 for rough driving. The 47-year-old Harvick is still happy to be back at one of his favorite tracks.“It’s always tough to see a racetrack that is in the fun-to-drive phase go away, because you’ll never put the asphalt down that way again,” he said.NO PRACTICE? NO PROBLEMGiven their familiarity with this circuit, the drivers aren't concerned after the weather kept them off the track Saturday.“Everyone kind of got used to that,” Larson said of the pandemic years. “It would be a different question if this was last year and we had a brand-new racing car.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821862,"Kirk battles, takes 2-shot lead into final round at Honda","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Chris Kirk’s last win on the PGA Tour was nearly eight years ago. He’s put himself in a position to change that at the Honda Classic.

            Kirk battled his way to a 4-under round of 66 on Saturday, putting him at 13-under 197 for the week and giving him a two-shot lead over Eric Cole (66) through three rounds at PGA National.

            His last win on tour was at Colonial in 2015 — 180 tournaments ago. He’s a four-time winner on tour, played in the Presidents Cup in 2015, and has been waiting to hoist a trophy again since.











            Kirk made a wild birdie on the last, after his second shot on the par-5 18th wound up next to the grandstand and underneath someone’s bag that was left against structure. He got a drop, chipped on from there and made the putt to restore a two-shot lead.

            And now he has a chance to be a winner again — with most of the players nearest to him on the leaderboard looking for their first tour wins.

            “It’s been so long since I’ve won,"" Kirk said. “I’m going to be plenty nervous, just as nervous as those guys are probably.""

            Cole stayed in the mix with his second consecutive round of 66.

            “It’s awesome,” Cole said. “I’ve never played this event before. Tried to qualify a bunch of times ... I’m enjoying every minute of it.”

            Justin Suh holed out from the fairway for an eagle on the par-4 12th, and is alone in third at 10 under. He shot even-par 70 on Saturday.

            Shane Lowry (65) is 9 under, and right in the mix after having a chance to win the Honda last year until the 72nd hole. He’s tied with Ben Taylor (69).

            “If I can just hang around all day, hopefully I can give myself a chance coming down the stretch,” Lowry said. “I think I did what I needed to do today.”

            Among those lurking: defending champion Sepp Straka, who followed opening rounds of 69 and 68 with a 66 on Saturday. He’s 7 under for the week, six shots back. It was Straka’s sixth consecutive round in the 60’s at PGA National.

            “It’s a tough test, but if you’re hitting it good, you can score,” Straka said.

            Straka went to Georgia, as did Kirk. When Straka got his first win at Honda a year ago, Kirk was one of the players who braved an intense rainstorm to congratulate Straka when it was over.

            “We stay together all the time. He’s usually the guy that gets us a house,” Straka said. “I’ve gotten to know Chris very well over the last few years, one of my best friends. He’s been playing great golf for a couple years now. It’s not surprising to me, especially around this course.”

            Sunday is a big day for two players with a shot of qualifying for The Players Championship by getting into the top 50 in the world. Min Woo Lee struggled to a 73 on Saturday and is tied for 58th at even par through 54 holes; Adrian Meronk is tied for 20th at 4 under.

            Lee started the week No. 47; Meronk started No. 53.

            DIVOTS: Ryan Brehm (64) made a big move Saturday, starting the round tied for 60th and finishing tied for 15th at 5-under 205. ... Akshay Bhatia needed a new outfit after playing a ball from the water.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821864,Conley's pitch clock violation leaves Braves-Red Sox tied,"Cal Conley of the Atlanta Braves thought he had just won the game with a two-out, full-count, bases-loaded walk-off walk on Saturday. He took a few steps toward first base, bat still in hand, when umpire John Libka jumped out from behind the plate and indicated strike three.

            Game over. Conley, apparently thinking he had been awarded an automatic ball four, couldn't believe it. He pointed to himself and said, “Me?” His teammates couldn't believe it, either. Fans booed. 

            Welcome to 2023, where baseball’s new rules designed to improve pace of play are coming fast at everyone, particularly the players.











            The most dramatic moment of the new pitch clock era arrived on the first full day of spring games, and in the most dramatic scenario possible. Conley, facing reliever Robert Kwiatkowski of the Boston Red Sox, wasn’t set in the box and alert to the pitcher as the clock wound under eight seconds. 

            The penalty is an automatic strike, which led to the game at North Port, Florida, finishing in a 6-6 tie. Kwiatkowski got the strikeout after throwing only two real strikes.

            It was a far more dramatic moment than when San Diego Padres slugger Manny Machado on Friday became the first player to draw a pitch clock violation when he was called for an automatic strike in the bottom of the first inning against Seattle because he wasn’t set in the box in time. 

            The pitch clock is one of the new rules designed to speed pace of play. Players will have 30 seconds to resume play between batters. Between pitches, pitchers have 15 seconds with nobody on and 20 seconds if there is a baserunner. The pitcher must start his delivery before the clock expires. After a pitch, the clock starts again when the pitcher has the ball back, the catcher and batter are in the circle around home plate, and play is otherwise ready to resume.

            MORE SIGN STEALING?

            Could the pitch clock lead to more on-field sign stealing, in turn forcing managers to cut out the third base coach as the middleman for relaying signs?

            Veteran managers Dusty Baker and Buck Showalter think so.

            It’s an interesting point from Baker, considering that he took over as Houston’s manager in 2020 after A.J. Hinch was fired following the stunning revelation that the Astros had illicitly stolen signs in 2017, when they won the World Series, and again in 2018.

            “I’m concerned about that because you’re always aware of people stealing signs,” Baker said Saturday when his defending World Series champion Astros beat Showalter’s New York Mets 4-2 in West Palm Beach, Florida. “And then there’s the sensitive area. OK, are you cheating? Is that part of the game, stealing signs? If I know you’re hitting and running that’s what I’m supposed to do.”

            Baker said there’s less time for the dugout to signal the third base coach, who in turn must relay signs to batters and runners, and therefore less time for to use decoys, making the signs easier to decipher.

            Baker believes the pitch clock puts even more pressure on the third base coach to be quick — and somewhat deceptive. On the other hand, the pitch clock also limits the amount of time defenses have to react, even if they know a hit-and-run or bunt is coming.

            Baker said the toughest job on the field is being a third base coach. “Everybody in the ballpark has eyes on him. Everybody’s trying to decipher his sequence of signs. There are guys in the stands, are guys now on videos. I mean, if you know what the opposition is going to do, that makes it even tougher to do. Yeah, I’m concerned about that.”

            Showalter shares Baker’s concern to the point that he’s considering eliminating the middleman and having all signs come directly from the dugout, a practice common in the amateur ranks.

            “There are so many things that, because we’re afraid to copy colleges or high schools because, ‘Oh, they’re amateurs and we’re pros,’ ” Showalter said. “There are things they did better. They don’t go through the third base coach. Why do we transfer stuff to a third base coach to then transfer to the player? It’s just another relay.”

            A HOMER AND A VIOLATION

            Los Angeles Angels outfielder Jo Adell used his one aloted timeout during his at-bat in the second inning, and then on the next pitch launched a long two-run homer to left off Seattle lefty Marco Gonzales. In his final at-bat, he drew a violation for strike two by plate umpire Mike Muchlinski and eventually struck out.

            “I was trying to figure out how many timeouts before a strike, so I wanted to make sure I didn’t call another one,” Adell said. “The following at-bat I ran into seven seconds and got a strike called. I think it’s fine, we’ll all get into the rhythm of it, there’s going to be a few violations here and there.

            HOME PLATE TENSION

            St. Louis Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said umpire C.B. Bucknor “has zero class” for refusing to shake his hand during the lineup card exchange at home plate before a game against the Washington Nationals. Marmol, who did shake hands with the other three umps, was seeing Bucknor for the first time since being ejected in a contentious dispute Aug. 21 in Arizona.

            “I went into that game pretty certain of my thoughts on him as an umpire,” Marmol said. “They weren’t very good and it shows his lack of class as a man. I chose my words wisely. I just don’t think he’s good at his job and it just showed his lack of class as a man.”

            Marmol was ejected last year in the final game of a series after protesting a strike call by Bucknor against Nolan Arenado, with each loudly questioning the other’s “time in the league.”

            Bucknor was not available after Saturday’s game and did not return a reporter’s telephone call.

            BRYANT ON THE MOVE

            Colorado Rockies slugger Kris Bryant’s first spring training game this season included more running that he expected. The 31-year-old is trying to bounce back after missing a big chunk of the 2022 season with various injuries, including to his right foot. He hit .306 with five homers in 42 games.

            Bryant reached first base on a fielder’s choice in the first inning against the Diamondbacks. He then scored from first base on Ryan McMahon’s double to the wall.

            “I felt fine running, I just felt slow,” Bryant said, laughing. “But I figure for the first time in spring training doing that, it’s a good test for me.""

            SONG THROWS

            Phillies right-hander Noah Song threw off a mound during his third day of workouts after joining the team from the U.S. Navy and said the session was “good.” The 25-year old had been a flight officer training on a P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft before he was allowed to transfer from active duty to reserves.

            Song was impressive in his only pro season, making seven starts for Boston’s Class A Lowell affiliate in 2019, striking out 19 in 17 innings with a 1.06 ERA. With a fastball in the upper 90s mph, he went 11-1 with a 1.44 ERA and 161 strikeouts in 94 innings during his senior year at Navy.

            The Phillies selected Song from the Phillies in the December draft for unprotected minor league players.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821867,"No. 21 Colorado women thump Cal, end two-game skid","BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Aaronette Vonleh scored 25 points shooting 11 for 14 and No. 21 Colorado closed the Pac-12 regular season by beating Cal 95-69 on Saturday to end a two-game losing streak.

            Frida Formann scored 19 points, Jaylyn Sherrod 16 and Quay Miller grabbed 11 rebounds for Colorado, which won both games against the Bears this season.

            Jayda Curry scored 23 points for Cal and made all 11 of her foul shots. The sophomore made her first and only 3-pointer of the game with 57 seconds left to keep her streak of games with a 3-point make alive at 51. She finished 1 for 4.











            Vonleh jumpstarted Colorado (22-7, 13-5), making her first three shot attempts for a 6-2 lead and the Buffaloes never trailed.

            In fifth place after the opening run, Schwarz powered through the course in a combined time of 2 minutes, 23.63 seconds to hold off Swiss standout Marco Odermatt by 0.03 seconds. Rasmus Windingstad of Norway wound up third to earn his first World Cup podium finish since 2019.

            It was Schwarz's first World Cup win since a slalom race on Jan. 26, 2021, at Schladming, Austria. 











            Odermatt has now been on the podium in each of the last 14 World Cup giant slalom races he’s started. 

            It’s been quite a season for Odermatt, who also won the giant slalom at the world championships in Courchevel, France, on Feb. 17. Odermatt's performance Saturday extended his lead over Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway in his bid to win back-to-back overall World Cup titles. 

            The top American finisher was George Steffey in 21st place. Fellow U.S. racer River Radamus was among the three competitors who didn't finish their final run.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821871,EPA orders 'pause' of derailment contaminated waste removal,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Federal environmental authorities have ordered a temporary halt in the shipment of contaminated waste from the site of a fiery train derailment earlier this month in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line.

            Region 5 administrator Debra Shore of the Environmental Protection Agency said Saturday the agency ordered Norfolk Southern to “pause” shipments from the site of the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine but vowed that removal of the material would resume “very soon.”

            “Everyone wants this contamination gone from the community. They don’t want the worry, and they don’t want the smell, and we owe it to the people of East Palestine to move it out of the community as quickly as possible,” Shore said. 











            Until Friday, Shore said, the rail company had been solely responsible for the disposal of the waste and supplied Ohio environmental officials with a list of selected and utilized disposal sites. Going forward, disposal plans including locations and transportation routes for contaminated waste will be subject to EPA review and approval, she said.

            “EPA will ensure that all waste is disposed of in a safe and lawful manner at EPA-certified facilities to prevent further release of hazardous substances and impacts to communities,” Shore said. She said officials had heard concerns from residents and others in a number of states and were reviewing “the transport of some of this waste over long distances and finding the appropriate permitted and certified sites to take the waste.”

            The Ohio governor's office said Saturday night that of the twenty truckloads (approximately 280 tons) of hazardous solid waste hauled away, 15 truckloads of contaminated soil was disposed of at a Michigan hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility while five truckloads had been returned to East Palestine. 

            Liquid waste already trucked out of East Palestine would be disposed of at a licensed hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility in Texas, but that facility would not accept more liquid waste, the Ohio governor's office said.

            “Currently, about 102,000 gallons of liquid waste and 4,500 cubic yards of solid waste remain in storage on site in East Palestine, not including the five truckloads returned to the village,” the governor's office said. “Additional solid and liquid wastes are being generated as the cleanup progresses.”

            No one was injured when 38 Norfolk Southern cars derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of town, but as fears grew about a potential explosion due to hazardous chemicals in five of the rail cars, officials evacuated the area. They later opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from the tanker cars, sending flames and black smoke billowing into the sky again. 

            Shore said the EPA was not involved in the decision to do the controlled burn, but she called it a “well-founded” decision by local and state officials based on the information they had at the time “to deal with a highly explosive toxic chemical.”

            Federal and state officials have repeatedly said it’s safe for evacuated residents to return to the area and that air testing in the town and inside hundreds of homes hasn’t detected any concerning levels of contaminants from the fires or burned chemicals. The state says the local municipal drinking water system is safe, and bottled water is available while testing is conducted for those with private wells.

            Despite those assurances and a bevy of news conferences and visits from politicians, many residents still express a sense of mistrust or have lingering questions about what they have been exposed to and how it will impact the future of their families and their communities.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Federal environmental authorities have ordered a temporary halt in the shipment of contaminated waste from the site of a fiery train derailment earlier this month in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line.Region 5 administrator Debra Shore of the Environmental Protection Agency said Saturday the agency ordered Norfolk Southern to “pause” shipments from the site of the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine but vowed that removal of the material would resume “very soon.”“Everyone wants this contamination gone from the community.

            And the Seminoles ended Miami's hopes of a perfect home season.

            Matthew Cleveland's 3-pointer as time expired capped Florida State's comeback from a huge deficit and the Seminoles stunned No. 13 Miami 85-84 on Saturday.











            “We showed a little bit about who we are,"" Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said.

            Jordan Miller had given Miami the lead on a 3-pointer with 4.9 seconds left. But Cleveland let fly from about 25 feet and the ball swished to give the Seminoles (9-20, 7-11 Atlantic Coast Conference) their best moment of the season.

            They ended Miami's seven-game winning streak, knocked the Hurricanes out of the outright lead in the ACC standings and denied the bid for a perfect home record. Miami was 15-0 at the Watsco Center entering Saturday.

            “Miami's a really, really good basketball team. ... I would hate to play them in the NCAA Tournament,"" Hamilton said.

            Cleveland and Darin Green Jr. each had 20 points for Florida State, which got 13 from Caleb Mills and 11 from Jalen Warley.

            Miller led Miami (23-6, 14-5) with 21 points. Norchad Omier had 15, Isaiah Wong scored 14 and Bensley Joseph added 12 for the Hurricanes.

            “We played as well as we could in the first half,"" Miami coach Jim Larrañaga said. “But it appeared to me to start the second half that our battery died. We didn’t have the energy or juice and it showed most of all with our defense.""

            Miami simply could not get stops in the second half. Florida State shot 68% in the final 20 minutes, lost the lead twice in the final 40 seconds — then stunned its biggest rival anyway.

            “Credit to them. They played hard,"" Miller said. “I think they just wanted it more. We came out unfocused. ... We’ve just got to find a way to close out games like this. There’s no excuse for us losing this game.""

            Miami ran out to a 14-2 lead after 3 1/2 minutes, and Florida State chipped away to get within 28-23 with 8:12 left in the half.

            The next seven minutes were all Miami.

            It appeared a 22-2 run would essentially put the game away before halftime, pushing the Hurricanes’ lead to 50-25. Miami made eight of its final 10 shots of the half.

            “The first half, we just weren't ready,"" Hamilton said.

            And then came halftime. The Seminoles sure looked ready.

            “We did not tell them anything at halftime that we didn't tell them before the game started,"" Hamilton said.

            The Seminoles made 10 of their first 30 shots of the game — then made 10 of their next 11, getting Miami’s lead down to 61-49 with 14:45 left. That was part of a 35-10 run that gave FSU the lead for the first time on a layup by Mills with 5:56 remaining.

            The lead would change hands 10 more times down the stretch, the last of those off Cleveland's desperation heave after Miller's go-ahead 3 at the other end.

            “I knew they were going to celebrate,"" Cleveland said. “If we get down and push, we’d get a decent shot.""

            It was better than decent. It was perfect.

            BIG PICTURE

            Florida State: The Seminoles have, for now, avoided tying a school record for losses. The only FSU team to lose 21 games was the 2000-01 club, which was part of a run of five consecutive losing seasons for the Seminoles. This year will be the end of what has been a stretch of 17 consecutive winning seasons for Florida State.

            Miami: The Hurricanes were without guard Nijel Pack, who was ruled out with a lower extremity injury. Miami is listing him as day to day. He's averaging 13.6 points, 2.7 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game, with 41% shooting on 3-pointers.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Miami will be in the AP Top 25 for the 12th consecutive week when the latest rankings are released Monday. But the Hurricanes will likely fall a few spots.

We had plenty of close games earlier and we were not on the correct side of the ledger when the final buzzer went off. For whatever reason, our group had to go through some tough experiences to learn and grow.











            “They did that and it makes you feel good when they respond like that. They stuck with the process and now they are being rewarded for it.”

            Wade Taylor IV led Texas A&M (21-9, 13-3) with 21 points, including four 3-pointers, and Henry Coleman III and Andersson Garcia each scored 11.

            “We just didn’t get out of the second half very well. I’m not sure why but we didn’t. So obviously we needed to regroup and they responded. Defensively, we got a bunch of stops in a row and got out in transition. Once that happened the crowd was huge and they played a vital role in our comeback.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821892,Rust's overtime goal lifts Penguins to 3-2 win over Blues,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — Bryan Rust scored the winning goal 1:16 into overtime, lifting the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 3-2 victory over the St. Louis Blues on Saturday.

            “We showed a bit of resilience to get back in the game and win it, ” said Rust, who has nine points in his last four games.

            Marcus Pettersson's first goal of the season game on a wrist shot at 14:32 of the third period gave Pittsburgh a 2-1 lead. But the Blues came back on Justin Faulk's goal at 17:33 to tie it.











            “There’s a fine line between winning and losing in this league,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said. “It could have deflated us when they scored late in the game. Our effort was strong in the overtime.”

            Evgeni Malkin also scored for Pittsburgh, and Tristan Jarry made 25 saves to improve to 5-0 in five career games against St. Louis. 

            “This was good. To get a win in overtime is great,” Jarry said. “To get that boost helps us. Gives us an extra point.”

            Pavel Buchnevich had the other goal for St. Louis and Jordan Binnington had 46 saves, but the Blues dropped their fifth straight since the trades of Ryan O’Reilly and Noel Acciari. The Blues have been outscored 21-8 in those losses.

            “I thought that we got a good response tonight. Competitive,” St. Louis coach Craig Berube said. “We were physical. Played hard. Just offensively, we've got to get more done. But overall I was pretty pleased with the effort.”

            Buchnevich deflected a wrist shot from Robert Thomas just 23 seconds into the second period to give St. Louis a 1-0 lead. 

            Pittsburgh made it 1-1 on a goal by Malkin at 6:59. Rust passed to an all-alone Malkin, who snapped in the puck from the right side of the net for his 22nd goal. He has five points (three goals, two assists) in his last four games. 

            “He can be such a dominant player,"" Sullivan said about Malkin. ""He’s just so gifted offensively. He’s a horse. He’s hard to handle when he’s on top of his game. I thought he played an inspired game today.”

            The Blues were outshot 21-7 in the first period. The total marked the fourth time this season a Blues goalie has made more than 20 saves in any one period.

            ""Yeah, I think it’s just fight until the end is kind of how I’m feeling,” Binnington said. ""I think we showed some good compete tonight and played hard and stood up for our guys in certain areas, certain plays. That’s a fun game. Saturday afternoon, rink was good. It was a lot of fun. 

            ""Obviously, you want to win and that sucks, but I think we’re competing.”

            ROSTER MOVES

            The Blues claimed RW Kasperi Kapanen on waivers Saturday after he was waived by Pittsburgh on Friday. He was not in St. Louis. He will join the team for Tuesday’s home game against Seattle. Kapanen was a 2014 first-round pick for Pittsburgh. He was traded to Toronto in 2015 and then traded back to Pittsburgh in 2020. ... To make room for Kapanen, the Blues sent C Nikita Alexandrov to Springfield of the AHL. 

            NOTES: Blues D Torey Krug (lower-body injury) returned to the lineup. He missed Thursday’s game against Vancouver. He was hurt in Tuesday’s game against Carolina. ... Binnington moved him into sole possession of fifth place on St. Louis' career list for goaltenders with his 204th start. He moved past Greg Millen.

            INJURIES

            Penguins: C Ryan Poehling and D Mark Friedman are day to day with upper body injuries.

But overall I was pretty pleased with the effort.”Buchnevich deflected a wrist shot from Robert Thomas just 23 seconds into the second period to give St. Louis a 1-0 lead.Pittsburgh made it 1-1 on a goal by Malkin at 6:59. Rust passed to an all-alone Malkin, who snapped in the puck from the right side of the net for his 22nd goal. He has five points (three goals, two assists) in his last four games.“He can be such a dominant player,"" Sullivan said about Malkin. ""He’s just so gifted offensively. He’s a horse. He’s hard to handle when he’s on top of his game. I thought he played an inspired game today.”The Blues were outshot 21-7 in the first period. The total marked the fourth time this season a Blues goalie has made more than 20 saves in any one period.""Yeah, I think it’s just fight until the end is kind of how I’m feeling,” Binnington said. ""I think we showed some good compete tonight and played hard and stood up for our guys in certain areas, certain plays. That’s a fun game. Saturday afternoon, rink was good. It was a lot of fun.""Obviously, you want to win and that sucks, but I think we’re competing.”ROSTER MOVESThe Blues claimed RW Kasperi Kapanen on waivers Saturday after he was waived by Pittsburgh on Friday. He was not in St. Louis. He will join the team for Tuesday’s home game against Seattle. Kapanen was a 2014 first-round pick for Pittsburgh.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821894,"Alcaraz and Norrie advance to Rio Open final, eye rematch","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Top seeds Carlos Alcaraz and Cameron Norrie won semifinal matches Saturday to set up their second straight final at the Rio Open. 

            If the Spaniard wins he will not only defend his title in Brazil, but also tie Novak Djokovic in points on the top of the ranking — the Serbian would still be No.1 due to other results.

            Alcaraz worked hard to beat Nicolas Jarry 6-7 (2), 7-5, 6-0 on Saturday. Hours earlier, Cameron Norrie topped Bernabe Zapata Miralles 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (3). 











            The top-seeded players in the clay court tournament also clashed last weekend in the final of the Argentina Open, which the Alcaraz won in straight sets. 

            Alcaraz dropped only his second set in the Rio Open tournament against Jarry. 

            The 19-year-old Spaniard was in trouble with the Chilean's effective service in the first two sets, but showed he had more energy in the third. 

            Alcaraz blanked Jarry in the final set with a dominant performance.

            “Nico has great power, an incredible service and he has shots to make any player's life difficult,” Alcaraz said of Jarry after the match, where until the end of the second set his Chilean opponent had won almost 90% of the points after his first service.

            “I am not going to do anything different (from the Buenos Aires final against Norrie). I think he will, and I will debate that with my team tomorrow.”

            Norrie will play his third final of the year. He needed 2 1/2 hours to beat Zapata Miralles. In the deciding set, Norrie saved a break point in the fifth game, broke the Spaniard in the sixth but was forced to a tiebreak. His stronger first service made the difference.

            “I tried to finish the points a little bit too early. I was a bit overconfident,"" Norrie said.

            Asked what he needs to do differently from the finals in Buenos Aires and Auckland, which he lost to Alcaraz and Richard Gasquet, Norrie said: “I have to play better in the big moments.” 

            Norrie currently leads the tour in wins in 2023, with 17 victories and three losses.

            The stifling Jayhawk defense kept West Virginia from attempting a shot in the final 20 seconds. The Mountaineers’ Joe Toussaint traveled on their final possession of the game.

            “We ran the same thing as we did a few games ago, but we just couldn't turn it this time,"" West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said.











            Baskets by K.J. Adams and Kevin McCullar extended the Jayhawks' lead to 75-68 late as they grinded out the victory.

            Harris led Kansas (24-5, 12-4 Big 12) with 7-of-9 shooting from the field and had six assists and six steals.

            West Virginia (16-13, 5-11) led 44-43 early in the second half, but Kansas went on a 7-0 run which featured a Harris layup, assist and then a 3-pointer by Gradey Dick to give the Jayhawks a six-point lead.

            “We probably needed to be humbled a bit, but I’m glad that we won,"" Kansas coach Bill Self said. ""I told our guys after the game that I’m happy we won, but if that was a second round game in the NCAA Tournament, we’d be going home.”

            Erik Stevenson led West Virginia with 23 points. Tre Mitchell scored 20, Kedrian Johnson scored 15 and Emmitt Mathews Jr. had 13.

            ""We wanted to get a win for coach and this program,"" Stevenson said. “This is head and shoulders above every league. It’s by far the toughest league, but tonight we just came up one possession short.”

            Dick and McCullar had 16 while Adams had 13 and Jalen Wilson finished with 11.

            “They are a great team so no lead is safe against a team like them and they’re playing for a lot and we are too,” Wilson said. “This just shows how tough it’s going to be, but that’s how things are going to be moving forward.” 

            After the game Huggins commented on if he thought his team deserved to be playing the the NCAA Tournament. 

            “We have the best strength of schedule in the country and if that doesn’t mean something to the committee, shame on them,"" he said. “If we don't get it I will blast the committee as far and as long as I can.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821912,"Former Oklahoma St. teammates Gooch, Uihlein share LIV lead","PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) — Talor Gooch made a 4-foot birdie putt on his final hole to tie Peter Uihlein for the lead in a LIV Golf season debut at Mayakoba that looks to be an Oklahoma State alumni reunion.

            Uihlein was in the lead for most of Saturday at El Camaleon until a bogey-birdie-bogey finish led to a 5-under 66. Gooch played bogey-free, ending his round with an approach to short range on the par-4 first hole.

            They were teammates at Oklahoma State — Uihlein was a junior having won the U.S. Amateur at Chambers Bay when Gooch was a freshman.











            They were at 9-under 133, one shot ahead of Charles Howell III, who played for the Cowboys more than a decade earlier. Howell opened with three straight birdies and closed with a birdie for a 66.

            Paul Casey was in the mix until three bogeys over his last four holes gave him a 71 and left him three shots behind, along with Branden Grace (68).

            Uihlein finished at No. 3 on the points list in LIV's inaugural season, and he was recruited to replace Gooch as part of the 4 Aces team captained by Dustin Johnson. He closed out the front nine with five birdies in a six-hole stretch before settling into a series of pars until his wild finish.

            “The back nine was just tough. The greens got a little crusty,” Uihlein said. “I kept the ball in play, which is all you can really do around here.”

            In the team competition, Howell's round helped carry the Crushers to a two-shot lead over 4 Aces.

            Mayakoba held a PGA Tour event from 2007 until last November. Howell played that tournament 13 times with three top 10s, his best a tie for fourth in 2018.

            “I've played this golf course many times. You just never get comfortable around it,” Howell said. “If you drive it well, you can play it. So we've got a tough day ahead of us.”

            Johnson had to settle for a 71, taking a double bogey late in his round, and found himself six shots out of the lead.

            Phil Mickelson made only one birdie in his round of 75 and was 14 shots behind after two rounds. The third and final round is Sunday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821923,NZ rally to 202-3 after follow-on in 2nd test vs. England,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Tim Southee sounded the rallying cry and Tom Latham and Devon Conway answered the call as New Zealand fought back after following on Sunday on the third day of the second cricket test against England.

            New Zealand trailed by 226 on the first innings and by stumps was 202-3, only 24 runs in deficit. At the close, Kane Williamson was 25 and Henry Nicholls 18, having seen New Zealand through most of the last session.

            Southee battered 73 runs from 49 balls with five fours and six sixes in the morning to show the first spark of defiance before New Zealand was dismissed for 209 in its first innings in reply to England’s 435-8.











            Latham and Conway then combined in a 149-run opening partnership which wiped out all but 77 runs of the deficit.

            Stokes may be taken to task for enforcing the follow-on, a tactic that is increasingly rare in cricket. His bowlers already had bowled 53.2 overs in the New Zealand first innings in which the England quicks James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson had shared 36.2 overs.

            But Stokes likely had no other choice on a pitch which has lost most of its sting and likely will be ideal for batting on the final day.

            The English bowlers, Broad especially, frequently beat the bat in the early stages of the New Zealand second innings. But Latham and Conway showed application which recently has been missing from New Zealand’s top order. New Zealand’s best opening partnership in the three previous innings in the series was 14: Sunday’s stand is now the highest second innings opening partnership ever at the Basin Reserve.

            Latham grafted his way to his 26th test half-century from 124 and Conway was slightly quicker, reaching his seventh 50 from 121 balls. On reaching 45, Latham became the seventh New Zealander to score 5,000 test runs.

            But Conway was out for 61, caught by Ollie Pope at short leg from the bowling of Jack Leach, and Latham followed soon after for 83, trapped lbw by Joe Root.

            ""I felt both of us (Latham and Conway) were slightly different. Dev struggled to get away a bit at the start but I managed to do most of the scoring,” Latham said. “The scoreboard was ticking over and we just managed to take it one over at a time and just keep asking them to come back.”

            New Zealand found itself under familiar pressure. Then came a man facing his own pressures: Kane Williamson had scored only 10 runs in his three previous innings in the series and needed a big innings as much as New Zealand did.

            Williamson hung on for more than two hours until stumps and faced 81 ball to make 25. He now needs only three runs on Monday to overtake Ross Taylor as New Zealand’s leading run-scorer in tests.

            England took the second new ball with 10 minutes remaining in the day’s play and it was shared by Ollie Robinson and Leach to keep James Anderson and Stuart Broad fresh for the first session on Monday when the test likely will be decided.

            New Zealand has been on the back foot for most of this test, indeed most of the series. But it enjoyed a period on the offensive when Southee was at the crease in the morning.

            He resumed at 23 and reached his fifty from only 39 balls. Finally, he was out for 73 from 49 balls which included five fours and six sixes and helped New Zealand reduce England’s imposing first innings advantage.

            The innings reflected some of Southee’s unrealized promise as a batter.

            Southee made an unbeaten 77 in his debut test against England in 2008 and that innings for a long time led to a hope that he might develop into a genuine allrounder.

            That hasn’t come to pass. He now has six half-centuries in tests but they have come in 131 innings and he averages just over 15.

            More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Tim Southee sounded the rallying cry and Tom Latham and Devon Conway answered the call as New Zealand fought back after following on Sunday on the third day of the second cricket test against England.New Zealand trailed by 226 on the first innings and by stumps was 202-3, only 24 runs in deficit. At the close, Kane Williamson was 25 and Henry Nicholls 18, having seen New Zealand through most of the last session.Southee battered 73 runs from 49 balls with five fours and six sixes in the morning to show the first spark of defiance before New Zealand was dismissed for 209 in its first innings in reply to England’s 435-8.Latham and Conway then combined in a 149-run opening partnership which wiped out all but 77 runs of the deficit.Stokes may be taken to task for enforcing the follow-on, a tactic that is increasingly rare in cricket. His bowlers already had bowled 53.2 overs in the New Zealand first innings in which the England quicks James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson had shared 36.2 overs.But Stokes likely had no other choice on a pitch which has lost most of its sting and likely will be ideal for batting on the final day.The English bowlers, Broad especially, frequently beat the bat in the early stages of the New Zealand second innings. But Latham and Conway showed application which recently has been missing from New Zealand’s top order.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821928,Mexican president posts photo of what he claims is an elf,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president posted a photo on his social media accounts Saturday showing what he said appeared to be a mythological woodland spirit similar to an elf.

            President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not seem to be joking when he posted the photo of an “Aluxe,” a mischievous woodland spirit in Mayan folklore. 

            López Obrador wrote the photo “was taken three days ago by an engineer, it appears to be an aluxe,"" adding “everything is mystical.” 











            The nighttime photo shows a tree with a branch forming what looks like a halo of hair, and what may be stars forming the figure’s eyes. 

            López Obrador has long expressed reverence for indigenous cultures and beliefs. Engineers and workers are in the Yucatan peninsula, constructing a tourist train that is the president's pet project.

            According to traditional Mayan belief, “Aluxes” are small, mischievous creatures that inhabit forests and fields and are prone to playing tricks on people, like hiding things. Some people leave small offerings to appease them.

            The ancient Mayan civilization reached its height from 300 A.D. to 900 A.D. on the Yucatan Peninsula and in adjacent parts of Central America, but the Mayas’ descendants continue to live on the peninsula.

            Many continue speaking the Mayan language and wearing traditional clothing, while also conserving traditional foods, crops, religion and medicine practices, despite the conquest of the region by the Spanish between 1527 and 1546.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s president posted a photo on his social media accounts Saturday showing what he said appeared to be a mythological woodland spirit similar to an elf.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador did not seem to be joking when he posted the photo of an “Aluxe,” a mischievous woodland spirit in Mayan folklore.López Obrador wrote the photo “was taken three days ago by an engineer, it appears to be an aluxe,"" adding “everything is mystical.”The nighttime photo shows a tree with a branch forming what looks like a halo of hair, and what may be stars forming the figure’s eyes.López Obrador has long expressed reverence for indigenous cultures and beliefs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821936,Cardinals' Marmol says umpire C.B. Bucknor 'has zero class',"JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — St. Louis Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said umpire C.B. Bucknor “has zero class” for refusing to shake his hand during the lineup card exchange at home plate before a game against the Washington Nationals on Saturday.

            Marmol was seeing Bucknor for the first time since being ejected in a contentious dispute Aug. 21 in Arizona.

            “I went into that game pretty certain of my thoughts on him as an umpire,” the Cardinals' second-year manager said. “They weren’t very good and it shows his lack of class as a man. I chose my words wisely. I just don’t think he’s good at his job and it just showed his lack of class as a man.”











            Marmol did shake hands with the other three umps — Ron Kulpa, Angel Hernandez and Carlos Torres.

            Marmol was ejected last year in the final game of a series after protesting a strike call by Bucknor against Nolan Arenado, with each loudly questioning the other’s “time in the league.”

            “It’s not an olive branch,” Marmol said. “It’s just respect. You can have disagreements. You still go to home plate. Any time I get thrown out of a game, I will go to home plate the next day for that very purpose. It’s unfortunate.

            “I went out to home to shake his hand. He didn’t want to. He has zero class.”

            The tension at home plate delayed the normal pregame picture taken of the managers and the umpires. Washington manager Dave Martinez, seemingly uncomfortable, had to be asked to return when he was about to leave the home plate area. 

            Bucknor was not available after Saturday’s game and did not return a reporter’s telephone call for comment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821938,No. 24 UNLV women hold off San Diego State 65-59,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Desi-Rae Young and Alyssa Brown had double-doubles to lead No. 24 UNLV to a sluggish 65-59 victory over San Diego State on Saturday.

            Young had 15 points with 11 rebounds and Brown had 14 points, 12 rebounds and five blocked shots for UNLV (27-2, 17-0 Mountain West). Justice Etheridge added 13 points and Essence Booker scored 12.

            Four players scored in a 9-2 run to open the fourth quarter, giving UNLV a 55-47 advantage with 7:23 remaining. Much like a similar drought in the third quarter, UNLV went four minutes without a point and by the time Young hit a jumper with 3:12 to go the Lady Rebels' lead was only 57-53. Young's layup at 1:10 was the second and last UNLV field goal of the final seven minutes. Booker, who was 6-for-6 from the line in the fourth quarter, closed out the win with four free throws in the final minute.











            UNLV led 46-41 with 4:06 remaining in the third quarter but did not score the rest of the period. Yummy Morris hit a hook shot in the final second to get the Aztecs within 46-45 heading to the fourth.

            Mercedes Staples, who made 5 of 6 3-pointers, scored 17 points for San Diego State (21-9, 11-6). Morris and Sophia Ramos had 12 each.

            San Diego State led 16-12 after one quarter and two 3-pointers from Staples helped give them a 24-14 lead with 7:53 remaining before halftime. The Lady Rebels tied it at 27 on a three-point play by Brown with 3:09 to go. Etheridge scored the next five points for UNLV, her 3-pointer with two seconds left giving the Lady Rebels a 32-31 halftime lead.

            UNLV closes out the regular season at Nevada on Tuesday. The Lady Rebels lead the conference by five games in the loss column and will be the No. 1 seed for the conference tournament in Las Vegas.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821940,James leads No. 11 Tennessee past South Carolina 85-45,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Josiah-Jordan James came back from missing four games with an injury to score 18 points to lead No. 11 Tennessee to an 85-45 victory over South Carolina on Saturday night.

            James, who suffered an ankle injury against Vanderbilt on Feb. 8, hit 4 of 7 3-pointers for the Volunteers (21-8, 10-6 Southeastern Conference). Jahmai Mashack scored 14 points, Zakai Zeigler had 13 points and 11 assists, and Olivier Nkamhoua and Uros Plavsic scored 10 each.

            “(James) was terrific,” said Tennessee coach Rick Barnes. “His presence has a major impact on the team. He takes a lot of pressure off.”











            “(James) is a good player; very skilled,” said South Carolina coach Lamont Paris. “He can contribute in a variety of different ways. (Tennessee is) really good when he's in there.”

            “I don't feel any pressure,” said James, who had missed eight games earlier in the season while recovering from offseason knee surgery. “It's just basketball. I've been doing it for a long time. I want to make it easy for my teammates.”

            Hayden Brown led the Gamecocks (10-19, 3-13) with 18 points. GG Jackson II scored five points, 10 below his average.

            A 22-4 Tennessee run in the second half turned a competitive game into a lopsided one. The Gamecocks were the 12th Tennessee opponent held to 50 points or fewer. 

            “(Tennessee's) physicality had an impact on the game,"" Paris said. “We're more on the finesse end.”

            “(Physicality is) who we are,” said Barnes. “Not just our post players, our guards are physical.”

            Tennessee had just four turnovers and committed just eight fouls in the win over the Gamecocks, who were coming off an overtime loss to No. 2 Alabama.

            “They took the (No. 2) team in the country to overtime and had a chance to win it,” said Barnes. “(The Vols) are very resilient.”

            Tennessee dominated the first half down low. The Vols outscored South Carolina 26-14 in the paint and led 38-26 at halftime. James had 10 points for Tennessee and Brown led the Gamecocks with 13.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Despite the win over South Carolina, Tuesday’s five-point loss to Texas A&M will be destined to cost No. 11 Tennessee once the polls are released Monday. … With the postseason in sight, the Vols are able to hang their hat on five Quad 1 victories.

            BIG PICTURE

            South Carolina: Freshman star Jackson hasn’t disappointed by averaging 15.5 points and six rebounds He’s one of three freshmen in the country averaging at least 15 points and six boards. … Jacobi Wright has made himself a fixture in the starting lineup the last six games. … After struggling through most of the SEC campaign, the Gamecocks have been 2-3 over their last five games, including taking Alabama to overtime before falling by two. … First-year South Carolina head coach Lamont Paris was in the University of Tennessee system (as head coach at Chattanooga) for five years.

            Tennessee: The Vols are in the middle of a six-team battle for the final two double-bye spots for the SEC Tournament. … James (knee) and Julian Phillips (hip flexor) had missed the last two weeks. During that time Tennessee has had trouble. In their last seven games (before meeting the Gamecocks), the Vols had lost five. James saw limited action but was productive. Phillips went through warmups but did not play. … Tyreke Key missed the game with a right ankle injury. ... Freshman inside presence Tobe Awaka has come on to average 18 minutes of playing time in the last six games, well above his bit parts earlier.

            According to the CWB forecast, low-lying clouds could lead to the possibility of localized heavy rain in Taipei City, Yilan’s mountainous areas, and the northern coast of Keelung. Rains could begin in the morning and continue throughout Sunday.

            Additionally, a continental cold air mass led to a cold surge advisory for nine counties and cities. Temperatures are expected to be cold in the following areas: New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, and Yilan County. In these locations, outdoor temperatures are likely to be below 10 C, according to CWB.

Meanwhile, it was also cold in southern Taiwan as Kaohsiung’s Dashu District reported 11.2 C.











            Wu's latest meteorological simulation shows that a cold air mass will begin to weaken from Monday (Feb. 27) to Wednesday (March 1), with temperatures rising daily. Taipei will get a reprieve from the rain with the western half of Taiwan becoming sunny.

            From Wednesday evening to Friday (March 3), northeasterly monsoon winds will begin to strengthen with cloud cover on the windward side of Taiwan increasing.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4821965,Nance powers North Carolina over No. 6 Virginia 71-63,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — North Carolina Tar Heels coach Hubert Davis says that he’s not a “superstitious guy” but he’s planning on making another trip to the grocery store to secure another box of Pete Nance’s favorite cookies: Lemon Oreos.

            Davis gifted Nance with a package of them during a meeting this week, and all the fifth-year forward did afterwards was turn in one of the best shooting performances of his career in a crucial game for the Tar Heels.

            “I’m serious. I’ll bring them to Tallahassee,” Davis joked. “If that works, let’s do it. Let’s try it.”











            Nance scored 22 points as the Tar Heels secured an important win, defeating No. 6 Virginia 71-63 on Saturday night.

            “Pete started us off and was really hot from 3, and I’m just really happy for him,” Davis said.

            For UNC (18-11, 10-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) the victory is a much-needed boost to its NCAA Tournament resume as it counts as a Quadrant 1 win, the first of the season for the Tar Heels. It was also UNC’s first home win over an AP top 10-ranked team since March 9, 2019.

            Nance shot 7 of 10 from the floor and was a perfect 4 of 4 from behind the arc. It’s the most 3-pointers the fifth-year forward has made in ACC play, and Nance also added two assists and four blocks.

            “His ability to stretch it, and then he can also go inside – he’s tall, man,” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said of Nance. “He filled in the way (Brady Manek) did last year. When they can stretch you out and all of a sudden the floor opens up, that changes their dynamics.”

            Armando Bacot chipped in 11 points for UNC, Caleb Love had 10, and R.J. Davis notched the fourth double-double of his career with 16 points and 10 boards.

            In its second straight defeat, Virginia (21-6, 13-5) was powered by Jayden Gardner’s 19 points and 12 rebounds. Armaan Franklin added 14 points.

            After trading baskets with Virginia for the first five minutes of play, resulting in an early 8-8 tie, the Tar Heels dominated for the rest of the period. UNC outscored the Cavaliers 34-18 through the remainder of the first half, creating a comfortable 16-point halftime advantage. 

            BIG PICTURE

            Virginia: Because of No. 13 Miami’s loss to Florida State, this game was an opportunity for the Cavaliers to take at least a share of first place in the ACC. Instead, Pitt has sole possession of the top spot in the conference. After scoring a season-low 48 points in its loss to Boston College on Wednesday, Virginia’s offense somewhat struggled again.

            “You just keep knocking,” Bennett said. “We tried to make little adjustments, and I told the guys, there’s a lot of basketball left.”

            North Carolina: UNC took a major step forward in making a case for an NCAA Tournament bid. Quadrant 1 wins are crucial when the committee considers at-large resumes, and UNC was previously 0-9 against those teams. After shooting a season-low 33% from the floor on Wednesday, the Tar Heels beat Virginia with sharp shooting, making shots at a 47% clip.

            POLL, SEEDING IMPLICATIONS

            Virginia is likely to take a tumble in the next AP Top 25 Poll after losing two straight. But the Cavaliers won’t be alone, as No. 7 Arizona, No. 8 Texas and No. 9 Baylor also suffered losses in the past week.

            North Carolina is still jockeying for seeding in the ACC Tournament. And UNC needs to win all the games it can to keep improving its resume for March.

            TIP-INS

            Virginia has always struggled mightily in Chapel Hill and is now 9-68 all-time there. … UNC blocked eight shots, the third-most it’s had in a game this season. … The Tar Heels won without scoring any points off turnovers or any fast break points.

            Fueled by strong winds, the fire burned out of control with thick black smoke and a foul smell drifting into nearby neighborhoods. The fire department dispatched fire vehicles and fire fighters to battle the blaze which continued to smolder through Sunday morning, leading to complaints by residents, per CNA.

            A number of explosions accompanied the landfill fire as the contents of the dump ignited. Firefighters fought the blaze with hoses, but the accumulation of loose debris prevented close contact. An excavator was brought in to assist with the fire fighting operation.











            A Taitung City sanitation worker said guards at the landfill noticed a fire just after midnight, and reported the incident to authorities. The location of the fire was an area where garbage had yet to be covered with soil.

            The fire continued to burn as the sun rose, with garbage still smoldering and smoke drifting to surrounding villages. Taitung Mayor Chen Mingfeng (陳銘風) arrived to survey the scene and encourage fire fighters to extinguish the blaze as soon as possible.

            The landfill in Taitung City’s Jiannong Village (建農里) has been in use for 29 years and has already exceeded its service life.

(AP) — Myles Turner scored 24 points, Tyrese Haliburton had 15 points and 14 assists and the Indiana Pacers ran away from the Orlando Magic in the second half for a 121-108 victory on Saturday night.

            Indiana shot 59% in the second half and won for only the fourth time in 21 games.

            “That was one of the better games we’ve played in a while, on the road,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “We've played some good home games, but it's been a while (more than two months) since we've won on the road.”











            Bennedict Mathurin scored 19 points and Jordan Nwora had 18 for the Pacers, while Jalen Smith added seven rebounds and five blocks.

            “Jalen Smith and Nora really were exceptional off the bench,” Carlisle said.

            Franz Wagner led Orlando with 21 points. Paolo Banchero scored 19 points and Markelle Fultz 18. The Magic struggled with their shooting, going 6 for 29 from 3-point range and finished the game at 38.9% overall.

            Both teams shot below 40% in the first half, while the Pacers blocked nine shots, including four by Smith.

            Andrew Nembhard, Buddy Hield and Haliburton hit 3-pointers in a 17-2 run to open the second half that put Indiana up by 68-54.

            “We knew we were due for a big quarter there,” Haliburton said. “I don’t know if the first half was as much them doing a good job on us defensively or us not playing our brand of basketball. But we were able to do that in the third and that was big for us.”

            Mathurin, Nwora and T.J. Connell sparked another rally that stretched the lead to 19 points with 7:51 left in the game, and a 3-pointer by Mathurn pushed the Pacers' lead to 21, their largest of the game.

            “Our second unit really helped us today,” Haliburton said. “They have been struggling of late, just getting comfortable playing with each other. I thought they were really good today.”

            The Magic, who are just behind the Pacers in the conference playoff race, never recovered from the start of the second half.

            “I think something happened that we can't let happen,” Wagner said. “After a couple of shots being missed or us not getting what we wanted, we let it affect how we played on the other end. That's when they made that run.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822027,"Watson, Batherson score in 3rd, Senators beat Canadiens 5-2","MONTREAL (AP) — Austin Watson and Drake Batherson scored in a 47-second span in the third period to help the Ottawa Senators beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on Saturday night.

            Ottawa rebounded from a 4-0 loss at Carolina on Friday night.

            “Sometimes you’re a little tired mentally on the back-to-back and you got to reset, but that’s why there’s three periods,” Senators forward Mathieu Joseph said. “I thought we had a good talk in the third, we showed up and the boys delivered.”











            Watson broke a tie at 4:31 with a deflection of Travis Hamonic's point shot and Batherson fired a wrist shot from the slot past past goalie Sam Montembeault at 5:18.

            Julien Gauthier added his first goal for the Senators with 8:03 to go. Gauthier came over from the New York Rangers a week ago along with a seventh-round pick for forward Tyler Motte.

            Derick Brassard and Shane Pinto also scored for Ottawa and Mads Sogaard made 29 saves and had his first career assist.

            “He was great,” Senators coach D.J. Smith said about Sogaard. “We shouldn’t have given him that many opportunities, but in saying that, that’s why you have a goalie. And clearly, he’s calm and he’s doing his thing.”

            Mike Matheson and Nick Suzuki scored for Montreal.

            “I liked our game but I didn’t like the result,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “It just kind of got away from us in the third. Not so much structurally, just missed assignments. First two periods, I thought we were outplaying them so obviously it wasn’t a 5-2 game.”

            Brassard opened the scoring for Ottawa with 4:48 left in the first period, tipping Nick Holden's long wrist shot past Montembeault.

            Just 58 seconds after Michael Pezzetta fought Watson, Matheson tied it for Montreal at 4:29 of the second. Matheson beat Sogaard off his own rebound.

            Suzuki gave Montreal the lead on a breakaway at 8:46 of the second with his 20th goal of the season. Pinto tied it at 2 with 6:09 left in the third, deflecting Alex DeBrincat's centering pass from the corner past Montembeault.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsMONTREAL (AP) — Austin Watson and Drake Batherson scored in a 47-second span in the third period to help the Ottawa Senators beat the Montreal Canadiens 5-2 on Saturday night.Ottawa rebounded from a 4-0 loss at Carolina on Friday night.“Sometimes you’re a little tired mentally on the back-to-back and you got to reset, but that’s why there’s three periods,” Senators forward Mathieu Joseph said. “I thought we had a good talk in the third, we showed up and the boys delivered.”Watson broke a tie at 4:31 with a deflection of Travis Hamonic's point shot and Batherson fired a wrist shot from the slot past past goalie Sam Montembeault at 5:18.Julien Gauthier added his first goal for the Senators with 8:03 to go. Gauthier came over from the New York Rangers a week ago along with a seventh-round pick for forward Tyler Motte.Derick Brassard and Shane Pinto also scored for Ottawa and Mads Sogaard made 29 saves and had his first career assist.“He was great,” Senators coach D.J. Smith said about Sogaard. “We shouldn’t have given him that many opportunities, but in saying that, that’s why you have a goalie. And clearly, he’s calm and he’s doing his thing.”Mike Matheson and Nick Suzuki scored for Montreal.“I liked our game but I didn’t like the result,” Canadiens coach Martin St. Louis said. “It just kind of got away from us in the third. Not so much structurally, just missed assignments. First two periods, I thought we were outplaying them so obviously it wasn’t a 5-2 game.”Brassard opened the scoring for Ottawa with 4:48 left in the first period, tipping Nick Holden's long wrist shot past Montembeault.Just 58 seconds after Michael Pezzetta fought Watson, Matheson tied it for Montreal at 4:29 of the second. Matheson beat Sogaard off his own rebound.Suzuki gave Montreal the lead on a breakaway at 8:46 of the second with his 20th goal of the season. Pinto tied it at 2 with 6:09 left in the third, deflecting Alex DeBrincat's centering pass from the corner past Montembeault.UP NEXTSenators: Host Detroit on Monday and Tuesday nights.Canadiens: At San Jose on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822029,Appleby sparks Wake Forest in 63-56 win over Notre Dame,"WNSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) — Tyree Appleby scored 21 points with six assists and four steals and Wake Forest pulled away from cold-shooting Notre Dame in the second half to earn a 63-56 win on Saturday night.

            The Irish struggled through two prolonged scoring droughts in the second half, scoring just a field goal over a nine-minute stretch, and after Ven-Allen Lubin scored five straight points, went scoreless for another three minutes.

            Wake Forest struggled through a drought of its own, going more than four minutes without scoring.











            The teams combined to score 75 points in the first half and just 49 in the second.

            Appleby hit 5 of 12 from distance, Andrew Carr added 11 points with seven rebounds and Bobi Klintman posted a double-double with 10 points and 12 rebounds for Wake Forest (18-11, 10-8 Atlantic Coast).

            Notre Dame (10-19, 2-16) was led by Lubin's 19 points with eight rebounds. Trey Wertz and Cormac Ryan each contributed 12 points. Wertz grabbed six rebounds and had five assists while Ryan had four steals.

            Wake Forest's Damari Monsanto underwent surgery to repair a torn Petella tendon on Saturday after going down with an injury in the waning seconds of Wednesday's game at North Carolina State.

            Wake Forest entertains Boston College on Tuesday in its final home game of the season. Notre Dame plays host to Pitt on Wednesday in Mike Brey's final home game as coach of the Irish.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822030,Gibson stops 51 shots as Ducks top Hurricanes,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Jakob Silfverberg and Troy Terry scored in the third period, and John Gibson stopped 51 shots as the Anaheim Ducks beat Carolina 3-2 on Saturday night to end the Hurricanes’ five-game winning streak.

            John Klingberg also scored and Trevor Zegras and Ryan Strome each had two assists for the Ducks, who’ve won two in a row following a six-game winless streak. 

            “It’s hard not to talk about our goalie, first and foremost,” Terry said. “It’s been unfair to him what he has had to do all year. It doesn’t wear off just how spectacular he is.”











            Jesperi Kotkaniemi and Jesper Fast scored for the Hurricanes, who lost for just the second time in their last 14 games. Frederik Andersen made 12 saves in what was a sour ending to a five-game homestand.

            Gibson had 13 saves in the first period, 22 in the second and 16 in the third to improve to 12-23-6 on the season. Among his notable saves was stopping Brent Burns’ redirect off Sebastian Aho’s pass in transition to keep the game scoreless in the second period.

            “I’m pretty tired,” Gibson said. “Pretty good trip overall with five points, but we just have to keep going. Overall, nice to get the win.”

            Hurricanes coach Rod Brind’Amour said Gibson was clearly up to the challenge.

            “We play that game 10 times, we’re going to win nine of them,” he said. “Unfortunate. We gave up some chances, but you’ve got to give up some in a game. Their goalie was good.”

            That save on Burns’ attempt came shortly before Klingberg’s goal on Anaheim’s 12th shot with 3:42 left in the period gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead. It was his eighth goal of the season.

            Silfverberg’s eighth goal came at 4:06 of the third to make it 2-0. He has scored in consecutive games for the first time this season.

            Kotkaniemi answered just 13 seconds later with his 11th goal.

            Terry got the next goal during a 4-on-4 set-up, pushing the Ducks’ lead to 3-1 with 7:59 remaining. It was his 15th.

            Again, the Hurricanes had a quick response as Fast scored 1:34 later for his first goal in 12 games. 

            “That’s a sign of a very, very good team that they can respond that quickly,” Ducks coach Dallas Eakins said. 

            Carolina couldn’t convert on a late power play despite pulling Andersen from the net.

            BACK IN THE GROOVE

            Terry was in his second game since a seven-game absence with an upper-body injury. He also scored Thursday night at Washington.

            “I’m just trying to judge myself on if I’m an impact player or not, and I felt like tonight I was,” Terry said.

            HE KEEPS DOING IT

            Burns, a defenseman in his first season with the Hurricanes, played in his 737th consecutive game for the second-longest ironman streak among defensemen in NHL history. Only Keith Yandle at 989 has produced a longer streak.

            It’s the ninth-longest overall, tying Jay Bouwmeester’s streak. Burns’ string began Nov. 21, 2013.

            WORTH NOTING

            Carolina’s 53 shots were its third-most in a game this season. ... Anaheim swept the two-game season series, also winning 4-3 in overtime Dec. 6. “Do they give a trophy for that?” Eakins asked. ... When playing on back-to-back days, this marked the Hurricanes’ first loss in regulation on the back end. They’re 7-1-1 in those games.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822033,Fast start helps No. 10 Marquette defeat DePaul 90-84,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Marquette didn't bother cutting down any nets after clinching a share of its first Big East regular-season title in a decade.

            The Golden Eagles have bigger goals in mind.

            “We don't want to share,” Tyler Kolek said after his 22 points and 14 assists helped No. 10 Marquette to a 90-84 victory over DePaul on Saturday night. “We want to put our stamp and really win the league. ... I think the scene will be different when we actually do that.”











            Kam Jones also scored 22 points as Marquette (23-6, 15-3) earned its first conference title since 2013, when the Golden Eagles shared the Big East crown with Georgetown and eventual national champion Louisville.

            Not bad for a team that didn’t have a single preseason all-Big East selection and was picked by the league’s coaches to finish ninth out of 11 conference teams.

            The other Big East teams with a shot to win a share of the title are No. 16 Xavier (21-8, 13-5) and No. 20 Providence (20-8, 12-5). Marquette can clinch the championship outright by winning either Tuesday at Butler or Saturday at home against St. John's.

            That remaining schedule explains why Marquette held off on a celebration.

            “We've got two more games left,” Marquette coach Shaka Smart said. “If this was our last game, then we would have done that. I asked Oso (Ighodaro) and Tyler a couple of days ago what they wanted to do with that, and they said, ‘Let’s try to win more.' Obviously when you get to this point — we've got two games remaining and we've clinched a share — it's a good time to be greedy in a good way.”

            Marquette rolled to a 49-28 halftime advantage and hung on after DePaul (9-20, 3-15) got close down the stretch. 

            Marquette has won nine of its last 10, while DePaul has lost 10 straight.

            DePaul cut Marquette’s lead to 78-72 on Umoja Gibson's 3-pointer with 3:18 remaining and got it down to four with 15 seconds left, but the Blue Demons couldn’t keep Kolek off the free-throw line in the closing minutes. 

            Kolek scored 15 of Marquette's last 16 points and was 9 of 10 on free-throw attempts in the final 2:04.

            “They're a resilient group, but you just can't dig yourself a 21-point hole on the road against a team as good as Marquette,” DePaul coach Tony Stubblefield said. “You have to exert so much energy to even get back in the game, that it's really hard to overcome.”

            Jones, celebrating his 21st birthday, put Marquette ahead for good by sinking a pair of 3-pointers in the first two minutes of the game. He made four shots from beyond the arc in the first 5½ minutes and had a career-high six 3-pointers by halftime.

            “He's one of the best shooters I've ever seen and one of my favorite guys to play with,” Kolek said.

            Marquette shot 11 of 21 on 3-point attempts during a first half that featured 11 assists by Kolek. The Golden Eagles were just 1 of 7 from beyond the arc in the second half, enabling DePaul to claw back into the game. 

            Gibson led DePaul with 20 points and eight assists. Nick Ongenda added 16 points and 12 rebounds.

            BIG PICTURE

            DePaul: The Blue Demons deserve credit for making this game competitive in the second half, but their losing streak still reached double digits. … DePaul was missing forward Yor Anei due to a hamstring injury. Da'Sean Nelson didn’t play the second half due to an ankle injury. … One bright spot was the performance of Ongenda, who had season highs in points and rebounds. Ongenda was playing just his fourth game of the season after recovering from wrist surgery.

            Marquette: If the Golden Eagles play the way they did the first half, they can beat anyone in the country. But their second-half fade should serve as a lesson as they gear up for the NCAA Tournament. They might not have been able to survive that kind of late slump against a better opponent.

            
                POLL IMPLICATIONS
              

            There’s at least a possibility Marquette could move into the top seven for the first time since the 1977-78 season. No. 6 Virginia, No. 7 Arizona and No. 8 Texas all lost this week.

Ongenda was playing just his fourth game of the season after recovering from wrist surgery.Marquette: If the Golden Eagles play the way they did the first half, they can beat anyone in the country. But their second-half fade should serve as a lesson as they gear up for the NCAA Tournament. They might not have been able to survive that kind of late slump against a better opponent.POLL IMPLICATIONSThere’s at least a possibility Marquette could move into the top seven for the first time since the 1977-78 season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822034,Bruins goaltender Linus Ullmark scores into empty net,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Goaltender Linus Ullmark scored into an empty net in the final minute and the NHL-leading Boston Bruins beat the Vancouver Canucks 3-1 on Saturday might for their sixth straight victory.

            Ullmark made a save and fired a high wrist shot the length of the ice to become the 13th goalie in NHL history to score a goal — and the eighth to actually shoot the puck into the net.

            “It’s one of the dreams I always had that I wanted to score a goal and now I had the opportunity,” Ullmark said. “I tried it at the Winter Classic, didn’t really make it and now everything came together.”











            Defenseman Hampus Lindholm and Brad Marchand had first-period goals for the Bruins, and Ullmark made 26 saves.

            Brock Boeser scored for Vancouver.

            “This was a Stanley Cup-winning type team, but I thought we hung in there,” Canucks coach Rick Tocchet said. “We played well, I’m kind of proud of the guys, some of our top guys are a little tired.”

            Lindholm opened the scoring on a power play with 2:52 left in the first period. beating goalie Arturs Silovs with a one-timer from the point.

            Marchand made it 2-0 with 35 seconds left in the first, darting to the middle on a break and beating Silovs to the far side for his 19th goal of the season.

            Boeser scored for Vancouver at 7:24 of the third.

            Silovs stopped 32 shots.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822036,"Mercer extends goal streak to 6 games, Devils roll Flyers","NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — The New Jersey Devils honored their 2003 Stanley Cup championship team before playing the Philadelphia Flyers, and then they went out and played like the NHL's best team.

            Dawson Mercer scored in his sixth straight game, Akira Schmid made 24 saves in posting his first shutout and the Devils pounded the Flyers 7-0 on Saturday night, handing Philadelphia goaltender Samuel Ersson his first loss.

            “You can feel the emotion in the rink when they’re coming out (the '03 team) and just to see those guys so happy that they were back together with everyone and that’s a special bond,” Mercer said. “That’s what happens with winning teams and hopefully we can just keep working in the right direction.”











            Jonas Siegenthaler, Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier, Dougie Hamilton, Jesper Bratt and Nathan Bastian also scored as the Devils improved to 15-3-2 in their last 20 games. The seven-goal winning margin was New Jersey's largest of the season, and the output matched their season high.

            “I thought it was a great night just to honor all the players that were here and play the way we did,” Devils coach Lindy Ruff said. “It’s something to be proud of.”

            Ersson, who was the 12th NHL goaltender to win each of his first six decision, was outstanding making 29 saves as Philadelphia fell to 1-6-1 in its last eight games. Two of the Devils' goals were deflected by Flyers players, another one came when a defenseman was pushed into Ersson and opened the crease and four were on his doorstep by open players.

            “I let in seven goals. I can’t be happy,"" Ersson said. ""But like, yeah, it’s tough. I mean, I want to win every game. I want to save every puck. So it’s obviously a lot of goals. I have to make a couple of saves here.”

            Mercer extended his streak with his eighth goal in the last six games, and 19th overall. The last Devils player to score in six straight games was Adam Henrique in 2014. The franchise record is eight games set by Paul Gardner in 1977-78 when the team played in Colorado before the move to New Jersey.

            “I was kind of just trying to get myself open,” said Mercer, who was set up right in front by Hischier late in the second period for a 3-0 lead. “I knew Nico saw me like he was looking around and I was hoping their defense didn’t realize so I kind of just left it up to Nico.”

            The Flyers are in transition and and shorthanded because of injuries.

            “We have to think about winning games 2-1 because we’re just not built to make a bunch of offensive plays right now,” coach John Tortorella said. “The effort is there. I just don’t think we’re using our head and understanding how we have to play.”

            Siegenthaler gave the Devils the lead on a point shot deflected by a Flyers' player. The defenseman set up Hughes' breakaway goal — his 36th — later in the second period. Mercer made it 3-0 and New Jersey added four more goals in the third period.

            Flyers veteran forward James van Riemsdyk was banged up and did not play, Tortorella said. It could be a prelude to a trade.

            NOTES: Flyers C Elliot Desnoyers, 21, was called up from Lehigh Valley (AHL) and played in his first NHL game. ... Flyers D Nick Seeler won a second-period slugfest with Devils C Michael McLeod. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822038,"Williams, Hornets send Heat to 4th straight defeat 108-103","CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Gordon Hayward scored 21 points, rookie center Mark Williams had a huge game with 18 points and 20 rebounds — both career highs — and the surging Charlotte Hornets defeated the Miami Heat 108-103 on Saturday night for their season-best fourth straight win.

            LaMelo Ball had 16 of his 19 points in the second half and finished with 13 assists for his sixth straight double-double. Kelly Oubre Jr. and Dennis Smith Jr. each had 15 points off the bench for the Hornets.

            Tyler Herro had 33 points on six 3-pointers and Jimmy Butler added 28 points as Miami lost its fourth straight. Kevin Love had 13 points and 13 rebounds in his second game since joining the Heat.











            Herro called losing games on back-to-back nights coming out of the All-Star break “disappointing.”

            “This is a point in the year where we can either come together or we can go away and split,” Herro said. 

            The Hornets earned a season series split with the Heat, with each team winning twice at home.

            Williams was a dominant force inside all night for the Hornets and scored the game's final four points on an alley-oop from Ball and a thunderous dunk of an offensive rebound to help bury the Heat. He finished 9 of 12 from the field.

            “I think everybody viewed him as a talented defensive rim protector, but he has a chance to be a very good offensive player, too,"" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said of Williams, the 15th overall pick in last year's draft.

            Williams stepped into a starting role when the team sent veteran Mason Plumlee to the Los Angeles Clippers at the trade deadline.

            “The more and more I play, the more and more comfortable I get,"" Williams said. “Offensively, getting ready to catch passes from whoever, lobs, drop offs, on the offensive glass.”

            Charlotte led by 22 in the first half before Miami clawed back to cut the lead to three at the break.

            But Ball, who was 1 of 11 from the field in the first half, erupted with three 3-pointers in the first three minutes of the third quarter to set the tone for the second half. He added two more crucial 3s in the fourth quarter after Miami had cut the lead to one.

            “He’s super confident and he puts so much time in, so that gives you confidence,” Clifford said. “He works at it and his game is in rhythm, so I think he feels like he's always going to be able to make them.”

            Miami's offensive struggles — it has failed to reach 110 points in six straight games — carried over to the first half.

            The Heat shot 20.8% from the floor in the first quarter to fall behind 29-16. Charlotte extended the lead to 22 in the second quarter before Miami closed the first half on a 24-6 run sparked by 10 points by Love and a pair of 3s from Herro.

            “We put ourselves in a hole and it's just tough to get out of in this league with a bunch of good teams and good players,” Herro said. “That's on us as players to bring out best effort every night.” 

            Miami would cut the lead to one with under two minutes to play in the game on Bam Adebayo's driving dunk and had a chance to take the lead on its next possession. But Adebayo turned the ball over on a fast-break opportunity with 1:30 left.

            Williams made the Heat pay with back-to-back baskets.

            Miami failed to score on its final four possessions, turning it over twice.

            TIP INS

            Heat: Kyle Lowry (left knee soreness), Nikola Jovic (lower back stress reaction) and Omer Yurtseven (ankle surgery) did not play. ... Butler was 16 of 20 from the foul line.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822040,Hood-Schifino helps No. 17 Hoosiers sweep No. 5 Purdue,"WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) — Trayce Jackson-Davis turned into Jalen Hood-Schifino's biggest fan Saturday night.

            A few hours later, they were celebrating together.

            
                Hood-Schifino scored a career-high 35 points, Trey Galloway fueled a key 12-0 second-half run and No. 17 Indiana gave Jakcson-Davis his first road win against No. 5 Purdue, 79-71.











            “He plays the game at his pace and tonight, we really rode him,” Jackson-Davis said. “We found a way to do something tonight that hand't been done in a long time.”

            It had been a dubious decade at Mackey Arena., where Indiana lost seven straight since 2012-13. That was also the last time Indiana (20-9, 11-7 Big Ten) swept the season series.

            Now both streaks are over as is coach Mike Woodson's winless run at the same venue. He lost four straight as a player and again last season, his first since taking the job at his alma mater.

            And it came with a surprise twist.

            Boilermakers fans gathered hours before tip-off in snaking lines and chilly temperatures aroudn the arena's entrances — eager to witness Round 2 of the Big Ten's big men battle.

            Zach Edey certainly did his part, finishing with 26 points and 16 rebounds as the Boilermakers (24-5, 13-5) lost for the third time in four games and blew a chance to clinch a share of the conference crown.

            
                Jackson-Davis, in contrast, was scoreless for the first 28 minutes, got into foul trouble and wound up with 10 points, eight rebounds and seven assists.

            Instead, two other guys — Schifino-Hood and Galloway — stole the spotlight from Mackey's first prime-time weekend game between the teams. 

            “He's had his moments this season,” Woodson said when asked about Schifino-Hood. “Tonight, he was brilliant — a total good game.”

            And in the first half, when Indiana struggled offensively, Schifino-Hood did not. He scored 23 points to keep the Hoosiers within 38-34 at halftime.

            Then, after Purdue scored the first basket of the second half, Galloway turned the game. It started with a 3-pointer and Galloway wound up with eight points, one steal and one assist during the 12-0 run that gave Indiana its first lead and in control 46-40 with 15:52 to go.

            Galloway had 13 points five assists.

            Indiana never trailed again, extending the margin toas much as 13, and with four Indiana players with four fouls, it was Schifino-Hood's final scoring flurry that finally closed it out.

            “Very few people have rolled through here and done that and to do that at 19?” Purdue coach Matt Painter. said. “Getting swept by them is not something on our resume, but it is.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers certainly have played well since mid-January, winning nine of 12 and beating Purdue twice. And the secret to their success is obvious — defense. It allowed them to beat a top-five team on the road Saturday, even with Jackson-Davis held in check. That's a good sign for the Hoosiers as March looms.

            Purdue: Coach Matt Painter's squad has hit its first real rough patch of the season and the timing couldn't be worse. Though the Boilermakers have been the nation's top-ranked team most of this season, they may be squandering a chance to earn a rare No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. They need to find more consistent scoring options to help Edey — and fast.

            POLL IMPLICATIONS

            Indiana: Tuesday's road loss to an emotional Michigan State shouldn't hurt much, especially with an impressive road victory at Purdue.

            Purdue: The Boilermakers took a tumble last week and this one will only keep them sliding. 

            NOTABLE

            Indiana overcame Purdue's huge rebounding advantage, 46-23, and a stark free-throw discrepancy, 33-12, by committing just eight turnovers. The Boilermakers also were hurt by the their free-throw shooting, going just 22 of 33.

            HE SAID IT

            “We've got to play better, more than anything,” Painter said. “Give Indiana credit. They better than we did.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822043,"UK indie band Black Country, New Road to appear in Taipei","TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Black Country, New Road (BCNR) have experienced a wild ride since the release of “Ants from Up There”, which debuted at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart in February 2022.
Critical and public acclaim led to a packed touring schedule and international engagements. Unfortunately, fame was not enough to dissuade lead vocalist and guitarist, Isaac Wood, from quitting the band, leading the band to make the decision to soldier on with new material.
Fortunately, improvisation is a key element of BCNR according to band member, Charlie Wayne, in an exclusive email interview conducted by Taiwan News.

Is BCNR named after an actual road, ""Black Country New Road"" in England?

            The band both was and wasn't named after Black Country New Road. We first came across the name whilst surfing through randomly generated Wikipedia articles. The article that we used for the band's name was about a small road that goes through the midlands in the U.K., near Birmingham and Wolverhampton. We didn’t name the band on account of any particular affinity with the Black Country New Road, it was just the best of quite a lot of other bad options we had for prospective band names. We didn’t really think about it at the time, but as time passed we appropriated our own meaning to the name. The addition of the comma in the middle also made it our own. Band names don’t really mean anything at all unless there’s music attached to them.

BCNR were one of the few bands to tour during COVID, even doing “socially-distanced concerts”. What was this experience like? You must be glad most regulations have been dropped.











            We did a bunch of socially distanced shows back in 2021. It was largely because we wanted to road-test AFUT. It actually really helped to perform the tracks in front of small crowds. It would have been a bit weird to perform new tracks in big rooms, I think. In part because we were still tweaking the songs, but also because we were only really used to performing to small rooms. We sort of came up during the pandemic, so we didn’t really know what sized rooms we could perform in — it maybe just seemed more natural to perform to the smaller rooms that we knew.

            Saying that, though you’re right, I’m glad that the restrictions have been lifted, it’s really exciting to be able to play in larger spaces.

Can you give us some highlights of your recent tour with Black Midi or what some referred to Black 2 Tour?

            The Black 2 tour (or the ‘Back in Black’ tour as we called it) was something that we’d been wanting to do for a really long time. The guys in black midi are close friends of ours and we love their music. We didn’t get up to many proper hijinks, but we did wind up having loads of fun. We went sand-boarding and sledging down the White Sands National Park, which was pretty amazing, lots of bowling in LA and a few lovely evenings spent in each other's company.

Is geographical proximity the main reason behind BCNR's affinity Black Midi & Squid, or what some dub the “Windmill Scene” after the famous Windmill Pub in Southwest London?

            We met Black Midi at the Windmill, a pub/venue in London. It’s pretty well known in the alternative music scene for putting on bands like Goat Girl, Shame and HMTLD before us. We just started playing around the same time as Black Midi. They’re also about the same age as us, so we got to know them a little bit as we played more and more shows with one another. We also have the same booking agent so we started playing across Europe together when we both started playing shows.

            People also then just started grouping the two of us and Squid into the same sort of scene. The people in Squid are also really lovely, and amazing musicians. They’re not from London and they’re a little bit older, but I suppose we share the same musical sensibilities as them (broadly). People also just quite like categorizing things like musicians. Placing people into a scene always adds a bit of context (whether it’s relevant/important is maybe not altogether important).

I believe you are currently touring without any recorded music available to the public? Is this correct? And how are audiences responding to this?

            When Isaac left the band last year, we made the decision to continue performing, only under the condition that we play new music without his vocals. It was a pretty intense decision at the time and it was quite stressful — we had to write a full set of brand new music in under 6 months in order to perform at the festivals we’d been booked for over the summer. I think that we’re very lucky to have had a wonderful/understanding fan base. They know that our music is based on experimentation and the majority of people embraced the change. I think music also speaks for itself. It's different without Isaac, but by no means worse. We wouldn’t be performing it if we felt it was. Fundamentally, we’re still the same musicians with the same musical sensibilities — it’s just new.

Any chance that you will play music from “Ants from Up There”?

            As I mentioned, it just wouldn’t feel right to play any of the music that we wrote with Isaac without him. It’s not something that any of us want to do at the moment. It’s not because we’re trying to be obstructive or punitive to people who’ve really engaged with that album. All of the support that we’ve received has been pretty overwhelming. We just hope that people will be able to find the music that we’ve made since AFUT is just as interesting and engaging.

Do you consider BCNR to be more of a musical ”collective” rather than a traditional band? Is this intentional? Sort of a democratic approach to making music.

            Yeah, I think BCNR has never really had a ‘bandleader’ in the conventional sense. There’s no one voice that guides the others. We’re a group of friends first and bandmates second. It makes more sense to think of it in that context — it would be weird to have a leader of a friendship group. I also think the musical makeup of the group also lends itself to that attitude. Everyone governs their own little musical space because they’re the best at their respective instruments. I’m the best drummer in the group, so ultimately, I have the final say over what happens with the drums — that applies to everyone else. I really wouldn’t know where to start when writing a sax part, for example. We all obviously have our opinions about how songs should broadly be, and those opinions don’t always align, but that’s part of the fun of it — we talk a lot about what sounds good and what we could do to make songs sound better. Everyone’s ideas are listened to and tested out — we try everything once and nothing is personal.

Please feel free to add anything you want to this interview. I look forward to the show at The Wall. It’s a great performance space with good acoustics. 

            I think we’re all still pretty amazed that we’re going to be heading out to Taiwan to come and perform a show. I don’t think any of us would’ve ever imagined that we’d be invited to come and play somewhere so far away from the UK. It’s pretty amazing. I think we’re all pretty grateful to the people who’ve bought tickets to come and see us. I hope we put on a good show!TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Black Country, New Road (BCNR) have experienced a wild ride since the release of “Ants from Up There”, which debuted at No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart in February 2022.Critical and public acclaim led to a packed touring schedule and international engagements.

            USC ties No. 7 Arizona for second place in the Pac-12 Conference with the win. Arizona State stunned the Wildcats 89-88 earlier Saturday on Desmond Cambridge's 55-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer.

            Ellis made 6 of 12 shots, including 4 of 8 from 3-point range, for the Trojans (21-8, 13-5). Peterson hit two 3-pointers and added eight assists and seven rebounds. Kobe Johnson finished with 12 points and three steals. Reese Dixon-Waters contributed nine points and six rebounds off the bench.











            Marco Anthony scored 11 points to lead the Utes (17-13, 10-9), who have lost four straight. Branden Carlson totaled 10 points and 10 rebounds.

            Ellis sank three 3-pointers and scored 11 points, Peterson added 10 and Southern Cal built a 34-28 lead at halftime. The Trojans shot only 39% overall, but they made 8 of 15 from beyond the arc. Utah shot 34% overall and missed 9 of 11 attempts from distance. The Utes had six turnovers to USC's five, but the Trojans had an 11-0 edge in points off those turnovers.

            Ellis buried a 3-pointer to open the second half and a dunk by Vincent Iwuchukwu gave the Trojans a 43-36 lead with 13:51 left to play. Anthony followed with a layup and Mike Saunders Jr. hit a 3-pointer to pull the Utes within two, but Johnson answered with a 3-pointer and USC maintained a two-possession lead the rest of the way.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822066,Sharks retire Patrick Marleau's No. 12 jersey,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Patrick Marleau walked to the stage as the fans chanted his name and began tearing up. 

            The emotions carried through the entire ceremony until his No. 12 jersey was raised to the rafters Saturday night as the first to be retired in San Jose Sharks history. 

            “It was surreal,” Marleau said after the ceremony. “It just flashes before your eyes that everything I did led up to that moment. I was just so appreciative that it went so well, that I had the career that I had, that I had the support I had. It just all flashed before me. All that hard work finally paid off.”











            Marleau had the most accomplished career of any San Jose player so it was only appropriate that his jersey was the first to be raised to the rafters at the Shark Tank.

            The weekend long celebration was capped by the ceremony that featured about two dozen former teammates, video tributes from former coaches and teammates, and an appearance by Bay Area sports greats Barry Bonds, Rollie Fingers and Chris Mullin.

            The jersey retirement puts a coda on a remarkable career in which Marleau set several franchise records and also played in an NHL-record 1,779 games — breaking the previous mark of 1,767 set by Gordie Howe.

            ""I don't know if I have a favorite moment because I was living my dream every day and I got to do the majority of that right here in San Jose,” Marleau said in his speech.

            He night started with a “teal carpet” ceremony that featured throngs of cheering fans — many in Marleau jerseys — cheering as about two dozen former Sharks walked in before Marleau and his family arrived.

            Marleau signed autographs for the adoring fans and posed for pictures with his wife, Christina, and four sons, before heading inside for the jersey retirement.

            He was the franchise's first homegrown superstar after being drafted second overall in 1997. He holds the Sharks records for games played (1,607), goals (522) and points (1,111) as he helped make the team into a perennial contender and a fixture in the South Bay.

            “I’m so happy to be a part of that that story to be part of the evolution of hockey in the Bay Area,” he said.

            Marleau ranks 23rd with 566 goals and 52nd with 1,197 points for San Jose, Toronto and Pittsburgh. He also won Olympic gold medals for Canada in 2010 and '14. 

            It was as a celebratory weekend for Marleau, starting with a ceremony at San Jose City Hall on Thursday when a teal flag featuring Marleau's number and silhouette were raised.

            San Jose mayor Matt Mahan officially declared Saturday, “Patrick Marleau Day.”

            “You can’t mention San Jose without mentioning the Sharks, and you can’t mention the Sharks without thinking of Patrick Marleau,” Mahan said.

            There then was an alumni game played Friday night featuring Marleau, his sons, and several of his former San Jose teammates before the jersey raising ceremony on Saturday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822067,No. 1 Houston tops East Carolina to claim outright AAC title,"GREENVILLE. N.C. (AP) — Kelvin Sampson had no interest in breaking down the ins and outs of top-ranked Houston's first-half lockdown on East Carolina.

            Not when compared to having another American Athletic Conference regular-season title in hand.

            “I'm happy for our kids to be rewarded with winning a conference championship,” Sampson said after Saturday night's 76-57 win at East Carolina to clinch outright possession of the league's regular-season title. “That's not easy to do.”











            Marcus Sasser scored 22 points to lead the Cougars (27-2, 15-1), who have won at least a share of the crown four times in five seasons. This time, it comes with the Cougars charging toward March with a perfect road record.

            “Our kids know how to win — I say that a lot,"" Sampson said. “But we've figured out how to play our system, be unselfish.”

            To his point, Sasser got plenty of help from Tramon Mark (20 points) and J'Wan Roberts (17 points, 12 rebounds) in Houston's ninth straight victory. 

            And as with the long-running formula under Sampson, the Cougars didn't need a huge offensive performance to assert control of this one while leaning on defense and rebounding.

            By halftime, the Cougars had blocked more shots (five) than the Pirates had even made (three) and led by 17. ECU finished the game shooting 32%, including 52% after halftime while trailing big, and Houston claimed a 48-28 rebounding advantage that included 17 offensive rebounds and 19 second-chance points.

            East Carolina (14-14, 5-10) had an energetic home crowd for the first-ever visit from a No. 1-ranked team to Minges Coliseum, as well as the program's first game against a top-ranked opponent in more than 31 years. But the Cougars never trailed and led for all but 56 seconds.

            “The atmosphere (fans) had in there, they delivered at the highest level — the students, this community, Greenville,” first-year ECU coach Michael Schwartz said. “It was electric in there. They delivered. Unfortunately, we weren't able to deliver the same back to them.”

            Ezra Ausar scored 15 points to lead the Pirates, who got as close as 50-35 after halftime on Jaden Walker's 3-pointer at the 11:37 mark. In fact, it was the first of three times ECU pulled within 15 — yet Houston answered immediately each time to keep the Pirates from sustaining any true momentum toward a stunning upset.

            BIG PICTURE

            Houston: The Cougars have been rolling right along toward March with the kind of defensive efficiency that can make offensive possessions an adventure for opponents. And they arrived as the the only team in KenPom's metrics to rank in the top 10 nationally of adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency. Houston ended up with a relatively low-drama trip to the state of North Carolina.

            ECU: Pirates fans had memories of Houston’s last visit here two years ago, when the Pirates stunned the fifth-ranked Cougars for their lone win against a top-5 opponent and their first win against any AP Top 25 team in nearly two decades. This time, they were getting their fourth shot against the No. 1-ranked team and first since losing at Duke in November 1991. But the Pirates saw any chance to a repeat upset wither amid that 3-for-25 shooting in the first half, including going the last 10:56 without a basket as Houston's lead grew.

            INJURY SCARE

            The Cougars had at least one bit of drama: a brief injury exit for Sasser.

            Averaging a team-best 16.9 points, he got off to a fast start before having to leave after rolling his right ankle, which happened as he bumped into ECU screener Brandon Johnson away from the ball. He had to be helped off the court and taken to the locker room, though he returned minutes later to make it a brief absence for the team’s leading scorer.

            “I was just happy he was good,” Mark said.

(AP) — Kelvin Sampson had no interest in breaking down the ins and outs of top-ranked Houston's first-half lockdown on East Carolina.Not when compared to having another American Athletic Conference regular-season title in hand.“I'm happy for our kids to be rewarded with winning a conference championship,” Sampson said after Saturday night's 76-57 win at East Carolina to clinch outright possession of the league's regular-season title. “That's not easy to do.”Marcus Sasser scored 22 points to lead the Cougars (27-2, 15-1), who have won at least a share of the crown four times in five seasons. This time, it comes with the Cougars charging toward March with a perfect road record.“Our kids know how to win — I say that a lot,"" Sampson said. “But we've figured out how to play our system, be unselfish.”To his point, Sasser got plenty of help from Tramon Mark (20 points) and J'Wan Roberts (17 points, 12 rebounds) in Houston's ninth straight victory.And as with the long-running formula under Sampson, the Cougars didn't need a huge offensive performance to assert control of this one while leaning on defense and rebounding.By halftime, the Cougars had blocked more shots (five) than the Pirates had even made (three) and led by 17.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822068,Knicks rout Pelicans while honoring 1973 championship squad,"NEW YORK (AP) — Julius Randle scored 28 points to lead New York to a 128-106 rout of the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday night as the Knicks celebrated the golden anniversary of their 1972-73 NBA championship team. 

            Six players scored in double figures for New York, which won its fifth straight. R.J. Barrett had 25 points and a season-high seven assists. Jalen Brunson added 20 points, Josh Hart scored 15 points, Immanuel Quickley added 13, and Mitchell Robinson finished with a double-double of 11 points and 13 rebounds.

            “It's a team, any given night it's going to be different,” Barrett said, when asked if the 2022-23 Knicks were emulating their 1972-73 predecessors by playing unselfish basketball. “We did a great job sharing the ball. Everybody kind of had a great game.” 











            Brandon Ingram scored 19 points for the Pelicans, who lost their third straight and fourth in five games overall. Josh Richardson added 16 points, C.J. McCollum finished with 13 and Jonas Valanciunas had 12 points and 10 rebounds. Trey Murphy III scored 11 off the bench.

            “We have to be better and I (have to) hold our guys more accountable,” Pelicans coach Willie Green said. “That standard in which we played with tonight is not us.”

            New York was playing the second half of a back-to-back, coming off a 115-109 win over the Wizards a night earlier in Washington. Meanwhile the Pelicans last played Thursday, falling 115-110 loss to the Raptors in Toronto.

            The Knicks came out looking like the fresher team, building a 42-26 advantage after the first quarter, and extending the lead to 73-52 at halftime.

            Randle (19), Barrett (13), and Brunson (12) combined for 44 points as New York shot 54.3% from the field (25 for 46) and 50% from 3-point distance (13 for 26). New York's 13 3-pointers in the first half matched a season high.

            “Got off to a good start,” said Randle, “and sustained it.”

            The Pelicans trailed by as many as 27 points midway through the third. Despite going on a 19-12 run to close out the period, New Orleans trailed 102-82 entering the fourth.

            New York opened the fourth with a 12-8 spurt, highlighted by Robinson’s one-handed alley-oop dunk. And Randle’s two-handed dunk off of Quickley’s off-the-backboard-pass all but ended any hopes of a comeback by the Pelicans.

            New Orleans lost reserve forward Larry Nance Jr. in the second quarter with a sprained left ankle. He did not return. Nance was defending Quickley and landed awkwardly while attempting to contest a layup. Nance was down on the court for a few minutes and had to be helped to the locker room.

            TIP-INS:

            Pelicans: Here is what Green knows: He and his team will have star Zion Williamson return from a right hamstring injury at some point this season. Green and his team suspect Williamson’s return will happen before the playoffs begin. What is unknown is how Williamson will be reintroduced to the roster. “Once (we know) he’s ready it’s something that (Executive Vice-President of Basketball Operations David Griffin and) our performance team and medical (staff) and coaches sit down and talk about what’s the best plan,” Green said. Entering the game, the Pelicans had lost 17 of 24 games played in 2023 without Williamson in the lineup.

            Knicks: Throughout the game, the Knicks paid homage to their 1972-73 championship team with video testimonials and a halftime ceremony. And perhaps no person in Madison Square Garden could better appreciate that team more than Tom Thibodeau, who grew up in Connecticut rooting for the Knicks. “That was such a great team,” Thibodeau said during his pregame press conference. “They were so unselfish. They played great defense. … That was such a fun team but it’s what they embodied and how they played for each other. I think it resonated with the city.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822070,"Vasilevskiy makes 45 saves, Lightning beat Red Wings 3-0","DETROIT (AP) — Andrei Vasilevskiy made 45 saves for his 30th NHL shutout and the Tampa Bay Lightning cooled off the Detroit Red Wings 3-0 on Saturday night.

            Nikita Kucherov reached 699 points with a goal and an assist, Brayden Point also had a goal and an assist and Alex Killorn added an empty-net goal to help the Lightning win for the second time in five games. 

            The Lighting were coming off a 6-5 overtime loss to Buffalo and were eager to bounce back.











            “He’s an outstanding goalie in this league, so we’ve seen him play great games on a number of occasions,” Tampa Bay coach John Cooper said. “Probably not to that extent, just because we don’t usually play that poorly. He really wanted to get back out there after the Buffalo game, and boy, it shows Vasy’s character to play the other night like he did and then come right back and stand on his head. That was a marvelous performance.”

            Ville Husso stopped 15 shots for the Red Wings. They had won seven of their last eight games. Detroit has been shut out three times this season.

            “We needed this game after Buffalo,” Vasilevskiy said. “Detroit is obviously really hot and fighting for the playoffs, but we got some important goals and the defense did a great job blocking shots.”

            Detroit coach Derek Lalonde, Cooper's former top assistant, had an inkling Vasilevskiy would ferociously protect the net.

            “As a team when they come off poor losses, they dig in but no one digs in more than Vasy off a poor performance,” Lalonde said. “He takes it personal. He was just remarkable. Obviously, it feels like we deserved a much better fate.”

            Red Wings forward Michael Rasmussen was hit in the kneecap while blocking a shot in the first period and did not return. Lalonde said afterward he was still be evaluated by the medical staff.

            Point's 35th goal provided the only scoring in the opening period. Kucherov's lead pass allowed Point to get behind the defense and he lifted a shot just inside the crossbar.

            Detroit dominated the second period with a 19-3 shots on goal advantage, yet Tampa Bay emerged with a 2-0 lead. 

            Shortly after the Lightning killed off a penalty, Kucherov backhanded a shot from the right circle that squeezed through Husso's pads with seven seconds left in the period. Kucherov's 22nd goal this season was his 20th in 32 career games against Detroit.

            “That’s a big swing,” Tampa Bay defenseman Victor Hedman said. “We had a cluster in our own end and survived it and then we go down and get one with seven seconds left. That really lifts your confidence.”

            That was more than enough support for Vasilevskiy.

            “It's not what you want to see as the other team when he’s hot like that and pucks are hitting him,” Red Wings captain Dylan Larkin said. “You could just tell he was going to be the difference maker.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822073,"Morant scores 23, Grizzlies rout Nuggets in West showdown","MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Ja Morant had 23 points and seven rebounds as the Memphis Grizzlies raced to an early lead and coasted to a 112-94 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night in a matchup of the Western Conference’s top teams. 

            Tyus Jones finished with 17 points, and Luke Kennard, Xavier Tillman and Dillon Brooks scored 12 apiece for Memphis, which trails Denver by six games in the conference race.

            Nikola Jokic led the Nuggets with 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Jeff Green added 12 points. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Christian Braun each scored 11 points as Denver's four-game winning streak came to an end. Denver was hampered by a 40% shooting game. The Nuggets' starters were 17 of 47 from the field in the game.











            Denver's 94 total points was a season low.

            “One of the biggest priorities was transition defense,” Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said. “I thought our urgency was phenomenal.”

            The matchup of the West leaders had Denver entering while playing well and Memphis struggling, dropping six of its last 10 games and losing its grip on the second spot as the Sacramento Kings rose to third.

            But Memphis came out with more intensity and defensive pressure, a continuation of the Grizzlies first post-All-Star break game — a last-minute loss at Philadelphia.

            “They just played more physical than us,” Green said. “They treated it like a playoff game. We didn't. We came out lackadaisical. They got a good lead, and we couldn't bounce back.”

            Nuggets coach Michael Malone added: “I felt like going into this game that (the Grizzlies) were going to approach this as a playoff game. We approached it as a game 61 or 62.”

            The Grizzlies finished with 19 fast-break points and 60 points in the paint.

            “They ran off misses. They ran off makes. They were sprinting. We just didn’t match that,” Malone said.

            Memphis converted 56% of its shots in the first half and was 9 of 21 form outside the arc. Meanwhile, the Nuggets offense struggled, shooting 38% from the field and making only 3 of 16 3-pointers. Ten turnovers added to the Nuggets' misery.

            Memphis led by as many as 29 points in the first half and carried a 66-42 advantage at the break. 

            Memphis opened the second half with eight straight points, pushing the lead to 32 points. That catapulted the Grizzlies to a 94-62 advantage through three quarters. At that point, Memphis was still shooting better than 53%.

            With Denver facing the second half of a back-to-back Sunday, Malone sat his starters in the fourth quarter.

            The win gave Memphis a two-game cushion over third-place Sacramento after the Kings' 176-175 win over the Clippers in double-overtime Friday night. But despite the rout of the Nuggets, Memphis didn't consider the win a statement game.

            “I think it's too early to say,” Jones said. “It's a good win. They're a good team, but it's also one game. Don't try to look too much into it.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822080,Tries galore in Super Rugby Pacific opening round,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — Law changes designed to speed up matches in Super Rugby Pacific appear at first glance to have been successful. Matches in the tournament’s first weekend generally were fast-paced and high-scoring.

            There were an average of 7.6 tries per game, a small increase on the average of 6.8 tries per match over the whole of the 2022 season. The average score of winning teams was 39 points and the average total of points per match was 61.

            Most matches were competitive with an average margin between teams of 18 but that is made larger by two blowouts: the Blues’ 60-20 win over the Highlanders and the Hurricanes’ 47-13 win over the Queensland Reds.











            The decision to apply a “shot clock” to set pieces and goal kicks and to require the ball to be used at rucks within five seconds of being presented did appear to hurry proceedings.

            In some matches play at times seemed to take on a frantic tone: the six minutes played after the fulltime siren in the match between the Auckland-based Blues and Dunedin-based Highlanders was harum-scarum as both sides tried to take advantage of late attacking chances.

            The largest upset of the round came in the opening game when the Hamilton-based Chiefs beat defending champions the Crusaders 31-10 on the Crusaders home ground in Christchurch.

            The Chiefs are a team that seems to thrive in a fast and unstructured game, so the accelerated pace of the game on Friday suited them more than the Crusaders who weren’t able to keep control after scoring the opening try.

            The Crusaders were forced to make more than 200 tackles as the Chiefs gained more and more possession. The Chiefs also beat 46 defenders in an almost unprecedented failure of the Crusaders’ defense.

            “We played some decent footy at the start. Then momentum went their way and we just couldn’t get back going again,” Crusaders coach Scott Robertson said. “It is a mystery. We actually trained really well this week and had a really good mindset coming in.

            “They won a lot of kick battles. We made a lot of tackles. Our discipline started to go a bit and we were just on the back foot.”

            In Australia, the New South Wales Waratahs’ 31-25 loss to the ACT Brumbies was a surprise because the Waratahs had been so bullish in the pre-season. They returned for the first time in five years to Sydney’s Allianz Stadium and felt that homecoming would not only boost crowds but lift their performance.

            More than 25,000 turned up — the largest crowd of the first round — and saw the Brumbies beat the Waratahs for the ninth-straight time.

            The turning point might have come early, in the 20th minute when Waratahs and Wallabies prop Angus Bell limped from the field with a serious foot injury. The Waratahs seemed to have an edge up front until Bell departed.

            Waratahs coach Darren Coleman hoped an early prognosis that Bell may have to spend a long time on the sidelines was mistaken.

            “We are holding out a bit of hope; he’s getting scans,” he said. “But he felt very similar to when he did it in the England test. It is horrible news.”

            In terms of statement performances, none was louder than the Blues 40-point victory over the Highlanders.

            The Blues scored eight tries and many were made possible by the strong running of Mark Telea on the left wing.

            The Wellington-based Hurricanes beat the Queensland Reds 47-13 in the only trans-Tasman match of the first round but it may be too early to conclude New Zealand teams will dominate Australian teams again this year.

            The Hurricanes led by only three points at 16-13 after a competitive first half and their second half scoring owed a lot to the Reds’ indiscipline.

            In other matches, the Fiji Drua scored the 11th try of a thrilling match to edge Moana Pasifika 36-24 and former All Black Jeremy Thrush came out of retirement at 37 to help the Western Force beat the Melbourne Rebels 34-27.

They returned for the first time in five years to Sydney’s Allianz Stadium and felt that homecoming would not only boost crowds but lift their performance.More than 25,000 turned up — the largest crowd of the first round — and saw the Brumbies beat the Waratahs for the ninth-straight time.The turning point might have come early, in the 20th minute when Waratahs and Wallabies prop Angus Bell limped from the field with a serious foot injury. The Waratahs seemed to have an edge up front until Bell departed.Waratahs coach Darren Coleman hoped an early prognosis that Bell may have to spend a long time on the sidelines was mistaken.“We are holding out a bit of hope; he’s getting scans,” he said. “But he felt very similar to when he did it in the England test. It is horrible news.”In terms of statement performances, none was louder than the Blues 40-point victory over the Highlanders.The Blues scored eight tries and many were made possible by the strong running of Mark Telea on the left wing.The Wellington-based Hurricanes beat the Queensland Reds 47-13 in the only trans-Tasman match of the first round but it may be too early to conclude New Zealand teams will dominate Australian teams again this year.The Hurricanes led by only three points at 16-13 after a competitive first half and their second half scoring owed a lot to the Reds’ indiscipline.In other matches, the Fiji Drua scored the 11th try of a thrilling match to edge Moana Pasifika 36-24 and former All Black Jeremy Thrush came out of retirement at 37 to help the Western Force beat the Melbourne Rebels 34-27.___More AP rugby: https://apnews.com/hub/rugby and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822103,"Jazz rally late, send reeling Spurs to 16th straight loss","SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Lauri Markkanen scored 27 points and recent signee Kris Dunn added 15 as the Utah Jazz rallied from a 14-point deficit and beat the struggling San Antonio Spurs 118-102 on Saturday night.

            Markkanen sealed the game with 14 points in the fourth quarter, and Walker Kessler recorded four of his five blocks in the final minutes. 

            “We finally had our spacing right and got good looks after that,” Markkanen said. “But it was defense that was the difference maker, just getting out in transition and running to get into a good rhythm.”











            Kessler, who added 12 rebounds and nine points, was off the court when the Jazz made their first game-changing run and wanted to establish himself to help his team finish strong.

            “That’s what I do. I don’t like people scoring in my paint,” Kessler said. 

            Dunn, playing his second game on a 10-day contract with the Jazz, was signed for his defense. He ended up being a playmaker and late-game scorer when the rest of his teammates were struggling.

            “I’m an energy player. I was trying to direct the team on the offensive end and try and push the pace and get my guys easy looks,” Dunn said.

            Jeremy Sochan scored 22 points, Keldon Johnson had 18 and Zach Collins added 15 for the Spurs, who lost their 16th straight game.

            “We’re obviously not a 48-minute team,” San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. “Just not mature enough to understand you got to keep it up. It’s a game of consistency and execution, keeping your competitiveness up.”

            In 23 minutes, Dunn went 7 for 13 from the field and had game-high eight assists and seven rebounds, all along with strong defensive play.

            “The guys don’t really know me. I’ve only been here for a couple days, so playing hard and being vocal out there make it look like I know what I’m doing,” Dunn said.

            Dunn hadn’t scored 15 points since Jan. 20, 2020, against Milwaukee, when he was playing with Chicago. But, he now has 26 points in two games with the Jazz, who have won three of their last four.

            Utah is back at .500 (31-31) and among a logjam of teams in Western Conference playoff contention.

            After a hapless first half for the Jazz, the third quarter was pivotal as Utah outscored San Antonio 30-14. The 14 points was season low for the Spurs and the lowest point total allowed by the Jazz in the quarter.

            The Jazz used a 19-4 run in the third quarter to grab their first lead of the game. Jordan Clarkson made a layup with 3:30 left in the period to cap the surge and make it 78-75 in favor of Utah.

            Simone Fontecchio hit a 3-pointer just before the horn and the Jazz led 85-79 entering the final period. That was bad news for the Spurs, who are 0-42 when trailing after three quarters. 

            The Spurs led by 14 points in the first half, at 46-32, when Johnson hit a pair of acrobatic shots around the basket.

            KIND WORDS FROM THE MASTER

            Utah coach Will Hardy learned the coaching profession in the Spurs organization from 2010-2019.

            “He’s ridiculously intelligent and he’s a hard worker. He started out at the bottom in the film room and it was pretty apparent very quickly that he understood everything that we coaches wanted,” Popovich said.

            So, the mentor is not the least surprised at Hardy’s early success with the the Jazz, who were widely predicted to be one of the league’s worst teams this year. 

            TIP-INS

            Spurs: The Spurs were missing a host of injured players, including Devin Vassell (knee) and Tre Jones (foot).

            Jazz: Utah averages more than 14 3-pointers per game, but didn’t record their first 3 until Dunn made one with 4:16 left until halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822105,"Tatum's late 3 lifts Celtics past Embiid, 76ers 110-107","PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jayson Tatum buried the 3-pointer that put Boston ahead with 1.3 seconds left and casually backpedaled on defense before he turned to greet his teammates and — woosh! — a 70-foot shot sailed over his head and into the basket.

            Joel Embiid shook his head no. The 76ers' All-Star center knew his tying, desperation heave was just a tick too late.

            Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla needed a second look to know the Celtics were in the clear and he wasn't positive until “they showed it on the Jumbotron.”











            Time to celebrate.

            Tatum hit the winning 3 that capped Boston's comeback from 15 points down in the third quarter and he finished with 18 points, 13 rebounds and six assists to help the Celtics hold on for a 110-107 win against Philadelphia on Saturday night.

            “I dream about taking those shots,” Tatum said. “The worst thing that can happen is you miss.”

            He didn't miss.

            Jaylen Brown scored 26 points, Derrick White added 18 and Al Horford hit five game-changing 3s for 15 points.

            “Our guys have been there,” Mazzulla said. “They’ve been through it all.”

            Embiid finished with 41 points and 12 rebounds. He also made 17 of 18 free throws. James Harden scored 21 points and Tobias Harris had 19.

            The late-game thriller proved worthy of a showdown between two of the top teams in the East.

            Boston, though, proved it’s still the team to beat.

            The Sixers dug deep trailing by five with 3 minutes left. With booming “MVP! MVP!” chants filling the arena, Embiid hit two free throws and followed with a jumper that pulled the Sixers within one. Embiid then blocked Brown’s layup and Tyrese Maxey went the other way for a go-ahead driving layup that sent another packed house into a frenzy.

            Horford, once considered a key cog in the 76ers’ chase for a championship, instead hit the clutch 3-pointer inside Wells Fargo Center that the city craved from him in 2019-20. He put the Celtics ahead by two points and a bucket by Tatum made it 107-103.

            Harden and Embiid made four straight free throws that tied the game and put every fan — there was a smattering of green in the stands — on edge.

            Tatum, though, calmly hit a 3 to put Boston ahead. Embiid then heaved one from inside the opposing 3-point line and it fell through the basket -- just after the horn.

            “I kind of had a feeling it wasn't going to count,” Tatum said. “But it's the NBA, right? Anything can happen.”

            Just not on this night for the Sixers.

            “Unfortunately, story of my life,"" Embiid said.

            Tatum celebrated by giving his game-worn jersey to Philadelphia Eagles star wide receiver — and noted Celtics fan — DeVonta Smith.

            The 76ers had another packed house and fans were hyped from pregame warmups for a game with a definitive playoff feel. Both teams came out firing -- they each hit four 3s and shot at least 50% in the first quarter. The scoring swings were so one-sided for a stretch that the Celtics went on a 20-4 run and only led 39-32.

            The Sixers entered this one with something to prove after a miserable effort in a 106-99 loss earlier this month in Boston. The reigning Eastern Conference champion Celtics remain the class of the conference. The Sixers are still out to show under coach Doc Rivers they’re more than a 50-win, second-round exit team. They’re going to need Embiid to lead the way. After a difficult shooting night against Memphis on Thursday, Embiid had a game worthy of the “MVP! MVP!” chants that serenaded him with each trip to the free-throw line.

            He bullied his way down the lane for big buckets. Embiid’s three-point play late in the fourth stretched the lead to 11 and he had an assist on De’Anthony Melton’s 3-pointer on the next possession.

            Horford made three straight 3s to bring Boston back into the game. Horford’s fourth 3 of the quarter keyed an 18-3 run and helped the Celtics lead 80-78 through three.

            “It's not extra motivation,” Horford said of his return. “It's just fun. Those are the games you want to be a part of.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822134,'Everything Everywhere All at Once' dominates at SAG Awards,"The unlikely awards season juggernaut “Everything Everywhere All at Once” marched on at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday, and even gathered steam with wins not just for best ensemble, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan but also for Jamie Lee Curtis. 

            The SAG Awards, often an Oscar preview, threw some curve balls into the Oscars race in a ceremony streamed live on Netflix's YouTube page from Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles. 

            But the clearest result of the SAG Awards was the overwhelming success of Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's madcap multiverse tale, which has now used its hotdog fingers to snag top honors from the acting, directing and producing guilds. Only one film (""Apollo 13"") had won all three and not gone on to win best picture at the Oscars. 











            After so much of the cast of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” had already been on the stage to accept awards, the night's final moment belonged to 94-year-old James Hong, a supporting player in the film and a trailblazer for Asian American representation in Hollywood. He brought up the ignoble yellowface history of the 1937 film “The Good Earth.” 

            “The leading role was played with these guys with their eyes taped up like this and they talked like this because the producers said the Asians were not good enough and they were not box office,” said Hong. “But look at us now!” 

            Hong added that the cast of “Everything Everywhere All at Once” wasn't all Chinese, though he granted Jamie Lee Curtis had a good Chinese name. Curtis' win was one of the most surprising of the night, coming over the longtime favorite, Angela Bassett (""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever""), who had seemed to be on a clear path to becoming the first actor to win an Oscar for a performance in a Marvel movie. 

            A visibly moved Curtis said she was wearing the wedding ring her father, Tony Curtis, gave her mother, Janet Leigh. 

            “I know you look at me and think ‘Nepo baby,’” said Curtis, who won in her first SAG nomination. “But the truth of the matter is that I’m 64 years old and this is just amazing.” 

            The actors guild, though, lent some clarity to the lead categories. Though some have seen best actress as a toss up between Yeoh and BAFTA winner Cate Blanchett (""Tár""), Yeoh again took home the award for best female lead performance. 

            “This is not just for me,"" said Yeoh, the first Asian actress to win the SAG Award for female lead. ""It’s for every little girl that looks like me.”

            Quan, the former child star, also won for best supporting male actor. The “Everything Everywhere All at Once"" co-star had left acting for years after auditions dried up. He's also the first Asian to win best male supporting actor at the SAG Awards.

            “When I stepped away from acting, it was because there were so few opportunities,” said Quan. “Now, tonight we are celebrating James Hong, Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, Hong Chau, Harry Shum Jr. The landscape looks so different now.” 

            Some online commentators suggested there was irony in Mark Wahlberg, who presented best ensemble, handing out the night’s final award to a film with a predominantly Asian and Asian American cast. In 1988, a 16-year-old Wahlberg attacked two Vietnamese men while trying to steal beer near his home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Wahlberg, who said race wasn’t a factor in the assault, served 45 days of a two-year sentence. Wahlberg also announced the film “Women Talking” as “Women Are Talking.” 

            Best actor has been one of the hardest races to call. Austin Butler (“Elvis”), Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”) and Colin Farrell ( “The Banshees of Inisherin” ) have all been seen as possible winners. But it was Fraser who went home with the SAG Award for his comeback performance as an obese shut-in in “The Whale.” 

            “Believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you'll get where you need to go,"" said Fraser, who anxiously eyed the actor-shaped trophy and left the stage saying he was going to go look for some pants for him.

            The SAG Awards are considered one of the most reliable Oscar bellwethers. Actors make up the biggest percentage of the film academy, so their choices have the largest sway. Last year, “CODA” triumphed at SAG before winning best picture at the Oscar s, while Ariana DeBose, Will Smith, Jessica Chastain and Troy Kotsur all won at a SAG Award before taking home an Academy Award. 

            After the SAG Awards, presented by the film and television acting guild SAG-AFTRA, lost their broadcast home at TNT/TBS, Netflix signed on to stream Sunday's ceremony. Next year's show will be on Netflix, proper. 

            Sunday’s livestream meant a slightly scaled-down vibe. Without a broadcast time limit, winners weren’t played off. A regal and unbothered Sam Elliott, winner for male actor in a TV movie or limited series for “1883,” spoke well past his allotted time. The show sped through early winners, including awards for Jean Smart (“Hacks”), Jeremy Allen White (“The Bear”) and Jason Bateman (“Ozark”).

            Another streaming effect: No bleeping.

            Quinta Brunson and Janelle James of “Abbott Elementary” kicked off the ceremony with a few opening jokes, including one that suggested Viola Davis, a recent Grammy winner, is beyond EGOT status and has transcended into “ShEGOTallofthem.” 

            Brunson later returned to the stage with the cast of “Abbott Elementary” to accept the SAG award for best ensemble in a comedy series. Brunson, the sitcom's creator and one of its producers, said of her castmates, “These people bring me back down to Earth.""

            “The White Lotus” also took a victory lap, winning best ensemble in a drama series and another win for Jennifer Coolidge, coming off her wins at the Emmys and the Golden Globes. A teary-eyed Coolidge traced her love of acting to a first-grade trip to see a Charlie Chaplin film. She then thanked her date, a longtime friend, the actor Tim Bagley.

            “You're a wonderful date tonight,” said Coolidge. “I can't wait until we get home.”

            The ceremony's first award went to a winner from last year: Jessica Chastain. A year after winning for her lead performance in the film “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” Chastain won best female actor in a TV movie or limited series for Showtime's country music power couple series “George & Tammy.” Chastain jetted in from previews on the upcoming Broadway revival of “A Doll's House.”

            One award was announced ahead of the show from the red carpet: “Top Gun: Maverick"" won for best stunt ensemble. Though some have cheered that blockbusters like “Maverick"" and “Avatar: The Way of Water” are best picture nominees at this year's Oscars, the indie smash “Everything Everywhere All at Once” increasingly looks like the biggest blockbuster at this year's Academy Awards.

            “I got the ball with around 5 seconds to go,” Butler said. “I got to half court and I fumbled it a little bit. As soon as I looked up, there were 2 seconds left and I knew I had to let it go. I’m just happy the shot went in.""











            It appeared Micah Parrish’s 3-pointer with 23 seconds left that put San Diego State up 70-66 was going to be enough. But Jamal Mashburn Jr. was fouled on a 3-point attempt with 16.7 seconds remaining and he hit all three free throws — setting the stage for the wild closing sequence.

            “I was calm,” Butler said. “I knew Dutch (Aztecs coach Brian Dutcher) drew up the play for me, so I knew I had to make a play to win the game. So many hours I put in, I came out today and shot the shot and I’m glad it went in.”

            Dutcher said the play was actually designed for Butler to take the ball to the basket.

            “Obviously, I didn’t draw a play up for Lamont to come down and shoot a 3 with 6 seconds,” he said. “I said we have six dribbles with 6 seconds. We tried to get him up the sidelines and get him to the rim, try to win it at the rim. 

            ""But he came to the middle, I don’t know if they sent him to the middle or he came there, but he had the poise to raise up and knock down a really hard 3-point shot.”

            New Mexico coach Richard Pitino said the long shot took the Lobos by surprise.

            “We played hard. We shared the ball pretty well. They just made a big 3 at the end,” he said. “I thought they would go to Bradley with something. I thought it was kind of gutsy for them to knock down a 3.”

            Darrion Trammell scored 18 points to lead the Aztecs, while Matt Bradley added 11 as San Diego State won a sixth straight.

            Mashburn finished with 20 for New Mexico (20-9, 7-9) and House had 15.

            BIG PICTURE

            While the Aztecs' vaunted defense was absent for the first 30 minutes of the game, it clamped down by holding New Mexico without a bucket for more than four minutes late in the second half as they climbed back from a 56-47 deficit. Before forcing seven straight misses, San Diego State was allowing the Lobos to score at almost a 55% clip.

            The loss leaft the Lobos a game out of fifth place behind San Jose State in the conference with two games remaining.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822136,Timme leads No. 12 Gonzaga past No. 15 Saint Mary's 77-68,"SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — Drew Timme scored 19 points and No. 12 Gonzaga earned a share of the West Coast Conference regular-season title with a 77-68 win over No. 15 Saint Mary’s on Saturday night. 

            Anton Watson had 17 points and Malachi Smith added 13 off the bench for the Bulldogs, who have won or shared the conference title in 11 straight seasons. Gonzaga (25-5, 14-2) also reached the 25-win mark for the 16th season in a row — and avenged a loss to the Gaels earlier this month in Moraga.

            “It was the whole nation watching and we made sure that we backed our name and made everybody respect us,” Watson said. “We know what happened with LMU here at home and everybody kind of looked down on us, but we just had to keep a tight circle.”











            Logan Johnson led the Gaels (25-6, 14-2) with 27 points after a 29-point performance against Pacific in the team's last game. 

            Because the teams shared the regular-season title, the WCC will use the NCAA’s NET rankings to determine the top seed for the conference tournament. That’s expected to be determined Sunday. Entering Saturday’s matchup, Saint Mary’s was ranked No. 7 and Gonzaga No. 10 in the NET rankings.

            Should the higher seed advance in every round of the conference tourney, the Gaels will face No. 4 seed Loyola Marymount – the only team to beat both Gonzaga and Saint Mary’s this season – in the semifinal round.

            Saint Mary’s outscored Gonzaga in the second half, but couldn’t overcome a 13-point halftime deficit. A 3-pointer by Joshua Jefferson cut the lead to five with 3:03 to play, but Watson's dunk and four free throws by Gonzaga pushed the game back to double digits with 1:22 remaining.

            Two free throws from Johnson cut the lead to six with 29.8 seconds to play, but a dunk by Timme and free throws from Julian Strawther iced the game.

            Gonzaga broke an early deadlock with Saint Mary’s to take an eight-point lead after Randy Bennett turned to his bench for the first time with 11:42 remaining in the first. 

            The Gaels got within three points, but Smith scored six of his eight first-half points to help Gonzaga close the final six minutes of the half on a 15-7 run. 

            “I have a lot of confidence in Malachi. He’s never afraid. The bigger the moment, the better he is,” Gonzaga head coach Mark Few said. “It’s a nice luxury to have those guys.”

            The Zags led by as many as 19 before taking a 13-point lead to the locker room. Saint Mary’s had three separate three-minute stretches without a field goal in the first. 

            The Zags held Aidan Mahaney scoreless for the first 25 minutes, but Mahaney threatened to be the star for the second straight game. The freshman scored eight points in the second half to close the lead to six, but Gonzaga held him without a field goal the rest of the way. 

            “Through the post was working for them with Timme. We totally expected that, but didn’t do a good job there,” Saint Mary’s coach Randy Bennett said. “They always test you on your on-ball coverage. 

            ""There’s a reason they lead the country in scoring every year.”

            TIP-INS

            ESPN’s College GameDay returned to Spokane for the first time since 2009 with students camping overnight in below-freezing temperatures to be first inside when doors opened at 6 a.m. 

            “It was the best environment of the year,” show host Rece Davis said. “Really, I’d be hard pressed to think of one that was better in the last few years. ... They wanted to show off their passion for their team and their school and their city, and they did this as well as any crowd I can remember in my now 19 years on the show.”

            BIG PICTURE 

            Gonzaga: The Zags improved to 9-2 against Saint Mary’s when both teams are ranked and are 5-4 against Quad 1 opponents. With the win, the Zags won 25 games for the 16th consecutive season, breaking a tie with Kansas for the longest streak of all time.

            Saint Mary’s: The loss snapped the Gaels’ four-game winning streak and dropped them to 2-2 against Quad 1 opponents ahead of the WCC Tournament. Saint Mary’s has finished tied for second or higher in the WCC in 16 of the last 19 seasons.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822147,Stars beat Golden Knights 3-2 in SO in match of West leaders,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Jason Robertson and Roope Hintz got the Dallas Stars to extra time Saturday night.

            Then after a scoreless overtime, they both scored in the shootout to lift the Stars to a 3-2 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights in a potential Western Conference final preview.

            Wyatt Johnston and Hintz scored in regulation for Dallas, and Jamie Benn had two assists. Jake Oettinger had 41 saves for the Stars, who lead the Central Division with 74 points and ended an 0-3-2 skid. 











            “We’ve been grinding,” Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. “We needed a win. They played a great game, too. It was a real good game. Anybody that was at this game tonight got their money’s worth.”

            Michael Amadio and Jack Eichel scored for Vegas, which extended its point streak to 6-0-3 to remain atop the Pacific Division with 76 points. Laurent Brossoit also had 41 saves, including an acrobatic one 1:02 into overtime that even had the Stars raving about it.

            Vegas looked as if it was going to emerge with the victory after Eichel took a cross-ice pass from Chandler Stephenson and scored on a breakaway with 4:37 left in regulation to put the Knights ahead 2-1. It was Eichel’s third game in a row with a goal.

            The Knights nearly up went 3-1, but Dallas’ Robertson slid in front of Stephenson to prevent an empty-net goal in the final minute.

            “A big play at a big time,” Robertson said. “It was pretty lucky, but you've got to sell out in those moments. I got a lucky bounce, and it went the other way. What was more impressive was how composed we were in the final moments.""

            Robertson's stop became especially crucial when Hintz scored with 38 seconds left on a 6-on-5. The NHL office initiated a video review, but the goal was upheld, and the game was soon headed to overtime.

            Dallas missed chances early in the game to take a lead with a four-minute power play in the first period and a 5-on-3 for 59 seconds in the second.

            The Knights broke through first when Brayden McNabb's shot from the point was redirected by Amadio with 8 minutes left in the second period. That was the first goal Oettinger has given up this season to Vegas, ending a 92-minute shutout streak.

            The Stars scored 2:01 later when Johnston punched in Ty Dellandrea's pass to the left side of the net.

            Vegas had seven shots on goal in the extra period and Dallas had three, but neither team could get anything past the goalies.

            BROSSOIT'S SAVE

            Brossoit was on his back when Dallas' Tyler Sequin had what looked like the winning goal in overtime. But Brossoit rolled over and backhanded the puck away.

            “That might be the save of the year,” said DeBoer, who was the Knights' coach the previous 2 1/2 years. “I'm happy for LB. I got the opportunity to coach him, and I know the road he's had with the surgeries and the recovery, so its nice to see him back in the league at that level.”

            When asked what he was thinking when he saw Brossoit's stop, Oettinger said: “I'm sure that will be all over Instagram tonight. Just an unbelievable save.”

            Brossoit didn't want to take too much credit.

            “Some of the best saves means that you're out of position, and I was,” Brossoit said. “I threw my glove at it, and luckily he shot at the one spot that I could've gotten it.”

            NOTES

            Robertson is 5 for 6 in shootouts this season and 10 for 19 for his career. “He's like automatic,” Oettinger said. “It's scary. I hope I never have to face him in a game in a shootout. I don't even want to in practice.” ... Vegas' Shea Theodore has points in six consecutive games (two goals, seven assists). ...

            It was no different for Jimmy Carter in the early 1970s. And it took meeting several presidential candidates and then encouragement from an esteemed elder statesman before the young governor of Georgia, who had never met a president himself, saw himself as something bigger.

            He announced his White House bid on Dec. 12, 1974, amid fallout from the Vietnam War and President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Then he leveraged his unknown — and politically untainted — status to become the 39th president. That whirlwind path has been a model, explicit and otherwise, for would-be contenders ever since.











            “Jimmy Carter’s example absolutely created a 50-year window of people saying, ‘Why not me?’” said Steve Schale, who worked on President Barack Obama’s campaigns and is a longtime supporter of President Joe Biden.

            Carter’s climb is getting new attention as the 98-year-old receives end-of-life care at home in Plains, Georgia.

            David Axelrod, who helped engineer Obama’s four-year ascent from state senator to the Oval Office, said Carter’s model is about more than how his grassroots strategy turned the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary into his springboard.

            “There was a moral stain on the country, and this was a guy of deep faith,” Axelrod said. “He seemed like a fresh start, and I think he understood that he could offer something different that might be able to meet the moment.”

            Donna Brazile, who managed Democrat Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign, got her start on Carter’s two national campaigns. “In 1976, it was just Jimmy Carter’s time,” she said.

            Of course, the seeds of his presidential run sprouted even before Nixon won a second term and certainly before his resignation in August 1974.

            In Carter’s telling, he did not run for governor in 1966 — he lost — or in 1970 thinking about Washington. Even when announced his presidential bid, neither he nor those closest to him were completely confident.

            “President of what?” his mother, Lillian, replied when he told her his plans.

            But soon after he became governor in 1971, Carter’s team envisioned him as a national player. They were encouraged in part by the May 31 Time magazine cover depicting Carter alongside the headline “Dixie Whistles a Different Tune.” Inside, a flattering profile framed Carter as a model “New South” governor.

            In October 1971, Carter ally Dr. Peter Bourne, an Atlanta physician who would become U.S. drug czar, sent his politician friend an unsolicited memo outlining how he could be elected president. On Oct. 17, a wider circle of advisers sat with Carter at the Governor’s Mansion to discuss it. Carter, then 47, wore blue jeans and a T-shirt, according to biographer Jonathan Alter.

            The team, including Carter’s wife Rosalynn, now 95, began considering the idea seriously.

            “We never used the word ‘president,’” Carter recalled upon his 90th birthday, “but just referred to ‘national office.’”

            Carter invited high-profile Democrats — Washington players who were running or considering running in 1972 — to one-on-one meetings at the mansion. He would later jump at the chance to lead the Democratic National Committee’s national campaign. The position allowed him to travel the country helping candidates up and down the ballot.

            He was among the Southern governors who angled to be McGovern’s running mate in 1972. Alter said Carter was never seriously considered.

            Still, Carter got to know, among others, former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Sens. Henry Jackson of Washington, Eugene McCarthy of Maine and George McGovern of South Dakota, the eventual nominee who lost a landslide to Nixon.

            Carter later explained that he had previously defined the nation’s highest office by its occupants immortalized with monuments.

            “For the first time,” Carter told The New York Times, “I started comparing my own experiences and knowledge of government with the candidates, not against ‘the presidency’ and not against Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. It made it a whole lot easier.”

            Adviser Hamilton Jordan crafted a detailed campaign plan calling for matching Carter’s outsider, good-government credentials to voters’ general disillusionment, even before Watergate. But the team still spoke and wrote in code, as if the “higher office” weren’t obvious.

            It was reported during his campaign that Carter told family members around Christmas 1972 that he would run in 1976. Carter later wrote in a memoir that a visit from former Secretary of State Dean Rusk in early 1973 affirmed his leanings.

            Carter described Rusk in adoring terms. “Our most distinguished Georgian,” Carter called the man who led the State Department during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.

            During another private confab in Atlanta, Rusk told Carter plainly: “Governor, I think you should run for president in 1976.” That, Carter wrote, “removed our remaining doubts.”

            Schale said the process is not always so involved.

            “These are intensely competitive people already,” he said of governors, senators and others in high office. “If you’re wired in that capacity, it’s hard to step away from it.”

            But Schale and Axelrod emphasized that circumstances matter.

            “We judged what people felt was missing in our politics,” Axelrod said of Obama and his “Hope and Change” theme. 

            “He seemed uniquely positioned to answer that call ... where others were not,” Axelrod explained, alluding to Hillary Clinton’s long resume as a liability given voters' anger over the Iraq war and other matters by the end of George W. Bush’s presidency.

            Republican Donald Trump countered in 2016, riding a populist wave of discontent after two Obama terms. Schale noted that Biden, then vice president, passed on 2016 in part because Obama privately backed Clinton's reprisal bid. 

            In 2020, though, a 77-year-old Biden came out of retirement specifically to hammer Trump as a threat to the “soul of the nation.” Biden won. 

            “Does he even run if it’s anybody but Trump in office? No way,” Schale said. 

            Now 80, the president appears to be running again. So is 76-year-old Trump. That’s drawn new messengers to the stage with what they hope is the right message.

            “We’re ready — ready to move past the stale ideas and faded names of the past,” said Nikki Haley, the 51-year-old former U.N. ambassador, as she declared her underdog candidacy on Feb. 15. 

            The South Carolina Republican's call for “a new generation to lead us” echoed as a potential 2024 equivalent of the Georgia Democrat who told voters in his 1976 opening argument that “our trust has been betrayed.”

            “Jimmy Carter showed us that you can go from a no-name to president in the span of 18 or 24 months,” said Jared Leopold, a top aide in Washington Gov. Jay Inslee's unsuccessful bid for Democrats' 2020 nomination. 

            “For people deciding whether to get in, it's a real inspiration,” Leopold continued, ""and that's a real success of American democracy.”ATLANTA (AP) — As the 2024 campaign season begins, political players are looking in the mirror and deciding whether they see an American president staring back.It was no different for Jimmy Carter in the early 1970s.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822151,"MacKinnon, Georgiev help Avalanche beat Flames, 4-1","DENVER (AP) — Nathan MacKinnon had a goal to extend his points streak to seven games, Alexandar Georgiev stopped 28 shots and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Calgary Flames 4-1 on Saturday night for their fifth straight victory.

            Mikko Rantanen, Alex Newhook and Denis Malgin also scored for Colorado. The defending champion Avalanche moved into a tie for second place with Winnipeg in the Central Division.

            Colorado wrapped up a stretch of three back-to-back games over 11 days.











            “Every team we’ve played we’re kind of in the battle with for a playoff spot. Just crazy,” MacKinnon said. “They’re all waiting for us each time, too, so it wasn’t like they were on a back-to-back as well. It’s been a weird schedule.”

            Defenseman Cale Makar remained in the concussion protocol for the second game in a row. He has missed five of the last seven games due to two concussions.

            Nazem Kadri assisted on Tyler Toffoli’s goal for Calgary in his first game in Denver since helping Colorado win the Stanley Cup. Jacob Markstrom made 18 saves for the Flames.

            “Our defense got beat one-on-one a lot,” Flames coach Darryl Sutter said. “You play the Stanley Cup champions you can’t have one or two guys off.”

            MacKinnon scored on Colorado’s first shot of the game for the second straight night, his 21st at 3:05 of the first period. Newhook made it 2-0 with his 13th at 8:22 and Rantanen’s 38th of the season at 2:42 of the second gave the Avalanche a 3-0 lead.

            “The loss is on me. I was on the ice for three goals against. Unacceptable,” Calgary defenseman Nikita Zadorov said. “First goal, bad positioning. Second goal, I should have blocked it. And third goal, I got worked. Worst timing to have the worst game of your career.”

            Toffoli’s goal, his 25th, at 17:20 of the second made it 3-1 but Malgin’s fifth goal of the season early in the third gave Colorado a cushion.

            “He’s so talented,” MacKinnon said of Malgin. “We knew when we were getting him we were going to get a strong, sturdy little stocky guy. Good wheels, good skill and what a goal.”

            BIG WELCOME

            The Avalanche paid tribute to Kadri with a highlight video on the scoreboard at the first media timeout. Kadri played three seasons with Colorado, capped by winning the title in June. He had a hat trick in Game 4 of the second round against St. Louis and scored the overtime goal in Game 4 of the finals against Tampa Bay that gave the Avalanche a 3-1 series lead. They won the series in six games.

            The capacity crowd gave Kadri a standing ovation during the tribute and he banged his stick on the ice and tapped his heart in appreciation.

            “Very classy. It was hard not to get emotional,” Kadri said. “Obviously had some great years here and the city and the fans just continue to support me. It meant a lot to me.”

            MINOR MOVES

            Colorado beefed up its depth in the minor league with a couple of transactions Saturday. The Avalanche acquired goaltender Keith Kincaid from Boston for winger Shane Bowers in a swap of AHL players, and they re-signed defenseman Keaton Middleton to a two-year deal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822152,Bad news for Verstappen's F1 rivals as Red Bull looks better,"The bad news for Max Verstappen's rivals heading into the Formula One season is that Red Bull's car could even be better.

            That's saying something considering Verstappen won a record 15 races last year on his way to a second straight world title. 

            But Verstappen topped the first day of F1 testing at the Sakhir circuit in Bahrain and teammate Sergio Perez led the last on Saturday.











            It's scary to think that Red Bull could head into next weekend's season-opening race, held on the same circuit, with none of the reliability woes that saw Verstappen fail to finish two of the first three races in 2022. Even despite that setback, he crushed everyone.

            “The car is working really well, just going through a lot of things we wanted to try. It's very interesting what we've been trying, so very positive days for me,” Verstappen said. “Overall I think it’s definitely an improvement to last year.""

            Perez echoed that, saying Red Bull will start ""much stronger than we did last year.”

            Charles Leclerc won two of the first three races last season before Ferrari faded badly. He says the car feels good yet modifications are still needed.

            “I expect us to be a bit quicker on the straights, maybe struggling a bit more in the corners,” the 25-year-old from Monaco said. “I can say we are still working quite a bit on finding the sweet spot in terms of set up.”

            Ferrari was third and fourth in the first test; sixth-best in the second, and then fourth and fifth on Saturday.

            “We’ve had a very intense three days of testing,"" Leclerc said. ""We still have some work to do. Red Bull seems to be very strong.”

            Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton finished second Saturday, but there's room to improve. 

            At least the ground effect — known as porpoising — which hindered the team so much in 2022 seems to have been eradicated.

            “It's nice to drive without the bouncing for once,"" Hamilton said. ""But there are still some underlying things we're working through.”

            F1 race director Niels Wittich is confident bouncing has been fully resolved.

            “I think porpoising is not a topic anymore,” he said. “I think we and the teams sorted it quite well last year.”

            Hamilton is F1′s record holder with 103 wins but did not win a race last year, and the 38-year-old British driver feels the W14 car has some limitations.

            Teammate George Russell broke down with a hydraulics issue on Friday, leaving trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin confused. 

            “Stopping on track with a reliability issue wasn’t great and we have struggled to get the car balanced well across the changing conditions,"" Shovlin said.

            Russell, who won one race last year, placed only eighth in Saturday's last test day and said challenging for victory in Bahrain “may be a bit of a stretch.”

            Among the surprises in testing: Alfa Romeo topped Day 2 through Zhou Guanyu and was third Saturday with Valtteri Bottas behind the wheel. 

            Alex Albon churned out 136 laps for Williams on Day 3 and his new American teammate Logan Sargeant looked at ease during testing. But it was hard to tell if Williams was just reliable, or threatens to be quick.

            McLaren is behind the eight ball.

            Although Lando Norris was fifth on Thursday it went downhill from there; with Oscar Piastri ninth on Friday and Norris 11th on Saturday.

            CEO Zak Brown said the team was behind its projected development targets, and Norris conceded McLaren is playing catch up.

            AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsThe bad news for Max Verstappen's rivals heading into the Formula One season is that Red Bull's car could even be better.That's saying something considering Verstappen won a record 15 races last year on his way to a second straight world title.But Verstappen topped the first day of F1 testing at the Sakhir circuit in Bahrain and teammate Sergio Perez led the last on Saturday.It's scary to think that Red Bull could head into next weekend's season-opening race, held on the same circuit, with none of the reliability woes that saw Verstappen fail to finish two of the first three races in 2022. Even despite that setback, he crushed everyone.“The car is working really well, just going through a lot of things we wanted to try. It's very interesting what we've been trying, so very positive days for me,” Verstappen said. “Overall I think it’s definitely an improvement to last year.""Perez echoed that, saying Red Bull will start ""much stronger than we did last year.”Charles Leclerc won two of the first three races last season before Ferrari faded badly. He says the car feels good yet modifications are still needed.“I expect us to be a bit quicker on the straights, maybe struggling a bit more in the corners,” the 25-year-old from Monaco said. “I can say we are still working quite a bit on finding the sweet spot in terms of set up.”Ferrari was third and fourth in the first test; sixth-best in the second, and then fourth and fifth on Saturday.“We’ve had a very intense three days of testing,"" Leclerc said. ""We still have some work to do. Red Bull seems to be very strong.”Seven-time F1 champion Lewis Hamilton finished second Saturday, but there's room to improve.At least the ground effect — known as porpoising — which hindered the team so much in 2022 seems to have been eradicated.“It's nice to drive without the bouncing for once,"" Hamilton said. ""But there are still some underlying things we're working through.”F1 race director Niels Wittich is confident bouncing has been fully resolved.“I think porpoising is not a topic anymore,” he said. “I think we and the teams sorted it quite well last year.”Hamilton is F1′s record holder with 103 wins but did not win a race last year, and the 38-year-old British driver feels the W14 car has some limitations.Teammate George Russell broke down with a hydraulics issue on Friday, leaving trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin confused.“Stopping on track with a reliability issue wasn’t great and we have struggled to get the car balanced well across the changing conditions,"" Shovlin said.Russell, who won one race last year, placed only eighth in Saturday's last test day and said challenging for victory in Bahrain “may be a bit of a stretch.”Among the surprises in testing: Alfa Romeo topped Day 2 through Zhou Guanyu and was third Saturday with Valtteri Bottas behind the wheel.Alex Albon churned out 136 laps for Williams on Day 3 and his new American teammate Logan Sargeant looked at ease during testing. But it was hard to tell if Williams was just reliable, or threatens to be quick.McLaren is behind the eight ball.Although Lando Norris was fifth on Thursday it went downhill from there; with Oscar Piastri ninth on Friday and Norris 11th on Saturday.CEO Zak Brown said the team was behind its projected development targets, and Norris conceded McLaren is playing catch up.“There's still many things we've been struggling with. I guess we've been exploring,"" Norris said. “We know where we stand, and I think our plan is more what we can achieve during this year rather than the car we start the year with.”___AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822154,'Powder keg' for 9/11: 1993 trade center bombing remembered,"NEW YORK (AP) — Lolita Jackson was at her 72nd-floor desk in the World Trade Center, feeling like she worked at the top of the world. Then came the boom, and smoke started curling in from an elevator shaft. 

            Unsure what was happening, she joined thousands of other office workers on a harrowing trek down dark, smoky stairs, emerging onto the scene of a terror attack. 

            It wasn't Sept. 11, 2001. This was Feb. 26, 1993, when a deadly bombing killed six people, one of them pregnant, and injured more than 1,000 — becoming a harbinger of terror at the twin towers.











            Jackson hopes that Sunday's 30th anniversary serves as a reminder that even though decades have passed since the seismic acts of terrorism in the United States' most populous city, no one, anywhere, can say the threat of mass violence is over. 

            She knows that more personally than most: On 9/11, she had to flee the trade center’s south tower again.

            “I’m a living testament that it can happen to you, and it can happen to you twice,” Jackson said.

            Victims' relatives, survivors, dignitaries and others gathered at the trade center Sunday for a ceremony that included the reading of the names of the six people killed. The anniversary was also being marked at a Mass Sunday at a nearby church and a panel discussion Monday at the 9/11 Memorial Museum.

            A bell was tolled and a moment of silence held to mark the time of the attack, 12:18 p.m., and victims’ relatives and others laid roses next to their names, which are inscribed on one of the Sept. 11 memorial pools.

            Gov. Kathy Hochul, Mayor Eric Adams and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer were among speakers honoring the lives lost and mourning the loss of innocence in the attack's wake.

            “Today, 30 years later, we still feel the impact of that event,"" said Stanley Brezenoff, who survived the bombing as then-head of the government agency that owns the World Trade Center. ""The grief we hold for the ones we lost — we feel and share the hurt that the families have felt these many years. That will not change, even years into the future.”

            Charlie Maikish, the executive in charge of the World Trade Center at the time, said the bombing was a “wake up call” and that safety protocols enacted in the aftermath — including evacuation drills, emergency lighting in stairwells and new fire command stations — likely saved thousands of lives on 9/11. 

            The noontime explosion, set off in a rented van parked in an underground garage, served notice that Islamic extremists yearned to destroy the trade center's twin towers. But the public memory of the attack was largely subsumed after 9/11. Even the fountain that memorialized the bombing was crushed in the later attack. 

            But for some survivors and victims' relatives, the 1993 attack still echoes as a warning that was unheeded, a loss that feels overlooked and a lesson that still needs learning. 

            “The '93 World Trade Center bombing was the powder keg for the 9/11 attacks,” said Andrew Colabella, a cousin of bombing victim John DiGiovanni. Colabella said he feels the earlier attack is largely remembered as “a blip,” rather than a siren, in the history of international terror. 

            “These two historical events that have taken place should be instilled in our hearts and minds, to think united and to be united,” Colabella said. Now a town council member in Westport, Connecticut, he regularly attends ground zero anniversary ceremonies for both the bombing and 9/11, to honor the cousin he lost as a small child but can still picture.

            DiGiovanni was at the trade center as a visiting salesperson. Other victims all worked in the complex. They were Robert Kirkpatrick, Stephen A. Knapp, William Macko, Wilfredo Mercado and Monica Rodriguez Smith, who was due to start maternity leave the next day. 

            “Every part of our effort has considered the '93 bombing as a part of the story that we are telling,” museum Director Clifford Chanin said.

            The explosive was planted by Muslim extremists who sought to punish the U.S. for its Middle East policies, particularly Washington's support for Israel, according to federal prosecutors. 

            Six people were convicted and imprisoned, including accused ringleader Ramzi Yousef. A seventh suspect in the bombing remains on the FBI’s most wanted list.

            Yousef hoped the bomb would fell the twin towers by making one collapse into the other, according to the FBI. 

            The idea of razing the skyscrapers endured. A message found on another convicted conspirator’s laptop warned that “next time it will be very precise, and the World Trade Center will continue to be one of our targets.” 

            Yousef's uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, would later become the self-proclaimed mastermind of 9/11, when hijacked planes were used as missiles to strike the buildings.

            Although the towers endured the '93 bombing, it knocked out power, backup generators and the public address system. Tens of thousands of people picked their way down the stairs; others were rescued from stalled elevators and the wrecked garage. Some workers kicked out windows for air, a group of 120 kindergarteners were stranded for a time on an observation deck and police helicopters flew to rooftops to pick up two dozen people.

            The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the trade center, apologized to the victims’ relatives on the 25th anniversary, saying the complex and the country weren’t prepared for the attack. 

            After the bombing, the trade center forbade underground parking and installed security cameras and vehicle barriers, and the complex issued worker ID cards for entry.

            On Sept. 11, 2001, Jackson was again in her office, by then on the 70th floor. When flames started shooting out of the tower next door, her company ordered an immediate evacuation.

            Now she wonders whether what she experienced — twice — seems “like folklore” to people born after both attacks. She warns against complacency.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822159,Taiwan grants relief in vaccine injury case involving death of child,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The board overseeing the Ministry of Health and Welfare’s (MOHW) Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) made public the rulings on nine cases involving COVID-19 jabs on Sunday (Feb. 26).Among the rulings, NT$3.5 million (US$114,000) along with an additional NT$300,000 (US$9,800) funeral subsidy was awarded to a family in Taoyuan. The case involved a girl between the age of five and 11, who died of sudden myocarditis three days after taking her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, reported UDN.In the MOHW announcement of the rulings, which were made on Feb. 9, the director of VICP, Lo Yi-chun (羅一鈞), said that the BNT vaccine cannot be conclusively determined as the primary reason for the girl’s death. However, relief was granted based on the timeline of events, and in consideration of the fact that the BNT vaccine could not be ruled out as a contributing factor.Lo said that based on international data, the likelihood of children aged five to 11 suffering sudden myocarditis after taking a second shot of an mRNA vaccine is approximately 4.5 to 4.8 cases out of every one million. Local data from Taiwan reflects similar statistics, according to the MOHW.As of Feb. 15, Taiwan has reported 22 cases of myocarditis in children aged five to 11 who have taken COVID-19 vaccines. There have been 165 total cases reported in adolescents aged 12 to 17 who have taken vaccines. In 90% of cases, hospitalized patients were discharged within a week of being admitted.In addition to the Taoyuan case involving BNT, the VICP also announced additional rulings of relief granted in five cases involving the AstraZeneca vaccine and three cases involving the Moderna vaccine.Relief granted in cases involving the AZ vaccine was reported as NT$250,000 (US$9107), NT$100,000 (US$3,250), NT$75,000 (US$2,440), NT$30,000 (US$980), and NT$20,000 (US$650). In three of the cases involving AZ vaccines, patients were diagnosed with Gillian-Barre syndrome.In all five cases, the VICP said the damages suffered by patients could not be conclusively attributed to the vaccine, but that relief was granted based on measures outlined in Article 18 of the Regulations Governing Collection and Review of Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund.Relief granted in cases involving the Moderna vaccine was reported as NT$500,000 (US$16,300), NT$20,000 (US$650), and NT$5,000 (US$160). In the only other case involving the death of a patient, NT$500,000 was granted to the family of an elderly Taipei resident who died 10 days after taking the mRNA vaccine. The victim reportedly suffered from heart conditions prior to taking the vaccine.",2023/02/26,2391,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822175,Borsch without a 't': Kyiv chef uses food to reclaim culture,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Don’t tell Ievgen Klopotenko that borsch is just food. For him, that bowl of beet-and-meat soup is the embodiment of everything Ukraine is fighting for.

            “Food is a powerful social instrument by which you can unite or divide a nation,” said Klopotenko, Ukraine’s most recognizable celebrity chef and the man who in the midst of a bloody war spearheaded what would become an unlikely cultural victory over Russia. 

            “It’s our symbol,” Klopotenko said. “Borsch is our leader.”











            If that seems hyperbolic, you underestimate how intrinsic borsch (the preferred Ukrainian spelling) is to this country’s soul. More than a meal, it represents history, family and centuries of tradition. It is eaten always and everywhere, and its preparation is described almost reverentially. 

            And now, at the one-year mark of the war with Russia, Klopotenko uses the dish as a rallying call for preserving Ukrainian identity. It’s an act of culinary defiance against one of Moscow’s widely discredited justifications of the war — that Ukraine is culturally indistinct from Russia.

            Thanks to a lobbying effort that Klopotenko helped lead, UNESCO issued a fast-track decision last July declaring Ukrainian borsch an asset of “intangible cultural heritage” in need of preservation. Although the declaration noted borsch is consumed elsewhere in the region, and that no exclusivity was implied, the move infuriated Russia.

            A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson accused Ukraine of appropriating the dish and called the move an act of xenophobia and Nazism.

            But in Ukraine, where until a year ago Russian was as widely spoken as Ukrainian, the declaration legitimized a notion that many had struggled to express.

            “People started to understand that they are Ukrainians,” Klopotenko said recently while preparing borsch at his Kyiv apartment. From his living room window, the husk of a high-rise gutted by Russian missiles dominated the view. 

            “A lot of people started to eat Ukrainian food. A lot of people began to discover Ukrainian traditions,” he said.

            Klopotenko, 36, is an unlikely figure to grab headlines during a war that has left hundreds of thousands from all sides dead or wounded. But the television chef and restaurateur — recognizable by an unruly head of curls, rapid-fire dialogue and lively fashion sense — began his mission to elevate Ukrainian food years before Russia’s invasion in February 2022.

            Though born in Kyiv, Klopotenko had by age 5 spent months at a time living with his grandmother, who had moved just outside Manchester, England. He'd been raised on bland Soviet-era cuisine, and this was a culinary awakening. He encountered waves of new flavors and ingredients, experiences that set him on a path to restaurant work.

            His break came in 2015 when he won the television competition “MasterChef Ukraine.” He parlayed that into study at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris and later a successful campaign to overhaul the Soviet-influenced cafeteria menus in Ukrainian schools.

            Always in the background was his sense that Ukrainian food — ditto the country’s culture writ large — wasn’t being true to itself. Much of Ukraine's identity, he felt, from language and food to fashion and architecture, had been subjugated to Russian influences. Before the start of Soviet rule in 1917, Ukrainian cuisine was more diverse and robustly seasoned. That was quashed in favor of a more uniform palate with socialist sensibilities.

            Even after the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, Ukraine’s cuisine didn’t quite bounce back. But Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 was a trigger. Trying to identify and hold onto Ukrainian heritage, Klopotenko and others began researching pre-Soviet Ukrainian cooking, hoping to return it to the mainstream and give people another toehold for reclaiming their culture.

            In 2019, he opened his Kyiv restaurant, 100 Rokiv Tomu Vpered (100 Years Ago Ahead), a reference to what Ukrainian cuisine was before Soviet rule, and what it could be again. The menu draws heavily on flavors and ingredients many have forgotten. 

            Roasted parsnips with smoked sour cream. Buckwheat bread flavored with chamomile. Banosh, a sort of corn porridge topped with cottage cheese, mushrooms and apples.

            And, of course, borsch seasoned with the traditional smoked pears. Written records tie the recipe to Ukraine over many centuries. The effort to have it declared a cultural asset began in 2018, when Klopotenko enlisted the help of Maryna Sobotiuk, an adviser to the Ukrainian Ministry of Information Policy and co-founder of the Institute of Culture of Ukraine.

            They assembled a dossier that would become the country’s application to UNESCO. Their work took on greater urgency after Russia’s invasion a year ago and received the blessing of Ukraine’s government.

            Like Klopotenko, Sobotiuk said it’s a cause much deeper than dinner.

            “Our neighbors want to not just take our territory, but also our culture and our history,” she said, calling culinary heritage a soft power with tremendous potential to motivate and inspire. “It is important to give people something they can align with Ukraine except war.”

            Darra Goldstein, a food historian and expert in Eastern European cuisines, agreed, noting that the difficulty of delineating culinary boundaries doesn't diminish the cultural import of the dishes. 

            “It’s not simply a matter of claiming ownership of a dish, since the precise origins of any given dish are often difficult to trace. Instead, food goes to the heart of national belonging, how people define who they are,” she said.

            Borsch, of course, was just the start for Klopotenko. As more Ukrainians have rejected Russian culture since the war began, and consumption of traditional Ukrainian foods has spiked, he and others see an opening for codifying and celebrating more of their own.

            Though UNESCO is unlikely to grant similar status to other Ukrainian dishes — chicken Kyiv, garlicky pampushky bread and latke-like deruny enjoy similar popularity — Klopotenko said the next step is to raise the profile of the country’s cuisine as a whole, at home and abroad. 

            To that end, his cookbook, “The Authentic Ukrainian Kitchen,” which offers modern takes on traditional Ukrainian cooking, will be released this fall in the U.S.

            “The war accelerated the growth of Ukrainian culture,” he said. “Russia wanted to kill the culture with the huge invasion, but it’s worked the other way.""

            It’s a sentiment shared widely on the streets of the nation’s capital, where restaurants have revamped menus to replace Russian dishes with Ukrainian ones. They’ve been rewarded with packed dining rooms despite rolling blackouts and frequent air-raid warnings.

            At Kyiv’s bustling Volodymirsky market — a warren of stalls offering beets, smoked seafood, caviar and mounds of the local, crumbly cottage cheese — Tetyana Motorna has sold pickled fruit and vegetables for decades. She held back tears as she discussed the war and why Klopotenko’s work to secure borsch as a national treasure for her country matters.

            “Borsch is everything for Ukrainians,” she said. “The war has made borsch even more important. … With borsch, we prove that we are a separate nation. It confirms us as a nation.”

On Sept. 7, artifacts believed to be from the Wangliao Archaeological Site, which is located within the park, were discovered.The site, with an area of around 3,000 square meters, has artifacts that date back 3,000-4,500 years. It is categorized as part of the neolithic Niuchouzi Culture, and artifacts found include orange-colored pottery made of fine sand-bearing rope patterns, polished hoe-axes, polished adze-chisels, and shell mounds.Despite only completing 60% of the construction, the renovation project was halted according to the Cultural Heritage Preservation Act. After consulting with experts, the project’s designs were adjusted while an additional budget was allocated for archaeological excavation.Currently, the excavation and construction supervision plans are being reviewed by the Tainan Municipal Administration of Cultural Heritage. Once approved, an archaeological team will immediately begin excavation while construction will resume on the park.As the artifacts were discovered on a field and away from the playground of the park, the excavation and construction can be conducted simultaneously.(Tainan City Government Public Works Bureau photo)",2023/02/26,2232,Culture
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822182,Mrazek leads Blackhawks to 4-3 shootout win over Sharks,"SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Petr Mrazek had 45 saves and stopped all three shootout attempts to lead the Chicago Blackhawks to their fifth straight victory, 4-3 over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday night.

            Philipp Kurashev scored in the first round of the shootout for the only goal, giving the undermanned Blackhawks their longest winning streak since also winning five straight in January 2020. 

            “We got it done somehow,” coach Luke Richardson said. “Sometimes it’s just not conventional, not necessarily ugly, but it was a little bit sloppy at some times. But it’s a road game. Guys scraped it out. Guys were banged up and we got the win.”











            David Gust scored his first career goal, Brett Seney added his first goal in more than four years, and Max Domi also scored for Chicago. 

            Nick Bonino, Evgeny Svechnikov and Erik Karlsson scored for the Sharks, who have lost five of six games. Kaapo Kahkonen made 32 saves.

            The teams traded goals in the third, with Domi scoring on the opening shift of the period for Chicago and Karlsson answering with 2:11 to play after San Jose pulled Kahkonen. 

            But Chicago pulled it out in the shootout.

            “Good to fight back at the end and get a goal late. But when you don’t win it sucks,” Sharks captain Logan Couture said. “We would have liked to get that win.”

            The Blackhawks got goals from unlikely sources in the first period. 

            The 29-year-old Gust, who grew up in the Chicago area, was called up to the NHL earlier this week and got into the lineup for the first time against the Sharks. 

            He didn't take long to make an impact, scoring on his first career shift when he got in front of the net to deflect a pass from Colin Blackwell past Kahkonen. Gust joined Eddie Olczyk as the only Illinois natives to score in their NHL debuts with the Blackhawks.

            “First shift. Can’t write it up any better,” Gust said. “Good first game. It’s good to get that out of the way.” 

            After Bonino tied it for San Jose, Seney scored on the rush for his first goal since Feb. 9, 2019, when he played for New Jersey. Seney was called up from the minors last week.

            Svechnikov answered for San Jose.

            MARLEAU NIGHT

            The Sharks held a pregame ceremony to retire the No. 12 jersey for Patrick Marleau.

            San Jose's first homegrown star broke Gordie Howe's record for games played with 1,779 in his career. He holds the Sharks records for games played (1,607), goals (522) and points (1,111).

            Marleau played 21 of his 23 seasons in the NHL for San Jose after being drafted second overall in 1997. He finished his career in 2021. 

            “It was surreal,” Marleau said after the ceremony. “It just flashes before your eyes that everything I did led up to that moment.

            TRADE TALK

            Kane flew back to Chicago before the game as talks heat up about a possible trade to the New York Rangers. Kane has a no-movement clause and must approve any deal.

            Chicago also held Lafferty out of the lineup for “roster management” reasons in advance of Friday's trade deadline.

            Sharks forward Timo Meier, also the subject of trade talks, missed his third consecutive game with an upper-body injury that is not considered serious.

            Chicago placed forward Reese Johnson (concussion protocol) on injured reserve retroactive to Feb. 20.

But when you don’t win it sucks,” Sharks captain Logan Couture said. “We would have liked to get that win.”The Blackhawks got goals from unlikely sources in the first period.The 29-year-old Gust, who grew up in the Chicago area, was called up to the NHL earlier this week and got into the lineup for the first time against the Sharks.He didn't take long to make an impact, scoring on his first career shift when he got in front of the net to deflect a pass from Colin Blackwell past Kahkonen. Gust joined Eddie Olczyk as the only Illinois natives to score in their NHL debuts with the Blackhawks.“First shift. Can’t write it up any better,” Gust said. “Good first game. It’s good to get that out of the way.”After Bonino tied it for San Jose, Seney scored on the rush for his first goal since Feb. 9, 2019, when he played for New Jersey. Seney was called up from the minors last week.Svechnikov answered for San Jose.MARLEAU NIGHTThe Sharks held a pregame ceremony to retire the No. 12 jersey for Patrick Marleau.San Jose's first homegrown star broke Gordie Howe's record for games played with 1,779 in his career. He holds the Sharks records for games played (1,607), goals (522) and points (1,111).Marleau played 21 of his 23 seasons in the NHL for San Jose after being drafted second overall in 1997. He finished his career in 2021.“It was surreal,” Marleau said after the ceremony. “It just flashes before your eyes that everything I did led up to that moment.TRADE TALKKane flew back to Chicago before the game as talks heat up about a possible trade to the New York Rangers. Kane has a no-movement clause and must approve any deal.Chicago also held Lafferty out of the lineup for “roster management” reasons in advance of Friday's trade deadline.Sharks forward Timo Meier, also the subject of trade talks, missed his third consecutive game with an upper-body injury that is not considered serious.Chicago placed forward Reese Johnson (concussion protocol) on injured reserve retroactive to Feb. 20.UP NEXTBlackhawks: Visit Anaheim on Monday night.Sharks: Host Montreal on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/26,,World

            Going into the final round of playoff matches, Iran and Kazakhstan were the last teams left with hopes of qualifying for the World Cup from Group F, which contained already-qualified Australia, China and Japan. 

            To clinch the fourth and final qualifying spot, Iran only needed to match Kazakhstan's result in its final game against Australia. Kazakhstan lost 98-53 at Melbourne also Sunday, meaning Iran's fourth-quarter fade-out against China in Hong Kong didn't end its World Cup campaign. 











            Despite one round of qualifying matches remaining in Asia's other playoff group to be played on Monday — New Zealand, Lebanon, Jordan and Philippines had already secured the top four qualifying places in the six-team Group E.

            Final playoff matches in Africa, Europe and the Americas are also being played on Sunday and Monday to complete the 32-team lineup for the World Cup to be jointly hosted by Japan, Philippines and Indonesia from Aug. 25.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822219,"Migrant boat breaks up off Italian coast, killing nearly 60","ROME (AP) — A wooden boat crowded with migrants smashed into rocky reefs and broke apart before dawn Sunday off the Italian coast, authorities said. Rescuers recovered nearly 60 bodies, and dozens more people were missing in the rough waters.

            Officials feared the death toll could top 100 since some survivors indicated the boat had as many as 200 passengers when it set out from Turkey, United Nations refugee and migration agencies said.

            At least 80 people were found alive, including some who reached the shore after the shipwreck just off Calabria's coastline along the Ionian Sea, the Italian Coast Guard said. One of the agency's motorboats rescued two men suffering from hypothermia and recovered the body of a boy.











            As sundown approached, firefighters said 59 bodies had been found. 

            One man was taken into custody for questioning after fellow survivors indicated he was a trafficker, state TV said.

            The boat collided with the reefs in wind-whipped seas. Three big chunks of the vessel ended up on the beach near the town of Steccato di Cutro, where splintered pieces of bright blue wood littered the sand like matchsticks.

            “All of the survivors are adults,″ Red Cross volunteer Ignazio Mangione said. ”Unfortunately, all the children are among the missing or were found dead on the beach.” A baby and young twins were reported among the dead.

            Rescuers said two men who survived were spotted trying to save children by holding them over their heads as waves buffeted them. But the children died, state TV said.

            The humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said it was offering psychological assistance to survivors, who included a 16-year-old boy from Afghanistan whose sister, 28, made it to the beach but then died. The group said the teen “hasn't found the courage to tell his parents.”

            Another survivor was a 12-year-old boy from Afghanistan who lost his entire family, including four siblings.

            Italian state TV quoted survivors as saying the boat set out five days ago from Turkey.

            Standing next to the wreckage on the beach, a reporter for Italian RAI state TV noted a life preserver bearing the word “Smyrna,” a Turkish port also known as Izmir.

            More than 170 migrants were estimated to have been aboard the ship, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration said in a joint statement.

            Among them were ""children and entire families,'' according to the U.N. statement, with most of the passengers from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia.

            Earlier, in an indication of the difficulty in establishing how many passengers had set out on the voyage, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said some 200 people had been crowded into a 20-meter (66-foot) boat.

            The rescue operation involved a helicopter and police aircraft, as well as vessels from state firefighter squads, the Coast Guard and border police. Local fishermen also joined in the search.

            The bodies were brought to the sports stadium in the nearest city, Crotone. 

            A priest said a few of the bodies washed up on a stretch of beach near his town. “While I blessed them, I was asking myself why do we arrive after the deaths,'' the Rev. Rosario Morrone told state TV. “We need to get there before.”

            State TV said 22 survivors were taken to a hospital.

            Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square that he was praying for the dead, the missing and the survivors, as well as for rescuers ""and for those who give welcome” to the migrants.

            “It's an enormous tragedy,” Crotone Mayor Vincenzo Voce told RAI. “In solidarity, the city will find places in the cemetery” for the dead.

            In 2022, some 105,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores, some 38,000 more than in 2021, according to Interior Ministry figures.

            According to U.N. figures, arrivals from the Turkish route accounted for 15% of the total number, with nearly half of those fleeing from Afghanistan.

            Meloni expressed “her deep sorrow for the many human lives torn away by human traffickers.”

            “It’s inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the ‘price’ of a ticket paid by them in the false prospect for a safe voyage,” said Meloni, a far-right leader whose governing allies include the anti-migrant League party.

            She vowed to crack down on departures arranged by human smugglers and to press fellow European Union leaders to help.

            Opposition parties pointed to Sunday’s tragedy as proof of the flaws in Italy’s migration policy.

            “Condemning only the smugglers, as the center-right is doing now, is hypocrisy,″ said Laura Ferrara, a European Parliament lawmaker from the populist 5-Star Movement.

            “The truth is that the EU today doesn’t offer effective alternatives for those who are forced to abandon their country of origin,″ Ferrara said in a statement.

            Another route employed by traffickers crosses the central Mediterranean Sea from Libya's coast, where migrants often endure brutal detention conditions for months before they are allowed to board rubber dinghies or aging wooden fishing boats for Italian shores. That route is considered one of the deadliest.

            Meloni's government has concentrated on complicating efforts by humanitarian boats to make multiple rescues in the central Mediterranean by assigning them ports of disembarkation along Italy's northern coasts. That means the vessels need more time to return to the sea after bringing migrants aboard and taking them safely to shore.

            Humanitarian organizations have lamented that the crackdown also includes an order to the charity boats not to remain at sea after the first rescue operation in hopes of performing other rescues, but to head immediately to their assigned port. Violators face stiff fines and confiscation of rescue vessels.

            Italian President Sergio Mattarella called on the European Union to ""finally concretely assume the responsibility of managing the migratory phenomenon to remove it from the traffickers of human beings.''

            Italy has complained bitterly for years that fellow EU countries have balked at taking in some of the migrants, many of whom are aiming to find family or work in northern Europe.

Rosario Morrone told state TV. “We need to get there before.”State TV said 22 survivors were taken to a hospital.Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square that he was praying for the dead, the missing and the survivors, as well as for rescuers ""and for those who give welcome” to the migrants.“It's an enormous tragedy,” Crotone Mayor Vincenzo Voce told RAI. “In solidarity, the city will find places in the cemetery” for the dead.In 2022, some 105,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores, some 38,000 more than in 2021, according to Interior Ministry figures.According to U.N. figures, arrivals from the Turkish route accounted for 15% of the total number, with nearly half of those fleeing from Afghanistan.Meloni expressed “her deep sorrow for the many human lives torn away by human traffickers.”“It’s inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the ‘price’ of a ticket paid by them in the false prospect for a safe voyage,” said Meloni, a far-right leader whose governing allies include the anti-migrant League party.She vowed to crack down on departures arranged by human smugglers and to press fellow European Union leaders to help.Opposition parties pointed to Sunday’s tragedy as proof of the flaws in Italy’s migration policy.“Condemning only the smugglers, as the center-right is doing now, is hypocrisy,″ said Laura Ferrara, a European Parliament lawmaker from the populist 5-Star Movement.“The truth is that the EU today doesn’t offer effective alternatives for those who are forced to abandon their country of origin,″ Ferrara said in a statement.Another route employed by traffickers crosses the central Mediterranean Sea from Libya's coast, where migrants often endure brutal detention conditions for months before they are allowed to board rubber dinghies or aging wooden fishing boats for Italian shores. That route is considered one of the deadliest.Meloni's government has concentrated on complicating efforts by humanitarian boats to make multiple rescues in the central Mediterranean by assigning them ports of disembarkation along Italy's northern coasts. That means the vessels need more time to return to the sea after bringing migrants aboard and taking them safely to shore.Humanitarian organizations have lamented that the crackdown also includes an order to the charity boats not to remain at sea after the first rescue operation in hopes of performing other rescues, but to head immediately to their assigned port. Violators face stiff fines and confiscation of rescue vessels.Italian President Sergio Mattarella called on the European Union to ""finally concretely assume the responsibility of managing the migratory phenomenon to remove it from the traffickers of human beings.''Italy has complained bitterly for years that fellow EU countries have balked at taking in some of the migrants, many of whom are aiming to find family or work in northern Europe.___Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822220,Papua New Guinea kidnappers release last 3 hostages,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — An Australian-based archaeologist and two Papua New Guinea nationals have been released from captivity after being taken hostage by an armed group in a remote part of Papua New Guinea several days ago, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Sunday.

            “I welcome news from PNG that all hostages have been released and will soon be reunited with their families,” Wong said on Twitter.

            The academic, Bryce Barker, and the other hostages were reportedly held at gunpoint by 20 armed men, according to a local police report. Police did not say when the kidnapping occurred.











            Barker is a New Zealand national based at the University of Southern Queensland in Australia.

            The archaeologist and his research crew were conducting fieldwork in the remote Southern Highlands province of the poor South Pacific island nation when they were taken hostage by the armed group.

            Papua New Guinea authorities confirmed the release of one hostage on Friday. The last three hostages — the professor and two Papua New Guinea women — have now been freed safely.

            Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape said the final three hostages were secured “through covert operations” without paying the $3.5 million kina ($993,000) ransom.

            “To criminals, there is no profit in crime,” he wrote on Facebook.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822226,Taiwan defense ministry proposes revisions to national mobilization law,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced earlier this week that it submitted a revised draft of the “All-out Defense Mobilization Readiness Act,” which is now publicly available.The MND’s proposed revisions call for county and city governments, as well as all news and media organizations, to cooperate with government controls that may be implemented over all information networks, including online media platforms, publishers, and television broadcasters.The revised draft of the mobilization readiness act calls for the National Communications Commission (NCC) and the Ministry of Culture (MOC) to prepare relevant protocols for implementing any necessary oversight of the country’s mass communication networks, reported UDN. This may include potential audits or investigations of telecommunication equipment manufacturers and related businesses, prior to any national mobilization.In addition to tighter control over media and communications, the new draft also calls for stricter penalties for actions detrimental to national security. These include failure to comply with government demands prior to, or during mobilization, disseminating false information, and hoarding critical supplies.Anyone who fails to comply with government directives, or who actively tries to contravene or impede such directives may be jailed for up to seven years, and potentially fined up to NT$7 million (US$230,000). A company may also be fined up to NT$7 million if one of its employees commits an act to hamper the investigation of any government agency or the implementation of any national mobilization measures.In cases of disseminating false information, the prison sentence is not to exceed three years. However, jail terms can be increased by up to 50% if an individual knowingly disseminates false information online.The new draft also calls for increased fines and fixed-term punishments for hoarding supplies that may be vital to the country’s mobilization efforts, whether for war or any emergency crisis situation, reports CNA. Those found guilty of hoarding such supplies without justification are to be sentenced to not less than one year, and no more than seven years in prison.The new draft of the law was published on Feb. 21. Before the legislature can vote on any revisions, the MND must submit the new draft for public review for a period of 14 days. The new draft can be viewed here (Mandarin).",2023/02/26,4598,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822229,"Cruise, 'Everything Everywhere' honored at producers' awards","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Tom Cruise was honored for his nearly three decades of work as a producer, and “ Everything Everywhere All at Once ” solidified its status as the frontrunner for the best picture Oscar by taking the top prize at Saturday night's Producers Guild of America Awards. 

            “We love you! We love you!” another Oscar favorite and one of the film's stars, Ke Huy Quan, shouted gleefully from the stage as Jonathan Wang and the other producers of the multiversal dramedy accepted the award for best theatrical motion picture. 

            The award has proven to be perhaps the best indicator for what will win the top honor at the Oscars, with four of the past five and 11 of the past 14 PGA winners going on to win best picture. 











            PGA wins by “ CODA ” last year and “ Nomadland ” in 2021 set each apart as frontrunners before winning best picture. 

            The strong possibility of a big night at Sunday's Screen Actors Guild Awards could further mark “Everything Everywhere” as the film to beat at the March 12 Academy Awards. 

            Cruise the actor caused a stir inside and outside with his presence at the show at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, but his producing career beginning in 1996 with “Mission: Impossible"" earned him the David O. Selznick Award at the PGAs, a life achievement honor previously bestowed on Steven Spielberg, Kevin Feige, Mary Parent and Brian Grazer. 

            “My whole life I wanted to make movies,"" said Cruise, wearing a tuxedo with his hair grown out to the length he wore it in “Mission: Impossible 2."" ""I wanted to travel the world, and have adventure."" 

            Cruise talked about making his film debut in 1981's “Taps” at age 18 and how producer Stanley Jaffe let him in on every part of the process. 

            “I was certain this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life,"" he said. 

            Cruise thanked Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of the original 1986 “Top Gun” and his producing partner on last year's “Top Gun: Maverick,” which also was nominated for the top PGA award and is up for the best picture Oscar. 

            “You opened the door for me,” Cruise told Bruckheimer. “You welcomed me in and I will be grateful forever.” 

            Since the first “Mission: Impossible,” Cruise has regularly been a producer on the films in which he has starred, including “Vanilla Sky,” “The Last Samurai,"" “Jack Reacher"" and the other five films in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. 

            He paid tribute in his acceptance to many other mentors and partners including Spielberg and former Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing, who presented the award. 

            “You’ve all enabled me the adventurous life that I wanted,” he said. 

            Cruise gave a closing shout-out to “all the audiences, for whom I work first and foremost, thank you for letting me entertain you.” 

            Other movies honored by the PGA included “Navalny,” which won for best documentary feature, “Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio,” which took best animated film, and “Till,” which won the Stanley Kramer Award honoring a production or producer that illuminates and raises public awareness of important social issues. 

            In the PGA’s television categories, “The Bear” won for best comedy, “The White Lotus” won for best drama, “Lizzo’s Watch Out For The Big Grrrls” won for best reality or competition series, “Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy” won for non-fiction series, “The Dropout” won best limited series and “Weird: The Al Yankovic Story” won best TV movie. 

            Mindy Kaling received the Norman Lear Achievement Award in Television for her work producing shows including “The Mindy Project,” “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” “Never Have I Ever,” “Velma” and “The Office.”

            “I’m a child of immigrants and that unexpectedly became my secret weapon,” Kaling said. 

            B.J. Novak, her former “Office” co-writer and co-star, presented Kaling with the award, saying she “cared about characters other people hadn’t cared about enough to put on TV, and they cared about things that other people on TV hadn’t cared about.""

            The sudden spell of wintry weather in Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia this weekend came after days of unseasonably warm weather. In Serbia, people in the country's north woke up to a snow-covered landscape while temperatures in the south reached as high as 22 degrees Celsius (71.6 degrees Fahrenheit.)

            Croatian media reported that many people remained stuck in their cars far from the centers, which they only would be able to reach on foot. 

            Bad weather also halted ferry lines linking the mainland Croatia's coastline with the country's islands.

            Earlier, Croatian police reported that a bus overturned, killing one person and injuring several people. The accident happened shortly before midnight on Saturday in western Croatia, police said.

            Authorities also arrested Abby Choi's ex-husband on Saturday and charged him with murder on Sunday night, Superintendent Alan Chung said. 

            He will appear in court Monday alongside three family members: Choi’s former father-in-law and his eldest son were charged with murder, while her former mother-in-law faces a count of perverting the course of justice, police said in a statement. The names of those accused have not been released.











            Choi, 28, had financial disputes involving tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars with her ex-husband and his family, Chung said earlier, adding that “some people” were unhappy with how Choi handled her financial assets.

            Choi was a model and influencer who shared her glamorous life of photo shoots and fashion shows with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram. Dressed in a tulle floor-length gown, she had just attended a Dior show at Paris Fashion Week.

            Her last post was a week ago, featuring a photoshoot she had done with L’Officiel Monaco, a fashion publication.

            Choi had been missing several days when police discovered her dismembered body and documents on Friday. The remains were stored in a refrigerator in the home in the village of Tai Po, a suburban part of Hong Kong closer to the border with mainland China.

            At Sunday's news briefing, Chung said a young woman's skull believed to be Choi's was found in one of the cooking pots authorities seized, along with human ribs, hair, and tissue. Forensic pathologists found a small number of human bones in a second pot, he added. 

            “There's a hole on the right side rear on the skull, so the pathologist believes that that should be the fatal attack on the victim,” he said. 

            Chung said Choi was believed to have been attacked in a car and was unconscious when she arrived at the house. Police were still trying to find out the exact time of death and locate her hands and torso.

            On Sunday, police also arrested another woman believed to have been in an affair with the ex-husband's father for allegedly assisting the other suspects. Chung said the woman had rented the house together with the father, as well as another place to hide the ex-husband.

            The UCLA alumni came up short again at the Ladies European Tour in Saudi Arabia last week where she settled for another third place.

            “I knew I was going to win, it was just when... and I finally did,” she added. 

            Vu became the third American to triumph in the event after Lexi Thompson in 2016 and Jessica Korda in 2018. 

            Playing her first LPGA tournament, Vongtaveelap’s lack of experience took a toll with the 20-year-old golfer enduring a mixed final round featuring seven birdies offset by a double bogey and four bogeys to sign off with a 1-under 71 and and 267 overall. 

            Her hope for forcing a play-off was dashed after her birdie attempt at the last landed a foot away from the pin. 

            Thailand will have to wait for a second local winner after former No. 1 Ariya Jutanugarn prevailed in the 2021 edition. 

            Another Thai golfer, Atthaya Thitikul, was third after a final-round 68 got her to 268. 

            Maja Stark of Sweden and French Celine Boutier settled at joint fourth on 271, one ahead of top-ranked Lydia Ko, who finished joint-sixth on 272.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822299,Ukraine updates: Kyiv denies Russian forces captured Yahidne,"Russian forces have so far failed to capture the village of Yahidne in eastern Ukraine as part of efforts to take the city of Bakhmut, Kyiv said Sunday.The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces contradicted the Russian mercenary group, Wagner, which had claimed the capture of the village in the Donetsk region.Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said Saturday that his units had taken Yahidne after a similar claim over the nearby village of Berkhivka a day earlier.It is not possible to independently verify the claims.Kyiv said Russian troops were continuing their offensive around the town of Bakhmut, in a war of attrition that has been going on for months.But a military statement spoke of ""unsuccessful offensives"" by Russia in six areas in Donetsk, including Berkhivka and Yahidne.Although Russian troops have made progress in encircling Bakhmut in recent weeks, they have yet to take the city.Bakhmut, which once had a population of 70,000, now has just 5,000 people remaining in extremely dire conditions.After the war this week moved into its second year, Dara Massicot, a senior policy officer at the Rand Corporation, said Russian troops face two major hurdles that they hadn't foreseen at the start of the campaign.""One is Ukrainian resistance,"" Massicot told CNN, adding the Russians ""are also unable or unwilling to interdict Western support.  They're adjusting a little bit but I don't think they can overcome those larger issues.""Here are some of the other notable developments concerning the war in Ukraine on Sunday, February 26:President Vladimir Putin told Russian state TV that the West wants to destroy Russia.""They have one goal: to disband the former Soviet Union and its fundamental part - the Russian Federation,"" he told Rossiya 1.Putin also said the West would only admit Russia to the so-called ""family of civilized peoples"" after breaking the nation into separate parts.Putin added that he believed the West was an indirect accomplice to the ""crimes"" committed by Ukraine.The Russian leader said he felt Moscow had no choice but to take into account the nuclear capabilities of NATO as the US-led military alliance was seeking the defeat of Russia.""In today's conditions, when all the leading NATO countries have declared their main goal as inflicting a strategic defeat on us, so that our people suffer as they say, how can we ignore their nuclear capabilities in these conditions?""Russia's elite forces have likely suffered large casualties during their latest offensive in Donetsk, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Sunday.A satellite image purports to show a cluster of destroyed Russian military vehicles southeast of the embattled Ukrainian city of Wuhledar.This image likely shows vehicles of the marines of the 155th Naval Infantry (NI) Brigade.The ministry said the NI has so far been deployed alongside ground forces and has therefore been tasked with ""some of the toughest tactical missions"" in the war.In its latest intelligence update, Britain said NI's capacity has almost certainly been ""seriously degraded,"" which it said was partly down to experienced personnel joining the ranks.A senior Belarusian official said Saturday that the country has 1.5 million potential military
personnel outside of its armed forces.""The structures of the organizations, not the Armed Forces, will amount to somewhere up to 1.5 million people in the event of a declaration of martial law and the switch of the economy to a war mode,"" said State Secretary of the Security Council Alexander Volfovich told state news agency BeITA.Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has been a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow's war on Ukraine.Lukashenko had ordered the formation of a new volunteer territorial defense force of up to 150,000 people earlier this month. He said his army would fight only if Belarus was attacked.Ukraine said it has been able to amass power reserves and plans no more outages to ration electricity if there are no new strikes.""Electricity restrictions will not be introduced, provided there are no strikes by the Russian Federation on infrastructure facilities. Outages will only be used for repairs,"" Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said on the ministry's Telegram messaging platform.In October, Russia had begun bombing Ukraine's energy infrastructure, leaving millions without heat and electricity.""Our power engineers managed to maintain the power system, and for the third week in a row, electricity generation has ensured consumption needs, we have reserves,"" Halushchenko said.Ukraine does not produce power generators itself and has imported them over the past few years. The US pledged $10 billion on Friday to aid Kyiv's energy needs.The deputy director of Ukraine's military intelligence HUR told Germany's Funke Media Group newspapers that Russia currently has no weapons from China.""According to our information, Russia currently has no weapons and ammunition from China,"" HUR deputy chief Vadym Skibitsky said in the interview, published Sunday.Skibitsky added that Russia has been negotiating for arms supplies with countries such as China, Iran, North Korea and former Soviet nations. Moscow was currently negotiating with Iran for the delivery of medium-range missiles.Skibitsky said Russia was unable to keep up with ammunition, artillery and new weapons, especially missile systems. Ukrainian troops had destroyed 60% of Russian battle tanks and 40% of armored vehicles in the first six months of the war, he said.He urged the West to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine.Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern that China was ""considering providing lethal support"" to Moscow in the Ukraine war. Beijing had denied these claims.French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to visit China and urge Beijing to pressure Moscow to end the Ukraine war.China has maintained a neutral position in the war, whilst maintaining close ties with Russia.China published a 12-point position paper on Friday that called for urgent peace talks and a ""political settlement"" to end the conflict.""The fact that China is engaging in peace efforts is a good thing,"" Macron said on the sidelines of an agricultural show in Paris, in reference to the position paper. He added that peace was only possible if ""Russian aggression was halted, troops withdrawn, and the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its people was respected.""Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday also expressed hopes to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.Belarusian President Lukashenko, a close ally of Putin, is also set to visit China this month.mm, tg/ar (dpa, AFP, AP, Reuters)",2023/02/26,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822300,Has Ukraine's anti-oligarch law had an impact?,"During a visit to Brussels on February 9, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he expected negotiations about Ukraine joining the EU to begin in earnest this year. The bloc has said that membership will depend on certain reforms, including tackling corruption and reducing the influence of oligarchs on politics.In 2021, Ukraine adopted an ""anti-oligarch law,"" which is currently being reviewed by the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters; findings are expected to be published in March.According to the 2021 law, people can be considered oligarchs if they fulfil any three of the following four criteria:They must submit a special declaration of their income.For decades, Ukrainian politics was mired in a vicious circle of corruption. Oligarchs would finance political parties, mostly in secret, to influence laws and policies via politicians of their liking. It was often more lucrative to ensure that state taxes and levies on the extraction of resources remained low than to invest in the modernization of industry.The ""anti-oligarch law"" has already proven to be effective. Last summer, Ukraine's richest man, billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, handed over all licenses pertaining to his media group. The head of the European Solidarity political party, former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, also lost official control of his television stations and billionaire Vadym Novynskyi has also withdrawn his mandate as a member of parliament.Russia's ongoing attacks have done major damage to Ukraine's industry and have thus contributed to the erosion of the oligarchs' wealth. In a study published late last year, the independent Kyiv-based Centre for Economic Strategy (CES) calculated Ukraine's oligarchs had lost $4.5 billion in industrial assets. Akhmetov had suffered the greatest damages because his Metinvest Group lost the important Azovstal iron and steel works after Russian troops conquered Mariupol.The CES estimated these industrial sites were worth over $3.5 billion. Furthermore, Akhmetov's coke and chemical plant in Avdiivka, near Donetsk — worth $150 million — also ceased operating after damage caused by Russian attacks. Targeted missile strikes also destroyed many more of Akhmetov's energy companies, and particularly thermal power stations.The Ukrainian edition of Forbes magazine estimates Akhmetov has lost over $9 billion as a result of the war. However, with over $4 billion left in his coffers, he remains the richest person in Ukraine.The wealth of Ihor Kolomoyskyi, another very influential oligarch until recently, has also shrunk drastically. His most important company, an oil refinery near Ukraine's central city of Kremenchuk, was destroyed by Russian attacks last year, with the CES estimating damages at over $400 million. Kolomoyskyi and his partner Gennadiy Bogolyubov used to control a significant portion of Ukraine's fuel market and owned the largest petrol station network in the country.For many years, Kolomoyskyi had been able to use his political influence to control the management of Ukrnafta, a state company and the largest producer of oil and gas in Ukraine, in which he only held a minority interest, but accumulated massive profits.Now, however, his shares in Ukrnafta and the oil refinery Ukrtatnafta have been seized for the duration of martial law in Ukraine. He has also had his Ukrainian citizenship revoked, as he has Israeli and Cypriot citizenship, too, and Ukraine does not allow dual nationality. Furthermore, there are several pending legal cases against him as he is accused of fraud in connection with Ukrnafta.Dmytro Firtash, another oligarch who wielded considerable influence for years, though he lives in Austria, and is now under investigation, has also lost a large part of his fortune in the past year. The Azot chemical plant in Russian-occupied Severodonetsk, owned by his group, has been significantly damaged in the war, with the CES estimating the losses at $69 million.Dmytro Horyunov from the CES says that with their current loss of resources, Ukrainian oligarchs have fewer means of influencing politics and their previous investment in this regard has become somewhat ""less relevant."" He hopes that the ""anti-oligarch law"" will further prevent businesspeople and media tycoons from playing such a major role in politics in future, but he is also realistic. He says not enough has been done for this to happen: ""As long as they have assets, they will do anything to protect or increase them.""According to the CES, oligarchs have tended to defend their interests through the Ukrainian judicial system. It also says that though Ukraine's anti-monopoly authority has imposed fines of more than $200 million on Akhmetov's companies and tens of millions of dollars on companies owned by Kolomoyskyi and Firtash for abuse of monopoly power, all of them have been challenged in court and none have been paid as yet.Despite the fact that some oligarchs have decided to give up control of their own media outlets, Ihor Feshchenko from the Chestno (honestly) movement also doubts that big business will stay out of politics after the war ends.""I think the first thing we will see on the part of the oligarchs is that they will create new TV channels, and, at the same time, political parties associated with them,"" he said, adding that it was imperative that legislation on political parties be implemented to block the flow of non-transparent funds for election campaigns.The CES hopes that if Ukraine becomes a member of the EU, major investments will come from other member states rather than oligarchs. It has appealed to international finance institutes, on whose aid Ukraine is dependent, to link this help with demands for de-oligarchizing and to support firms that can compete with the oligarchs.This article was originally written in Russian.",2023/02/26,109,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822302,"Russia, Iran sending top envoys to UN's human rights council","GENEVA (AP) — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will help kick off the latest and longest-ever session of the U.N.'s top human rights body on Monday, with Iran's foreign minister, a senior Russian envoy, and the top diplomats of France and Germany among scores of leaders set to take part.

            The more than five-week session of the Human Rights Council opens as the world grapples with rights concerns including Russia's war in Ukraine, repression of dissent in Russia and Belarus, new violence between Palestinians and Israelis, and efforts to solidify a peace deal in Ethiopia that ended two years of conflict between the national government and rebels in the Tigray region. 

            The council, made up of 47 members countries, takes up an extensive array of human rights issues — including discrimination, the freedom of religion, right to housing or the deleterious impact of economic sanctions targeting governments on regular people — as well as country “situations” like those in Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar, Nicaragua and South Sudan. It usually meets three times a year.











            Proponents say the Geneva-based rights body has grown in importance as a diplomatic venue because the U.N. Security Council in New York has been increasingly divided in recent years due to a major rift between affiliations among its five permanent members: China and Russia on one side, Britain, France and the United States on the other. 

            On Monday, among the speakers after Guterres and the presidents of Congo, Montenegro and Colombia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian will come up between Germany's Annalena Baerbock and France's Catherine Colonna. China's foreign minister, Qin Gang, is set to make a statement by video. 

            Amirabdollahian's visit comes in the wake of vociferous and continued protests that erupted in Iran after the death in September of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini following her arrest by the country’s morality police.

            Moscow is set to be represented at the highest level since Russia suspended its council membership last year — largely because the U.N. General Assembly was on the cusp of stripping it. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, known more for his expertise on defense matters, is set to attend on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to speak by video message the same day.

            A year ago, scores of diplomats walked out of the council chamber as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov appeared by video, to express their opposition to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine days earlier. He had originally been set to attend in person but many Western countries closed their airspace to flights from Russia after the invasion.

            In the session, the United States is likely to try to keep pressure on China over its record on issues over a crackdown on pro-democracy activists and others in Hong Kong, long-running concerns about Tibet, and others about the western region of Xinjiang — on which former U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet issued a scathing report last fall just minutes before she left office. 

            “We will continue to shine a spotlight on documented abuses of Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang by the PRC,” said the U.S. ambassador to the council, Michèle Taylor. ""We are not going to just walk away from that ... I don’t have an answer right now for exactly what’s planned, but I can tell you that we’re engaged in robust conversations about what that might look like.”

            Western diplomats say they are looking to see what tone the new U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, takes on the issue. He is set to speak right after Guterres. 

            Among other items on the agenda will be the possible renewal of the term of a team of experts, known as a Commission of Inquiry, on the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Ethiopia's effort to prematurely end the mandate of a council-designated team of investigators who have been looking into rights issues related to the conflict with Tigray rebels.GENEVA (AP) — U.N.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822310,Top Arab lawmakers in Syria for talks with President Assad,"BEIRUT (AP) — Senior Arab lawmakers were in Syria on Sunday for talks with President Bashar Assad on bringing his country back into the fold of the Arab world. The visit follows a mini-summit in Baghdad that affirmed the Arab League's intentions of having Syria return to the organization despite the country's devastating civil war. 

            Lawmakers from nine Arab countries, as well as Palestinian representatives, made up the delegation — reflecting a continuation in the thawing of relations with Assad, who for over a decade has been isolated from most of the region. 

            Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011 after Assad’s government cracked down brutally on mass protests against his rule — an uprising that quickly descended into a brutal civil war. The conflict has killed over 300,000 people and displaced half the country’s population of 23 million. 











            First to arrive in Damascus was Egypt's Parliament Speaker Hanafy el-Gebaly, the most senior Egyptian official to visit Syria in over a decade. Iraq's parliament speaker, Mohammed Halbousi — among several Arab leaders who have been calling for Syria's return to the Arab League — headed the delegation.

            On Saturday, the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union met in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, after several Arab countries in recent years moved to reestablish ties with Assad.

            The process intensified following the massive Feb. 6 earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria and killed more than 47,000 people, including over 1,400 people in government-controlled areas of Syria and more than 2,400 in the rebel-held northwest. The quake further compounded Syria's deep economic crisis.

            Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among U.S. allies in the Middle East that delivered earthquake aid to government-held areas in Syria. The United Arab Emirates sent more aid-loaded planes than any other nation, including Syria's key allies Russia and Iran.

            El-Gebaly told reporters after landing in Damascus that the Arab delegation was “visiting brotherly Syria to support the Syrian people"" after the quake. He cited the joint statement from the Baghdad meeting about the need to begin the process of “bringing Syria back to the Arab fold.”

            “It’s natural that Syria will return some day, God willing, and matters will return to what they once were,"" he said.BEIRUT (AP) — Senior Arab lawmakers were in Syria on Sunday for talks with President Bashar Assad on bringing his country back into the fold of the Arab world. The visit follows a mini-summit in Baghdad that affirmed the Arab League's intentions of having Syria return to the organization despite the country's devastating civil war.Lawmakers from nine Arab countries, as well as Palestinian representatives, made up the delegation — reflecting a continuation in the thawing of relations with Assad, who for over a decade has been isolated from most of the region.Syria was suspended from the Arab League in 2011 after Assad’s government cracked down brutally on mass protests against his rule — an uprising that quickly descended into a brutal civil war. The conflict has killed over 300,000 people and displaced half the country’s population of 23 million.First to arrive in Damascus was Egypt's Parliament Speaker Hanafy el-Gebaly, the most senior Egyptian official to visit Syria in over a decade. Iraq's parliament speaker, Mohammed Halbousi — among several Arab leaders who have been calling for Syria's return to the Arab League — headed the delegation.On Saturday, the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union met in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, after several Arab countries in recent years moved to reestablish ties with Assad.The process intensified following the massive Feb. 6 earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria and killed more than 47,000 people, including over 1,400 people in government-controlled areas of Syria and more than 2,400 in the rebel-held northwest. The quake further compounded Syria's deep economic crisis.Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among U.S. allies in the Middle East that delivered earthquake aid to government-held areas in Syria.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822311,Iran's currency hits new low amid anti-government protests,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s currency fell to a new record low on Sunday, plunging to 600,000 to the dollar for the first time as the effects of nationwide anti-government protests and the breakdown of the 2015 nuclear deal continued to roil the economy.

            Iranians have formed long lines in front of exchange offices in recent days, hoping to acquire increasingly scarce dollars. Many have seen their life savings evaporate as the local currency has deteriorated. Inflation reached 53.4% in January, up from 41.4% two years ago, according to Iran's statistics center.

            The dire economic conditions have contributed to widespread anger at the government, but have also forced many Iranians to focus on putting food on the table rather than engaging in high-risk political activism amid a fierce crackdown on dissent.











            Iran's currency was trading at 32,000 rials to the dollar when it signed the 2015 nuclear accord with world powers. The agreement lifted international sanctions in return for strict limits on and surveillance of its nuclear activities.

            The agreement unraveled when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from it and restored crippling sanctions. Iran responded by ramping up its enrichment of uranium, and now has enough for “several” atomic weapons if it chooses to develop them, according to the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog.

            Iran insists its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, but experts say it had a nuclear weapons program until 2003 and is developing a breakout capacity that could allow it to quickly build an atomic weapon should it decide to do so.

            The Biden administration supports a return to the 2015 agreement, but negotiations hit an impasse last year and appear to have ground to a halt. Iran has further angered Western countries by supplying armed drones to Russia that have been used in its invasion of Ukraine.

            Meanwhile, Iran has seen waves of anti-government protests since the September death of a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman who was detained by the morality police for allegedly violating Iran's strict Islamic dress code.

            The protests rapidly escalated into calls for the overthrow of Iran's ruling Shiite clerics, marking a major challenge to their four-decade rule. Iran' has blamed the unrest on foreign powers, casting it as an extension of the sanctions, without providing evidence.

            The Trump administration had hoped that maximum sanctions would force Iran to make major concessions on its nuclear activities, its ballistic missile program and its military involvement in countries across the Middle East, but it has yet to do so.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s currency fell to a new record low on Sunday, plunging to 600,000 to the dollar for the first time as the effects of nationwide anti-government protests and the breakdown of the 2015 nuclear deal continued to roil the economy.Iranians have formed long lines in front of exchange offices in recent days, hoping to acquire increasingly scarce dollars.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822320,Israeli settlers rampage after Palestinian gunman kills 2,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Scores of Israeli settlers went on a violent rampage in the northern West Bank, setting dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman. Palestinian medics said one man was killed and four others were badly wounded in what appeared to be the worst outburst of settler violence in decades.

            The deadly shooting Sunday, followed by the late-night rampage, immediately raised doubts about Jordan's declaration that Israeli and Palestinian officials had pledged to calm a year-long wave of violence.

            Palestinian media said some 30 homes and cars were torched. Photos and video on social media showed large fires burning throughout the town of Hawara — scene of the deadly shooting earlier in the day — and lighting up the sky. 











            In one video, a crowd of Jewish settlers stood in prayer as they stared at a building in flames. And earlier, a prominent Israeli Cabinet minister and settler leader had called for Israel to strike “without mercy.” 

            Late Sunday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by Israeli fire. The Palestinian Red Crescent medical service said two other people were shot and wounded, a third person was stabbed and a fourth was beaten with an iron bar. Some 95 others were being treated for tear gas inhalation. 

            Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned what he called “the terrorist acts carried out by settlers under the protection of the occupation forces tonight.”

            “We hold the Israeli government fully responsible,” he added.

            The European Union said it was “alarmed by"" the violence in Hawara and that “authorities on all sides must intervene now to stop this endless cycle of violence.” The U.K.’s ambassador to Israel, Neil Wigan, said that “Israel should tackle settler violence, with those responsible brought to justice.” 

            As videos of the violence appeared on evening news shows, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appealed for calm and urged against vigilante violence. “I ask that when blood is boiling and the spirit is hot, don’t take the law into your hands,” Netanyahu said in a video statement.

            The Israeli military said its chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Herzl Halevi, rushed to scene. It said troops were being reinforced in the area as they worked to restore order and search for the shooter.

            Ghassan Douglas, a Palestinian official who monitors Israeli settlements in the Nablus region. said that settlers burned at least six houses and dozens of cars in Hawara, and reported attacks on other neighboring Palestinian villages. He estimated around 400 Jewish settlers took part in the attack.

            “I never seen such an attack,” he said. 

            The rampage occurred shortly after the Jordanian government, which hosted Sunday’s talks at the Red Sea resort of Aqaba, said the sides had agreed to take steps to de-escalate tensions and would meet again next month ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

            “They reaffirmed the necessity of committing to de-escalation on the ground and to prevent further violence,” the Jordanian Foreign Ministry announced.

            After nearly a year of fighting that has killed over 200 Palestinians and more than 40 Israelis in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, the Jordanian announcement marked a small sign of progress. But the situation on the ground immediately cast those commitments into doubt.

            The Palestinians claim the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip – areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war – for a future state. Some 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The international community overwhelmingly considers the settlements as illegal and obstacles to peace.

            The West Bank is home to a number of hard-line settlements whose residents frequently vandalize Palestinians land and property. But rarely is the violence so widespread.

            Prominent members of Israel's far-right government called for tough action against the Palestinians.

            Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler leader who lives in the area and has been put in charge of much of Israel’s West Bank policy, called for “striking the cities of terror and its instigators without mercy, with tanks and helicopters.""

            Using a phrase that calls for a more heavy-handed response, he said Israel should act ""in a way that conveys that the master of the house has gone crazy.”

            Late Sunday, however, Smotrich appealed to his fellow settlers to let the army and government do their jobs. “It is forbidden to take the law into your hands and create dangerous anarchy that could spin out of control and cost lives,” he said.

            Earlier, in Israeli ministerial committee gave initial approval to a bill that would impose the death penalty on Palestinians convicted in deadly attacks. The measure was sent to lawmakers for further debate.

            There were also differing interpretations of what exactly was agreed to in Aqaba between the Palestinians and Israelis.

            Jordan’s Foreign Ministry said the representatives agreed to work toward a “just and lasting peace” and had committed to preserving the status quo at Jerusalem's contested holy site.

            Tensions at the site revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Haram al-Sharif have often spilled over into violence, and two years ago sparked an 11-day war between Israel and the Hamas militant group during Ramadan.

            Officials with Israel's government, the most right-wing in Israeli history, played down Sunday's meeting.

            A senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity under government guidelines, said only that the sides in Jordan agreed to set up a committee to work at renewing security ties with the Palestinians. The Palestinians cut off ties last month after a deadly Israeli military raid in the West Bank.

            Netanyahu’s national security adviser, Tzachi Hanegbi, who led the Israeli delegation said there were “no changes” in Israeli policies and that plans to build thousands of new settlement homes approved last week would not be affected. 

            He said “there is no settlement freeze” and “there is no restriction on army activity.”

            The Jordanian announcement had said Israel pledged not to legalize any more outposts for six months or to approve any new construction in existing settlements for four months. 

            The Palestinians, meanwhile, said they had presented a long list of grievances, including an end to Israeli settlement construction on occupied lands and a halt to Israeli military raids on Palestinian towns.

            Sunday’s shooting in Hawara came days after an Israeli military raid killed 10 Palestinians in the nearby city of Nablus. The shooting occurred on a major highway that serves both Palestinians and Israeli settlers. The two men who were killed were identified as brothers, ages 21 and 19, from the Jewish settlement of Har Bracha.

            Hanegbi was joined by the head of Israel’s Shin Bet domestic security agency who attended the talks in neighboring Jordan. The head of the Palestinian intelligence services as well as advisers to President Mahmoud Abbas also joined.

            Jordan’s King Abdullah II, who has close ties with the Palestinians, led the discussions, while Egypt, another mediator, and the United States also participated.

            In Washington, the U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, welcomed the meeting. “We recognize that this meeting was a starting point,” he said, adding that implementation will be critical.”

            It was a rare high-level meeting between the sides, illustrating the severity of the crisis and the concerns of increased violence as Ramadan approaches in late March.

            In Gaza, Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel’s destruction, criticized Sunday’s meeting and called the shooting a “natural reaction” to Israeli incursions in the West Bank.

            Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Hamas militant group subsequently took control of the territory, and Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade over the territory.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822333,South Korean K-pop group ITZY delight fans with return to Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The K-pop girl group ITZY performed at Linkou Arena in New Taipei on Sunday (Feb. 26) as part of the Checkmate World Tour, with over 8,000 fans in attendance.The members of ITZY expressed their gratitude for the welcoming atmosphere that Taiwanese fans helped to create. To show their fans, referred to as MIDZY, how comfortable they felt in Taiwan, the girls jokingly laid down on the stage for several minutes, reported LTN.The group performed 24 songs, including a special Mandarin version of the fan anthem “MIDZY.” Members of the group said they were so happy to see their fans in Taiwan again after four years, reported LTN.ITZY is a five-member girl group on the JYP record label that debuted in 2019. They have had hit singles with songs “Wannabe,” “Dalla Dalla,” and “Sneakers.” Their most recent album, Cheshire, was released in November 2022.Following their show in New Taipei, the group will head to Hong Kong for two concerts, and then to Bangkok, where they will wrap up the Asia leg of the Checkmate tour, which began in mid-January.",2023/02/26,1435,Sports & Entertainment

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822337,Taiwan restaurant accuses student of eating ice cream off public scoop,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A steak house in Taichung on Saturday (Feb. 25) shared a video of a patron eating ice cream off a public scoop while serving himself ice cream at the restaurant.In a video shared by 19House, a young man can be seen standing before a self-service station scooping ice cream onto a cone. As he does, he first takes a bite of the ice cream piled on the cone, then, after scooping more ice cream, he brings both the ice cream and the scoop to his mouth for another bite.The video’s subtitle reads that the individual belonged to a group of 25 “non-Taiwanese” patrons who “occupied half the restaurant’s seats.” Additionally, the patrons allegedly “made a mess on the table and floor” and “served themselves a bunch of food from the self-service station just to leave on the table untouched.”According to the restaurant, staff members immediately cleared all utensils at the self-service station and sent them to the kitchen to be washed and disinfected. The restaurant wrote that staff members also tried to communicate with the patrons and, after failing to do so, asked them to leave.The restaurant apologized to other patrons who dined there on the same day for what it described as an “absurd” incident.During an interview with CTS News, 19House owner, surnamed Chen (陳), said after the video was uploaded, the Korean patrons saw it and called to ask the restaurant to remove it because they are in Taiwan as a representative of Korea. After the incident, he disposed of the six tubs of ice cream, worth around NT$3,000 (US$97.81) to NT$4,000.In another post, 19House added that when the Korean patrons called, they refused to apologize or admit the individual’s wrongdoing, insisting that there was an issue with the camera angle of the video. “Even if people from other countries don’t have the habit of using shared utensils, it is not possible for them to eat ice cream off an ice cream scoop directly, right?”",2023/02/26,6509,Food Safety & Health

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822347,"Sofia Goggia wins World Cup downhill, closes on season title","CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland (AP) — Sofia Goggia raced toward another World Cup downhill title with a fifth win in her dominating season on Sunday.

            Goggia raced through lightly falling snow and was fastest on the lower section of the Mont Lachaux course to finish 0.15 seconds ahead of Federica Brignone, her Italy teammate who matched a career-best result in downhill.

            “It was really a relief for me because it was tough (that) I crashed in the one and only training run,” said Goggia, whose 22nd career World Cup win was her 17th in downhill.











            Brignone got some of the best racing conditions as the No. 21 starter, starting 35 minutes after Goggia when the snow had stopped falling and sunshine broke through the clouds to light the slope.

            Laura Gauché wearing the No. 26 bib then placed third, 0.41 seconds behind Goggia, for a first career podium finish. The French racer’s previous best result in downhill was seventh.

            “It’s amazing, I didn’t expect that,"" said Gauché, who acknowledged ""I feel lucky with the visibility because the first racers had really bad visibility.” 

            Mikaela Shiffrin skipped the weekend meeting at Crans-Montana to take a break after the world championships with a massive lead of more than 700 points in the overall World Cup standings. The 27-year-old American is well on track to win a fifth giant crystal globe as the overall season-long champion.

            Goggia’s fifth win in seven World Cup downhills earned 100 race points and extended her lead in the season-long standings to 179 over Ilka Štuhec, who placed ninth.

            With two downhills left — next weekend at Kvitfjell, Norway and March 15 at the final week's races at Soldeu, Andorra — Goggia needs just a top-10 finish in either race to secure a fourth career crystal globe trophy.

            The win for the 2018 Olympic champion came two weeks after she crashed out as favorite at the world championships. The 17th World Cup downhill win lifted Goggia into a tie for fourth all-time in the marquee speed discipline which Lindsey Vonn leads with 43.

            Brignone, the 2020 overall champion, still seeks a first career downhill win though said she was “so proud of what I did today."" 

            Racing immediately after Brignone, Isabella Wright fell when she seemed unbalanced by the shifting terrain. The American slid about 60 meters (yards) down the slope before coming to a stop.

            Romane Miradoli crashed out when her left ski hooked a gate at a sharp turn. The ski detached and she was turned sideways before hitting the safety fences.

            Both racers appeared to be unhurt and skied down to the finish area.

            The start was delayed by more than 30 minutes while fog clouded the upper part of the 2.45-kilometer (1½-mile) course at Crans-Montana. 

            The downhill was rescheduled from Saturday when a combination of poor visibility on a lower section and a soft snow surface in the sunshine made racing too dangerous.

            The snow surface was more stable Sunday after a cold night and race-time temperature around minus-4 degrees Celsius (25 Fahrenheit).

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822348,Millions who rely on Medicaid may be booted from program,"WASHINGTON (AP) — If you get health care coverage through Medicaid, you might be at risk of losing that coverage over the next year.

            Roughly 84 million people are covered by the government-sponsored program, which has grown by 20 million people since January 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. 

            But as states begin checking everyone's eligibility for Medicaid for the first time in three years, as many as 14 million people could lose access to that health care coverage. 











            A look at why so many people may no longer qualify for the Medicaid program over the next year and what you need to know if you're one of those people who relies on the program. 

            WHAT’S HAPPENING TO MEDICAID? 

            At the beginning of the pandemic, the federal government prohibited states from kicking people off Medicaid, even if they were no longer eligible. Before the pandemic, people would regularly lose their Medicaid coverage if they started making too much money to qualify for the program, gained health care coverage through their employer or moved into a new state.

            That all stopped once COVID-19 started spreading across the country. 

            Over the next year, states will be required to start checking the eligibility again of every person who is on Medicaid. People will have to fill out forms to verify their personal information, including address, income and household size. 

            ___

            WHEN MIGHT I LOSE MY COVERAGE? 

            That will vary depending on which state you live in; some states are moving faster than others to check eligibility. Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia are among the states that will begin removing ineligible Medicaid recipients as early as April. 

            Other states will start taking that step in May, June or July. 

            Not everyone will be removed from the program all at once. States plan to verify all recipients’ eligibility over periods of nine months to one year. 

            ___

            HOW WILL I BE NOTIFIED IF I’M LOSING COVERAGE? 

            If you rely on Medicaid for care, it’s important to update your contact information, including home address, phone number and email with the state from which you receive benefits. 

            States will mail a renewal form to your home. The federal government also requires states to contact you in another way -– by phone, text message or email –- to remind you to fill out the form.

            Even if mailed notices reach the right address, they can be set aside and forgotten, said Kate McEvoy, executive director of the nonprofit National Association of Medicaid Directors.

            “A text might just grab someone’s attention in a way that would be more accessible,” she said, noting that a quick message also may be less intimidating than a mailed notice.

            Most states have already used texting for things such as reminding patients to get a COVID-19 vaccine or about upcoming doctor’s visits. But sending mass texts on Medicaid eligibility will be new, McEvoy said. 

            You will have at least 30 days to fill out the form. If you do not fill out the form, states will be able to remove you from Medicaid. 

            ___

            WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS IF I’M KICKED OFF MEDICAID? 

            Many people who will no longer qualify for Medicaid coverage can turn to the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace for coverage, where they’ll find health care coverage options that may cost less than $10 a month. 

            But the coverage available on the marketplace will still be vastly different from what’s offered through Medicaid. Out-of-pocket expenses and co-pays are often higher. Also, people will need to check if the insurance plans offered through the marketplace will still cover their doctors. 

            A special enrollment period will open for people who are unenrolled from Medicaid that will start on March 31 and last through July 31, 2024. People who lose Medicaid coverage will have up to 60 days to enroll after losing coverage, according to guidance the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent to states last month. 

            ___

            MY CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEIR COVERAGE? 

            More than half of U.S. children receive health care coverage through Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 

            Even if you receive a notice that you’re no longer eligible for Medicaid, it’s likely that your child still qualifies for the program or for health care coverage through CHIP, which covers children whose families make too much money qualify for Medicaid but don’t earn enough to afford private health insurance. 

            Between 80% and 90% percent of children will still be eligible for those programs, according to estimates from the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute’s Center for Children and Families. 

            “When a parent receives a message that they aren’t eligible anymore, they often assume their child is no longer eligible either,” said Joan Alker, the center’s executive director. “It’s more common to find that the parent is no longer eligible for Medicaid, but the child still is.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822350,"In 2024 campaign, kingmaker reprise for South Carolina?","CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina is accustomed to increased attention in the years leading up to presidential elections, with the state hosting the South’s first voting contests for several of the last cycles.

            But even by those standards, 2024 feels different.

            Democrats elevated South Carolina to the top of their presidential primary calendar, leapfrogging Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans, meanwhile, could potentially have two homegrown South Carolina presidential candidates in the race, a prospect that has already caused friction among the state’s GOP circles of supporters.











            A look at why so many political roads to 2024 will lead to South Carolina:

            THE DEMOCRATS

            Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee approved its 2024 calendar, an effort to give a prominent voice to a more diverse electorate.

            
                President Joe Biden had endorsed a plan placing South Carolina first on the party’s calendar for the coming presidential cycle, followed by New Hampshire, Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.

            Biden’s recognition of the role South Carolina played in reviving his 2020 campaign, after less-than-stellar performances in earlier-voting states, has been clear since his victory celebration three years ago in February.

            “You brought me back,” Biden told supporters. His win built momentum that helped him plow through the Super Tuesday votes that followed.

            Last year, in a fundraiser for South Carolina Democrats, Vice President Kamala Harris offered her gratitude, saying, “We see how South Carolina Democrats set President Joe Biden and me on a path to the White House. … Thank you, South Carolina.”

            The Biden administration has keep close ties with the state, where Biden's roots run deep and include family vacations to the state, as well as friendships with late Sens. Fritz Hollings and Strom Thurmond, and lawyer Dick Harpootlian, a former state party chairman who is now a state senator.

            On Monday, Harris will return to South Carolina to discuss the administration's advancements on broadband internet expansion, a top priority of Rep. Jim Clyburn, one of Biden's closest allies and the lone Democrat in South Carolina's congressional delegation. Other Cabinet officials visited last year.

            While South Carolina Democrats have not won a statewide race since 2006, they have begun selling buttons, mugs and apparel flaunting the state’s new status, with the tagline “South Carolina Democrats Pick Winners.” But the party is undergoing a period of transition, with chair Trav Robertson announcing this past week he would not seek another term after six years in the job.

            Looking ahead, Robertson noted the regional financial impact that could be felt from the early position of South Carolina, where media markets — and the campaign advertising dollars spent in them — bleed into surrounding states.

            “We have long advocated that South Carolina’s position in this process has been extremely beneficial to North Carolina and Georgia and to Tennessee,” Robertson told The Associated Press. “The impact of this is going to be felt for a generation.”

            ___

            HOMEGROWN GOP CANDIDATES

            
                Nikki Haley's official launch to her 2024 presidential campaign, in downtown Charleston two weeks ago, was steeped in references to her six years as South Carolina's governor.

            “It's a great day in South Carolina!” Haley said, a nod to her gubernatorial catchphrase that she for a time required state Cabinet agencies to use when answering public phone lines. 

            Haley, the first woman and Indian American to lead the state, also cloaked herself in references to accomplishments during her time in office, including creating jobs. She mentioned leading the state “beyond hate and violence,"" a reference to the shooting of an unarmed Black motorist by a white police officer and the slayings of nine Black parishioners by a self-avowed white supremacist.

            She did not explicitly mention the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds in 2015 after the church shootings — a move she pushed for after years of publicly supporting its presence.

            With former President Donald Trump already in the 2024 race, Haley — who served two years as his U.N. ambassador — became the first major Republican to challenge him for the nomination.

            
                Some of South Carolina’s top Republicans, including Gov. Henry McMaster, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, have endorsed Trump, whose 2016 victory in South Carolina’s primary helped solidify GOP support behind his campaign.

            Haley has lined up support from at least one member of the state’s congressional delegation, Rep. Ralph Norman. Rep. Nancy Mace, whom Haley endorsed for reelection last year, has said that, for now, “my powder is dry” when it comes to the 2024 White House race.

            But Tim Scott, South Carolina's junior senator, has been making moves that seem to put him on the verge of formalizing his own 2024 bid. The day after Haley's launch, Scott was in Charleston himself, speaking at a Charleston County GOP dinner his team characterized as part of a “listening tour.” Days later, both he and Haley were in Iowa, which holds the GOP's first 2024 votes.

            Scott's potential entry into the race has led to some awkwardness among the state's Republicans, many of whom have been supporters of both him and Haley.

            Catherine Templeton, who served in Haley's administration, said Haley and Scott are calling the state's Republicans seeking support, a process she characterized as “uncomfortable.”

            “Generally, a Scott Republican and a Haley Republican are pretty similar creatures, but it is a game of addition, so both candidates are being deferential,” Templeton said. ""They are saying, ‘If I can’t be your first, I’d like to be your second.’ You won’t find them criticizing each other, but ultimately, it is uncomfortable to choose between friends.”

            Templeton won't say whom she plans to support and says she expects a similar waiting game among GOP voters and donors in South Carolina.

            “People are waiting to see what Tim does before they make a decision,"" she said. ""But Nikki is in either way.”

            ___

            WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?

            The 2024 season in only getting started in South Carolina, just as in the other early states. Next month, the state plays host to one of the first leadoff, multicandidate events, when Palmetto Family sponsors its Vision '24 conference in Charleston.

            So far, one announced candidate — Haley — is scheduled to attend, though potential ones, including Scott and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, are set to come. Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are among those yet to RSVP.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822357,"Voting continues in Nigeria, a day after polls due to close","ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More people in Nigeria cast ballots Sunday even though voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections of Africa’s most populous nation was supposed to end Saturday. 

            Votes were cast in Benue, Adamawa and Bayelsa states even as the counting of ballots ballots was underway Sunday in places where polls had closed, election observers said. Preliminary results were expected as early as Sunday evening.

            Logistical and security challenges caused widespread delays across the country Saturday. Some frustrated voters waited overnight and still hadn't voted by the following morning. 











            “No sacrifice is too great to elect a credible leader of your choice,” Glory Edewor, who stood in line all night to vote in Delta state, said. 

            Election officials blamed the delays on logistical issues, though other observers pointed to the upheaval created by a redesigned currency that has left many residents unable to obtain bank notes.

            
                The cash shortage affected transportation not only for voters but also for election workers and police officers providing security. The challenges also likely resulted in low voter turnout, said Yiaga Africa, the country’s largest election monitoring body. 

            While Saturday's election was largely peaceful, observers said there were at least 135 critical incidents, including eight reports of ballot-snatching, that undermined the legitimacy of the country's democracy, 

            “It is unacceptable that Nigerians who have the constitutional rights to participate in an election go out to cast their vote and you have thugs who make it difficult for them,” said Samson Itodo, the head of Yiaga Africa. “The nation needs to really rise and condemn these acts of voter suppression that we observed yesterday,” he said.

            Associated Press journalists saw armed men pull up to a voting station in a minibus Saturday, fire shots in the air and grab the presidential ballot box. The shots sent voters screaming and scattering, and ballots strewn across the floor.

            In the capital, Abuja, some voters said they were barred from voting at all. 

            “They employed various strategies to make sure that we do not continue to vote,” said Emmanuel Ogbu. The 45-year-old trader waited with more than 100 people to vote Sunday but was told by election officials they didn't have enough supplies, such as ink, and needed to wait for the supervisor who had yet to arrive.

            President Muhammadu Buhari is stepping down after two four-year terms. His tenure was marked by concerns about his ailing health and frequent trips abroad for medical treatment. Out of the field of 18 presidential candidates, three front-runners emerged in recent weeks: the candidate from Buhari’s ruling party, the main opposition party candidate and a third-party challenger who drew strong support from younger voters. 

            As voting continued, officials need to ensure there is adequate security at polling stations, monitor the process for vote-rigging and manipulation, and control misinformation, said Dr. Akinola Olojo, project manager for the Lake Chad Basin team at the Institute for Security Studies.

            Associated Press reporters Taiwo Ajayi in Abuja, Nigeria, and Sam Mednick in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, contributed.ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — More people in Nigeria cast ballots Sunday even though voting in the presidential and parliamentary elections of Africa’s most populous nation was supposed to end Saturday.Votes were cast in Benue, Adamawa and Bayelsa states even as the counting of ballots ballots was underway Sunday in places where polls had closed, election observers said. Preliminary results were expected as early as Sunday evening.Logistical and security challenges caused widespread delays across the country Saturday. Some frustrated voters waited overnight and still hadn't voted by the following morning.“No sacrifice is too great to elect a credible leader of your choice,” Glory Edewor, who stood in line all night to vote in Delta state, said.Election officials blamed the delays on logistical issues, though other observers pointed to the upheaval created by a redesigned currency that has left many residents unable to obtain bank notes.The cash shortage affected transportation not only for voters but also for election workers and police officers providing security.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822358,"Failing at polls, election deniers focus on state GOP posts","PARKER, Colo (AP) — In a basement event space in the Denver suburb of Parker, Tina Peters surveyed a crowd of Colorado Republicans last week and made an unusual pitch for why she should become chair of their beleaguered party: “There's no way a jury of 12 people is going to put me in prison.”

            Peters was referring to her upcoming trial on seven felony charges related to her role in allegedly accessing confidential voting machine data while she was clerk in western Colorado's Mesa County. The incident made her a hero to election conspiracy theorists but unpopular with all but her party's hardest-core voters.

            Peters, who condemns the charges as politically motivated, finished second in last year's GOP primary for secretary of state, Colorado's top elections position.











            Now Peters has become part of a wave of election deniers who, unable to succeed at the polls, have targeted the one post — state party chair — that depends entirely on those hardest-core Republicans.

            Embracing election conspiracy theories was a political albatross for Republicans in states that weren't completely red last year, with deniers losing every statewide bid in the swing states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But the movement has focused on GOP state party chairs — positions that usually are selected by only dedicated activists and have the power to influence the party's presidential nominating contest and some aspects of election operations, such as recruiting poll watchers.

            “The rise of this dangerous ideology nationwide and the rise within party machinery are ominous,” said Norm Eisen, a prominent Washington lawyer and former ambassador who is executive chair of States United Democracy Center, which tracks election deniers. “It's an outrageous phenomenon.”

            Kristina Karamo, a former community college instructor who lost her bid last fall to become Michigan's secretary of state by 14 percentage points, won the chair of the Michigan Republican Party a week ago. She beat a fellow election denier, failed attorney general candidate Matthew DePerno.

            In Kansas, Mike Brown, a conspiracy theorist who lost his primary bid for secretary of state, was named chair of the state party. 

            Peters is just one of multiple candidates for the Colorado position who have repeated former President Donald Trump's lies that President Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election.

            “We can't just say, ‘Oh, it’s time to get over 2020 and be done with that,'” said Aaron Wood, a self-described Christian conservative father also running for Colorado GOP chair, who organized a slate of candidates to take over the party's top posts. “Until I have 100% confidence that the election has integrity, I will not be done with that.”

            The wave of election deniers follows a push by Trump during his administration to stock the roster of party chairs with loyalists, several of whom supported his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and remain in the White House. Of those, Kelli Ward, the chair of the Arizona GOP, did not run again and was replaced by another Trump loyalist, former state Treasurer Jeff DeWitt. In Georgia, chairman David Shafer has announced he won’t seek another term this June, amid scrutiny over whether he could be indicted for efforts to help Trump overturn the 2020 election. 

            As in most states, the new Georgia party head will be selected by leaders of local county parties. Many of those are Trump loyalists who also backed Shafer's bid to overturn Trump's 2020 loss in the state. But Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who defied Trump's request and easily beat a primary challenger last year backed by Shafer, has marginalized the state party, creating a parallel structure to raise money and turn out voters.

            That's an example of how the once powerful post of state party chair has changed.

            “It used to be adjacent to public service, to be the state party chair, and now it's something where you get to dunk on Democrats on Twitter,” said Robert Jones, a Republican pollster in Idaho.

            In that state, Dorothy Moon, an election denier and former state representative who made an unsuccessful primary run for secretary of state, became the Idaho GOP chair last year.

            Still, Eisen noted that state parties have important roles in appointing poll workers and poll watchers in many states. A perennial fear has been that conspiracists could fill those positions and disrupt elections, though that did not happen in 2022 despite a prominent conservative effort to find more poll watchers.

            “Maybe the Karamos and the Browns and the Moons will implode,” Eisen said. “There is a kind of incompetence that goes with this ideology. But it's a concerning trend given the power these state parties have.”

            Parties also have a major role in structuring their primaries. In Michigan, the party apparatus that Karamo now leads has the power to move its nominating contest to a closed convention, where activists select the winner.

            “Donald Trump would love there to be a convention for Michigan’s delegates,” Jason Roe, the former executive director of the state party, said in an interview.

            Ironically, Trump had endorsed DePerno, a lawyer who unsuccessfully sued to force a new count in 2020. Instead, Karamo, whom the former president had supported in her secretary of state race, won. She has described abortion as “child sacrifice” and Democrats as having a “Satanic agenda.” 

            Last wek, on the podcast of Trump adviser Steve Bannon last week, Karamo said Michigan was “ground zero for the globalist takeover of the United States of America.”

            In Colorado, many Republican strategists say they are prepared for Peters or another election denier to win the party chair position next month.

            “People seem almost resigned that the party is going to fall into the hands of this crowd for the next two years,” said Sage Naumann, one of the operatives, who said usually a chair's impact on elections is “neutral,” but that could change.

            “If they're constantly making controversial statements, then they can be detrimental,” Naumann said.

            The insurgent candidates running for Colorado's chair argue things can't get worse for the GOP in the state. Republicans lost every statewide race by double digits in November and have their smallest share of seats in the Legislature in state history.

            The candidates for party chair claim the Colorado GOP has been too timid and needs to be more outspoken and conservative — a risky bid in a state that has been rapidly moving to the left. As part of that, they seek to restrict the primary to only registered Republicans, shutting out voters not affiliated with any party who have been eligible to participate. That would require overturning a voter-approved ballot measure, which activists failed to do in a lawsuit last year. They hope to have a better shot with the party chair's support.

            At the debate last week in Parker, former state Rep. Dave Williams said: “It's time we had a warlike leader who is going to go toe-to-toe” with Democrats.

            Williams later added: “Joe Biden is not a legitimate president.”

            Only one candidate, Erik Aadland, a military veteran who unsuccessfully ran for Congress last year, cautioned about the election denier rhetoric. He noted that Democrats effectively used a tape of him questioning the validity of the 2020 election against him in his race. In an interview, he said specifically that he worried about Peters' candidacy.

            “It's not healthy, the words we're using, the rhetoric we've been using,” Aadland said. And, he added, “I don't think it'd be healthy to have a chairwoman under seven indictments.”

            Peters, however, reveled in her national profile. She noted that she had just started a podcast that had 60,000 downloads on its first day and that she raised $250,000 to fund a recount in three days after the 2022 primary —a recount that confirmed her loss.

            During a separate debate Saturday, she demonstrated the appeal of her message to voters whose beliefs are increasingly unpopular in a liberal state.

            “It’s not your fault that we lost this election in 2022. It’s not my fault that we lost this election in 2022,” she told another crowd of Republican voters at a suburban pizzeria. “It’s because of the machines.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822359,Siem wins Hero Indian Open for 5th European tour title,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Marcel Siem ended his long wait for a fifth European tour title with victory at the Hero Indian Open by a single shot on Sunday.

            The German’s last win on the tour came eight years and 116 days ago at the 2014 BMW Masters but a closing 68 saw him edge out countryman Yannik Paul to return to the winner’s circle with a 14-under 274.

            The 42-year-old golfer, who secured his card for the 2023 season at qualifying school in November, went into the final round one shot behind overnight leader Paul.











            He took a share of the lead after sinking a 20-foot birdie putt at the fourth. After picking up another shot on the par-five eighth, Siem made back-to-back gains on the 10th and 11th to establish a two-shot cushion.

            But a bogey on the 13th led to a two-shot swing, with Paul birdieing the same hole to join Siem at the top on 13 under.

            After saving par on the tough 14th, Siem holed from 15 feet for a birdie at the next to regain the outright lead.

            And he closed his round with three more pars, rolling in a 3-foot par putt on No. 18 to win moments after Paul slid his birdie putt wide from about 12 feet.

            He threw his cap to the ground then, with his arms outstretched, shouted “wow.”

            “This means a lot because two years ago I wasn’t even sure if I could still compete... and now I’m a winner again, come on,” he said.

            Paul finished alone in second on 13 under, with Dutchman Joost Luiten another shot further back in third.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822360,"On Ukraine front, civilians cling on as troops repel Russia","VUHLEDAR, Ukraine (AP) — The murky water oh so slowly trickles from the filthy drainpipe into her grimy container — the ticking seconds ramping up the risk that Emilia Budskaya could lose life or limb to Russian artillery strikes torturing her front-line town in eastern Ukraine.

            Gaping gashes from shrapnel in the courtyard walls around her testify to the dangers of venturing outside — exposed and without the body armor that Ukrainian soldiers defending Vuhledar wear when they emerge from their bunkers. 

            But Budskaya and her daughter need water to cling on and survive, to eke out another day in the ruins.











            And so they wait — tick, tick, tick — for the container to fill, for Budskaya to then pour the water into plastic bottles and — tick, tick, tick — for her to then start the process again until their bottles are filled. 

            Picking their way through the debris and mud, they carry their bounty back to the dark basement that now passes for their home.

            “We have no water, nothing,” Budskaya says. ""I’m getting rain water to wash dishes and hands.” 

            On the largely static front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces that stretches over hundreds of kilometers (miles), from the Black Sea in the south to Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, Vuhledar has become one of the deadliest hot spots. 

            It has joined Bakhmut, Marinka and other cities and towns, particularly in fiercely contested eastern Ukraine, as evidence of a grinding and destructive war of attrition, as well as symbols of fierce Ukrainian resistance.

            By defending their ruins, Ukrainian forces are slowing costly Russian offensive efforts to extend Moscow's control over the entirety of eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbas region. It became Russian President Vladimir Putin's revised target for conquest after his forces were beaten back from the capital, Kyiv, and northern Ukraine in the invasion's opening stage a year ago.

            Ukrainian soldiers are paying a heavy price, too, but say their sacrifices are wearing down waves of troops and equipment that Moscow is throwing into battle.

            In Bakhmut, a soldier who allowed himself to be identified only by his war name, “Expert,” said the pulverized city in the Donbas' Donetsk region “has become a stronghold "" for Ukraine.

            “See what they have done to it?"" he said of Russian forces that have been pounding Bakhmut for months, slowly inching forward with heavy casualties to capture a prize that, if it falls, might allow Moscow to argue that the invasion is making progress.

            “And this is not the only city,” the soldier, who fights in a Ukrainian rapid response unit, added. ""I wish they would break their teeth trying to chew it.”

            Battlefields around Vuhledar, southwest of Bakhmut and also in the Donetsk region, bear witness to the precious equipment and manpower that Russia is expending, with little territorial gain. Tanks and other armored fighting vehicles blown up by mines or stopped in their tracks by Ukrainian strikes are clumped together on the blasted, cratered terrain. 

            Although Russia has seized most of the Luhansk region that also forms part of the Donbas, the adjacent Donetsk region remains roughly divided between Ukrainian and Russian control.

            Ukraine's military said Sunday that Russian assaults in the east remain concentrated on Bakhmut and other objectives. 

            Russian forces include mercenaries of the notorious Wagner Group, a private military company that has recruited fighters from prisons and tossed them into combat, with high casualty rates. Its millionaire owner with longtime links to Putin, former convicted felon Yevgeny Prigozhin, said Saturday that his fighters had advanced into a settlement on Bakhmut's northern outskirts. The Ukrainian military disputed that claim, saying Russian forces were repelled.

            Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko reported three civilians killed and four wounded in Russian strikes on Saturday. Vuhledar and its surroundings were also intensely shelled, he said. Further along the front line, in the southern Kherson region also split between Ukrainian and Russian control, Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported two civilians killed and seven injured in 78 Russian strikes on the region on Saturday.

            On patrol in Vuhledar's ruins, hurrying down muddy paths to take cover behind pockmarked walls, Ukrainian soldiers said their fight was larger than for control of the city.

            “We fight for our children, for our fellow Ukrainians, for our nation,” said a marine with the war name “Moryak.” 

            “Because I think what Russia is doing now is genocide of Ukrainians. And Ukrainians don’t have another option but to win.""

            In other developments Sunday:

            — Marking the anniversary of Russia's occupation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed confidence the peninsula's return to Ukrainian control would be part of an end to the war. 

            “This is our land. Our people. Our history. We will return the Ukrainian flag to every corner of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.

            U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price repeated Sunday that “the United States does not and never will recognize Russia’s purported annexation of the peninsula. Crimea is Ukraine.”

            Asked whether the United States would support a Ukrainian military effort to retake Crimea, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s ""State of the Union"": “What ultimately happens with Crimea in the context of this war and a settlement of this war is something for the Ukrainians to determine, with the support of the United States.”

            The Ukrainian military said Sunday that Russian forces were building fortifications in Crimea to strengthen their defense, allegedly bringing 150 Russian conscripts from Russia’s Chelyabinsk region, close to the Ural mountains, to perform engineering work.

            — Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Farhan bin Faisal visited Kyiv to sign an agreement under which Riyadh will provide humanitarian aid and financing for purchases of oil derivatives purchases. “We hope this helps ease the suffering of the Ukrainian people during this humanitarian crisis,” he said of the agreement that is worth $400 million.

""I’m getting rain water to wash dishes and hands.”On the largely static front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces that stretches over hundreds of kilometers (miles), from the Black Sea in the south to Ukraine's northeastern border with Russia, Vuhledar has become one of the deadliest hot spots.It has joined Bakhmut, Marinka and other cities and towns, particularly in fiercely contested eastern Ukraine, as evidence of a grinding and destructive war of attrition, as well as symbols of fierce Ukrainian resistance.By defending their ruins, Ukrainian forces are slowing costly Russian offensive efforts to extend Moscow's control over the entirety of eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbas region. It became Russian President Vladimir Putin's revised target for conquest after his forces were beaten back from the capital, Kyiv, and northern Ukraine in the invasion's opening stage a year ago.Ukrainian soldiers are paying a heavy price, too, but say their sacrifices are wearing down waves of troops and equipment that Moscow is throwing into battle.In Bakhmut, a soldier who allowed himself to be identified only by his war name, “Expert,” said the pulverized city in the Donbas' Donetsk region “has become a stronghold "" for Ukraine.“See what they have done to it?"" he said of Russian forces that have been pounding Bakhmut for months, slowly inching forward with heavy casualties to capture a prize that, if it falls, might allow Moscow to argue that the invasion is making progress.“And this is not the only city,” the soldier, who fights in a Ukrainian rapid response unit, added. ""I wish they would break their teeth trying to chew it.”Battlefields around Vuhledar, southwest of Bakhmut and also in the Donetsk region, bear witness to the precious equipment and manpower that Russia is expending, with little territorial gain. Tanks and other armored fighting vehicles blown up by mines or stopped in their tracks by Ukrainian strikes are clumped together on the blasted, cratered terrain.Although Russia has seized most of the Luhansk region that also forms part of the Donbas, the adjacent Donetsk region remains roughly divided between Ukrainian and Russian control.Ukraine's military said Sunday that Russian assaults in the east remain concentrated on Bakhmut and other objectives.Russian forces include mercenaries of the notorious Wagner Group, a private military company that has recruited fighters from prisons and tossed them into combat, with high casualty rates. Its millionaire owner with longtime links to Putin, former convicted felon Yevgeny Prigozhin, said Saturday that his fighters had advanced into a settlement on Bakhmut's northern outskirts. The Ukrainian military disputed that claim, saying Russian forces were repelled.Donetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko reported three civilians killed and four wounded in Russian strikes on Saturday. Vuhledar and its surroundings were also intensely shelled, he said. Further along the front line, in the southern Kherson region also split between Ukrainian and Russian control, Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported two civilians killed and seven injured in 78 Russian strikes on the region on Saturday.On patrol in Vuhledar's ruins, hurrying down muddy paths to take cover behind pockmarked walls, Ukrainian soldiers said their fight was larger than for control of the city.“We fight for our children, for our fellow Ukrainians, for our nation,” said a marine with the war name “Moryak.”“Because I think what Russia is doing now is genocide of Ukrainians. And Ukrainians don’t have another option but to win.""In other developments Sunday:— Marking the anniversary of Russia's occupation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed confidence the peninsula's return to Ukrainian control would be part of an end to the war.“This is our land. Our people. Our history. We will return the Ukrainian flag to every corner of Ukraine,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram.U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price repeated Sunday that “the United States does not and never will recognize Russia’s purported annexation of the peninsula.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822361,Germany wants to ease visa application for Indian IT workers,"BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that his government wants to make it easier for information technology experts from India to obtain work visas in Germany as the country struggles with a shortage of skilled labor.

            Scholz said improving the legal framework so Germany becomes more attractive for software developers and those with IT development skills is a priority for his government this year.

            “We want to make the issuing of visas easier,” he told reporters during a visit to India's high-tech hub of Bengaluru.











            “Aside from the legal modernization we want to modernize the entire bureaucratic process as well,” Scholz said.

            Asked about workers who don't speak the language when they come to Germany, he said it should not be seen as a hurdle if people arrive in the country speaking English first and then acquire German later on.

            Scholz was speaking on the second day of his trip to India, after meeting Saturday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the fallout from the war in Ukraine.

            The German leader last year invited Modi to attend a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations he hosted in Bavaria, and said he favors India joining this year's meeting in Japan, too.BERLIN (AP) — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Sunday that his government wants to make it easier for information technology experts from India to obtain work visas in Germany as the country struggles with a shortage of skilled labor.Scholz said improving the legal framework so Germany becomes more attractive for software developers and those with IT development skills is a priority for his government this year.“We want to make the issuing of visas easier,” he told reporters during a visit to India's high-tech hub of Bengaluru.“Aside from the legal modernization we want to modernize the entire bureaucratic process as well,” Scholz said.Asked about workers who don't speak the language when they come to Germany, he said it should not be seen as a hurdle if people arrive in the country speaking English first and then acquire German later on.Scholz was speaking on the second day of his trip to India, after meeting Saturday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the fallout from the war in Ukraine.The German leader last year invited Modi to attend a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations he hosted in Bavaria, and said he favors India joining this year's meeting in Japan, too.",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822378,Putin: will 'take into account' NATO's nuclear capability,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview broadcast Sunday that after Russia suspended its participation in the last arms control agreement with Washington, it would “take into account” the nuclear weapons capabilities not only of the United States but of other NATO countries such as France and Britain.

            
                Putin had said in a speech suspending Russia's role in the 2010 New START treaty earlier this week that France and Britain, not parties to the agreement, had joined the United States in targeting Russia with nuclear weapons. In an interview with Russian TV that was recorded Wednesday and broadcast Sunday, he said he took the action to ""preserve our country, ensure security and strategic stability"" and added:

            “In today’s conditions, when all the leading NATO countries have declared their main goal to inflict a strategic defeat on us, to make our people suffer ... how can we not take into account their nuclear capabilities? Moreover, they supply weapons to Ukraine worth tens of billions of dollars.” 











            Putin was repeating his common theme that the West is bent on destroying Russia and that his one-year-old fight in Ukraine is part of a battle for Russia's very survival. He argued a year ago that his overarching goal in invading Ukraine was to reduce what he perceived as threats to Russia's security and has since cited those as justification for potentially using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. 

            As Western military aid poured into the invaded country, the Russian leader and his foreign minister have portrayed the war as a de facto fight between Russia and not just Ukraine but NATO. Ukraine's allies have emphasized they want to avoid becoming direct fighting parties in the war while equipping Ukraine to defend itself and to retake Russian-captured territory. 

            CIA Director William Burns said Sunday that the real issue behind the invasion is Putin's loss of control over Ukraine and the country's rise as an independent, democratic state aligned with the West.

            “He’s seen that as a direct threat to the ambition that cuts to the core of his view as a Russian leader, and I think that’s the backdrop to the horrific aggression that he’s launched,” Burns said on CBS' “Face the Nation.” 

            New START is the last remaining arms control agreement between Moscow and Washington. In suspending his country's participation, Putin said Russia can’t accept U.S. inspections of its nuclear sites while Washington and its NATO allies seek Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. The Russian president emphasized that Moscow was not withdrawing from the pact, and the Russian Foreign Ministry said the country would respect the treaty's caps on nuclear weapons and continue notifying the U.S. about test launches of ballistic missiles.

            In the interview with Russian TV, Putin didn't elaborate on how he would “take into account” the nuclear arsenals of NATO countries beyond those of the United States but indicated he was open to “discussion of this topic from the center of the field.”

            Putin also used the interview to allege that the West wants to break up Russia, a notion that he has repeatedly used to justify Russian aggression in Ukraine. “They have one goal: to disband the former Soviet Union and its fundamental part — the Russian Federation,” Putin said.

            
                Appealing to his citizenry's nationalistic sentiments, Putin predicted that if the West succeeds in destroying Russia and establishing control, Russians may not survive as a distinct ethnic group.

            “There will be Muscovites, some kind of people from the Urals, and so on,” he said of Russia’s possible fragmentation into regional groupings. The West could only partly accept Russia into the so-called “family of civilized peoples,” breaking the country into separate pieces, he theorized.

            Claiming threats to Russians' survival is a favorite Putin theme, and Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted in a recent interview with The Associated Press that “for him, it’s all about protection, and he believes that the Russian world has been attacked from the West, and Ukrainians are a part of this Russian world.”

            Claiming the West and and not Russia provoked the war in Ukraine is also a favorite Putin topic that many Russians buy into, said Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in the past three U.S. presidential administrations. 

            “They think that this is a war of them yet again defending their territory, as it has been since time immemorial, since the Mongol invasion of having to deal with invaders when they are the ones that are doing the invading,” Hill said in a recent AP interview. 

            She added that Putin’s frequent references to nuclear weapons fit a pattern “of menacing the world on every nuclear frontier because he knows that that’s the ultimate psychological weapon. Nuclear weapons are pretty effective politically.”

            
                U.S. President Joe Biden countered some of Putin's claims in a speech in Poland's capital, Warsaw, on Tuesday.

            “The United States and the nations of Europe do not seek to control or destroy Russia. The West was not plotting to attack Russia, as Putin said today,"" Biden said. ""And millions of Russian citizens who only want to live in peace with their neighbors are not the enemy.""Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an interview broadcast Sunday that after Russia suspended its participation in the last arms control agreement with Washington, it would “take into account” the nuclear weapons capabilities not only of the United States but of other NATO countries such as France and Britain.Putin had said in a speech suspending Russia's role in the 2010 New START treaty earlier this week that France and Britain, not parties to the agreement, had joined the United States in targeting Russia with nuclear weapons.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822381,Sri Lanka police fire tear gas at election protest; 15 hurt,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Police in Sri Lanka on Sunday fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters angry over a decision to postpone local elections after the government said it cannot finance them because of the country's crippling economic crisis. 

            About 15 people were treated for minor injuries, according to Colombo National Hospital. 

            Thousands of supporters of the opposition National People's Power party tried to march toward the main business district in capital Colombo, ignoring police warnings after a court order barred them from entering the area, which includes the president's residence, office and several key government buildings.











            The order had been obtained in the backdrop of last July's massive protests, when thousands of people stormed the presidential office and residence and occupied them for days. The crisis forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign.

            The turmoil was caused by severe shortages of some foods, fuel, cooking gas and medicine, after Sri Lanka went bankrupt because it could not repay its foreign debt. The new president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, negotiated a rescue package with the International Monetary Fund for $2.9 billion over four years, but it can be finalized only if Sri Lanka’s creditors give assurances on debt restructuring.

            Sri Lanka’s total foreign debt exceeds $ 51 billion, of which it must repay $28 billion by 2027. India and several other creditor countries have so far given assurances that meet the IMF standards, but the deal hinges on whether China would agree to debt restructuring at the same level.

            The Finance Ministry under Wickremesinghe said it can't allocate sufficient funds for the March 9 elections for town and village councils, even though political parties had submitted nominations. 

            The decision forced the Election Commission to indefinitely postpone the elections.

            Despite signs of progress in reducing shortages and ending daily power cuts after nearly a year, Wickremesinghe is immensely unpopular. Many people say he lacks the mandate because he was elected by lawmakers backed by Rajapaksa supporters. They accuse Wickremesinghe of protecting members of the Rajapaksa family from corruption allegations in return for backing him in Parliament. 

            The National People’s Power party, which organized Sunday's rally, has only three lawmakers in Sri Lanka's 225-member Parliament but it enjoys a wave of public support after the economic crisis eroded the popularity of traditional political parties that have ruled Sri Lanka since independence.COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Police in Sri Lanka on Sunday fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters angry over a decision to postpone local elections after the government said it cannot finance them because of the country's crippling economic crisis.About 15 people were treated for minor injuries, according to Colombo National Hospital.Thousands of supporters of the opposition National People's Power party tried to march toward the main business district in capital Colombo, ignoring police warnings after a court order barred them from entering the area, which includes the president's residence, office and several key government buildings.The order had been obtained in the backdrop of last July's massive protests, when thousands of people stormed the presidential office and residence and occupied them for days.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822392,DW Jazz Concerts: Christopher Dell and trio with Bob Degen,"Legendary American pianist Bob Degen joined Christopher Dell, Christian Lillinger and Jonas Westergaard, the members of the DLW trio, for this episode, which is a live recording of their concert at the 2021 Jazzfest in Bonn.Dell is not just a vibraphonist and composer. He's also an urban design theorist. His work is influenced by motives, themes and questions of the contemporary city.According to him, the city is an improvisational process affected by actors, things, actions, discourses and so on. ""Being driven by [these] motives, his work can take on different forms — such as writing a book, teaching urban design and architecture theory, playing or composing music..."" according to his website.Dell's fellow musician, Christian Lillinger, was also part of the trio that played at the 2021 Jazzfest. He was born in 1984 in Brandenburg, in eastern Germany, and studied with the famous German drummer and percussionist Günter Sommer, who is considered one of Europe's first Free Jazz musicians, with a focus on harmonically and rhythmically free improvisation. Lillinger was part of the German youth jazz orchestra, the Bundesjazzorchester, from 2001 to 2003. He also composes music and has been a member of the DLW trio since 2018, when it was formed under the name of Ensemble Stefanovich Dell Lillinger Westergaard (SDLW).Contrabassist Jonas Westergaard is from Copenhagen and has been active in the Danish and German jazz and improvisation scenes since the 1990s. He's played extensively with several jazz musicians, including German pianist Michael Wollny, Danish saxophonist and composer Benjamin Koppel, and German pianist and composer Marc Schmolling, among others.The legendary jazz pianist Bob Degen was born in Pennsylvania, US, in 1944. He began learning the piano when he was only four years old and had his first public performance at 10 with his father, who was also a musician. In 1961, he went to the Berklee College of Music in Boston and took lessons with pianist Margaret Chaloff, who had instructed such musicians as Herbie Hancock and  Steve Kuhn. Degen has played extensively in Europe since the 1960s and usually performs in trios. He moved to Germany in 1974.The concert in Bonn included a world premiere of Dell, Lillinger and Westergaard's newly composed music, inspired by the likes of Ludwig van Beethoven and Richard Wagner. The first piece is a ""suite"" dedicated to the album ""Third Stream"" (1960) by The Modern Jazz Quartet. The group, which traced its roots to jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie's big band in the 40s and 50s, played a combination of cool jazz, bebop and classical music. Its members included the pianist John Lewis, vibraphonist Milt Jackson, double bassist Percy Heath and drummer Conny Kay.Next you will be listening to some abstract ""sketches"" by the trio and Bob Degen, followed by a final piece called ""Superloader.""That's all for this edition of DW Jazz Concerts hosted by Manasi Gopalakrishnan. The show was produced by Thomas Schmidt and Christian Stäter, with editorial support from Anastassia Boutsko.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822393,Are Shah Rukh and Salman Khan Bollywood's last superstars?,"Released in India on January 25, 2023, Hindi-language action thriller ""Pathaan"" is Bollywood superstar, Shah Rukh Khan's, first film after a four-year hiatus.At the time of writing, it has grossed $122 million (€115 million) at the global box office, breaking several records in the process. Besides currently being the highest grossing Hindi-language film of all time, it is the seventh highest grossing film of 2023 worldwide to date.In a scene from the film, the 57-year-old actor, popularly known as SRK, and his co-star Salman Khan in a cameo role, allude to the lack of worthy successors in the Hindi film industry.Though meant as a joke, it is not that different from reality. To date, the Hindi film industry or ""Bollywood"" has seen no other star attain the level of the ""Three Khans."" Comprising Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir Khan — all in their late 50s and not related to each other — this trio has ruled the industry for decades.""There is definitely a sense of nostalgia attached to them, the sense of them representing a gradually dying era of Hindi cinema. They have also spent decades building a solid foundation of admirers,"" Rosheena Zehra, editor and curator at Shorted, a short-film curation platform, told DW.Zehra further explained how each Khan carved a niche — Shah Rukh as the romance king, Salman as the ""bhai"" or brother and Aamir as the intellectual — for a very particular brand of cinema that none of the actors after them have established.All three began their film careers around the same time but had different journeys. Aamir and Salman hail from acting dynasties in Bollywood, while Shah Rukh was an outsider from India's capital, New Delhi. Aamir gradually fell behind the other two in terms of quantity and popularity of films.Regardless of how their films fared in theatres or critics' opinions, the Khans enjoy immense popularity among the audiences. With their charisma and larger-than-life presence, they have fans from all ages and walks of life.Shah Rukh and Salman Khan often come out and stand on platforms erected at their respective residences, namely ""Mannat"" and ""Galaxy,"" and wave to their fans especially on occasions such as their birthdays or festivals like Eid. Tourists to Mumbai also often come by to see their homes.""For someone to be considered a superstar, there has to be an element of delusion that if I climb up a viewing platform, there must be hundreds of people waiting for me to wave to. Everybody else is an actor, a star, but being a superstar requires delusion. There is also the belief that 'If I make a film, people are going to come watch me',"" Abhishek Mande Bhot, writer and former digital editor of GQ India told DW.College student Rashi* and her group of friends have watched ""Pathaan"" twice within a month. ""We’re going to watch it a third time, and maybe a fourth!"" While she doesn't find the film that great, they are all going to watch it for Shah Rukh Khan. ""After what he’s been through with his son’s arrest and the polarization in the country, he has remained nothing but positive and we want to show him our support,"" she told DW.Shah Rukh’s son, Aryan Khan, was arrested and detained on drug charges last year, though many believed the actor was unfairly targeted for being a Muslim star in a country with rising anti-Islamic sentiments.Some fringe Hindu groups had also protested against a song in ""Pathaan,"" in which actor Deepika Padukone is seen wearing a saffron bikini. The color saffron bears significance in Hinduism, and has been adopted by some Hindutva groups as the color of their flags.The popularity of the Khans often attracts the ire of extremist Hindutva trolls on social media, with increasing attacks against Muslims in India. Shah Rukh and Salman have largely refrained from openly expressing their political views.""A superstar is also someone who gives the nation hope during these dark and polarizing times. Through all these difficulties, SRK maintained a dignified silence. And then through his movie, he gave us all one weekend of hope. Can you imagine anyone else doing that?"" asks Abhishek Mande Bhot.As Indian films became slicker and more stylized, the Khans have also adapted to changing times and thus now appeal to younger generations too.""The Khans are also among the first to recognize the importance of fitness. All three of them worked on getting six packs, and look believable as the heroes. This is what separates them from the previous generations, who couldn't play the lead of a film because they looked old,"" explains Abhishek Mande Bhot.While there are talented younger actors, like the hugely popular Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh and also female actors like Deepika Padukone and Alia Bhatt, industry observers feel that they will not reach ""superstardom"" status because the concept will not exist for much longer. The global pandemic and lockdowns served as a setback to several Bollywood stars. With the rise in online streaming services, Indian audiences are now able to access entertainment that goes far beyond mainstream cinema.""The newer actors have also over-exposed themselves over social media, taking away much from the myth of a superstar, the mystery and aura that pretty much made them who they are. Now I've to simply open Instagram to see what an actor's workout or last meal or vacation looks like. Where is the 'super' in that?"" asks Rosheena Zehra.*Full name has not been published to protect the interviewee's identity.Edited by: Brenda Haas",2023/02/26,119,

            Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Baneira would first fly to Dubai, then to Geneva, and finally to Coruña, the northern Spanish city where she is originally from and is expected to arrive Monday. 











            The reasons for her arrest and detention in early November were not made public. Baneira is a human rights activist who was arrested while allegedly taking part in protests in Tehran, according to Spanish national news agency EFE.

            A family spokesperson told The Associated Press that Baneira was visiting Iran on a vacation and that the trip was not related to human rights activism. The spokesperson, Llerena Perozo, described her as committed to protecting the environment and interested in getting to know different cultures and social realities through travel.

            Baneira was one of two Spanish nationals known to have been detained in Iran amid the anti-government protests that erupted in the country after the death of Masha Amini, a woman who died in police custody. 

            The other one is Santiago Sánchez, who was arrested in early October after visiting Amini's tomb during a trekking trip that crossed Iran.MADRID (AP) — A 24-year-old Spanish citizen has been released from prison in Iran after almost four months, Spain's Foreign Ministry said Sunday.Ana Baneira was released Saturday, the ministry said, explaining that it waited to make the announcement until her plane took off from Iran.Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said Baneira would first fly to Dubai, then to Geneva, and finally to Coruña, the northern Spanish city where she is originally from and is expected to arrive Monday.The reasons for her arrest and detention in early November were not made public.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822396,"Jill Biden sees East Africa drought up close, seeks more aid","LOSITETI, Kenya (AP) — U.S. first lady Jill Biden got an up-close look Sunday at the historic East Africa drought as she walked along arid land and listened as some Maasai women described how their children and livestock are going hungry. She appealed for more countries to join the United States to help alleviate the suffering.

            Some areas of the Horn of Africa have endured five consecutive failed rainy seasons, meaning there was no rainfall or an insufficient amount to help farmers with their crops and livestock. An upcoming sixth rainy season, beginning in March, is expected to be about the same or worse.

            Biden, who was on the final day of a five-day visit to Africa, toured an outreach center in the town operated by World Vision with support from UNICEF and the World Food Program. She chatted with people who had brought their children to be screened for malnutrition and she participated in a discussion with a group of women, including a mother of 10 children, who shared their stories.











            “They talked about how their livestock are dying. Obviously, you can see the drought here, how bad it is,” the first lady told reporters afterward. “The one source of water here feeds 12 villages and each village has approximately a thousand to 1,200 people.”

            “So they are coming here, the people are coming to get water, they’re bringing their livestock to get water. But unfortunately, for many of them, the way they make their living is from their livestock and for most of them, the livestock are dying, so they’re having a hard time,” she said.

            Biden noted that the United States has provided 70% of the money sent to the region to help alleviate the suffering, “but we cannot be the only ones.”

            “We need to have other countries join us in this global effort to help these people of the region,” she said, adding that the drought was competing with humanitarian efforts tied to Russian’s war in Ukraine and an earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people in Turkey and Syria.

            “I mean, there are a lot of competing interests but, obviously here, people are actually, livestock, people are starving,” she said.

            Meg Whitman, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who accompanied Biden, said people know intellectually what’s going on in the region but “it’s different when you just see it.”

            Underscoring Biden, Whitman said that “everyone needs to help as best we can here because this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.”

            Members of the Maasai community, who are predominantly herders, live in Kajiado county where Biden visited.

            Nearly 23 million people in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya are thought to be highly food insecure, which means they do not know where they will find their next meal, according to a food security working group chaired by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the regional Intergovernmental Authority on Development.

            A Maasai elder, Mingati Samanya, 69, said he lost 10 cows during the recent prolonged dry season and struggled to find hay for the rest of his herd.

            ""The short rains last year were insufficient and right now we are back to struggling for pasture. We hope the long rains will be enough,” he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

            Biden sought to use her stature to help focus the world’s attention on the worsening humanitarian crisis in East Africa by touring the drought-stricken area near Kenya’s border with Tanzania.

            On the nearly three-hour drive south of Nairobi, the capital, Biden’s lengthy motorcade passed over dry river and creek beds. Numerous cows were walking alongside the highway — many so thin that their ribs were showing.

            Throngs of people lined both sides of the motorcade route at various points, waving or using their cellphones to record the event.

            Some 4.4 million people in Kenya are facing high levels of food insecurity, with the number projected to rise to 5.4 million in March, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification.

            Already, 11 million livestock that are essential to many families’ health and livelihood have died. Many of the people affected are farmers who have watched their crops wither and die, and their water sources run dry.

            Northern Kenya, which is arid and semi-arid and is where pastoralist communities live, is most affected.

            The country’s agriculture sector heavily relies on rainfall, and the meteorological department is predicting delayed rains in the upcoming short rainy season that should begin in March.

            President William Ruto announced last October that his cabinet had lifted a decade-old ban on openly cultivating and importing genetically modified crops. The decision came amid pressure from the U.S. government, which had argued that the ban affected U.S. agricultural exports and food aid.

            Last week, Ruto led the country in praying for rain.

            The first lady has been highlighting the drought along with women and youth empowerment since arriving in Namibia last Wednesday.

            Biden had visited Kenya in 2011, when her husband, Joe Biden, was serving as vice president, to help raise awareness about what then was considered a severe famine. U.S. officials and aid organizations say the current drought is far worse.

            About halfway through drive to Lositeti, the first lady traded her black SUV for a smaller one more suited for the rugged terrain ahead. The village was the final stop on a five-day, two-country visit that took her from Namibia, along the Atlantic coast in southern Africa, to Kenya in the east.

            It was her sixth visit overall to Africa, and her first as first lady. She traveled with her granddaughter, Naomi Biden, who is 29.

            Biden met throughout the week with young people, women and entrepreneurs as she promoted U.S.- backed programs that teach about HIV/AIDS, preventing infection and safe sex practices. Other programs she visited help people learn skills to find jobs or start businesses to support their families.

            Along the way, she managed to make some news with her comments in an interview with the AP in which she gave the strongest indication yet that her husband will seek to be reelected in 2024.

            Asked if the only thing left to do was to decide on when and where to announce the campaign, she replied, “Pretty much.”

            The president, who later was asked about his wife’s comments, offered a more measured response, saying he had “other things to finish before I get into a full-blown campaign.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822413,"In heart of Haiti's gang war, one hospital stands its ground","PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — When machine gun fire erupts outside the barbed-wire fences surrounding Fontaine Hospital Center, the noise washes over a cafeteria full of tired, scrub-clad medical staff.

            And no one bats an eye.

            Gunfire is part of daily life here in Cité Soleil – the most densely populated part of the Haitian capital and the heart of Port-au-Prince’s gang wars.











            As gangs tighten their grip on Haiti, many medical facilities in the Caribbean nation's most violent areas have closed, leaving Fontaine as one of the last hospitals and social institutions in one of the world's most lawless places.

            “We’ve been left all alone,” said Loubents Jean Baptiste, the hospital's medical director.

            Fontaine can mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of people just trying to survive, and it offers a small oasis of calm in a city that has descended into chaos.

            The danger in the streets complicates everything: When gangsters with bullet wounds show up at the gates, doctors ask them to check their automatic weapons at the door as if they were coats. Doctors cannot return safely to homes in areas controlled by rival gangs and must live in hospital dormitories. Patients who are too scared to seek basic care due to the violence arrive in increasingly dire condition.

            Access to health care has never been easy in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. But late last year it suffered a one-two punch.

            One of Haiti’s most powerful gang federations, G9, blockaded Port-au-Prince’s most important fuel terminal, essentially paralyzing the country for two months.

            At the same time, a cholera outbreak made worse by gang-imposed mobility restrictions brought the Haitian health care system to its knees.

            The U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said this month that violence between G9 and a rival gang has turned Cité Soleil into “a living nightmare.”

            Reminders of the desperation are never far away. An armored truck driven by hospital leaders passes by hundreds of mud pies baking in the harsh sun to fill the stomachs of people who can’t afford food. Black spray-painted “G9” tags dot nearby buildings, a warning of who's in charge.

            In a February report, the U.N. documented 263 murders between July and December in just the small area surrounding the hospital, noting that violence has “severely hampered"" access to health services.

            That was the case for 34-year-old Millen Siltant, a street vendor who sits in a hospital hallway waiting for a checkup, her hands nervously clutching medical paperwork over her pregnant belly.

            Nearby, hospital staff play with nearly 20 babies and toddlers — orphans whose parents were killed in the gang wars.

            Normally, Siltant would travel an hour across the city by colorful buses known as tap-taps for her prenatal checkups at Fontaine. There she would join other pregnant women waiting for exams and mothers cradling malnourished children in line for weigh-ins.

            All the clinics in the area where she lives have closed, she said. For two months last year she couldn't leave the house because gangs holding the city hostage made travel through the dusty, winding streets nearly impossible.

            “Some days, there’s no transportation because there’s no fuel,” she said. “Sometimes there’s a shooting on the street and you spend hours unable to go outside … Now I’m worried because the doctor says I need to get a C-section.”

            Health care providers told the Associated Press that the crisis has caused more bullet and burn wounds. It has also fueled an uptick in less predictable conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and sexually transmitted infections, largely because of slashed access to primary care.

            Pregnant women are disproportionately affected. Gynecologist Phalande Joseph sees the repercussions every day when she leaves her hospital dormitory and pulls on her light blue scrubs.

            The young Haitian doctor snaps on a pair of white surgical gloves and makes an incision into a pregnant patient's belly with a steady hand that only comes with practice.

            She works swiftly, conversing with medical staff in her native Creole, when a burst of wailing erupts from a baby girl nurses swaddle in pink blankets.

            Operations like these have grown more common, Joseph explains in between C-sections, because the very conditions that have intensified amid the turmoil can turn a pregnancy from high risk to deadly.

            This year, 10,000 pregnant women in Haiti could face fatal obstetric complications due to the crisis, according to U.N. data.

            Those risks are only compounded by the fact that many of Joseph's patients are sexual violence survivors or widows whose husbands were killed by gangs. Permeating the struggle is an air of fear.

            ""If they start having contractions at 3 a.m., they are terribly scared of coming here because it is too early, and they are scared something might happen to them because of the gangs,"" Joseph said. “Many times when they arrive, the baby is already suffering, and it is too late so we need to do C-section.""

            That became most evident to Joseph last October when four men came rushing to a hospital carrying a woman giving birth stretched out on top of a door. Because of gang lockdowns, the woman couldn't find any transportation to the hospital after her water broke.

            “These four men were not even her family. They found her delivering on the street ... When I heard she lost the baby, it shook me,” she said. “The situation in my country is so bad, and there is not much we can do about it.”

            Started as a one-room clinic to provide basic medical services to a community with no other resources, Fontaine Hospital Center was opened in 1991 by Jose Ulysse.

            Ulysse and his family have worked to expand the hospital year after year. They fight to keep their doors open, Ulysse said.

            Even when firefights arrive at the doors of Fontaine, the hospital reopens few hours later. If it were to close for longer, administrators worry that it could lose momentum and would be hard to reopen.

            Today, it's the only facility to perform C-sections and other high-level surgeries in Cité Soleil.

            Because most of the people in the area live in extreme poverty, the hospital charges little to nothing to patients even as it struggles to purchase advanced medical equipment with funds from UNICEF and other international aid providers. Between 2021 and 2022, the facility saw a 70% jump in the number of patients.

            The hospital possesses a certain level of protection because it accepts all patients.

            “We don’t pick sides. If the two groups face off, and they arrive at the hospital like any other person, we treat them,” Jean Baptiste said.

            Even the gangs understand the importance of medical care, he added. Yet the walls still feel like they're closing in.

            Rising carjackings of medical vehicles have made it impossible for Fontaine to invest in an ambulance. When ambulance operators are called from areas like Cité Soleil, they offer a simple response: “Sorry, we can’t go there.”

            Fontaine’s mobile clinic can now travel little more than a few blocks outside the facility's walls.

            Doctors worry, but they keep working, just as they've always done.

            “You say, well, I have to work. So let God protect me,” Jean Baptiste said. “As this situation gets worse, we go out and decide to face the risks. … We have to keep pushing forward.”PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — When machine gun fire erupts outside the barbed-wire fences surrounding Fontaine Hospital Center, the noise washes over a cafeteria full of tired, scrub-clad medical staff.And no one bats an eye.Gunfire is part of daily life here in Cité Soleil – the most densely populated part of the Haitian capital and the heart of Port-au-Prince’s gang wars.As gangs tighten their grip on Haiti, many medical facilities in the Caribbean nation's most violent areas have closed, leaving Fontaine as one of the last hospitals and social institutions in one of the world's most lawless places.“We’ve been left all alone,” said Loubents Jean Baptiste, the hospital's medical director.Fontaine can mean the difference between life and death for hundreds of thousands of people just trying to survive, and it offers a small oasis of calm in a city that has descended into chaos.The danger in the streets complicates everything: When gangsters with bullet wounds show up at the gates, doctors ask them to check their automatic weapons at the door as if they were coats.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822415,Afridi and Fakhar star in Lahore's big win over Peshawar,"LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) — Shaheen Shah Afridi took five wickets and Lahore Qalandars' top-order scored heavily as the defending champions beat Peshawar Zalmi by 40 runs in the Pakistan Super League on Sunday.

            Tayyab Tahir earlier made an impressive debut in the PSL with a half century that lifted Karachi Kings to a 66-run victory over first-place Multan Sultans, which was playing its first away game this season after winning four home matches.

            In a record-breaking PSL game — with 28 sixes — Afridi (5-40) dominated with his left-arm swing bowling after Fakhar Zaman (96), Abdullah Shafique (75) and Sam Billings (47 not out) had propelled Lahore to 241-3.











            Afridi won the much-awaited PSL duel against one of the world’s best batters, Peshawar captain Babar Azam (7), as he clean bowled Pakistan's all-format skipper with a sharp delivery that cut back and knocked over the stumps.

            But Tom Kohler-Cadmore (55) and Saim Ayub (51) both hit brisk half centuries and took Peshawar to 119-1 midway through their chase.

            However, both batters fell in successive overs with Kohler-Cadmore chipping an easy catch to Afridi at mid-off against Haris Rauf’s slower delivery, and Saim was brilliantly snapped by a diving Abdullah in the deep off Rashid Khan.

            Fast bowler Zaman Khan (2-28) then ended Peshawar’s slim hopes with the wickets of Bhanuka Rajapaksa (24) and Rowman Powell (20) in one over before Afridi grabbed three wickets in his two-over return spell to restrict Peshawar to 201-9 in its 20 overs.

            Earlier, Peshawar fast bowler Wahab Riaz (2-45) bowled brilliantly in the powerplay and gave away only seven runs in his two overs that restricted Lahore to 36-1 before Fakhar and Abdullah cut loose and combined in a 120-run stand.

            Riaz broke that stand when Abdullah, playing his first game this season, was caught at deep point. However, Fakhar continued the acceleration as he smashed 10 sixes and three fours before missing out on a century by giving an easy catch in the covers in the 18th over.

            Billings had an escape early in his whirlwind knock when Lahore didn’t go for a caught-behind television referral. TV replays suggested the batter had gloved James Neesham’s short ball to the wicketkeeper.

            With its third win in four games, third-place Lahore is behind Islamabad United on net run-rate. Peshawar slipped to fifth in the six-team league on net run-rate behind Karachi, which has four points from six matches after a massive win against Multan.

            Tayyab’s brilliant 65 off 46 balls propelled Karachi to 167-3 as he shared a 109-run stand with Matthew Wade, who made a nearly run-a-ball 46.

            Multan was bowled out for 101 in 16.3 overs with Shoaib Malik (3-16) and left-arm South African spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3-18) doing most of the damage.

            James Vince provided Karachi with a whirlwind start by smashing two sixes and three fours in his blistering knock of 27 off 12 balls before he skied a catch to David Miller at mid-on after Multan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss and elected to field.

            Tayyab and Wade then raised a century stand before both perished in fast bowler Ihsanullah’s return spell in the late overs. 

            Ihsanullah, the leading wicket-taker in the tournament, raised his tally to 14 in six games when he had Tayyab trapped leg before wicket off a delivery that slanted into the right-hander before uprooting Wade’s offstump with a pacey ball that was clocked at 151.4 kph.

            Rizwan (29) and Shan Masood (25) provided Multan with a steady start of 41 off 30 balls before Karachi went for a successful referral against Masood after he edged fast bowler Akif Javed and the umpire ruled in the batter’s favor.

            Malik had in-form Rilee Rossouw (7) clean bowled before holding onto a catch at mid-on as Miller (7) tried a big hit against Shamsi.

            Tayyab then grabbed a stunning flying catch at point to dismiss Rizwan, who tried to play Malik on the leg side but got a leading edge in the 11th over. 

            Multan lost its last seven wickets for 31 runs against some disciplined Karachi bowling.

However, Fakhar continued the acceleration as he smashed 10 sixes and three fours before missing out on a century by giving an easy catch in the covers in the 18th over.Billings had an escape early in his whirlwind knock when Lahore didn’t go for a caught-behind television referral. TV replays suggested the batter had gloved James Neesham’s short ball to the wicketkeeper.With its third win in four games, third-place Lahore is behind Islamabad United on net run-rate. Peshawar slipped to fifth in the six-team league on net run-rate behind Karachi, which has four points from six matches after a massive win against Multan.TAYYAB IMPRESSESTayyab’s brilliant 65 off 46 balls propelled Karachi to 167-3 as he shared a 109-run stand with Matthew Wade, who made a nearly run-a-ball 46.Multan was bowled out for 101 in 16.3 overs with Shoaib Malik (3-16) and left-arm South African spinner Tabraiz Shamsi (3-18) doing most of the damage.James Vince provided Karachi with a whirlwind start by smashing two sixes and three fours in his blistering knock of 27 off 12 balls before he skied a catch to David Miller at mid-on after Multan captain Mohammad Rizwan won the toss and elected to field.Tayyab and Wade then raised a century stand before both perished in fast bowler Ihsanullah’s return spell in the late overs.Ihsanullah, the leading wicket-taker in the tournament, raised his tally to 14 in six games when he had Tayyab trapped leg before wicket off a delivery that slanted into the right-hander before uprooting Wade’s offstump with a pacey ball that was clocked at 151.4 kph.Rizwan (29) and Shan Masood (25) provided Multan with a steady start of 41 off 30 balls before Karachi went for a successful referral against Masood after he edged fast bowler Akif Javed and the umpire ruled in the batter’s favor.Malik had in-form Rilee Rossouw (7) clean bowled before holding onto a catch at mid-on as Miller (7) tried a big hit against Shamsi.Tayyab then grabbed a stunning flying catch at point to dismiss Rizwan, who tried to play Malik on the leg side but got a leading edge in the 11th over.Multan lost its last seven wickets for 31 runs against some disciplined Karachi bowling.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822419,Belarus leader and Putin ally Lukashenko to visit China,"BEIJING (AP) — Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader, will visit Beijing this week, China's Foreign Ministry said, as U.S. concerns grow that China is considering providing military aid to Russia. 

            Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko is due to visit Tuesday through Thursday, but gave no details about his agenda. 

            Belarus has strongly backed Moscow and allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for the initial invasion of Ukraine a year ago. 











            Lukashenko has been Belarus' only president since the position was created in 1994, and crushed 2020 protests over his disputed reelection in a vote that the opposition and Western countries regard as fraudulent. 

            The visit comes as top U.S. officials repeated warnings to China against providing military aid to Russia in its war on Ukraine, saying that would bring heavy consequences. 

            CIA Director William Burns repeated those earlier statements in an interview due to be broadcast on American channel CBS on Sunday, saying, “We’re confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment."" 

            However, Burns added, “We also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment.” 

            Providing such aid “would be a very risky and unwise bet,"" he said. 

            
                Beijing claims to have a neutral stance in the war that began one year ago, but has also said it has a “no limits friendship” with Russia and has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion or even call it that. It has accused the West of provoking the conflict and “fanning the flames” by providing Ukraine with defensive arms. 

            It has accused the U.S. of smearing it over the military aid allegations and reiterated that it seeks only peace between Russia and Ukraine. 

            Beijing on Friday issued a proposal calling for a cease-fire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy cautiously welcomed China's involvement -- but said success would depend on actions not words.

            The plan released by China’s Foreign Ministry mainly reiterated long-held positions, and analysts said Beijing would be an unlikely broker given its close ties to Russia and unwavering stance over the conflict. 

            However, some observers warned that Ukraine and its allies need to tread carefully, saying that rejection of what China sees as its peace overture could move Beijing closer toward providing arms to Russia instead.

            Chinese President Xi Jinping is believed to be preparing to visit Russia sometime in the coming months.BEIJING (AP) — Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus and a close ally of the Russian leader, will visit Beijing this week, China's Foreign Ministry said, as U.S. concerns grow that China is considering providing military aid to Russia.Spokesperson Hua Chunying said Lukashenko is due to visit Tuesday through Thursday, but gave no details about his agenda.Belarus has strongly backed Moscow and allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for the initial invasion of Ukraine a year ago.Lukashenko has been Belarus' only president since the position was created in 1994, and crushed 2020 protests over his disputed reelection in a vote that the opposition and Western countries regard as fraudulent.The visit comes as top U.S. officials repeated warnings to China against providing military aid to Russia in its war on Ukraine, saying that would bring heavy consequences.CIA Director William Burns repeated those earlier statements in an interview due to be broadcast on American channel CBS on Sunday, saying, “We’re confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment.""However, Burns added, “We also don’t see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don’t see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment.”Providing such aid “would be a very risky and unwise bet,"" he said.Beijing claims to have a neutral stance in the war that began one year ago, but has also said it has a “no limits friendship” with Russia and has refused to criticize Moscow’s invasion or even call it that.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822434,Sabres place Tuch on IR; Dahlin ruled out against Capitals,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Sabres’ playoff push hit a speed bump on Sunday, with top-line forward Alex Tuch and top defenseman Rasmus Dahlin ruled out from playing against the Washington Capitals.

            Tuch was placed on injured reserve and will miss at least two weeks with a lower-body injury, general manager Kevyn Adams said before the game. Dahlin, a Norris Trophy candidate, is considered day to day and requires resting an injury he’s been playing through, Adams said.

            Without revealing the nature of the players’ injuries, Adams said Tuch does not require surgery and is projected to return before the end of the season.











            Tuch was hurt in the third period of a 3-1 win at the Florida Panthers on Friday. 

            The 26-year-old Tuch has been a mainstay on a line centered by Tage Thompson and rounded out by Jeff Skinner, and he ranks second on the team with 28 goals and 62 points — both career highs. He had scored four goals in his past five games, including the game winner at Florida.

            “It’s a tough loss,” Adams said, referring to Tuch. ""We believe internally in what we have in our locker room. It’s opportunity for guys to kind of step in and play a bigger role. But yeah, it’s just a massive player in our lineup from everything he does, not just the offensive side, but you guys see the minutes he plays, the situations he plays.”

            The Sabres called up Vinnie Hinostroza from the minors to fill Tuch’s roster spot.

            Adams acknowledged that Tuch’s injury places what he called “urgency” on trade talks leading up to the NHL’s trade deadline on Friday.

            “The way I would say it, is we know these are critical games and just puts us in a position where we’re more open to things than maybe before, 48 hours ago,” Adams said. “It doesn’t change our plan or vision, but it just puts those conversations even more ... on the front burner.”

            Buffalo opened the day 30-23-4 and in a tightly contested race for the Eastern Conference’s two wild-card playoff berths as it tries to end an NHL-record 11-year postseason drought.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822435,CIA director: Putin too confident he can grind down Ukraine,"Wilmington, Del. (AP) — As the war in Ukraine enters its second year, CIA Director William Burns said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is being “too confident” in his military's ability to grind Ukraine into submission.

            Burns, in a television interview, said the head of Russia's intelligence services had displayed in their November meeting “a sense of cockiness and hubris” that reflected Putin's own beliefs “that he can make time work for him, that he believes he can grind down the Ukrainians that he can wear down our European allies, that political fatigue will eventually set in.” 

            That conversation, in which Burns warned of the consequences if Russia were to deploy a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, was “pretty dispiriting,” Burns said.











            Burns said he judged Putin as “quite determined” to continue prosecuting the war, despite the casualties, tactical shortcomings and economic and reputational damage to Russia.

            “I think Putin is, right now, entirely too confident of his ability ... to wear down Ukraine,” Burns told CBS' “Face the Nation” in an interview that aired Sunday. Burns said that “at some point, he’s going to have to face up to increasing costs as well, in coffins coming home to some of the poorest parts of Russia,” where he said many of the conscripts “being thrown as cannon fodder” are from.

            Burns also said Putin was underestimating U.S. resolve to support Ukraine, saying that it has been his experience that the Russian leader's view is that Americans have “attention deficit disorder and we'll move on to some other issue eventually.”

            The comments came at a critical juncture for the war as the Biden administration is “confident that the Chinese leadership is considering"" whether to provide “lethal” military equipment to Russia. 

            “It would be a very risky and unwise bet,” Burns said, adding that such a move could only further strain relations between the world's two largest economics. “That's why I hope very much that they don't.”

            Burns said China's leader, Xi Jinping, has closely watched how the war has evolved, and “I think, in many ways, he's been unsettled and sobered by what he's seen.” The CIA director spoke of “where Putin's hubris has now gotten Russia,” and said that in authoritarian systems, when “nobody challenges” a leader, “you can make some huge blunders.”

            Meanwhile, the question of military aid and the pace of the war is also a source of uncertainty in the U.S. as Republican lawmakers criticized the administration for not sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.

            White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the U.S. was providing Ukraine with the military aid needed to retake territory seized by Russia. The domestic politics of support for Ukraine are also complicated by some GOP members of Congress who say the administration should pull back and focus more on the needs at home.

            Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said planes and long-range artillery could help end the war on a faster timeline. ""This whole thing is taking too long,” McCaul said. “And it really didn't have to happen this way,” said McCaul, R-Texas.

            Ukraine won support last month from Baltic nations and Poland in its quest to obtain Western fighter jets, but there have been no signs that nations such as the U.S. and Britain will change their stance of refusing to provide warplanes to Kyiv. 

            Biden said in an ABC News interview on Friday that he’s “ruling it out for now,"" saying that they are not the weaponry that Ukrainians need in the near term.

            But Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said the White House has been slow in providing what Ukraine seeks, including jets. “That has been a pattern with this administration from the beginning, where they have slow-rolled critical military weapons systems,"" he said.

            Jake Sullivan said the U.S. is already providing parts to keep Ukraine's fleet of Soviet-era jets flying, but supplying F-16s “is really a question for another day, for another phase” of the war.

            Jake Sullivan appeared on NBC's “Meet the Press,” CNN's “State of the Union” and ABC's “This Week.” McCaul was on ABC and Dan Sullivan was on NBC.Wilmington, Del.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822439,Afghan refugees in Pakistan protest delay in US resettlement,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Hundreds of Afghan refugees facing extreme delays in the approval of U.S. visas protested in Pakistan's capital on Sunday, as an American program to help relocate at-risk Afghans fleeing Taliban rule stalls.

            The U.S. government's Priority 1 and Priority 2, known as P1 and P2 refugee programs were meant to fast track visas for at-risk Afghans including journalists and rights activists after the Taliban takeover in their homeland. Those eligible must have worked for the U.S. government, a U.S.-based media organization or nongovernmental organization in Afghanistan, and must be referred by the U.S.-based employer.

            Applicants have been waiting in Pakistan for more than one and a half years for U.S. officials to process their visa applications. The delay in approving visas and resettlement has left Afghan applicants in a highly vulnerable position as they contend with economic hardship and lack of access to health, education and other services in Pakistan.











            Mohammad Baqir Ahmadi, who said he'd helped to organize the protest outside of Pakistan's National Press Club in Islamabad, said many of the Afghans present were facing problems in extending visas to wait out the application process in Pakistan.

            Protesters said that applicants had yet to receive the preliminary interview necessary to begin the visa application process.

            “We, the holders of P1/P2 cases, your allies, and colleagues, played significant role toward expansion of democracy, human rights, and freedom of expression. We are currently asking for your support and companionship in the bad days of life,” read one banner held by Afghan demonstrators.

            Hesamuddin, an Afghan who is waiting on the processing of his P2 case, said authorities should evacuate Afghan P1 and P2 applicants to a country where the necessary resettlement support centers (RSC) are open and able to conduct interviews. “They must evacuate us to another country where RSCs are functioning and can process there,” he said.

            Under U.S. rules, applicants must first relocate to a third country for their cases to be processed, where it initially can take up to 14 to 18 months and cases are processed through the resettlement support centers.

            The Taliban retook power in Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew. Many Afghans sought to leave in the immediate aftermath of the Taliban takeover.

            But they have progressively imposed more restrictions, particularly on women. They have banned women and girls from schooling beyond the sixth grade, barred them from most jobs and demanded they cover their faces when outside.ISLAMABAD (AP) — Hundreds of Afghan refugees facing extreme delays in the approval of U.S. visas protested in Pakistan's capital on Sunday, as an American program to help relocate at-risk Afghans fleeing Taliban rule stalls.The U.S. government's Priority 1 and Priority 2, known as P1 and P2 refugee programs were meant to fast track visas for at-risk Afghans including journalists and rights activists after the Taliban takeover in their homeland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822441,Fleeing Nicaraguans a boon to economy back home,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Each month, Antón Martínez, 38, sets aside $200 from his wages as a dishwasher in the United States to send home to his mother in Nicaragua.

            Martínez wishes it could be more, but he’s still trying to find his footing in the new country and pay off the debt of his migration. His monthly contribution to family back home was part of a 50% surge in remittances to Nicaragua in 2022, a massive jump that analysts attribute to the thousands of Nicaraguans who emigrated to the U.S. in the past two years. 

            They have been leaving as the government intensifies a crackdown on opposition voices since early 2021, high global inflation slams families’ buying power and job opportunities remain limited at home.











            That swell of Nicaraguan arrivals to the U.S. was part of the reason the Biden administration announced in January that it would begin turning them away at the border if they did not first register online to make asylum petitions. Their numbers have dropped precipitously since.

            But Martínez, who arrived in late 2021, and others already there are keeping Nicaragua’s economy afloat with the more than $3.2 billion they sent home last year. 

            Last year’s huge jump, “can only be explained by the disproportionate increase in migrants,” Nicaraguan economist Enrique Sáenz said.

            Emigration “has become (President Daniel Ortega’s) main macroeconomic policy and his main social policy,” Saenz said.

            Ortega's increasingly authoritarian government has drawn sanctions from the U.S. government and Europe, but the measures have been targeted toward his inner circle and members of his administration to avoid adding more economic hardship for average Nicaraguans.

            Still, for the fiscal year ending last September, U.S. authorities recorded more than 163,000 encounters with Nicaraguans, more than three times the 2021 total. Encounters peaked in December with more than 35,000 and then plummeted to 3,377 in January.

            The reasons vary from a lack of economic opportunity to outright persecution of political opponents and voices of dissent. Ortega cracked down violently after popular protests broke out in April 2018. He ratcheted up the pressure in 2021 ahead of national elections.

            Earlier this month, he put 222 imprisoned opponents on a plane to Washington, saying he was sending the “terrorists” back to their foreign sponsor.

            Until last year, Costa Rica had been the primary destination for Nicaraguans in recent years. But the small neighboring country’s asylum system is overwhelmed, the wait now stretches years and its economy has struggled to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Costa Rica President Rodrigo Chaves tightened the generous asylum system in December, arguing that it was being abused by economic migrants.

            Those factors made the U.S. a more attractive destination despite the distance. Ortega blames the U.S. sanctions for the emigration. 

            In Martínez’s case, he left because he had participated in anti-government protests in 2018 and feared he could be arrested at any moment. “I miss my mother and I love Nicaragua, but there was nothing else to do. It was leave or be taken prisoner at some point.”

            Many others reached the same decision.

            Nicaragua’s government released data late last year showing that between Sept. 17 and Oct. 7, it issued 20,192 passports. In the capital, residents camped out on sidewalks just to get one of the limited numbers called each day to process a passport application.

            Sabrina Gazol Moncada, a 28-year-old college student who had to drop out to find work, left Nicaragua in October, the month after her husband travelled to the U.S. 

            “It’s a really difficult decision to make, because ultimately you are leaving your country, your family, the people who support you and love you,” she said. 

            Gazol moved north on buses, on foot and stuffed into semi-trailers with 200 others. After three weeks of often rough and frightening travel through Central America and Mexico, Gazol crossed the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas, turned herself over to Border Patrol and began the process to seek asylum.

            In Nicaragua, “people who are not with the Ortega regime are threatened and persecuted, there’s no freedom of expression,” she said. 

            She had not been able to send money home since arriving in the U.S., because she was still awaiting permission to work as she pursued asylum.

            “In Nicaragua, the government does what it wants and everybody is looking for a way out,” she said. “In the end, Nicaragua is going to be left without young people, it’s going to be a ghost country.”MEXICO CITY (AP) — Each month, Antón Martínez, 38, sets aside $200 from his wages as a dishwasher in the United States to send home to his mother in Nicaragua.Martínez wishes it could be more, but he’s still trying to find his footing in the new country and pay off the debt of his migration.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822442,Casinos and consulting? Pandemic spurs tribes to diversify,"MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) — When the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut for three months in 2020, its owners, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, had to reckon with decades of relying heavily on gambling as the tribe's main source of revenue.

            “The fact that the casino revenues went from millions to zero overnight just fully reiterated the need for diverse revenue streams,” said Tribal Chairman Rodney Butler. 

            The 1,000-member tribe has since expanded its efforts to get into the federal government contracting business, making it one of several tribal nations to look beyond the casino business more seriously after the coronavirus crisis. Tribal leaders and tribal business experts say the global pandemic has been the latest and clearest sign that tribal governments with casinos can't depend solely on slot machines and poker rooms to support future generations.











            In Michigan, the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, or Gun Lake Tribe, recently announced a 25-year plan to develop hundreds of acres near its casino into a corridor with housing, retail, manufacturing and a new 15-story hotel. A non-gambling entity owned by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, also in Michigan, is now selling “NativeWahl” burger franchises to other tribes after forming a 2021 partnership with Wahlburgers, the national burger chain created by the celebrity brothers Paul, Mark and Donnie Wahlberg. 

            Some tribes, with and without casinos, have gotten involved in a wide range of non-gambling businesses, such as trucking, construction, consulting, health care, real estate, cannabis and marketing over the past decade or longer while others have been branching out more recently.

            “While enterprise diversification can come with costs, its necessity became clear during the early phases of the pandemic, when tribally owned casinos were shut down to mitigate COVID-19 transmission and gaming-dependent tribes were left with little incoming revenue,” according to a new report from the Center for Indian Country Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. 

            The report found that many tribes are increasingly doing business with the federal government, especially the U.S. Department of Defense. 

            The Mashantucket Pequots' non-gambling entity, Command Holdings, last year made its largest acquisition to date: WWC Global, a Florida-based management consulting firm that predominantly works with federal agencies, including the defense and state departments. WWC announced in December that it had been awarded a $37.5 million contract supporting the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

            WWC Global CEO Jon Panamaroff applauded the Mashantucket Pequots' casino and hospitality business but noted that it can be subject to the “ups and downs of the market,” making it important to branch out economically. A member of the Sun’aq Tribe of Kodiak, Alaska, he credited the Mashantucket Pequots' tribal leaders with doubling down on diversification efforts during the pandemic instead of “shying away and trying to hunker down.”

            Butler said the tribe hopes non-gambling revenues, including from a planned family resort with a 91,000-square-foot (8,450-square-meter) water park that's expected to open in 2025, will eventually comprise 50% to 80% of the Mashantucket Pequots' portfolio, providing “stability and certainty” when another challenging event undoubtedly will happen. 

            “You think about the financial crisis in ’08 and now COVID. And so, something’s going to happen again,” Butler said. “We’ve learned from past mistakes, and we want to be ready for it in the future.”

            Even before the pandemic hit, some tribal casinos were already facing competitive pressures from the advent of other gambling options, including legalized online wagering on sports and casino games in some states. At the same time, traditional patrons of brick-and-mortar casinos are getting older.

            “Tribal economies are at an inflection point because gaming markets are maturing across the U.S.,” said Dawson Her Many Horses, head of Native American banking for Wells Fargo and an enrolled member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. “As casino revenues flatten, tribes will be looking for new business opportunities in other industries.”

            Terri Fitzpatrick, a member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation's chief real estate and global attraction officer, has noted “tremendous growth” in non-gambling-related tribal businesses over the last decade in Michigan. Most tribes within the state now engage in some form of economic development other than casinos. 

            The pandemic, Fitzpatrick said, really highlighted the importance of such a strategy, given the financial impact of COVID-19 on tribal schools, health care centers, assistance for older adults, day care programs and other services. 

            “It wasn’t about a loss of revenue,"" she said. “It was a loss of, ‘What we can do for our community and in our community.'” 

            The Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi in Michigan saw its successful casino shut down in the early months of the pandemic. But the financial blow was blunted in part by the tribe's non-gambling businesses, including a firm that's involved in drone development for the federal government and was deemed “essential.” 

            The tribe's economic development entity, Waséyabek Development Company LLC, now has mapped out a plan to generate at least one-third of the revenue needed to support the tribe from activities other than gambling by 2040, its president and CEO, Deidra Mitchell, said. 

            That doesn’t mean tribes are giving up on gambling. Some are even expanding it. The gambling and hospitality entity owned by the Mohegan Tribe in eastern Connecticut announced this month it is partnering with a New York developer to try and secure a New York City gambling license and build a proposed entertainment district in Manhattan's East Side. Meanwhile, the Chickasaw Nation in Oklahoma is part of another consortium that wants to build a casino and entertainment complex on New York's Coney Island.

            The National Indian Gaming Association reported in August that $39 billion in gross gambling revenue was generated in fiscal year 2021, the most in tribal gambling history. That figure, which accounts for 243 tribes across 29 states, increased 40% over the previous year.

            Patrick Davison, vice president of Native American gaming and finance at PNC Bank, said he’s been working with tribal officials who still want to build casinos but also want to avoid overbuilding. He said the pandemic was “a real eye-opener for tribes” as officials consider their tribes' futures in the gambling business.

            “There’s a lot more thought being put into it,” he said.MASHANTUCKET, Conn. (AP) — When the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut for three months in 2020, its owners, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, had to reckon with decades of relying heavily on gambling as the tribe's main source of revenue.“The fact that the casino revenues went from millions to zero overnight just fully reiterated the need for diverse revenue streams,” said Tribal Chairman Rodney Butler.The 1,000-member tribe has since expanded its efforts to get into the federal government contracting business, making it one of several tribal nations to look beyond the casino business more seriously after the coronavirus crisis. Tribal leaders and tribal business experts say the global pandemic has been the latest and clearest sign that tribal governments with casinos can't depend solely on slot machines and poker rooms to support future generations.In Michigan, the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians, or Gun Lake Tribe, recently announced a 25-year plan to develop hundreds of acres near its casino into a corridor with housing, retail, manufacturing and a new 15-story hotel. A non-gambling entity owned by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, also in Michigan, is now selling “NativeWahl” burger franchises to other tribes after forming a 2021 partnership with Wahlburgers, the national burger chain created by the celebrity brothers Paul, Mark and Donnie Wahlberg.Some tribes, with and without casinos, have gotten involved in a wide range of non-gambling businesses, such as trucking, construction, consulting, health care, real estate, cannabis and marketing over the past decade or longer while others have been branching out more recently.“While enterprise diversification can come with costs, its necessity became clear during the early phases of the pandemic, when tribally owned casinos were shut down to mitigate COVID-19 transmission and gaming-dependent tribes were left with little incoming revenue,” according to a new report from the Center for Indian Country Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.The report found that many tribes are increasingly doing business with the federal government, especially the U.S. Department of Defense.The Mashantucket Pequots' non-gambling entity, Command Holdings, last year made its largest acquisition to date: WWC Global, a Florida-based management consulting firm that predominantly works with federal agencies, including the defense and state departments. WWC announced in December that it had been awarded a $37.5 million contract supporting the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.WWC Global CEO Jon Panamaroff applauded the Mashantucket Pequots' casino and hospitality business but noted that it can be subject to the “ups and downs of the market,” making it important to branch out economically. A member of the Sun’aq Tribe of Kodiak, Alaska, he credited the Mashantucket Pequots' tribal leaders with doubling down on diversification efforts during the pandemic instead of “shying away and trying to hunker down.”Butler said the tribe hopes non-gambling revenues, including from a planned family resort with a 91,000-square-foot (8,450-square-meter) water park that's expected to open in 2025, will eventually comprise 50% to 80% of the Mashantucket Pequots' portfolio, providing “stability and certainty” when another challenging event undoubtedly will happen.“You think about the financial crisis in ’08 and now COVID.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822446,Iran releases Spanish woman jailed over Amini protests,"A Spanish woman imprisoned in Iran for three months on espionage charges after she was arrested during anti-government protests has been released, Spain's government said Sunday.Ana Baneira Suarez was 24 years old when she was arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) revealed at the time.""She was freed yesterday, but we didn't want to announce it publicly before her plane had taken off from Iran,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told journalists.""I was able to speak with her ... she is well,"" he said, adding she was on her way to northwestern Spain, where she is from.Albares said that another Spanish citizen, Santiago Sanchez Cogedor, was still in Iranian custody but that he hoped for his release soon.""Today is a happy day, but our happiness will be complete when Santiago is also freed,"" said Albares, referring to the football fan who was trying to walk to the World Cup in Qatar when he was detained in Iran.The Iranian government did not respond to requests for comment on Baneira's release.Suarez was detained during nationwide protests sparked by the death in custody of a young woman in September.Tehran has blamed ""foreign adversaries"" for the demonstrations that erupted after 22-year-old Kurdish woman Jina Mahsa Amini died while in custody following her arrest by Iran's morality police.Amid was accused of violating the strict dress code for women.The protests continued for several weeks despite a violent crackdown and this week, demonstrators hit the streets once again in the southeast of the country.In September, Tehran said nine Europeans had been arrested for their involvement in the protests.Last month, the European Union approved a fresh round of sanctions on the Iranian government over the protest crackdown.mm/jcg (AFP, Reuters)",2023/02/26,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822447,Germany: Food banks turn 30 with no end in sight,"The inspiration came from the United States. A member of a Berlin women's group had read an article about volunteers in New York who were distributing discarded groceries to homeless people. ""And then we thought, 'OK, we can do that too,'"" Sabine Werth told DW. ""We wanted to set a place at the table for those who otherwise couldn't afford it.""Together with fellow members of the group, called ""Initiativgruppe Berliner Frauen,"" she founded the first Tafel, as food banks are called in Germany, the name being one of the German words for ""table.""That was 30 years ago. The original food bank remains the largest in the country and has since become an independent registered association. And the idea spread rapidly: Today there are 936 Tafel food banks throughout Germany. Depending on how big the food banks are, the organizers go to supermarkets, local food retailers and bakeries several times a week, or even daily, to collect leftover food that is still good to eat, thus saving waste while supporting people suffering poverty.Sometimes, large supermarket chains also deliver their excess goods to the food banks in the evenings once or twice a week. The banks are then opened for people who first need to prove their need, for example, with a document from the social welfare office, before they can pick up things like apples, sausage and bread.""We follow the classic Robin Hood principle. We take from where there is too much and give to where it is needed. But we do it legally,"" said Werth smilingly.The food bank now serves a much wider variety of people than just those in the homeless community. It provides welcome relief to many single parents, pensioners needing a top-up and refugees. For such people, it is only when a little money can be shaved off the monthly food budget that other purchases are possible, such as a child's school exercise book or a visit to the movies.The umbrella organization for the food banks in Germany estimates that 2 million people visited them last year — a sharp increase, about 50%, compared with the year before. Despite Germany being one of the world's richest countries, 13.8 million people there were affected by or threatened with poverty in 2022. As a rule, poverty in Germany refers to relative rather than absolute poverty. People are not facing immediate starvation or freezing. But even so, poverty in Germany still means a lack of participation in society, children having hungry days without lunch, no holiday travel and inferior education.The food banks began as a way of saving food and alleviating hardship, but they have now become a gauge of poverty — or, as the chairperson of the national umbrella organization, Jochen Brühl, told DW, ""a seismograph for societal situations and developments."" He said that when the first Tafel opened in 1993, poverty was not yet a widely discussed topic in German society. According to him, the general tenor was that poverty did not exist in Germany: Whoever wanted to work, worked.""Fortunately, that sentiment has changed dramatically over the past 30 years,"" Sabine Werth said. ""There is no political party, no parliamentary group, nobody on the political scene who would say that there is no poverty in Germany.""Brühl says that this is partly down to the existence of food banks, with the fact that there is one in almost every city making poverty very tangible.A visit to one of the many food banks in Germany quickly provides a sense of this. In Eitorf, a village near Bonn, Paul Hüsson gives a tour of the food bank he runs with 56 volunteers. With a touch of noticeable pride, he leads the way to the courtyard where goods are distributed on Mondays and Tuesdays, and opens a small warehouse where bags of pasta, packets of flour and tins of vegetables are stacked. It does not take long for Hüsson to become political. He maintains that welfare payments are too low, and says that the €9 ($9.50) monthly public transport ticket, a pilot project that ran throughout Germany from June to August 2022, was a blessing for those with little money.The food banks often intervene in sociopolitical debates — and that is intentional. ""If we are genuinely engaging with these issues, that automatically makes us political,"" said Brühl. ""Not in the sense of being affiliated with any particular political party. But we have influence at a sociopolitical level because we hold up a mirror to society and show what is obviously not working in some places."" Or, as Sabine Werth puts it succinctly at the door to the Tafel in Berlin: ""'Food is political.""Hüsson explained that he himself had much to learn about how complex poverty is. Currently, half the clients of his food bank are children. ""That cuts deep,"" he said, pointing toward his heart.Ever since the food banks formed, there has also been criticism, with some saying they make things too easy for the state and people in need. What becomes clear in conversations with food bank volunteers and leaders, however, is that they expressly do not want to be a part of the government social welfare system.All of them emphasize that it is wrong for social welfare offices to send people to food banks when they say their monthly allowances are not enough. ""We are increasingly slipping into a situation where some are pricing us into our welfare system. But we do not want that, and we are vehemently opposed to it,"" said Brühl. In Berlin, said Sabine Werth, the food bank does not accept any financial support from the state for that reason, in order to maintain its independence.The past three years have been extremely challenging for the food banks. Inflation, the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic have caused considerable strain, with a 50% increase in people in need. Many of the institutions are at their limit, as Brühl notes. But despite this, they keep going, he says.At this 30-year milestone the food banks are reflecting on their development — from that first site in Berlin to hundreds throughout Germany, along with a sociopolitical advocacy role. But Sabine Werth waves aside the question of her vision for the next three decades. ""I never thought in those dimensions,"" she said. ""Thirty years ago, I never thought that we would be where we are now. Food bank work is full of new surprises every day.""Jochen Brühl says he thinks that the Tafel food banks' future is guaranteed. ""I believe food banks will reinvent themselves as needed,"" he says, because they always react to what is happening in society, not the other way around.Paul Hüsson in Eitorf is focused on practical concerns: He is trying to find new premises, as the current ones are slowly becoming too small. It looks as though food banks will still be needed in 30 years' time, even in affluent Germany.This article was originally written in German.",2023/02/26,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822453,Antetokounmpo won't play against Suns due to bruised quad,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo won’t play in the Milwaukee Bucks' game Sunday against the Phoenix Suns because of what the team is describing as a bruised right quadriceps.

            That means neither team will have its MVP available for the afternoon matchup. Kevin Durant remains out for Phoenix because of a sprained right medial collateral ligament and hasn’t played since Jan. 8, when he was still with the Brooklyn Nets.

            Antetokounmpo left the Bucks’ 128-99 victory over the Miami Heat on Friday in the first quarter after team officials said he knocked knees with an opposing player. The Bucks called it a right knee issue at the time, but the injury report for Sunday’s game lists the two-time MVP with a bruised right quad.











            “It’s enough where he can’t play today, but I think we’re also confident that this is just a fairly common occurrence in our league,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game. “You hit knees, you knock, sometimes it takes a day or two, and it’s really nothing more than that. The level of conversations have all been kind of along that line.”

            Budenholzer said Bobby Portis will start in place of Antetokounmpo.

            Antetokounmpo had started Friday’s game after a sprained right wrist caused him to leave Milwaukee’s 112-100 victory at Chicago on Feb. 16, which marked the Bucks’ last game before the All-Star break. Antetokounmpo played only 20 seconds in the All-Star Game and went to New York the next day to have the wrist examined, but he recovered from that injury quickly enough to play Friday.

            The Bucks also will be missing Wesley Matthews on Sunday for a second straight game due to a strained right calf. Pat Connaughton is available for the Bucks after missing the Heat game because of a sore left calf.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822455,"Beyond Kane, much uncertainty ahead of NHL trade deadline","The NHL's top contenders did not wait until the last minute to do their shopping before the trade deadline.

            
                League-leading Boston got bigger and tougher by adding Dmitry Orlov and Garnet Hathaway. Toronto got defensive by trading for Ryan O'Reilly. The Rangers answered their New York-rival Islanders' move for Bo Horvat by acquiring Vladimir Tarasenko — and they're not done yet.

            A handful of big moves already have been made around the league, including a few Sunday, and more are expected before the trade deadline Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern. Patrick Kane going from Chicago to the Rangers is the most highly anticipated deal on the docket, and yet plenty of uncertainty remains about what else will shake out.











            “I am certainly not going to predict where the market goes next,” Bruins general manager Don Sweeney said last week after making what could be his first big trade or his only big one. ""That’s for all teams, all 32 teams, to continue to discuss and those discussions will continue.”

            Discussions led to a flurry of trades Sunday. 

            
                San Jose traded winger Timo Meier to New Jersey, Tampa Bay gave Nashville a boatload for forward Tanner Jeannot, Stanley Cup champion Colorado reacquired veteran defenseman Jack Johnson in a trade with Chicago in exchange for Andreas Englund, St. Louis sent forward Ivan Barbashev to Vegas for 20-year-old prospect Zach Dean, and Dallas got 20-goal-scorer Evgenii Dadnov from Montreal for Denis Gurianov.

            More are ongoing around Kane, San Jose's Erik Karlsson, Arizona's Jakob Chychrun, Philadelphia's James van Riemsdyk and Washington's handful of pending free agents after the perennially contending Capitals went from buyers to sellers.

            Prices have been high on a lot of players, most notably Chychrun, who is the top player left to change places by the deadline.

            “I can see the marketplace taking towards the end of the week to sort out for some teams,” said Hart Levine of PuckPedia, a website that tracks the salary cap and player movement.

            WHAT ALREADY HAS HAPPENED

            The Islanders made their splash in late January, getting Horvat, a 30-goal scorer, from Vancouver and signing him to an eight-year extension. The Rangers, after the All-Star break in early February, got Tarasenko and big defenseman Niko Mikkola from St. Louis to start loading up to try to repeat or improve on their trip to the Eastern Conference final.

            ""You want to win, and you want to be a part of good hockey teams who can win,"" Mikkola said. “The whole team is good, and we can go deep. We all know that.”

            The Maple Leafs want to go deep, but they haven't won a playoff series since 2004 — before the NHL had a salary cap. Acquiring O'Reilly, a playoff MVP in 2019 when the Blues won the Stanley Cup, and tough depth forward Noel Acciari sets them up better for that pursuit, if their goaltending holds up.

            WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN

            
                The worst-kept secret in the sport is Kane's connection to the Rangers.

            After New York got Tarasenko, thinking the price for Meier or Kane would be too high, Kane said: “If things were going to happen ... that was a team that I was definitely looking at.”

            Not much of a poker face, but Kane has a full no-movement clause, meaning the three-time Cup champion who was league MVP in 2015-16 can choose where he wants to go. Rangers GM Chris Drury took care of his end of the money aspect Saturday by trading Vitali Kravtsov to Vancouver and waiving Jake Leschyshyn.

            And while Kane's name isn't being uttered around the Rangers, there's an uneasiness around them as the buzz seeps into the locker room.

            “It always does at this time of the year,” coach Gerard Gallant said. “It’s tough on some players. But at the end of the day, you’re trying to make your team better every day and that’s what management does.”

            Chychrun has been on the trade block since before last season, and the 24-year-old defenseman with two seasons left on his contract after this one figures to finally get dealt.

            WHAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN

            Sellers also are buying while still selling — mass hysteria. Well, not quite hysteria, but it's not as simple as the haves and the have-nots at this deadline.

            
                St. Louis, even after trading Tarasenko, Mikkola, O'Reilly, Acciari and Barbashev, could also be in the market for Chychrun or other players signed beyond this season. Same goes for Washington, which won the Cup in 2018 and has made the playoffs every year since 2014, but has been beset by injuries and other events that could end the streak.

            The Capitals sent Orlov and Hathaway to the Bruins and still could trade forwards Lars Eller, Conor Sheary and Marcus Johansson and defenseman Nick Jensen, Trevor van Riemsdyk and Erik Gustafsson, all of whom are pending free agents.

            “It’s a little bit emotional, and it’s not fun,” said Eller, who scored the Cup-clinching goal five years ago. ""Just try to stay in the moment, stay in the present.”

            Washington GM Brian MacLellan is certainly doing that. With Alex Ovechkin in pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's career goals record, the Capitals aren't going into a rebuild any time soon, and MacLellan already has foreshadowed taking the picks acquired and flipping them to win again as soon as next year.

            “While this season has proven challenging with injuries to our significant players, we are in a position to use some of our current assets to retool our club and build a competitive team moving forward,” he said.

            That could even start before the deadline.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822457,Australia wins Women's T20 World Cup for 3rd straight title,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Australia won the Women's T20 World Cup on Sunday, beating host South Africa by a comfortable 19 runs to underline its status as the best team in the world with a third straight title.

            Australia has now won six of the eight T20 World Cups played.

            The latest victory at Newlands came through a disciplined bowling and fielding effort from the Australians, who batted first and scored 156-6, then shut down South Africa's batters, who never came close.











            South Africa finished well short on 137-6.

            “We felt like it was a good score but we had to bowl well,” Australia captain Meg Lanning said. “We had to put pressure on South Africa. It was about enjoying the process and do what we were doing, about keeping things simple when the pressure is on. Thoroughly enjoyed it.”

            Lanning has now led Australia to four T20 World Cup titles and one ODI World Cup title, more ICC tournament wins than any other captain in men's or women's cricket.

            Megan Schutt, Ashleigh Gardner, Darcie Brown and Jess Jonassen all took a wicket each for Australia, but it was a team effort in the field as the Aussies' big-match temperament shone through.

            Australia was playing in its seventh straight final.

            “You guys are very annoying,” South Africa captain Sune Luus said, jokingly, of Australia's all-conquering squad. “But congratulations to Meg and the team. You are setting the benchmark for other teams to live up to.”

            Australia's total was built on opener Beth Mooney's 74 from 53 balls and 29 off 21 from Gardner, who was promoted to No. 3.

            No one else got to the 20 mark for Australia but it was enough.

            Opener Laura Wolvaardt top-scored for South Africa with 61 from 48 but Australia's bowling was tight and disciplined throughout and the South Africans couldn't ever break free. The hosts only had a glimpse of a chance when they needed 59 off the last five overs with Wolvaardt still there.

            Her partnership of 55 with Chloe Tryon (25) threatened to lead to a late challenge from South Africa, but Schutt trapped Wolvaardt lbw in the 17th over to break that stand and South Africa's hopes of a first title in its first appearance in a final went with her.

            Tryon was out in the next over, two balls after cracking a six over long-on, and Australia closed it out, conceding just 39 runs off those last five overs.

The hosts only had a glimpse of a chance when they needed 59 off the last five overs with Wolvaardt still there.Her partnership of 55 with Chloe Tryon (25) threatened to lead to a late challenge from South Africa, but Schutt trapped Wolvaardt lbw in the 17th over to break that stand and South Africa's hopes of a first title in its first appearance in a final went with her.Tryon was out in the next over, two balls after cracking a six over long-on, and Australia closed it out, conceding just 39 runs off those last five overs.___More AP cricket: https://apnews.com/hub/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822458,Armani gives graceful close to Milan Fashion Week,"MILAN (AP) — It was nipples out on the Milan Fashion Week runway this season, one of the clear trends emerging from a week of previews of mostly womenswear collections for next fall and winter.

            Wherever there is a trend, there is always the counter-current, and holding out for what he described as “the dignity of women” was Giorgio Armani. Where sheer fabrics were employed in his collection, it was with modesty. 

            Armani's show closed out fashion week on Sunday. Here are highlights from the last day of live runway shows:











            TOMO KOIZUMI PUTS A SMILEY FACE ON FASHION

            With swirls of colored taffeta and satin gathered into crushed roses, Japanese designer Tomo Koizumi put a smiley face on a rainy Sunday morning.

            The exuberant looks were spasms of color fashioned into ruffles on a minidress constructed from stripes of knitwear, elaborate skirts with deep slits and dresses with southern belle silhouettes. These are occasion pieces that would be standouts on any red carpet, stage or party; imagine the lucky girl wearing one to prom. 

            The runway show was in collaboration with Dolce & Gabbana, which supplied textiles as well as handbags and shoes, Koizumi said. He turned a print from one of the Italian house's recent collections into a series of 3-D floral creations. 

            “I took inspiration from Dolce & Gabbana, and I also got powerful support, which allowed me to push myself even harder,’’ Koizumi said.

            Koizumi also put out there his dream: “To be hired by as creative director of a major fashion house.”

            GIORGIO ARMANI’S INTIMATE PEEK INSIDE

            Giorgio Armani once again gave the fashion world a glimpse of idealized life inside Milan’s stately palazzi, populated by women for whom dressing in comfort and style are not a contradiction. 

            Satiny loungewear in soothing earthy tones skimmed the form and were grounded in more structured pieces, such as leather motorcycle jackets or contrasting black vests. The looks were elegantly layered, with long dresses over a translucent ribbed trouser suggesting lingerie. 

            Where sheer fabrics were employed, it was with modesty, for example, over dark tights, and with a bandeau top of velvet. 

            Beaded fringe, velvet bows and a flower motif underlined the femininity in the collection. And before the Armani woman walks out into the street, one last touch of face powder … 

            Armani said the collection is about “the dignity of women, dressed with a lot of care and attention, and who take pleasure in dressing.”

            CHECKMATE FOR FRANCESCA LIBERATORE

            Italian designer Francesca Liberatore conceived her show, featuring a collaboration with the Errea sportswear brand, around a chess game, a comment on the state of the world on many fronts. 

            Eight Black models walked the runway and took their places on a chessboard laid out in the center of the showroom. Next came eight white models, who faced off from the other side. 

            “It is exactly because of the situation that we are living that for me it is essential to have an eye on fairness,’’ Liberatore said backstage. ""And there is nothing like a game to even out situations.”

            The first 16 models, who represented the pawns, were followed by the rooks, two with big bouffant hair styles to represent the castle shape. The knights wore long extensions to embody horse tails, while the bishops had hoods pulled over their hair. 

            Women took the roles of both king and the queen, and walked hand in hand in stately fashion to their spots on the board. Raised collars denoted the kings, sweeping trains the queens. 

            The Erra collaboration underpinned the looks, including track jackets, stretch tops and leggings in medieval patterns. Liberatore layered the sportswear with draped or half-pleated mini-skirts, tailored jackets, striped and ribbed knitwear and flowing overcoats in the way of an unselfconscious youth mixing style and comfort. 

            ""For me, the chessboard also represented the idea of teamwork,'' the designer said. 

            DIVERSITY DISPLAYED AT TRADE FAIR

            White Milano, the premiere womenswear trade fair held alongside Milan Fashion Week, worked with the Fashion Minority Alliance to feature two Black designers as they promoted a conversation around diversity. 

            U.S. designer Romeo Hunte and Nigerian-Scottish designer Olubuyi Thomas look to their environments for inspiration, and both are keen on garments that can be transformed to serve multiple purposes. 

            Hunte draws on his Brooklyn-roots for his luxury fashion brand with the six square-dot logo, built around deconstructing garments and oversized proportions to give a modern touch. His trademarks include zipper features that allow a trench to shorten and go sleeveless, giving longer life and flexibility to the outerwear. 

            The Milan showcase gave him the opportunity to connect his 10-year-old brand with international clients. “It means a lot to me. Me being here will open the way for younger designers as well,” the designer said. 

            Hunte’s designs have been worn by Michelle Obama and Jennifer Hudson, and he recently did a collaboration with Tommy Hilfiger, whom he called his mentor.

            Thomas seamlessly combines his Scottish upbringing with his native Nigeria because “that’s who I am.” He sources materials in both countries, including hand-woven tartans he designs and Nigerian textiles with cutouts and contrast stitching. One tartan skirt on display at White featured plaid in the back, with black pleating in the front (or vice versa), giving choice. 

            “I love working on garments that are modular, depending on who are you are, and what day it is,’’ Thomas said. 

            He is the only designer commissioned to produce his own tartan for an exhibit on the traditional plaid at an upcoming exhibition at the V&A Dundee, Scotland’s design museum.

            CHINESE BRAND ANNAKIKI'S SENSE OF DOOM

            Chinese designer Anna Yang infused her latest ANNAKIKI collection with a sense of doom from the multiple disasters humankind has faced in recent years, from the coronavirus pandemic to the war in Ukraine. 

            Yang could not travel to Milan Fashion Week because of visa issues, but her collection and new techniques did the talking for her. She brought out a sense of pessimism in raw leather and burned the edges of an ample tulle dress, achieving a dramatic effect.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822459,6N: Four-try France holds off Scotland comeback to win 32-21,"PARIS (AP) — Six Nations defending champion France bounced back from losing to Ireland by holding off Scotland 32-21 at home Sunday to end Scottish hopes of a Grand Slam.

            Tries from flyhalf Romain Ntamack, left winger Ethan Dumortier and fullback Thomas Ramos had France 19-0 ahead with as many minutes on the clock.

            Two tries from center Huw Jones saw the Scots rally to 22-14. A Ramos penalty gave France some breathing space until playmaker Finn Russell — who was causing problems with his slick offloads — spotted a gap for a converted try to move the Scots within four points with 10 minutes left.











            France was creaking but Scotland botched an attacking lineout to give away possession and let the French off the hook. The relief was immense at Stade de France when veteran center Gael Fickou went over right at the end for a bonus-point fourth try, converted by Ramos.

            France coach Fabien Galthié drew on the positives.

            “We managed to get the bonus point and we took five points, they took none. We lost in Ireland and our watchword was falling down and rising back up,” he said. “That's what this game was about.”

            Both sides were down to 14 men after 12 minutes for high tackles.

            “We became a bit tense, lost our way a bit (after the red card),” Galthié said. “There were ups-and-downs.”

            Ntamack had already scored in the fifth minute when lock Grant Gilchrist was red-carded two minutes later for a high tackle on Anthony Jelonch, while recalled France prop Mohamed Haouas saw red for appearing to target scrumhalf Ben White's head. Such indiscipline could cost Haouas a place in Galthié's World Cup squad later this year.

            Haouas is the only France player with two red cards and his other was also against Scotland, at Murrayfield in 2020 in a match France lost.

            But his red card doesn't hide the fact that France's game — which is trying to play a more possession-based style demanded by Galthié — is not flowing like it was when it won the Grand Slam last year.

            France ended 2022 with last-gasp wins at home to Australia and world champion South Africa, and then opened the Six Nations with a patchy and error-strewn 29-24 victory in Italy. 

            All three of those matches could have gone either way — like the Scotland game — and Ireland punished the hesitant French when they won 32-19 in Dublin two weeks ago.

            “Given the start we made (against Scotland) we should have controlled the game better and shouldn’t have put ourselves under pressure,” France captain and scrumhalf Antoine Dupont said. “We lacked control, especially in the way we cleared the ball from our camp. It almost proved costly for us.""

            But France still creates plenty of scoring chances.

            Within less than 60 seconds of Gilchrist's sending off, France had its second try as the tournament newcomer Dumortier was fed by Ntamack in the corner. Ramos scored from nearly the other end of the field after intercepting Russell's pass and converted his own try.

            The Scots didn't wilt and hit back in the 26th when Jones burst through for a converted score, shortly after powerful winger Duhan van der Merwe had a try in the corner ruled out following a video review.

            A Ramos penalty sent France in 22-7 at the break, but Jones rolled over for his second try within 10 minutes of the restart after being set up by fellow midfielder Sione Tuipulotu's pass inside.

            Scotland took maximum points against England and Wales with wins from its opening two matches for the first time in 27 years. But defeat leaves Gregor Townsend five points behind Ireland ahead of their clash at Murrayfield.

            Second-place Scotland, England and France have 10 points.

            Galthié's side faces another tough test next when it takes on England at Twickenham.

            “We haven't given up our trophy yet,” he said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822471,Group: 22 Syrian migrants on hunger strike in Libyan prison,"CAIRO (AP) — At least 22 Syrian migrants detained for more than five months in Libya began a hunger strike Monday to demand their release, a Libyan rights group said.

            The group of migrants included three minors and have been held in a prison in the western town of Zawiya in appalling conditions, the group Belaady said. They were detained in October in the town of Ajaylat, which is some 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of the capital of Tripoli, said activist Tarik Lamloum.

            A spokesman for the government in Tripoli didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.











            The migrants arrived in Libya last year on a flight by private Syrian airline Cham Wings which operates routes to eastern Libya, Lamloum said. “They entered the country legally and have all needed documents and stamps on their passports,” he said.

            They then moved to western Libyan where they were detained as part of a crackdown on migrants. A court in Ajaylat ordered their deportation after paying a fine of 600 Libyan dinars (around $125) each, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press.

            Rights group Belaady said the Correction and Rehabilitation Institution in Zawiya, known as Jodeddaim Prison, is overseen by the Justice Ministry unlike other detention centers for migrants run by the Interior Ministry. The group, which visited the prison twice this year, said the detainees have suffered from scabies and other skin diseases. 

            Belaady called for the release of the migrants from prison and that they not be deported to Syria, where civil war has raged for over a decade.

            Thousands of African and Middle Eastern people arrive every year in Libya which has become a major transit point for migrants seeking a better life in Europe. The North African nation descended into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed long-time dictator Gadhafi in 2011.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822472,UK and EU leaders to meet amid hope of Brexit trade spat fix,"LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen are set to hold face-to-face talks, with expectations high they will seal a deal to resolve a thorny post-Brexit trade dispute.

            That would mark a breakthrough after months of bitter wrangling that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and and threatened to set back Northern Ireland's decades-old peace process.

            In a joint statement on Sunday the U.K. and the EU said European Commission President von der Leyen will travel to Britain on Monday so the leaders can work towards ""shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.”











            Sunak’s office set out a tightly choreographed agenda for Monday suggesting a deal is all but done. It said the leaders’ lunchtime “final talks” would be followed by a meeting of the U.K. Cabinet, then, if there is a deal, by a joint news conference and a statement by Sunak to the House of Commons.

            U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said earlier Sunday that the two sides were on the “cusp” of striking an agreement over trade rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.

            Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.

            Instead there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. 

            The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Ireland’s Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten.

            Relations between the U.K. and the EU, severely tested during years of Brexit wrangling, chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The British government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. The bloc accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.

            The mood between London and Brussels improved after Sunak, a pragmatic Brexit supporter, took office in October, replacing more belligerent predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.

            Striking a deal would let Sunak “get Brexit done” in a way that eluded Johnson, who won a landslide election victory on that very slogan in 2019, three years after British voters narrowly opted in a referendum to leave the bloc.

            Johnson did lead the U.K. out of the now 27-nation EU in 2020, but with a divorce deal that left Northern Ireland still bound to some EU rules and standards in a way that caused headaches for businesses and upset Northern Ireland’s delicate political balance.

            U.K. and EU negotiators have been inching towards a solution during weeks of intense talks, but any deal with the bloc carries political risk for Sunak. Hints of compromise towards the EU have sparked opposition from hard-line euroskeptics in Sunak’s governing Conservative Party, including Johnson.

            The DUP also has warned it will oppose any deal that does not meet its demand for “significant, substantive change.”

            A deal is likely to remove customs checks on the vast majority of goods moving between the U.K. and Northern Ireland.

            The thorniest issue is the role of the European Court of Justice in resolving any disputes that arise over the rules. Britain and the EU agreed in their Brexit divorce deal to give the European court that authority, but the DUP and Conservative Brexiteers insist the court must have no jurisdiction in U.K. matters.

            Sunak insisted a deal would meet unionist demands.

            “As someone who believes in Brexit, voted for Brexit, campaigned for Brexit, I want to demonstrate that Brexit works and it works for every part of the United Kingdom,” he told the Sunday Times.

            “There’s unfinished business on Brexit and I want to get the job done.”

            Follow AP's coverage of Brexit at https://apnews.com/hub/brexit and of British politics at https://apnews.com/hub/british-politicsLONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Union leader Ursula von der Leyen are set to hold face-to-face talks, with expectations high they will seal a deal to resolve a thorny post-Brexit trade dispute.That would mark a breakthrough after months of bitter wrangling that has soured U.K.-EU relations, sparked the collapse of the Belfast-based regional government and and threatened to set back Northern Ireland's decades-old peace process.In a joint statement on Sunday the U.K. and the EU said European Commission President von der Leyen will travel to Britain on Monday so the leaders can work towards ""shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.”Sunak’s office set out a tightly choreographed agenda for Monday suggesting a deal is all but done. It said the leaders’ lunchtime “final talks” would be followed by a meeting of the U.K. Cabinet, then, if there is a deal, by a joint news conference and a statement by Sunak to the House of Commons.U.K. Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said earlier Sunday that the two sides were on the “cusp” of striking an agreement over trade rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.Northern Ireland is the only part of the U.K. that shares a border with an EU member, the Republic of Ireland. When the U.K. left the bloc in 2020, the two sides agreed to keep the Irish border free of customs posts and other checks because an open border is a key pillar of Northern Ireland’s peace process.Instead there are checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. That angered British unionist politicians in Belfast, who say the new trade border in the Irish Sea undermines Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.The Democratic Unionist Party collapsed Northern Ireland’s Protestant-Catholic power-sharing government a year ago in protest and has refused to return until the rules are scrapped or substantially rewritten.Relations between the U.K. and the EU, severely tested during years of Brexit wrangling, chilled still further amid disputes over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The British government introduced a bill that would let it unilaterally rip up parts of the Brexit agreement, a move the EU called illegal. The bloc accused the U.K. of failing to honor the legally binding treaty it had signed.The mood between London and Brussels improved after Sunak, a pragmatic Brexit supporter, took office in October, replacing more belligerent predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.Striking a deal would let Sunak “get Brexit done” in a way that eluded Johnson, who won a landslide election victory on that very slogan in 2019, three years after British voters narrowly opted in a referendum to leave the bloc.Johnson did lead the U.K. out of the now 27-nation EU in 2020, but with a divorce deal that left Northern Ireland still bound to some EU rules and standards in a way that caused headaches for businesses and upset Northern Ireland’s delicate political balance.U.K. and EU negotiators have been inching towards a solution during weeks of intense talks, but any deal with the bloc carries political risk for Sunak.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822473,"'Cocaine Bear' gets high with $23.1M, 'Ant-Man' sinks fast","NEW YORK (AP) — The gonzo R-rated horror comedy “Cocaine Bear"" sniffed up $23.1 million in its opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, while Marvel's “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” shrank unusually quickly in its second weekend. 

            
                “Quantumania” was still No. 1 with an estimated $32.2 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters. But the “Ant-Man” sequel, hit with some of the worst reviews and audience scores of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dropped a steep 69.7% in its second weekend. That's the worst decline for an MCU film, falling faster than “Black Widow” (67.8%), a pandemic release that debuted simultaneously in homes. 

            Instead, Universal Pictures' “Cocaine Bear” rampaged through multiplexes, scoring notably above expectations. Made for about $35 million and directed by Elizabeth Banks, “Cocaine Bear” stirred up plenty of buzz just from its title and its made-to-go-viral trailer. 











            “Cocaine Bear,"" scripted by Jimmy Warden and produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse,"" “The Lego Movie”), managed to turn a bizarre true-life tale into a tongue-in-cheek box office hit. It's based on the real story of a 175-pound (79-kilogram) black bear who died in the Georgia mountains in 1985 after eating from a duffle bag of cocaine that had fallen from a smuggler's plane. (The smuggler, a former Kentucky narcotics investigator, parachuted to his death in Tennessee.) 

            The trailer for “Cocaine Bear,” which played ahead of the Super Bowl, was watched globally by more than 90 million, Universal said, and caught fire on social media. But transferring can-you-believe-that's-a-real-movie buzz to the box office doesn't always work. ""Snakes on a Plane,"" a movie many compared to “Cocaine Bear,” opened with $13.9 million in 2006.

            “Audiences discovered this very outrageous, hysterical comedy that our director Elizabeth Banks delivered,” said Jim Orr, Universal distribution chief. “The film absolutely delivers on its preposterous premise. People wanted to come out and have a good time at the theater.”

            “Cocaine Bear” managed to overperform despite mixed reviews from critics and a “B-” CinemaScore from audiences. Ticket buyers were 59% male, and 63% were aged 18-34. It added $5.3 million overseas. “Quantumania” is more easily outpacing “Cocaine Bear” internationally, where it added $46.4 million over the weekend. 

            In just about the epitome of counterprogramming to “Cocaine Bear,” Lionsgate's “Jesus Revolution” also debuted strongly. The film, likewise inspired by a true story, stars Kelsey Grammer as a California minister and Joel Courtney as youth minister, and dramatizes the movement of Christian hippies in the late '60s and early ’70s. It launched with $15.5 million over the weekend and in advance screenings. Produced by the Kingdom Story Company, “Jesus Revolution” proved popular with Christian audiences, and early surpassed expectations. It earned an A+ CinemaScore. 

            Next week should see a new champ at the box office, with the release of Michael B. Jordan's “Creed III."" 

            Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822474,"Michigan power crews work, California recovers after storms","Some Michigan residents faced a fourth straight day without power Sunday as crews continued work to restore electricity more than 165,000 homes and businesses in the greater Detroit area following last week's ice storm.

            Leah Thomas, whose home north of Detroit lost power Wednesday night, was still waiting Sunday afternoon for the power to come back.

            Thomas said she feels lucky that she and their 17-year-old son have been able to stay at her parents’ nearby home, which still has power, while they are in Florida.











            With her husband traveling out of town, Thomas said it was up to her to recharge the battery to their home’s backup sump pump Sunday with her car. She went to multiple stores to find a long cable for the task.

            “I’m a strong woman. I figured it out,"" she said. “Our basement is OK, so we’re the lucky ones.""

            But with the local school district on mid-winter break, Thomas said some of their neighbors have been out of town and will be returning to find a mess from burst water pipes and flooded basements.

            “They don’t know what they’re coming home to,"" she said.

            Powerful storms with widespread wind gusts moved into Oklahoma on Sunday evening from the Texas panhandle. The National Weather Service said that tornado watches and warnings remained in effect in parts of Oklahoma after tornados were spotted there and in Kansas.

            Widespread gusts up to 90 mph (144 kilometers) were reported in southwest Oklahoma with downed trees and power lines, road closures and damage to homes around Norman and Shawnee.

            The Norman Police Department said on Facebook that they were responding to storm damage on the south and eastern sides of Norman about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City. In their post, they said they are still assessing potential injuries and the extent of all the damage.

            In hard-hit southeastern Michigan, still reeling from the ice storm and high winds, the state's two main utilities — DTE Energy and Consumers Energy — reported about 168,000 homes and businesses were without power as of about 6 p.m. Sunday. About 132,000 of those were DTE customers.

            Both utilities said they still hoped to have the lights back on by Sunday night for a majority of their affected customers.

            DTE Energy spokeswoman Cindy Hecht said some DTE business and residential customers have been without power since late Wednesday, but she did not know how many.

            She said power restoration efforts have proven time-consuming because of the large number of damaged lines, including individual lines linking single homes on the grid.

            Wednesday's ice storm coated lines and trees with a half an inch (more than 1.25 centimeters) of ice or more. The storm was followed Thursday by high winds that put about 600,000 DTE customers in the dark at the storm's peak. 

            Hecht said that was the second-largest number of outages DTE has ever experienced, topped only by a March 2017 wind storm that cut power to about 800,000 of its customers.

            “The icing event we had this week is equivalent to a hurricane for coastal utilities. It was the amount of ice and high winds — the winds and the amount of ice accumulation on lines and branches,” she said.

            Hecht said the utility's meteorologists have been tracking another storm system that will move into Michigan on Monday, and the utility is “prepared to respond.""

            The outages prompted some Democratic state lawmakers to call for legislative hearings in Lansing to question utilities about the long restoration times and reliability issues. “There will be hearings. We will be taking over,” State Sen. Darrin Camilleri told WDIV-TV.

            California, meanwhile, got a brief break from severe weather after a powerful storm a day earlier swelled Los Angeles-area rivers to dangerous levels, flooded roads and dumped snow at elevations as low as about 1,000 feet (300 meters). The sun came out briefly Sunday in greater LA, where residents emerged to marvel at mountains to the north and east blanketed in white. 

            Suburban Santa Clarita, in hills north of Los Angeles, received its first significant snowfall since 1989.

            “We went outside and we let our sons play in the snow,” resident Cesar Torres told the Santa Clarita Signal. “We figured, while the snow’s there, might as well make a snowman out of it.” 

            The weather service said Mountain High, one of the closest ski resorts to Los Angeles, received an eye-popping 7.75 feet (2.3 meters) of snow during the last storm, with more possible this week. 

            Rain and snow were falling again Sunday in Northern California as the first of two new storms began moving in. Blizzard warnings go into effect at 4 a.m. Monday and will last until Wednesday for much of the Sierra Nevada.

            “Extremely dangerous and near to impossible mountain travel is expected due to heavy snow and strong wind,” the weather service's Sacramento office warned on Twitter.

            After fierce winds toppled trees and downed wires, about 65,000 utility customers remained without electricity statewide as of Sunday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. The majority of the outages were in Los Angeles. 

            Days of downpours dumped almost 11 inches (28 cm) of rain in the Woodland Hills area of LA’s San Fernando Valley, while nearly 7 inches (18 cm) were reported in Beverly Hills. 

            In Valencia, north of LA, county officials said the heavy rains eroded an embankment at an RV park and swept multiple motorhomes into the Santa Clara River, with emergency video showing one of the vehicles toppled on its side. No one was reported injured. 

            Rare blizzard warnings for Southern California mountains and widespread flood watches ended late Saturday. But Interstate 5, the West Coast’s major north-south highway, was closed off and on due to heavy snow and ice in the Tejon Pass through the mountains north of Los Angeles. Emergency crews, meanwhile, worked to clear mountain roads east of LA of snow and ice.Some Michigan residents faced a fourth straight day without power Sunday as crews continued work to restore electricity more than 165,000 homes and businesses in the greater Detroit area following last week's ice storm.Leah Thomas, whose home north of Detroit lost power Wednesday night, was still waiting Sunday afternoon for the power to come back.Thomas said she feels lucky that she and their 17-year-old son have been able to stay at her parents’ nearby home, which still has power, while they are in Florida.With her husband traveling out of town, Thomas said it was up to her to recharge the battery to their home’s backup sump pump Sunday with her car.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822475,AC Milan welcomes Ibrahimovic back in 2-0 win over Atalanta,"ROME (AP) — A scorching volley from Theo Hernandez led to the opening goal, Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his season debut and goalkeeper Mike Maignan returned after five months out during an encouraging 2-0 win for AC Milan over Atalanta in the Italian league on Sunday.

            The victory moved the defending Serie A champion level on points with second-place Inter Milan, which lost 1-0 at Bologna, 18 points behind runaway leader Napoli.

            Hernandez opened the scoring midway through the first half at the San Siro with a long-distance effort that ricocheted off the post then hit goalkeeper Juan Musso in the back before going in for an own-goal.











            Milan produced several more chances before Junior Messias finally lifted a shot over the onrushing Musso and into an empty net.

            Ibrahimovic came on in the 74th and at age 41 and 146 days became the oldest Milan player in recent memory, beating the mark that Alessandro Costacurta had established at 41 years and 25 days.

            Ibrahimovic had surgery on his left knee in May, while Maignan injured his left calf in September.

            Atalanta failed to place a single shot on goal and remained sixth, six points behind the Milan clubs.

            INCONSISTENT INTER

            Riccardo Orsolini took advantage of a defensive error by Inter to score midway through the second half for Bologna, which registered consecutive home wins over Inter for the first time since 1999.

            Bologna dominated the match and had several other chances, as Inter appeared to lack motivation following its 1-0 win over Porto in the Champions League four days ago.

            “We’re not going to achieve anything if we play this way,” Inter striker Lautaro Martinez said. “We need to change immediately and find more consistency. We just had a great game in the Champions League and now we put on a performance like this. That’s not good.”

            Also, Salernitana beat Silvio Berlusconi’s Monza 3-0 with goals from Lassana Coulibaly, Grigoris Kastanos and Antonio Candreva; and Udinese and Spezia drew 2-2.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822476,CIA chief: China has some doubt on ability to invade Taiwan,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence shows that China's President Xi Jinping has instructed his country's military to “be ready by 2027"" to invade Taiwan though he may be currently harboring doubts about his ability to do so given Russia's experience in its war with Ukraine, CIA Director William Burns said.

            Burns, in a television interview that aired Sunday, stressed that the United States must take “very seriously” Xi's desire to ultimately control Taiwan even if military conflict is not inevitable.

            “We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan, but that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,” Burns told CBS' “Face the Nation.” 











            “I think our judgment at least is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion,” he said. 

            Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war that ended with the Communist Party in control of the mainland. The self-governing island acts like a sovereign nation yet is not recognized by the United Nations or any major country. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized the government in Beijing and cut nation-to-nation ties with Taiwan. In response, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, creating a benchmark for a continuing relationship.

            Taiwan has received numerousdisplays of official American support for the island democracy in the face of growing shows of force by Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory. President Joe Biden has said that American forces would defend Taiwan if China tries to invade. The White House says U.S. policy has not changed in making clear that Washington wants to see Taiwan’s status resolved peacefully. It is silent as to whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.

            In Sunday's interview, Burns said the support from the U.S. and European allies for Ukraine following Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of that country may be acting as a potential deterrent to Chinese officials for now but said the risks of a possible attack on Taiwan will only grow stronger.

            “I think, as they’ve looked at Putin’s experience in Ukraine, that’s probably reinforced some of those doubts,” Burns said. ""So, all I would say is that I think the risks of, you know, a potential use of force probably grow the further into this decade you get and beyond it, into the following decade as well. 

            “So that’s something obviously, that we watch very, very carefully,” he said.WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. intelligence shows that China's President Xi Jinping has instructed his country's military to “be ready by 2027"" to invade Taiwan though he may be currently harboring doubts about his ability to do so given Russia's experience in its war with Ukraine, CIA Director William Burns said.Burns, in a television interview that aired Sunday, stressed that the United States must take “very seriously” Xi's desire to ultimately control Taiwan even if military conflict is not inevitable.“We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan, but that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,” Burns told CBS' “Face the Nation.”“I think our judgment at least is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion,” he said.Taiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war that ended with the Communist Party in control of the mainland.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822477,"Jaguars sign Robertson-Harris, Hasty to contract extensions","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars have signed defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris and running back JaMycal Hasty to contract extensions.

            Robertson-Harris, coming off the best season of his NFL career, signed a three-year, $30 million extension, according to NFL Network.

            Robertson-Harris had one year remaining on a three-year, $23.4 million deal. He started all 17 games in 2022 and finished with 45 tackles, 12 quarterback hits and three sacks. He was at his best down the stretch and in the playoffs, leading the way on a defense that finished 12th in the NFL in points allowed.











            Hasty would have been a restricted free agent once the new league year began next month. He ran for a career-high 194 yards and two touchdowns last season as Travis Etienne's primary backup.

            Robertson-Harris and Hasty joined quarterback C.J. Beathard in getting deals done in the past week. Beathard signed a two-year extension to remain Trevor Lawrence's backup.

            Jacksonville is trying to keep much of its 2022 roster intact. Tight end Evan Engram, right tackle Jawaan Taylor and defensive ends Arden Key and Dawuane Smoot are among the team's top pending free agents.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822479,"AP source: Machado, Padres agree to new $350M, 11-year deal","All-Star slugger Manny Machado has agreed to a new $350 million, 11-year contract that will keep him with the San Diego Padres through 2033, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Machado must pass a physical before the deal, which was first reported by ESPN, is finalized.

            “We're excited to be here for the rest of our careers and have this hat go into the Hall of Fame,” Machado said as he passed a group of reporters before batting second against the Arizona Diamondbacks and going 2 for 3.











            Machado, 30, had said that after this season he planned to opt out of the $300 million, 10-year free agent deal he signed in 2019. With the $120 million he already has received, the new deal increases the free-spending Padres' commitment to Machado to $470 million over 15 years.

            Machado, who has helped turn the Padres into a World Series contender, finished second in the NL MVP race last year. He'll anchor a superstar-laden lineup that includes Xander Bogaerts, Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr., who can return on April 20 from an 80-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs.

            Earlier in spring training, Machado said a deadline for negotiating a new deal had passed, but owner Peter Seidler has said that retaining the smooth-fielding third baseman was his top priority.

            Seidler, a member of the O'Malley family that once owned the Dodgers, hasn't been afraid to spend big money in pursuit of the franchise's first World Series title. The Padres haven't been to the Fall Classic since 1998, when they were swept by the New York Yankees.

            Hometown product Joe Musgrove was given a $100 million, five-year deal in July. The Padres signed Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract just after the winter meetings and signed ace Yu Darvish to a new $108 million, six-year deal earlier this month.

            With the flashy Tatis sidelined all of last year, first due to injury and then the suspension, Machado was a steadying force in helping lead the Padres on a thrilling run to the NL Championship Series, where they lost in five games to the Philadelphia Phillies. The Padres eliminated the 101-win New York Mets in the wild-card round and then beat the 111-win rival Dodgers in the NL Division Series.

            Machado and Bogaerts are under contract through 2033, while Tatis is locked up through 2034 under a $340 million, 14-year deal he signed in early 2021. Soto is under contract for two more seasons. 

            Machado batted .298 with 32 home runs and 102 RBIs in 2022 and is entering his 12th big league season. He has a career .282 batting average with an .833 OPS, 283 homers and 853 RBIs.

            He has also been remarkably durable, playing in all 162 games twice and in fewer than 150 games just once, excluding the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. He was limited to 82 games in 2014, when he didn't make his season debut until May 1 due to knee surgery the previous year, and then had the season cut short by a knee injury in August.

            Machado played in 150 games last year. He sustained a scary-looking sprained left ankle on June 19 at Colorado but returned less than two weeks later. 

            The $350 million deal would be baseball's fourth-largest contract behind Mike Trout ($426.5 million for 12 years), Mookie Betts ($365 million for 12 years) and Aaron Judge ($360 million for nine years).

            However, the $31.8 million average will rank just 16th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822480,Greeks revel in Carnival celebrations after pandemic pause,"NAXOS, Greece (AP) — Throngs of revelers across Greece attended end-of-Carnival celebrations this weekend for the first time in four years.

            The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the festivities held before the beginning of Lent in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

            On the island of Naxos, which hosts some of the most colorful Carnival events in Greece, the number of young people taking part soared this year.











            Many of the customs observed are based on rituals from celebrations of the changing seasons that predate antiquity, while others are more recent.

            In the latter category is the Lampadiforia, or Torch Parade, held on Naxos that features a procession of young men and women holding torches on poles and with their faces painted to resemble black-and-white masks.

            It first took place on the Saturday night preceding Lent in 1994, dreamed up by young members of a local cinema club. About 50 of them went out into the street that year, screaming and dancing while holding torches, and startling other people as they paraded toward the Temple of Apollo. 

            This year, well over 2,000 torch bearers joined the parade, dancing to the beat of drums along the maze of the narrow streets in old town Naxos to a central square where a scarecrow was burned.

            In other parts of Naxos and mainland Greece, young men wearing cow bells and carrying a phallic symbol — a common feature of ancient rites celebrating spring — danced their way to village squares on Sunday.

            Other customs included young men wearing folk costumes and holding thick canes making their way to neighboring villages, where they invite local women to dance. The women, in turn, offer the men local delicacies and wine.

            In Orthodox Christian countries, Lent, as well as Easter, are celebrated at different times than in primarily Catholic countries because they use different calendars. Greek Orthodox Easter is usually a week later than Catholic Easter.

            Carnival celebrations also took place this weekend in Cyprus.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822481,"EU, UK announce talks on Northern Ireland post-Brexit","The EU and UK released a curt press statement on Sunday evening, saying that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen would meet in person in London on Monday.""Today, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak agreed to continue their work in person towards shared, practical solutions for the range of complex challenges around the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" the joint statement said.This comes amid long-running talks on the terms of Northern Ireland's special status after Brexit and comments from both sides suggesting that progress was being made in the negotiations.Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had told newspaper The Sunday Times that he would be ""giving it everything"" through the weekend in the hope of reaching a deal.""If we want to restore the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland, which I very much want to do and I think that's what people need and deserve, then we need to resolve the issues of the Protocol,"" Sunak said.He said the shooting of a police officer this week, likely by a separatist paramilitary group, ""reminds us of the delicate situation in Northern Ireland, the fragility of it, and we shouldn't take it for granted. And that's why getting power-sharing up  and running is really important.""Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar had also voiced optimism on the talks making progress.""Certainly the deal isn't done yet,"" Varadkar told broadcaster RTE at the weekend. ""But I do think we are inching towards conclusion.""The British government and EU negotiators have been in talks for some time looking to agree on alterations to the Northern Ireland Protocol.This is the name for the post-Brexit rules for Northern Ireland that allow the country to effectively remain part of the EU single market, via its open border with the Republic of Ireland, at the expense of having to check some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.It also entails Brussels having control of some so-called ""level playing field"" issues like VAT or sales tax rates and state subsidy policies.The contentious special status for Northern Ireland is both praised and despised in the divided country.Unionists who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK argue the deal is an unacceptable loss of sovereignty and equal status with England, Scotland and Wales.The country's second-largest political party, the Democratic Unionist Party, is refusing to participate in the power-sharing government in Stormont in Northern , saying the terms of the Northern Ireland Protocol are the reason for this.That said, it's not clear whether the DUP will see any deal struck by Sunak's government as satisfactory.Meanwhile, the largest republican party Sinn Fein, which advocates a reunified Ireland, sees Northern Ireland's special status under the Brexit deal as a necessary guarantor for the 1990s Good Friday peace deal that broadly ended decades of sectarian conflict.Since taking office late last year, Sunak — himself a lifelong advocate of Brexit — has said he would try to find a bilateral agreement with Brussels to improve the situation in Northern Ireland and break the political deadlock there.He's argued that the deadlock was hurting the UK's ties with the EU and even the US, which has often stressed the importance of a post-Brexit status quo that upholds the Northern Irish peace deal's terms, most notably including an open border on the island of Ireland.Before him, Boris Johnson's government had been threatening to unilaterally stop abiding by some terms of the Protocol, while Liz Truss' few weeks in office last summer were so fleeting that a desired direction of travel barely had time to emerge.msh/jcg (Reuters, AFP)",2023/02/26,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822482,Bayern Munich back on top after dispatching Union Berlin,"Bayern Munich reclaimed their familiar perch at the top of the Bundesliga, laying down a marker with an emphatic 3-0 win over surprise challengers Union Berlin on Sunday.As the snow fell over the Allianz Arena pitch, the reigning champions turned up the heat immediately. Thomas Müller spurned a golden early opportunity but Bayern were relentless, and Union's defense was finally breached by Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's back post header in the 31st minute.The opener was created by Kingsley Coman, and the French winger made it two 10 minutes later. Running on to a pinpoint through ball from Müller, Coman kept his composure to round the keeper and double Bayern's lead.If Union's task looked tough at that point, a miracle was required when Jamal Musiala marked his 20th-birthday with the third just before the break. Again Müller was involved, creating a yard of space on the right with a heavy-looking touch before finding Musiala in enough room to tuck come comfortably.Bayern's third saw an already confident side regain their swagger. Müller and Musiala rubbished the notion they couldn't play together, Musiala was a picture of invention and incision and Yann Sommer in goal had little to do but keep warm.The good news continued to come for Bayern, with Sadio Mane replacing Coman afer 65 minutes. The Senegalese star had been out since before the World Cup at the end of last year. The early departure of a limping Matthijs de Ligt was the only possible problem for Nagelsmann. But Bayern's dominance means it may well have been a tactical rest.The win lifts the Bavarians back above Dortmund and three points clear of Union. But it was the nature of the victory that might ring alarm bells among the pretenders as the business end of the season approaches.",2023/02/26,,

""We intend to modernize the whole bureaucratic process in addition to legal modernization.""""We will need many skilled workers to meet the demand for software development in Germany.""The plan would be to make it easier for the skilled workers needed in Germany to come to the country with their families, Scholz said.He added that it should be possible, initially, for people to arrive in Germany without a concrete job offer.Relaxing language requirements would also help to make Germany a more attractive destination to sought-after professionals who might otherwise be lured to English-speaking countries.""It is clear that anyone who comes to Germany as an IT specialist can first easily converse with all his or her colleagues in English, because many in Germany can speak English,"" Scholz said, adding that German could be learned later.""A lot of reform proposals have already been collected and we are continuing to work on them,"" Scholz added.Scholz, accompanied by business representatives, was visiting companies in India's tech hub, including a site operated by the German software company SAP.He also met officials and players from the Indian Premier League cricket team Royal Challengers Bangalore.Scholz is keen to increase economic and strategic cooperation with India and reduce Germany's dependence on China while also helping New Delhi free itself from its close ties with Moscow.Over the past 15 years, Europe's largest economy benefited from the rise of China and cheap Russian energy. However, concerns over Beijing flexing its muscle militarily and the war in Ukraine have spurred a need to decouple from both countries.While New Delhi has articulated its position against the Ukraine war more robustly to counter criticism that it is soft on Russia, it has still not openly held Moscow accountable for the invasion. India has also not changed its policy on importing Russian oil and coal.On the first day of his visit, Scholz was met by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the capital, New Delhi, where he received military honors.Scholz is pressing for progress toward an India-EU free trade deal and an investment protection agreement, and told reporters he was in ""favor of applying more pressure.""The chancellor is also pressing for Germany's Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems to build six submarines in India in a deal reportedly worth several billion dollars.Germany is the ninth largest investor in India, with cumulative foreign direct investment inflows of $13.8 billion from April 2000 to September 2022.rc/jcg (AP, dpa)",2023/02/26,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822484,Tens of thousands protest Mexico's electoral law changes,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tens of thousands of people filled Mexico City’s vast main plaza Sunday to protest President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's electoral law changes they say threaten democracy and could mark a return to the past. 

            The plaza is normally thought to hold nearly 100,000 people, but many protesters who couldn't fit in the square spilled onto nearby streets.

            The marchers were clad mostly in white and pink — the color of the National Electoral Institute — and shouted slogans like “Don’t Touch my Vote!” Like a similar but somewhat larger march on Nov. 13, the marchers appeared somewhat more affluent than those at the average demonstration.











            The electoral law changes drew attention from the U.S. government.

            Brian A. Nichols, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western hemisphere affairs, wrote in his Twitter account that “Today, in Mexico, we see a great debate on electoral reforms that are testing the independence of electoral and judicial institutions.”

            “The United States supports independent, well-resourced electoral institutions that strengthen democratic processes and the rule of law,” Nichols wrote.

            López Obrador's proposals were passed last week. Once enacted, they would cut salaries, funding for local election offices and training for citizens who operate and oversee polling stations. They would also reduce sanctions for candidates who fail to report campaign spending. 

            Mexico's president denies the reforms are a threat to democracy and says criticism is elitist, arguing the institute spends too much money. He says the funds should be spent on the poor. 

            But protester Enrique Bastien, a 64-year-old veterinarian, said that with the reforms López Obrador “wants to return to the past” when “the government controlled elections.” 

            “It was a life with no independence,"" said Bastien, recalling the 1970s and 80s when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, ruled Mexico with fraud and handouts. 

            Fernando Gutierrez, 55, a small businessman, said López Obrador wanted to lead Mexico to a socialist government. “That's obvious, from the aid going to Cuba,” Gutierrez said. 

            López Obrador has imported coronavirus vaccines, medical workers and stone railway ballast from Cuba, but has shown little taste for socialist policies at home.

            Many other demonstrators were simply wary of the kind of vote miscounting, campaign overspending and electoral pressure tactics that were common in Mexico before the independent electoral agency was created in the 1990s.

            López Obrador said Thursday he’ll sign the changes into law, even though he expects court challenges. Many at Sunday's protest expressed hope that Mexico's Supreme Court would overturn some of the changes, as courts have done with other presidential initiatives. 

            Lorenzo Cordova, the head of the National Electoral Institute, has said the reforms “seek to cut thousands of people who work every day to guarantee trustworthy elections, something that will of course pose a risk for future elections.” 

            López Obrador has appeared nonchalant about court challenges, saying Thursday that he believed the changes would be upheld because none was “outside the law.” 

            However, in the past he has frequently attacked Mexico’s judiciary and claimed judges are part of a conservative conspiracy against his administration.

            The president’s strident pushback against the judiciary, as well as regulatory and oversight agencies, has raised fears among some that he is seeking to reinstitute the practices of the old PRI, which bent the rules to retain Mexico’s presidency for 70 years until its defeat in the 2000 elections. 

            Elections in Mexico are expensive by international standards, in part because almost all legal campaign financing is, by law, supplied by the government. The electoral institute also issues the secure voter ID cards that are the most commonly accepted form of identification in Mexico, and oversees balloting in the remote and often dangerous corners of the country. 

            López Obrador remains highly popular in Mexico, with approval ratings of around 60%. While he cannot run for reelection, his Morena party is favored in next year’s national elections and the opposition is in disarray.

            Part of his popular appeal comes from railing against high-paid government bureaucrats, and he has been angered by the fact that some top electoral officials are paid more than the president.MEXICO CITY (AP) — Tens of thousands of people filled Mexico City’s vast main plaza Sunday to protest President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's electoral law changes they say threaten democracy and could mark a return to the past.The plaza is normally thought to hold nearly 100,000 people, but many protesters who couldn't fit in the square spilled onto nearby streets.The marchers were clad mostly in white and pink — the color of the National Electoral Institute — and shouted slogans like “Don’t Touch my Vote!” Like a similar but somewhat larger march on Nov. 13, the marchers appeared somewhat more affluent than those at the average demonstration.The electoral law changes drew attention from the U.S. government.Brian A. Nichols, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western hemisphere affairs, wrote in his Twitter account that “Today, in Mexico, we see a great debate on electoral reforms that are testing the independence of electoral and judicial institutions.”“The United States supports independent, well-resourced electoral institutions that strengthen democratic processes and the rule of law,” Nichols wrote.López Obrador's proposals were passed last week. Once enacted, they would cut salaries, funding for local election offices and training for citizens who operate and oversee polling stations. They would also reduce sanctions for candidates who fail to report campaign spending.Mexico's president denies the reforms are a threat to democracy and says criticism is elitist, arguing the institute spends too much money. He says the funds should be spent on the poor.But protester Enrique Bastien, a 64-year-old veterinarian, said that with the reforms López Obrador “wants to return to the past” when “the government controlled elections.”“It was a life with no independence,"" said Bastien, recalling the 1970s and 80s when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, ruled Mexico with fraud and handouts.Fernando Gutierrez, 55, a small businessman, said López Obrador wanted to lead Mexico to a socialist government. “That's obvious, from the aid going to Cuba,” Gutierrez said.López Obrador has imported coronavirus vaccines, medical workers and stone railway ballast from Cuba, but has shown little taste for socialist policies at home.Many other demonstrators were simply wary of the kind of vote miscounting, campaign overspending and electoral pressure tactics that were common in Mexico before the independent electoral agency was created in the 1990s.López Obrador said Thursday he’ll sign the changes into law, even though he expects court challenges. Many at Sunday's protest expressed hope that Mexico's Supreme Court would overturn some of the changes, as courts have done with other presidential initiatives.Lorenzo Cordova, the head of the National Electoral Institute, has said the reforms “seek to cut thousands of people who work every day to guarantee trustworthy elections, something that will of course pose a risk for future elections.”López Obrador has appeared nonchalant about court challenges, saying Thursday that he believed the changes would be upheld because none was “outside the law.”However, in the past he has frequently attacked Mexico’s judiciary and claimed judges are part of a conservative conspiracy against his administration.The president’s strident pushback against the judiciary, as well as regulatory and oversight agencies, has raised fears among some that he is seeking to reinstitute the practices of the old PRI, which bent the rules to retain Mexico’s presidency for 70 years until its defeat in the 2000 elections.Elections in Mexico are expensive by international standards, in part because almost all legal campaign financing is, by law, supplied by the government.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822486,Notre Dame G Olivia Miles hurts right knee at Louisville,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Notre Dame star guard Olivia Miles left Sunday’s ACC title-clinching victory at Louisville and did not return after injuring her right knee while diving for a loose ball under the Irish basket late in the second quarter.

            Miles, who leads the No. 10 Irish with 14.7 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 2.1 steals per game, was hurt with 2:35 remaining before halftime. The sophomore became emotional and pounded the floor while being examined by medical personnel. Miles was able to flex her knee and eventually limped off the floor without assistance to applause as she made her way to the locker room.

            Miles favored the right leg as she talked with family members and walked gingerly back into the locker room. She eventually returned to the bench midway through the third quarter with her right knee wrapped in ice and eventually a large bandage.











            Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey said after the game that ""as of now, we're in the dark on that, not sure what’s going on with her knee. But it was encouraging that she walked off the court. We’ll find out the next couple of days about her.”

            She finished with three rebounds, two points and two assists in 16:18 and watched Notre Dame rally from a 33-24 halftime deficit and 46-43 entering the fourth quarter to win 68-65 and clinch the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title.

            The top-seeded Irish will open on Friday afternoon against the winner of Thursday's matchup between the Nos. 8 and 9 seeds.

            The 5-foot-10 guard's versatility on both ends of the floor has made her one of women’s college basketball’s rising stars. Miles leads the Atlantic Coast Conference and ranks fifth nationally in assists and has recorded 10 double-doubles this season.

            Miles last spring became the first freshman (man or woman) to post a triple-double in the NCAA Tournament and is on the watch list for several national awards.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822487,Man United wins League Cup to end 6-year wait for trophy,"LONDON (AP) — Manchester United’s six-year wait for a trophy is over after beating Newcastle 2-0 to win the League Cup on Sunday.

            United manager Erik ten Hag has wasted no time in guiding the club to silverware just 10 months after being hired. 

            Casemiro headed United in front in the 33rd minute of the final at Wembley Stadium and Sven Botman's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 39th. 











            It is United’s first trophy since winning a League Cup and Europa League double under Jose Mourinho in 2017. 

            The victory keeps alive Ten Hag’s four-pronged challenge this season, with his team in contention for the Premier League title and still competing in both the Europa League and FA Cup. 

            For Newcastle, the wait for a first major domestic trophy since winning the FA Cup in 1955 goes on. 

            The Saudi Arabian-backed club mounted a fightback in the second half, but could not find a breakthrough goal, with David de Gea keeping a club record 181st clean sheet for United. 

            While Ten Hag and United's fans will have their sights on bigger prizes than the League Cup, it could prove to be an important platform to build on after watching fierce rivals Manchester City and Liverpool dominate English soccer in recent years. 

            Newcastle arrived at Wembley also hoping for a first major trophy since Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund bought the club in 2021. 

            The sense of anticipation from both sets of supporters was unmistakable ahead of kickoff, with each hoping to see an end to their respective trophy droughts as Newcastle fans waved a sea of black-and-white flags against the opposing red scarves of United.

            United has not had to wait anything like as long as Newcastle for major success. In terms of the club’s storied past, though, a six-year run has felt like a crisis to fans brought up on iconic former manager Alex Ferguson’s all-conquering teams. 

            There is growing belief among the club's fans that Ten Hag can bring back the glory years and he has certainly made an impressive start by delivering a trophy at the earliest possible point. 

            His team looked on course for victory from the moment Casemiro headed them in front when rising to meet Luke Shaw’s curled free kick. 

            For a man who has won it all with Real Madrid, including five Champions League titles, Casemiro's delight at opening the scoring at Wembley was clear to see as he ran to the corner to celebrate with a broad smile on his face.

            Perhaps there was also an element of relief given Newcastle had come close to taking the lead just before that goal when Alain Saint-Maximin’s close-range shot was blocked by De Gea. 

            It was 2-0 to United shortly before halftime when Wout Weghorst played in Marcus Rashford on the left. 

            The in-form forward miscued his shot, but Botman's attempted block saw the ball fly beyond Newcastle goalkeeper Loris Karius. 

            Rashford ran away in celebration, but it was adjudged to be an own-goal.

            Newcastle's players tried to force their way back into the match in the second half and made United retreat at times. 

            However, De Gea was not to be beaten and Bruno Fernandes might have extended United's lead late when denied by Karius.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822489,"Maryland rolls in 2nd half, beats No. 21 Northwestern 75-59","COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — No matter what the postseason holds for the Maryland Terrapins, they'll be able to point to some real accomplishments in Kevin Willard's first season as their coach.

            For example, they won all their Big Ten home games.

            Jahmir Young scored 18 points and Don Carey added 13 to help Maryland wrap up an undefeated home season in conference play with a 75-59 victory over No. 21 Northwestern on Sunday.











            “Going 10-0 in this conference at home, that's pretty impressive for this group,” Willard said. “I just think it shows you how great of a program this is, how great of a fan base it is.”

            The Terrapins (20-9, 11-7) finished 16-1 overall at home, and they used unusually impressive 3-point shooting to turn back the Wildcats (20-9, 11-7). Maryland's win also clinched at least a share of the Big Ten title for No. 5 Purdue.

            The Boilermakers (24-5, 13-5) now have a record 25 Big Ten championships, three more than Indiana, which is one of several teams that can still tie Purdue at the top this year. Remarkably, Maryland and Northwestern also are in that group. The Terps have made huge strides since Willard arrived from Seton Hall, and Chris Collins' Wildcats entered the AP Top 25 this week before losing to Illinois and Maryland.

            “This league is hard. You play good teams,” Collins said. “We're not down in any way. We're still excited. We've got a big week coming up again, and you've just got to learn from these games and go home and try to make it right when you get another opportunity to play.”

            The Terrapins have not been a good 3-point shooting team this season. They entered their game Sunday at 31% from beyond the arc but went 14 of 22 against Northwestern. Young and Carey made four each.

            The 6-foot-1 Young threw down an emphatic dunk to give Maryland a 35-32 lead. He later made a 3 at the buzzer to put the Terps up 41-39 at halftime.

            “I was feeling it from 3 early on, so just trying to get a shot up,” said Young, who scored 16 of his points before halftime.

            Maryland was 8 for 11 from long distance in the first half, and both teams were shooting around 60% from the field. The Terps didn't regress much in the second. A 3 by Carey capped a 12-2 run that put Maryland up 67-51, and it was smooth sailing from there.

            Chase Audige led Northwestern with 16 points.

            BIG PICTURE

            Northwestern: Purdue's recent struggles gave the Wildcats a shot at their first Big Ten title since 1933, but those chances took a big hit Sunday in front of a packed house at Maryland.

            “We haven't been good enough the last couple years probably to kind of warrant that kind of spirited crowd,"" Collins said. “They knew this was a high-level game. They knew there was a lot on the line for both teams here late in the season.”

            Maryland: The Terps went unbeaten at home in Big Ten play for the second time. They also did it in 2014-15, their first season in the league. Maryland made more than 10 3s in a game for only the second time this season. The Terps had 13 in a win over Saint Louis in November.

            SENIOR SENDOFF

            Willard said he tried to stay loose on a day Maryland honored its senior class.

            “I wanted to have fun. I never have fun on senior night. I'm an emotional wreck, and that goes off onto my players,” Willard said. “So the only thing I told them was I just wanted to have fun today. ... I was going to have fun no matter what. We got blown out by 20, I was going to enjoy the fact that this group has worked really hard, and I was going to be appreciative of what they've given us.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822490,NTSB says medical plane apparently broke apart before crash,"STAGECOACH, Nev. (AP) — A medical transport flight that crashed in a mountainous area in northern Nevada, killing five all five people aboard the plane including a patient, apparently broke apart before hitting the ground, authorities said Sunday. 

            The National Transportation Safety Board has sent in a seven-member team of investigators to the site of Friday night’s crash near Stagecoach.

            “How do we know if the airplane broke up in flight? We found parts of the airplane one-half to three-quarters of a mile away” from the crash scene, NTSB Vice Chair Bruce Landsberg said at a news briefing in Carson City.











            Landsberg said in the afternoon briefing that a team spent all day looking for pieces of the downed plane. He added investigators would likely be on site for several days before the wreckage of the single-engine Pilatus PC-12 is moved so investigators can try to determine a possible crash cause. The plane was built in 2002.

            “Right now, we just don't know. This is like a three dimensional puzzle,” Landsberg said. “It's harder when you don't have the pieces all in one place.”

            The crash occurred amid a winter storm warning issued by the National Weather Service in Reno for large swaths of Nevada, including parts of Lyon County. It was snowing steadily with winds around 20 mph (30 kph) and gusts up to 30 mph (50 kph). 

            Visibility was under two miles (3.2 kilometers) with a cloud ceiling about 2,000 feet (600 meters) above ground when the flight left Reno for Salt Lake City, Utah, and went down, according to the weather service. 

            Care Flight, which provides ambulance service by plane and helicopter, identified the downed aircraft and said the pilot, a flight nurse, a flight paramedic, a patient and a patient’s family member all died.

            Robin Hays, a Stagecoach resident and a former flight nurse, said she heard the sputtering plane fly over her house before crashing behind her property.

            “I knew the plane was in trouble,” Hays told the Reno Gazette Journal. “I knew it was going to crash. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to crash into my house.”

            Hays called 911 and went outside but could not see the wreckage because of the blowing snow.

            Misty Gruenemay told the newspaper that the wind was howling and the snow blowing hard when she heard what sounded like a whiz and a thump behind her house in Stagecoach. The rural community is home to around 2,500 residents and located about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Reno.

            Gruenemay said she wanted to help but conditions were terrible and she didn’t have a vehicle that could safely travel the unpaved roads buried in 6 inches of snow. 

            “It was snowing and visibility was horrible. I don’t even understand why that plane was allowed to take off,” Gruenemay said.

            The Lyon County Sheriff’s office said authorities began receiving calls about the crash near Stagecoach, Nevada, around 9:15 p.m. and found the wreckage two hours later. 

            Care Flight officials said it was halting all flights and will work with each of its operations to determine when it will return to service.

            According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was registered to Guardian Flight, based in South Jordan, Utah. Care Flight is a service of REMSA Health in Reno and Guardian Flight.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822492,Al-Hilal routs Al-Duhail 7-0 to reach ACL final,"DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo scored four goals as titleholder Al-Hilal of Saudi Arabia advanced to the final of the Asian Champions League with a 7-0 rout of Qatar’s Al-Duhail on Sunday. 

            The four-time continental champion will meet Urawa Reds of Japan in the two-legged final in April and May.

            Despite Al-Duhail having the advantage of playing at Qatar’s Al Thumama Stadium, the 18-time Saudi Arabian champion scored five times in the first half of the semifinal game.











            Ighalo found the target twice in the opening 10 minutes as Al-Hilal quickly took control. The Nigeria striker’s first came with just 90 seconds on the clock. The second was a well-taken shot after a smart pass from Michael Delgado.

            After 14 minutes Moussa Marega made it 3-0 and the Mali forward added his second just before the half hour.

            Seven minutes before the break, Salem Al-Dawsari scored a fifth goal for Al-Hilal, which is seeking to win a fifth Asian title and extend its own record, with a curling shot from just inside the area.

            The goals kept coming in the second half. Ighalo scored his third soon after the restart and his fourth in the 63rd minute.

            The final between Al-Hilal and Urawa will be their third meeting at that stage in six years. Urawa won its second title in 2017 with the Saudi Arabians lifting the trophy two years later.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822493,Bayern back on top with 3-0 win over rival Union Berlin,"BERLIN (AP) — Bayern Munich top-scorer Jamal Musiala struck again on his birthday Sunday to help his team reclaim first place in the Bundesliga with a 3-0 win over surprise challenger Union Berlin.

            After goals from Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kingsley Coman, Musiala marked his 20th birthday with his 11th league goal of the season just before the break for Bayern to deal Union its first defeat in any competition since November.

            The 10-time defending champion reclaimed the lead on goal difference from Borussia Dortmund, which has closed the gap by winning every game it's played this year. Union dropped three points behind the big two in third place, still a remarkable achievement for a club that was targeting league survival from its fourth season in the Bundesliga.











            The visitors’ busy schedule in three competitions finally took its toll. Union beat Ajax Amsterdam 3-1 in their Europa League playoff game on Thursday.

            In contrast, Bayern had eight days to recover after its 3-2 loss at Borussia Mönchengladbach last weekend. The home team appeared fresher from the start against Union, which had started the day level on 43 points with Bayern.

            Sadio Mané came on as a substitute for Bayern in what was the Senegal star’s first appearance since Nov. 8, when he was injured playing against Werder Bremen. Mané needed surgery to reattach a tendon to the head of his right fibula and missed the World Cup.

            Thomas Müller, making his 430th Bundesliga appearance for Bayern, missed the game’s first big chance and Musiala was twice blocked before Müller forced a good save from Frederik Rönnow.

            Choupo-Moting finally made the breakthrough in the 31st when he rose between two defenders to head in Kingsley Coman’s cross to the far post.

            Coman made it 2-0 in the 40th when Rönnow’s kickout from goal was quickly returned. Matthijs de Ligt won the ball in midfield and Müller sent it on straightway to Coman, who rounded the goalkeeper before scoring from a narrow angle.

            There was still time before the break for Musiala to score after Müller pulled the ball back from the end line.

            Earlier, Sardar Azmoun scored for Bayer Leverkusen to salvage a 1-1 draw at Freiburg, but the team’s patchy form leaves European qualification increasingly at risk.

            Leverkusen has won three of its seven league games so far this year, and Sunday’s draw dropped the team down to 11th.

            Freiburg dropped to fifth, one point behind Leipzig in the last place for Champions League qualification.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822495,"Boston, No 1 Gamecocks take SEC title, top Georgia 73-63","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — “The Freshies” have had a winning impact on South Carolina, one coach Dawn Staley believes will last long after they leave campus.

            “We've had leaders leave a legacy of leadership,” Staley said Sunday after her top-ranked team's 73-63 victory over Georgia. “It's still intact.” 

            And has more yet to accomplish.











            The group of five led by reigning AP national player of the year Aliyah Boston and high-scoring Zia Cooke (they've called themselves “The Freshies” since arriving as the country's No. 1 recruiting class) has helped the Gamecocks win three Southeastern Conference titles, two league tournament crowns and last year's NCAA championship. 

            Boston had her 78th career double-double with 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Cooke had 10 of her 12 points in the first half as the Gamecocks (29-0) completed a perfect, 16-0 SEC season.

            The quintet, which also includes Brea Beal, Laeticia Amihere and Olivia Thompson, has a 122-8 record the past four years and has won 35 straight games since its last loss to Kentucky at the SEC Tournament a year ago.

            Boston and her teammates hope to avenge that and add to their trophy collection this coming week.

            “There's definitely no relief” after their flawless regular season, she said. “Now, were into the season where winning is the only option.” 

            Kamilla Cardoso, the Gamecocks' 6-foot-7 reserve, also had a double-double with 13 points and 10 rebounds.

            Georgia (20-10, 9-7) kept things uncomfortably close into the second quarter before the Gamecocks pulled away for their 17th straight victory in the series.

            Georgia frustrated South Carolina nearly two months ago, holding Boston to four points and five boards in a 68-51 loss on Jan. 2.

            The Bulldogs defense was at it again, this time limiting just about every other Gamecock besides Boston to stay within arms length of the defending national champions. Diamond Battles' basket with 5:58 to go before the half tied things at 25.

            South Carolina dialed up its own defense for a 10-2 run the rest of the half to take control. The Gamecocks forced three turnovers and Georgia missed its five attempts during the four-minute span.

            Cooke opened the surge with a driving bucket and closed it with a three as the Gamecocks lead 35-27 at the break.

            South Carolina used its dominating height advantage — Cardoso scored all her points the final 20 minutes — to maintain a double-figure lead for much of the second half.

            Georgia came in with a five-game win streak, but fell to 0-4 this season against ranked opponents. Battles led the Bulldogs with 20 points. 

            Bulldogs first-year coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson was proud of her team's fight and said this doesn't diminish in how they've gelled the past month. 

            “Their personality is now becoming my personality,” she said. “Which I love that. They've got to be fighters and they've got to be tough.” 

            BIG PICTURE

            Georgia: The Bulldogs had no offensive rebounds in the first 20 minutes against South Carolina, which is second nationally in grabbing its opponents misses with more than 31 a game this season. Georgia entered this game fifth in SEC offensive rebounding per game at 13.3.

            South Carolina: The Gamecocks were stunned by Kentucky in last year's SEC Tournament finals. But it's hard to imagine South Carolina's versatile, talented roster letting up after the way they've handled the challenges of being No. 1 and remaining undefeated.

            SENIOR TEARS

            Aliyah Boston had her emotions on display as South Carolina's seven seniors were celebrated at Senior Day. Boston cried several times, including on video as she discussed her time at school in a taped message to fans. When Boston cried in the tunnel before the ceremony, she got a bit of coaching from Staley, “It's too early,"" Boston recalled.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822508,No. 10 Notre Dame overcomes Miles injury to clinch ACC,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Initially stunned by an injury to its best player, Notre Dame regrouped with impressive maturity and resolve to earn a conference title and provide Olivia Miles a welcome cheer-up.

            Sonia Citron scored 27 points, including four key free throws in the final 1:20, and the No. 10 Irish overcame the loss of Miles to a knee injury to beat Louisville 68-65 on Sunday and clinch the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title.

            Miles, who leads the Irish with 14.7 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 2.1 steals per game, was hurt with 2:35 remaining before halftime while diving for a loose ball. The sophomore became emotional and pounded the floor while being examined by medical personnel. Miles was able to flex her knee and eventually limped off the floor without assistance to applause as she made her way to the locker room.











            As Miles was being examined, Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey sought to maintain her team’s focus.

            “It was just to stay together and just for us to know that when one person, when our sister goes down, everybody has to step up,” Ivey said. “Everybody just basically just went after it, competed and knew that we’re playing for a little bit more with Olivia out.”

            As for Miles’ status, Ivey added, “We’re in the dark on that, not sure what’s going on with her knee. But it was encouraging that she walked off the court. We’ll find out the next couple of days about her.”

            Miles returned to the bench in the third quarter with the knee wrapped in ice and eventually a bandage. Through occasional tears as her parents consoled her from behind the bench, Miles watched the young Irish (24-4, 15-3 ACC) rally from a 33-24 halftime deficit and take the lead for good in the fourth quarter before holding on.

            KK Bransford's layup got the Irish within 53-52 before Citron and Cassandre Prosper followed with five consecutive free throws to lead by four. Louisville's Hailey Van Lith made two free throws, but Citron's 3-pointer made it 60-55 and maintained that edge as the Cardinals missed two of four from the line.

            Citron made two more from the line with 43.3 seconds left to make it 66-61 but missed two after Mykasa Robinson's layup to open the door for the Cardinals (21-10, 12-6). Van Lith's left-corner 3-pointer missed, Prosper was fouled on the defensive rebound and then made two with six seconds left to seal it.

            Citron, a sophomore guard, made 10 of 14 free throws and 7 of 13 shots with three 3s as the Irish won their sixth in a row and swept Louisville. Bransford and Prosper, both freshman guards, added 14 and points respectively off the bench along with two assists each.

            The group effort by the backcourt shut down Louisville's attempts to tie and helped Notre Dame end an emotional day on a high note.

            Van Lith made 10 of 12 free throws to finish with 23 for Louisville, which finished the final 6:44 with just two field goals in the final 35 seconds. Merissah Russell had 12 points and Olivia Cochran 10, but the Cardinals shot just 35% and only made 27% in the fourth quarter.

            “Unfortunately for us, our fourth quarter offensively was not what we needed it to be,"" coach Jeff Walz said. ""But I can’t fault our effort. I thought our kids competed. I thought they played hard. They gave it everything they had.”

            BIG PICTURE

            Notre Dame: Duke's loss to North Carolina opened the door for the Irish and they took advantage to gain the No. 1 seed for the ACC Tournament and a double bye. They were picked to finish fourth, three spots below Louisville. That wasn't easy considering Miles was sitting on the bench with injury, but their underclassmen showed amazing resolve as she looked on. 

            “With Liv down, I had to take the point,” Citron said. “So that’s a big adjustment. I think our team just did a great job of just focusing possession by possession, not looking at it like, just get a stop score. We’ve been in that position before, we knew what we had to do and it was on defense.”

            Louisville: The Cardinals' loss spoiled the home finales for seniors Morgan Jones, Chrislyn Carr, Norika Konno, Liz Dixon, Josie Williams and Mykasa Robinson (nine points, six rebounds, five assists). One consolation was earning the No. 4 seed and a double bye that delays their ACC Tournament debut until Friday, like it had been for a while.

            UP NEXT

            Notre Dame will face the winner between the No. 8 and 9 seeds in Friday's quarterfinal of the ACC Tournament in Greensboro, North Carolina.

            Louisville will play on Friday as the No. 4 seed against 5/12-13 game winner.

(AP) — Initially stunned by an injury to its best player, Notre Dame regrouped with impressive maturity and resolve to earn a conference title and provide Olivia Miles a welcome cheer-up.Sonia Citron scored 27 points, including four key free throws in the final 1:20, and the No. 10 Irish overcame the loss of Miles to a knee injury to beat Louisville 68-65 on Sunday and clinch the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title.Miles, who leads the Irish with 14.7 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 2.1 steals per game, was hurt with 2:35 remaining before halftime while diving for a loose ball. The sophomore became emotional and pounded the floor while being examined by medical personnel. Miles was able to flex her knee and eventually limped off the floor without assistance to applause as she made her way to the locker room.As Miles was being examined, Notre Dame coach Niele Ivey sought to maintain her team’s focus.“It was just to stay together and just for us to know that when one person, when our sister goes down, everybody has to step up,” Ivey said. “Everybody just basically just went after it, competed and knew that we’re playing for a little bit more with Olivia out.”As for Miles’ status, Ivey added, “We’re in the dark on that, not sure what’s going on with her knee. But it was encouraging that she walked off the court. We’ll find out the next couple of days about her.”Miles returned to the bench in the third quarter with the knee wrapped in ice and eventually a bandage. Through occasional tears as her parents consoled her from behind the bench, Miles watched the young Irish (24-4, 15-3 ACC) rally from a 33-24 halftime deficit and take the lead for good in the fourth quarter before holding on.KK Bransford's layup got the Irish within 53-52 before Citron and Cassandre Prosper followed with five consecutive free throws to lead by four.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822509,No. 22 UNC women crush No. 11 Duke's ACC title hopes,"DURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Three players scored nine points and No. 22 North Carolina went 9 of 9 from the foul line in the fourth quarter to deny No. 11 Duke a share of the ACC championship on Sunday with a 45-41 win, the lowest scoring game in the 105 meetings of these bitter rivals.

            Combined with No. 10 Notre Dame coming from behind to win at Louisville, the Irish win the conference title outright.

            In 112 quarters this season, North Carolina (20-9, 11-7) failed to reach double figures just five times but only scored eight in each of the first two quarters to trail 20-16. Duke was in single digits in both the second and third quarters, for 10 on the season.











            Elizabeth Balogun led Duke (24-5, 14-4), which was 13-0 at home, with 12 points.

            North Carolina shot 34% (15 of 21) with 21 turnovers but went 12 of 15 from the foul line. Duke shot 30% (16 of 53) but was only 5 of 6 from the line and had 25 turnovers. 

            NO. 1 SOUTH CAROLINA 73, GEORGIA 63

            COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Aliyah Boston had 25 points and 11 rebounds, and Zia Cooke added 12 points as South Carolina completed a perfect Southeastern Conference season with a victory over Georgia.

            Boston and Cooke, part of “The Freshies” top-ranked 2019 recruiting class, celebrated their Senior Day with pre-game tears, then followed with another fabulous showing as the Gamecocks (29-0, 16-0) won their 35th straight and their seventh SEC title in the past 10 seasons.

            Georgia (20-10, 9-7) kept things uncomfortably close into the second quarter before the Gamecocks pulled away for their 17th straight victory in the series. Diamond Battles led the Bulldogs with 20 points.

            South Carolina heads to next week’s SEC Tournament — only a two-hour drive from campus in Greenville — as heavy favorites to recapture the crown that eluded them a year ago.

            NO. 6 IOWA 86, NO. 2 INDIANA 85

            IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Caitlin Clark’s buzzer-beating 3-pointer lifted Iowa to a win over Indiana.

            Clark, who scored 34 points and added nine rebounds and nine assists, took the inbound pass from Kate Martin with 1.5 seconds left, dribbled once, and took an off-balance shot from the right side that rolled in as the horn sounded.

            Indiana had held the Hawkeyes without a field goal in the final 1:30, taking an 85-83 lead on Mackenzie Holmes’ two free throws.

            The Hawkeyes (23-6, 15-3 Big Ten), denied a chance to share the Big Ten title after Tuesday’s 96-68 loss to Maryland, snapped the 14-game winning streak of the Hoosiers (26-2, 16-2) and finished in a tie with Maryland for second place in the conference.

            Holmes led Indiana with 21 points.

            BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Angel Reese had 23 points and 26 rebounds to tie Sylvia Fowles’ LSU record of 27 double-doubles in a season, and the Tigers topped Mississippi State.

            Alexis Morris also scored 23 for LSU (27-1, 15-1 SEC) and nearly had three more when she hit a more than half-court shot moments after the third quarter expired. LaDazhia Williams added 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting for the Tigers, whose regular-season record matched the program’s best, set in the 2004-05 season by a squad starring Seimone Augustus.

            JerKaila Jordan, a New Orleans native who’s been among the SEC’s most productive players this month, scored 16 for Mississippi State (20-9, 9-7), which had won five of its previous six before visiting an LSU team whose only loss this season came at unbeaten and top-ranked South Carolina.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822511,No. 20 Providence routs Georgetown 88-68; Croswell scores 25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — With his team facing early foul problems, Providence coach Ed Cooley had to do what he thinks is the norm in college basketball today: He turned to his “senior citizens,” and they delivered.

            Ed Croswell scored a career-high 25 points and No. 20 Providence easily dispatched last-place Georgetown 88-68 on Sunday despite leading scorer Bryce Hopkins matching his season low with six points.

            The Friars (21-8, 13-5) got double-digit performances from Jared Bynum, who had 18 points, and Noah Locke and Devin Carter, who each added 12. That helped Providence bounce back from its largest loss of the season — an 87-69 defeat at No. 18 UConn on Wednesday — as it continues to position itself for one of the top seeds in the Big East Tournament.











            “We look around college basketball right now, because of COVID, we have two more years of having basically senior citizens playing on the court,” Cooley said.

            “A lot of these teams are just old, and that experience just shows this late in the season.”

            Croswell, Bynum and Locke are all fifth-year seniors who started their college careers elsewhere. Clifton Moore, another fifth-year player who played at two different schools and averages 4.9 points, scored eight points in a season-high 26 minutes with Hopkins on the bench.

            Primo Spears had 26 points to lead Georgetown (7-23, 2-17), which has lost 13 straight games against AP Top 25 teams dating back to its surprising 2021 Big East Tournament championship under coach Patrick Ewing. The Hoyas also have lost their last 11 games at home to ranked opponents, last beating then-No. 25 Creighton on Jan. 15, 2020.

            Hopkins, who was averaging 16.8 points per game, was whistled for three fouls in a 50-second span within the first four minutes and quickly found a seat on the Friars’ bench. He scored just two first-half points.

            With the Kentucky transfer stuck on the sideline, the Friars went on a 24-7 run over the next eight minutes to turn a 9-8 deficit into a 32-16 lead. Providence took a 46-27 lead into halftime behind 15 points from Croswell while Carter added 10. The Friars held the Hoyas to 33% shooting while shooting 49%.

            Georgetown opened the second half on a 12-3 run fueled by four 3-pointers to pull within 49-39. The Hoyas would never get closer and trailed by as many as 27 after two Croswell free throws with 10:57 remaining. Croswell added 13 rebounds and had a career-high six assists.

            “Ed Croswell played probably his best game he’s played for us here,” Cooley said. “Just how far he’s come when he came from La Salle and his hard work really showed today.""

            BIG PICTURE

            Providence: With two games remaining, the Friars have a chance to break the school record for conference wins in a season, which was set in 2021-22 when they finished 14-3. Cooley has guided Providence to double-digit conference wins in eight of the last 10 seasons.

            Georgetown: The Hoyas finished the home portion of their schedule at 5-12, setting a program record for most home losses in a season. The previous record of 11 home losses was set last season.

            HOMECOMING

            Bynum, who is from nearby Largo, Maryland, had another big game at Georgetown in hitting six 3-pointers to account for all of his points. Last season, Bynum posted career highs in points (32) and 3-pointers (7) at Georgetown.

            “He’s from the area, so we know every time he plays against us he feels some sort of way about us,” Ewing said.

            “Unfortunately, he was able to make some great shots and get it going.”

            ILLNESS ISSUES

            Georgetown senior center Qudus Wahab, the Hoyas' leading rebounder, participated in senior day activities in uniform before the game but did not appear on the Hoyas' bench until the second half, when he was wearing a suit. He was officially ruled out with an illness at halftime.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822512,"Barcelona stunned by 1-0 loss at Almeria, fails to grow lead","BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — A trip to Almeria offered a perfect chance for Barcelona to deal a major blow to Real Madrid’s Spanish title defense and move past its still-stinging elimination from the Europa League.

            But with Xavi Hernández feeling compelled to rest some of his best players, Barcelona put in what its coach admitted was the “worst game of the season.”

            The 1-0 shock loss at Almeria let second-place Madrid, which drew 1-1 with Atletico Madrid the day before, stay seven points behind Barcelona.











            Barcelona was unable to mount a credible fightback despite having more than an hour to respond to striker El Bilal Touré’s goal and flopped to the first-ever loss to Almeria in their 16th meeting.

            “It was a difficult game and a tough day for us,” Xavi said. “We are still leaders at seven points ahead, but we did not play like we should have. It was our worst game of the season. I think we had some fatigue, that is why we rotated our starting lineup, but we missed a golden chance to go up 10 points.”

            Barcelona hadn’t lost in 13 league games, with only one draw and 12 wins going back to its last defeat at Madrid in October.

            Barcelona will now have to regroup for Thursday’s visit to Madrid in the semifinals of the Copa del Rey.

            The unexpected defeat on Sunday came after a 2-1 loss at Manchester United eliminated Barcelona from the Europa League — after it had failed to advance from the Champions League group phase for a second consecutive year. The exit from Europe’s second-tier competition left Barcelona with the Spanish league and domestic cup titles to play for as it tries to make good on its investment in new players last summer using cash it generated from the sale of future television revenues and other assets.

            Almeria moved out of the relegation zone after earning one of its biggest wins.

            Almeria coach Rubi Ferrer credited his players for “working, working, working"" and restricting Barcelona's movement.

            “We did an extraordinary job,” Rubi said about his team that withstood a final bombardment of crosses by Barcelona. Goalkeeper Fernando Martínez had surprisingly little work to do.

            “Our game plan worked to perfection,"" Rubi said. ¨We are going to remember this game for a long time.”

            Nestled between trips to United and Madrid, the game at a modest Almeria side that was promoted this season seemed like a good time for Xavi to rest some of his first-choice players.

            Defenders Jules Koundé, Ronald Araújo and Alejando Balde and forward Raphinha began the game on the bench. Sergi Roberto, Éric García, Jordi Alba and Ferrán Torres started in their place.

            Barcelona still had Robert Lewandowski, Sergio Busquets and Frenkie de Jong on the field from kickoff along with Gavi, back from a one-game suspension that meant he missed the game at Old Trafford.

            The result, however, was a third-rate performance.

            After a complacent start by Barcelona, Almeria struck in the 24th minute on a quick attack after an inspired Rodrigo Ely tackled Gavi in the hosts’ area and booted a long ball forward for Touré to control. The 21-year-old Mali forward exchanged quick passes with Luis Suárez and blasted a powerful strike over Marc-Andre ter Stegen and in off the crossbar.

            Xavi sent Raphinha on at halftime, with Araújo and Marcos Alonso soon following, but Almeria held firm.

            Gavi’s shot blocked by Ely in the 59th and a shot by substitute Pablo Torre in the 82nd easily grabbed by Fernando ended up being the most that a disappointing Barcelona could muster.

            The stumble at Almeria came amid Barcelona facing intense scrutiny after it became known that Spanish state prosecutors are probing the payment of millions of euros to a company that belonged to the vice president of Spain’s refereeing committee. Barcelona says the money was for technical reports on referees and youth players, and denies any attempt to influence referees.

            OSASUNA WINS

            Osasuna won 3-2 at Sevilla to carry its winning momentum into the Copa del Rey semifinals against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.

            Abde Ezzalzouli scored the winner in the 85th to ensure Osasuna rose above Bilbao into seventh place.

            OWN-GOALS

            Girona was helped by two own-goals to win 3-2 at Bilbao after both Óscar de Marcos and Mikel Vesga sent the ball into their net.

            Midfielder Aleix García rifled in a fourth-minute opener for Girona and two of his crosses ended up being put in the hosts' goal by De Marcos and Vesga.

            VEIGA DOUBLE

            Celta Vigo’s 20-year-old Gabri Veiga scored twice in a 3-0 win at home over Valladolid.

            With eight goals from his position in midfield, Veiga has emerged as one of the Spanish league’s revelations.

(AP) — Jahmir Young scored 18 points and Don Carey added 13 to help Maryland wrap up an undefeated home season in Big Ten play with a 75-59 victory over No. 21 Northwestern on Sunday.

            The Terrapins (20-9, 11-7) finished 16-1 overall at home in Kevin Willard’s first season as their coach, and they used unusually impressive 3-point shooting to turn back the Wildcats (20-9, 11-7). Maryland’s win also clinched at least a share of the Big Ten title for No. 5 Purdue.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822514,Dylan Cozens scores 3 in Sabres' 7-4 rout of Capitals,"BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The familiar and frustrating February swoons the Buffalo Sabres have best been known for just might be a thing of the past.

            With the calendar approaching March, the NHL’s youngest team at the start of the season continues showing signs of making an actual playoff push in a bid to end an 11-year playoff drought, the longest in league history.

            The latest glimpse of the Sabres staying in contention came Sunday, when Buffalo overcame a lineup missing two of its top three leading scorers — forward Alex Tuch and defenseman Rasmus Dahlin — in a 7-4 rout of the Washington Capitals.











            Dylan Cozens enjoyed the first three-goal game of his career and added an assist. More important, Buffalo had 12 players register at least a point, including Tage Thompson, with his team-leading 40th goal. 

            “I think everyone stepped up. We knew that was a big game,” Thompson said. “We have a group that’s really hungry in here to succeed. And I think everyone in here takes that to heart.”

            Tuch will miss at least two weeks with a lower-body injury. Dahlin, who is tied with Tuch for second on the team with 62 points, is listed as day to day as he rests a nagging injury.

            Jeff Skinner, Zemgus Girgensons and Vinnie Hinostroza also scored in a game the Sabres broke open with four goals in a seven-minute span in the second period.

            In doing so, the Sabres followed a 6-3 dud of a loss to Toronto on Tuesday to rattle off three straight wins and keep pace in a tightly contested race for the Eastern Conference’s two wild-card spots. Buffalo (31-23-4) opened the day sitting ninth in the East, with three points separating seventh and the suddenly slumping 12th-place Capitals.

            The Capitals followed a promising 6-3 win over the New York Rangers to lose for the seventh time in eight outings.

            “Its just not good enough. The consistency of attention to detail for us right now has to be at an all-time high,” T.J. Oshie said. “Yesterday it was there for us. Today it wasn’t. You’re not going to last much longer being inconsistent like this.”

            Alex Ovechkin scored his team-leading 33rd goal and registered his 1,467th career point to tie Stan Mikita for 16th on the NHL list. Dylan Strome and Oshie had a goal an assist apiece, and Sonny Milano also scored for the Capitals.

            Darcy Kuemper was yanked after allowing five goals on 19 shots with 9:53 left in the second period. He was replaced by Charlie Lindgren, who allowed two goals on 18 shots.

            The Sabres, meantime, gained contributions from a reshuffled lineup. Rookie Jack Quinn, filling Tuch's spot on the top line, had two assists, while Hinostroza had a goal and assist a day after being recalled from the minors.

            “I think what it says is, psychologically, that doesn’t affect them,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “They believe in their own ability and their ability to rise, and we’re gonna need guys to rise when players are absent, specifically the caliber of Tuch and Dahlin.”

            Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen stopped 26 shots for Buffalo.

            With the game tied at 2, Skinner scored the go-ahead goal to spark Buffalo’s four-goal outburst 5:49 into the second period, when he stuffed in a puck that got in behind Kuemper after he got a piece of Mattias Samuelsson’s shot from in front.

            Kyle Okposo forced a turnover at the right boards to set up Girgensons alone in front 2:47 later, and Kuemper was chased after Hinostroza wrapped a puck behind the goalie at the 10:07 mark of the second period.

Rookie Jack Quinn, filling Tuch's spot on the top line, had two assists, while Hinostroza had a goal and assist a day after being recalled from the minors.“I think what it says is, psychologically, that doesn’t affect them,” Sabres coach Don Granato said. “They believe in their own ability and their ability to rise, and we’re gonna need guys to rise when players are absent, specifically the caliber of Tuch and Dahlin.”Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen stopped 26 shots for Buffalo.With the game tied at 2, Skinner scored the go-ahead goal to spark Buffalo’s four-goal outburst 5:49 into the second period, when he stuffed in a puck that got in behind Kuemper after he got a piece of Mattias Samuelsson’s shot from in front.Kyle Okposo forced a turnover at the right boards to set up Girgensons alone in front 2:47 later, and Kuemper was chased after Hinostroza wrapped a puck behind the goalie at the 10:07 mark of the second period.UP NEXTCapitals: Head west for a three-game swing beginning at Anaheim on Wednesday.Sabres: Host Columbus on Tuesday.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822515,Bucks outlast Suns 104-101 for 14th consecutive victory,"MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo's absence couldn't prevent the Milwaukee Bucks from extending the longest winning streak in the NBA this season.

            Jrue Holiday scored 33 points and produced a critical steal, Brook Lopez made a tiebreaking layup with 24.8 seconds left and the Bucks edged the Phoenix Suns 104-101 on Sunday for their 14th consecutive victory.

            The rematch of the 2021 NBA Finals didn't include either Antetokounmpo or new Suns superstar Kevin Durant, but it still featured 14 lead changes and plenty of late drama.











            “Both teams obviously have history,” Lopez said. “Those are the fun games, where the refs let it get physical a little bit, you can really go after each other. It was a great atmosphere.”

            Durant has yet to appear in a game for the Suns and hasn’t played since Jan. 8 because of a sprained right medial collateral ligament. Antetokounmpo was out with a bruised right quadriceps after leaving in the first quarter of the Bucks’ 128-99 victory over the Miami Heat on Friday.

            “It’s enough where he can’t play today, but I think we’re also confident that this is just a fairly common occurrence in our league,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said before the game. “You hit knees, you knock, sometimes it takes a day or two, and it’s really nothing more than that.""

            Holiday led all scorers, while Lopez had 22 points and 12 rebounds. Khris Middleton added 11 points and 10 rebounds.

            Devin Booker scored 24 points, Deandre Ayton had 22 and Chris Paul added 18 for Phoenix. Ayton also had 11 rebounds.

            After Booker made a game-tying jumper with 33 seconds left, the Bucks called a timeout and got the ball to Middleton, who found Lopez for the go-ahead layup.

            Holiday said he initially expected Middleton to shoot the ball.

            “It's a great play,” Holiday said. “At first, I kind of saw it, but I thought that Khris was going to shoot it because that's just what ‘K’ does. But he's a playmaker. He's not just a scorer.”

            Phoenix called a timeout and went back to Booker, who lost possession as Holiday forced the steal and Lopez got the loose ball.

            “That’s just the defender he is, the player he is,” Lopez said of Holiday. “He’s one of the top two-way players in the league, at least the top three. Just absolutely phenomenal. Just the best two-way player in the league. Those are the plays he makes just time and time again.”

            Booker said there was contact on the play, but no foul was called, a reflection of the game's physical nature.

            “I was touched,"" Booker said. ""But I did the same thing to Jrue on the other end. On that play, he hit my arm. But it’s playoff-type basketball and refs are going to let things go. And that was that.”

            Joe Ingles made the first of two free throws to extend Milwaukee’s lead to 103-100 with 11.3 seconds left. Ingles missed the second free throw and the ball initially was ruled out of bounds on Milwaukee.

            But after Budenholzer challenged the call, replays determined the ball actually went out on Phoenix's Terrence Ross. Holiday sank the first of two free throws with 10 seconds left but also missed the second, making the score 104-100.

            Booker was fouled on a 3 by Ingles with 0.9 seconds left but missed the first free throw. Booker made the second and intentionally missed the third, but Lopez got the rebound to seal the victory.

            TIP-INS

            Suns: Booker increased his career point total to 12,143 to overtake Shawn Marion (12,134) for fourth place on the Suns' all-time list. The Suns' career scoring leader is Walter Davis, with 15,666 points from 1977-88. ... The Suns lost for just the fifth time in their last 17 games.

            Bucks: Wesley Matthews missed a second straight game due to a right calf strain. He also won't be available Tuesday at Brooklyn. ... Pat Connaughton returned after missing the Heat game with a sore left calf, but he went scoreless in 13 minutes. ... Ex-Suns forward Jae Crowder had seven points. He made two 3-pointers during Milwaukee's fourth-quarter comeback. ... The Bucks’ franchise record for consecutive wins is 20 straight during their 1970-71 championship season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822516,AP PHOTOS:  Greeks revel in Carnival after pandemic pause,"NAXOS, Greece (AP) — Throngs of revelers across Greece attended end-of-Carnival celebrations this weekend for the first time in four years.

            The COVID-19 pandemic prevented the festivities held before the beginning of Lent in 2020, 2021 and 2022.

            On the island of Naxos, which hosts some of the most colorful Carnival events in Greece, the number of young people taking part soared this year.











            Many of the customs observed are based on rituals from celebrations of the changing seasons that predate antiquity, while others are more recent.

            In the latter category is the Lampadiforia, or Torch Parade, held on Naxos that features a procession of young men and women holding torches on poles and with their faces painted to resemble black-and-white masks.

            It first took place on the Saturday night preceding Lent in 1994, dreamed up by young members of a local cinema club. About 50 of them went out into the street that year, screaming and dancing while holding torches, and startling other people as they paraded toward the Temple of Apollo. 

            This year, well over 2,000 torch bearers joined the parade, dancing to the beat of drums along the maze of the narrow streets in old town Naxos to a central square where a scarecrow was burned.

            In other parts of Naxos and mainland Greece, young men wearing cow bells and carrying a phallic symbol — a common feature of ancient rites celebrating spring — danced their way to village squares on Sunday.

            Other customs included young men wearing folk costumes and holding thick canes making their way to neighboring villages, where they invite local women to dance. The women, in turn, offer the men local delicacies and wine.

            In Orthodox Christian countries, Lent, as well as Easter, are celebrated at different times than in primarily Catholic countries because they use different calendars. Greek Orthodox Easter is usually a week later than Catholic Easter.

            Carnival celebrations also took place this weekend in Cyprus.

            SPAIN

            Getafe visits Villarreal in the Spanish league with both sides in need of a win. Quique Setién’s Villarreal is in danger of falling completely out of contention for a top-four finish and a resulting Champions League berth. Four straight losses have left the “Yellow Submarine” in midtable. Despite Villarreal's poor form, Getafe coach Quique Sánchez Flores tells his team to be wary because “teams that don’t win are wounded beasts.” Getafe is unbeaten in three games but still in the relegation zone. 











            ITALY

            Lazio and Fiorentina are both in action after each club qualified for the round of 16 in the Europa Conference League. Lazio hosts a Sampdoria side in crisis and is looking to move into the top four and the Champions League places. Fiorentina looks to revive its Serie A campaign in a visit to relegation-threatened Hellas Verona.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822519,"Walter Mirisch, Oscar-winning producer, dead at 101","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Walter Mirisch, the astute and Oscar winning film producer who oversaw such classics as “Some Like It Hot,” “West Side Story” and “In the Heat of the Night,” has died of natural causes, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Saturday. He was 101. 

            Mirisch died on Friday in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the academy's CEO Bill Kramer and its president Janet Yang.

            “Walter was a true visionary, both as a producer and as an industry leader,” they said, noting he had served as academy president and an academy governor for many years. ""His passion for filmmaking and the Academy never wavered, and he remained a dear friend and advisor. We send our love and support to his family during this difficult time.”











            Mirisch received the best picture Academy Award for 1967's ""In the Heat of the Night,"" and the company run by him and his brothers also produced the best-picture Oscar winners ""The Apartment"" and ""West Side Story.""

            Born eight years before the first Academy Awards ceremony, he served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1973 to 1977 and received two honorary Oscars, in 1978 and 1983, for his body of work and his humanitarian efforts.

            As a producer, Mirisch aggressively recruited top filmmakers such as Billy Wilder and Norman Jewison, then gave them freedom to craft the movies as they saw fit.

            ""We offered these filmmakers what they needed,"" he told the Los Angeles Times in 1983. ""Billy could call me up and say, `I'd next like to do a picture about so-and-so' — and that's all we'd need to know. ... We became, in effect, partners with our directors.""

            His company's regular stable of directors included not only Wilder and Jewison, but Blake Edwards and John Sturges. The company also produced movies by John Ford, John Huston, William Wyler, George Roy Hill and Hal Ashby.

            Mirisch entered the movie business in his teens, advancing from usher to management jobs with a theater chain before going on to production work on low-budget action flicks and Westerns in the late 1940s.

            The company he founded in 1957 with his brother Marvin and half brother Harold was one of the most successful independent production outfits to arise from the old studio system as television cut into movie attendance.

            The Mirischs made a string of hits from the 1950s to the 1970s, among them ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" ""The Pink Panther"" and its sequel, ""A Shot in the Dark.""

            Their company started with a handful of Westerns before producing 1959's ""Some Like It Hot,"" the Wilder comedy with Marilyn Monroe co-starring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as cross-dressing musicians running from the mob.

            Mirisch was willing to take on unusual projects. A Harvard-trained business executive, he efficiently oversaw the commerce side of things, allowing his filmmakers to concentrate on their movies.

            Elmore Leonard — the crime novelist and screenwriter on two Mirisch productions, 1974's ""Mr. Majestyk"" and the 1987 TV movie ""Desperado"" — dedicated his Hollywood satire ""Get Shorty"" to Mirisch, calling him ""one of the good guys.""

            Mirisch was also among a handful of filmmakers Sidney Poitier acknowledged in his speech at the 2002 Academy Awards when he accepted an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement.

            ""Those filmmakers persevered, speaking through their art to the best in all of us,"" said Poitier, who starred in Mirisch's ""In the Heat of the Night"" and the sequel ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!""

            The Mirisch brothers adjusted their management style film by film, depending on the level of oversight they felt a director wanted or needed. In a 1972 interview in the journal “Films and Filming,” Mirisch said some directors worked well as their own producers, while others showed little interest beyond the actual filmmaking.

            ""We've worked with brilliant directors and producer-directors, and I must say that the relationship with each of them has been entirely different,"" he said.

            A team for most of their careers, the Mirisch brothers also worked in theater. Before joining the Allied Artists production company in the 1940s, Walter worked as a producer and later head of production and Harold and Marvin had administrative jobs.

            While at Allied, Walter produced both Westerns and a series of low-budget titles in the ""Bomba the Jungle Boy"" series that starred Johnny Sheffield, who had played Boy in the ""Tarzan"" movies of the 1940s.

            After his oldest brother, Harold, died in 1968, the surviving siblings continued their company with Marvin as chairman and Walter, the youngest brother, in charge of production. Marvin died in 2002.

            Walter Mirisch continued to produce theatrical movies into the 1980s. Although the quality and commercial success of his films generally declined, there were still some hits, including Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe for “Same Time Next Year.” Other films that came late in his career included ""Midway,"" ""Gray Lady Down,"" and the 1979 version of ""Dracula."" He was also executive producer on a few television projects in the 1990s.

            Walter Mortimer Mirisch was born in New York City on Nov. 8, 1921. After studying at City College of New York, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1942 and a graduate degree in business from Harvard in 1943.

            In 1947, Mirisch married Patricia Kahan, who preceded him in death. They had three children, Anne, Andrew and Lawrence.

            In lieu of flowers, the family requested donations to the Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF).

            A memorial service will be held at a future date.

The company also produced movies by John Ford, John Huston, William Wyler, George Roy Hill and Hal Ashby.Mirisch entered the movie business in his teens, advancing from usher to management jobs with a theater chain before going on to production work on low-budget action flicks and Westerns in the late 1940s.The company he founded in 1957 with his brother Marvin and half brother Harold was one of the most successful independent production outfits to arise from the old studio system as television cut into movie attendance.The Mirischs made a string of hits from the 1950s to the 1970s, among them ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" ""The Pink Panther"" and its sequel, ""A Shot in the Dark.""Their company started with a handful of Westerns before producing 1959's ""Some Like It Hot,"" the Wilder comedy with Marilyn Monroe co-starring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as cross-dressing musicians running from the mob.Mirisch was willing to take on unusual projects. A Harvard-trained business executive, he efficiently oversaw the commerce side of things, allowing his filmmakers to concentrate on their movies.Elmore Leonard — the crime novelist and screenwriter on two Mirisch productions, 1974's ""Mr. Majestyk"" and the 1987 TV movie ""Desperado"" — dedicated his Hollywood satire ""Get Shorty"" to Mirisch, calling him ""one of the good guys.""Mirisch was also among a handful of filmmakers Sidney Poitier acknowledged in his speech at the 2002 Academy Awards when he accepted an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement.""Those filmmakers persevered, speaking through their art to the best in all of us,"" said Poitier, who starred in Mirisch's ""In the Heat of the Night"" and the sequel ""They Call Me Mister Tibbs!""The Mirisch brothers adjusted their management style film by film, depending on the level of oversight they felt a director wanted or needed. In a 1972 interview in the journal “Films and Filming,” Mirisch said some directors worked well as their own producers, while others showed little interest beyond the actual filmmaking.""We've worked with brilliant directors and producer-directors, and I must say that the relationship with each of them has been entirely different,"" he said.A team for most of their careers, the Mirisch brothers also worked in theater. Before joining the Allied Artists production company in the 1940s, Walter worked as a producer and later head of production and Harold and Marvin had administrative jobs.While at Allied, Walter produced both Westerns and a series of low-budget titles in the ""Bomba the Jungle Boy"" series that starred Johnny Sheffield, who had played Boy in the ""Tarzan"" movies of the 1940s.After his oldest brother, Harold, died in 1968, the surviving siblings continued their company with Marvin as chairman and Walter, the youngest brother, in charge of production. Marvin died in 2002.Walter Mirisch continued to produce theatrical movies into the 1980s. Although the quality and commercial success of his films generally declined, there were still some hits, including Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe for “Same Time Next Year.” Other films that came late in his career included ""Midway,"" ""Gray Lady Down,"" and the 1979 version of ""Dracula."" He was also executive producer on a few television projects in the 1990s.Walter Mortimer Mirisch was born in New York City on Nov. 8, 1921. After studying at City College of New York, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin in Madison in 1942 and a graduate degree in business from Harvard in 1943.In 1947, Mirisch married Patricia Kahan, who preceded him in death. They had three children, Anne, Andrew and Lawrence.In lieu of flowers, the family requested donations to the Motion Picture and Television Fund (MPTF).A memorial service will be held at a future date.___Former Associated Press writer David Germain contributed biographical information to this report.",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822521,Leipzig signs Seiwald in 20th deal with Salzburg,"LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) — Leipzig is signing yet another player from sister club Salzburg after agreeing a five-year deal with Austria midfielder Nicolas Seiwald.

            The 21-year-old Seiwald will join ahead of the 2023-24 season, the Bundesliga club announced Sunday.

            Seiwald will be the 20th player to switch from Salzburg to fellow Red Bull-backed Leipzig since the German club was founded by the energy drinks manufacturer in 2009.











            Leipzig had already said Slovenian forward Benjamin Šeško will join for next season, following the same path as 18 other players including Naby Keita, Dayot Upamecano, Konrad Laimer, Amadou Haidara and goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.

            “Nici is a tough-tackling, box-to-box player who has undergone a tremendous development in the last few years,” Leipzig sporting director Max Eberl said. “Despite being just 21 years old, he has already been able to amass plenty of experience at the senior level and been able to prove himself at the highest level in the Champions League.” 

            Seiwald, who came through Salzburg’s youth setup, has made 95 competitive appearances for the club including 16 games in the Champions League. He made 10 appearances for Austria since making his international debut in October 2021.

Judy Chu on Sunday, saying it was abhorrent and unacceptable for a GOP lawmaker to question her loyalty to the United States based on her Chinese heritage.

            “One of my colleagues, unfortunately, attacked Judy Chu, the first Chinese American congresswoman in the United States Congress, saying that somehow she’s not loyal to the United States. I find that offensive as an Asian American myself,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the panel, about the comments last week from Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas.

            “We should not question anybody’s loyalty to the United States,” Gallagher said. “That is out of bounds. It’s beyond the pale.”

            In a Fox News interview last week, Gooden criticized Chu for her defense of Biden economic appointee Dominic Ng, who the president named to the business advisory council of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Gooden questioned either Chu's “loyalty or competence.” He also suggested that Chu, a California Democrat, should not have a security clearance or access to classified briefings. 

            Chu, the chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus who was born in Los Angeles, called Gooden's comments “racist,"" saying the attacks on her and Ng relied on false information from right-wing media.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822524,Machado rips RBI double after agreeing to $350M deal,"PEORIA, Ariz. (AP) — Manny Machado continues to be a very rich man. He also is still a very good hitter.

            Machado ripped an RBI double on Sunday, the same day he agreed to a new $350 million, 11-year contract that will keep him with the San Diego Padres through 2033, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.

            The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Machado must pass a physical before the deal is finalized.











            Machado got a big cheer from Padres fans on a chilly afternoon in Arizona before a spring training game against the Diamondbacks. The third baseman struck out in his first at-bat before lacing a line-drive double off the base of the left-field wall in San Diego's nine-run second inning of an 18-6 victory.

            Machado finished 2 for 3 at the plate, adding a single in the third.

            The 30-year-old slugger had said that after this season he planned to opt out of the $300 million, 10-year free agent deal he signed in 2019. With the $120 million he already has received, the new deal increases the free-spending Padres’ commitment to Machado to $470 million over 15 years.

            Machado finished second in the NL MVP race last year. He’ll anchor a superstar-laden lineup that includes Xander Bogaerts, Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr., who can return on April 20 from an 80-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs.

            Machado batted .298 with 32 home runs and 102 RBIs last season.

            BACK IN BLACK (AND ORANGE)

            Michael Conforto saw his first game action in more than a year and went 1 for 3 as the San Francisco Giants’ designated hitter against the Cincinnati Reds. He singled his final time up. 

            “Felt good to be back. I definitely had some nerves. After the first at-bat most of them went away,” he said.

            Conforto, who turns 30 on Wednesday, hadn’t played since Oct. 3, 2021, when he was with the New York Mets. He missed all of 2022 after having right shoulder surgery but signed a two-year, $36 million contract with the Giants in the offseason.

            He said the plan is to DH for a couple of weeks, then play some outfield.

            “Really what matters is getting to opening day healthy,"" Conforto said. ""But today was good.”

            CAPTAIN JUDGE

            Yankees slugger Aaron Judge received several ovations from the crowd at Steinbrenner Field before his first game in pinstripes as the new team captain.

            “I felt it with the intro, I felt it on defense, I felt it stepping up to the plate,” the reigning AL MVP said. 

            Judge was a free agent after last season but ended up signing a $360 million, nine-year contract with the Yankees. He also was named the team's first captain since Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in 2014.

            “He loves the game, and obviously being back here, to be able to put the uni on and go out, I think it was something he was looking forward to,” Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.

            TROPHY DO-OVER

            Marlins right-hander Sandy Alcantara received his NL Cy Young Award trophy on Sunday for the second time – and this time he has no reason to give it back.

            “I want to keep it for the rest of my life,” Alcantara said. “I think that is for my mom.”

            When the Baseball Writers' Association of America originally presented Alcantara with the trophy at its January awards dinner, the plaque language dubbed both Alcantara and AL winner Justin Verlander the “most valuble” pitchers in their leagues, leaving out the second “a” in “valuable.""

            The new plaque contains the more up-to-date “most outstanding” phrasing — and it’s spelled correctly.

            Marlins owner Bruce Sherman presented the award to Alcantara at home plate before Miami’s spring training home opener against St. Louis.

            “I didn’t expect that I was going to get my award today,” Alcantara said. “I thought I’d go outside and have fun with my teammates. But when I saw the surprise, it made my day today.”

            RULES, RULES, RULES

            Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said Major League Baseball is providing updates — nearly in real time — on the rules changes package that is making this spring training unique.

            The two major changes are a pitch clock and a limit on extreme infield shifts.

            “They did a really nice job of sending out a memo this morning with all the things that took place yesterday and questions that players and managers that just had to be addressed in order that you can cover it with your staff and club as you feel appropriate,"" Marmol said. ""So we did that with our staff and brought two different points with our players because they’ve done a really good job of communication.”

            The new rules already had an effect during Saturday's first full day of games: Cal Conley of the Atlanta Braves thought he had just won the game with a two-out, bases-loaded walk. But umpire John Libka ruled that Conley wasn’t set in the box as the pitch clock wound under eight seconds.

            He was ruled out. The game ended in a tie.

            Braves manager Brian Snitker said Sunday that Conley's situation was part of a learning process.

            “It’s baseball. You’re going to see something you’ve never seen before,” Snitker said. ""All to the point where I said I’m glad we’re starting these things when we did. I’m glad we didn’t wait until March 15 or something where we can have a whole month of this, and hopefully in a few weeks that this thing is just normal.”

            There were more hiccups on Sunday throughout the Cactus and Grapefruit League games, but most took the changes in stride. 

            Rockies reliever Daniel Bard was called for a ball after throwing a warmup pitch after the 30-second deadline heading into an inning. The 30-second mark before innings was also a source of confusion during the Cardinals-Marlins game. Two Cardinals pitchers were called for balls before the start of innings before, according to Marmol, the umpires gathered and realized they were interpreting the rule incorrectly.

            “It’s spring training for everybody,” Marmol said. “Those things will get ironed out before we get out of here.”

            According to Major League Baseball, there were 69 pitch-timer violations through the first 35 spring training games over the weekend — including 35 violations in 16 games Sunday.

            SCHERZER FINE WITH CLOCK

            New York Mets right-hander Max Scherzer described pitching under the new major league rules as a “cat-and-mouse” game. 

            Contrary to previous years, Scherzer feels the pitcher finally has gained control. 

            In his first start of the Grapefruit League schedule, Scherzer was touched for a run in the second inning but struck out five while working the first two innings of the Mets’ 6-3 win over Washington.

            “Really, the power the pitcher has now — I can totally dictate pace,” the three-time Cy Young Award winner said. “The rule change of the hitter having only one timeout changes the complete dynamic of the hitter-and-pitcher dynamic. Yeah, I love it.”

            Washington’s Michael Chavis, the second hitter in the second inning, stepped out of the box when he felt Scherzer was taking too long. That was fine with Scherzer. 

            He held the ball for more than 10 seconds before delivering the next pitch as Chavis had to remain in the batter’s box, no matter the level of his impatience. The fact that Chavis ultimately singled to right was immaterial. Scherzer had imposed his will.

            “It’s a cat-and-mouse game,” Scherzer said. “There’s rules and I’ll operate within whatever the rules are.""

            TWINS ADD SANTANA

            The Minnesota Twins claimed right-handed pitcher Dennis Santana off waivers from the Atlanta Braves.

            The 26-year-old threw in 63 games, including one start, for the Texas Rangers last season, going 3-8 with a 5.22 ERA. To make room for Santana on the 40-man roster, the Twins put infielder Royce Lewis on the 60-day injured list.

            Lewis is recovering from right knee surgery.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822525,"Clark's 3-pointer lifts No. 6 Iowa over No. 2 Indiana, 86-85","IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Caitlin Clark’s buzzer-beating 3-pointer lifted No. 6 Iowa to an 86-85 win over No. 2 Indiana on Sunday.

            Clark, who scored 34 points and added nine rebounds and nine assists, took the inbound pass from Kate Martin with 1.5 seconds left while coming off a screen from Monika Czinano. Her off-balance shot from the right side that rolled in as the horn sounded.

            “Caitlin, we knew she had it the whole time,” Iowa coach Lisa Bluder said of the shot.











            “Monika set a really good screen,” Clark said. “I came off it, and I was probably more open than I should have been. There was not much time to find the room and try to get it off at the same time, but I hoped for the best. It kind of spun around for a second.”

            Indiana coach Teri Moren said Chloe Moore-McNeil was assigned to guard Clark, but she slipped coming around the Czinano screen.

            “I don’t know if she got her foot tangled or if she fell on her own,” Moren said. “I think would have been different if she would have been able to stay on her feet.”

            Indiana had held the Hawkeyes without a field goal in the final 1:30, taking an 85-83 lead on Mackenzie Holmes’ two free throws. Bluder called a timeout and advanced the ball to midcourt to set up the game-winning shot.

            The clock originally had just eight-tenths of a second on it when Holmes was going to go to the line, but after a replay review seven-tenths of a second were added.

            “They can go to the monitor any time in the last two minutes, and I'm so glad they did,” Bluder said.

            Clark lobbied for the review.

            “I knew to go tell the ref like you have to go look and see if the time is right,” Clark said. “And, you know, they basically doubled (the time) at that point. There’s a big difference between 0.8 and 1.5 (seconds) for me to get a shot off like that.”

            Moren said had there been the original time, she might have had Holmes intentionally miss the second free throw once the Hoosiers had the lead.

            “We felt like we needed both of them, because 1.5 is a lot of time,” Moren said.

            The Hawkeyes (23-6, 15-3 Big Ten), denied a chance to share the Big Ten title after Tuesday’s 96-68 loss to Maryland, snapped the 14-game winning streak of the Hoosiers (26-2, 16-2) and finished in a tie with Maryland for second place in the conference.

            “I told the team we couldn’t be the Big Ten champs, but we could beat the Big Ten champs,” Bluder said.

            Clark had scored on the final plays of every quarter. She had layups at the end of the first and second quarters, and made two free throws in the final seconds of the third quarter.

            “It's not anything I shy away from, if you want to be the best player on one of the best teams,” Clark said of being the choice to get the ball in the closing seconds. “I've been in plenty that haven't gone my way, but that's just basketball.”

            Martin had 19 points for the Hawkeyes. Czinano had 13.

            Holmes led Indiana with 21 points. Moore-McNeil and Sydney Parrish had 18. Grace Berger had 16.

            BIG PICTURE

            Indiana: The Hoosiers had every answer for the Hawkeyes throughout the game after falling behind by 11 points twice in the first half. Now they head to the Big Ten Tournament as the top seed. “The ending of this chapter wasn't what we wanted, but another book comes out next week,” Moren said.

            Iowa: Their chance at sharing the Big Ten title was gone after Tuesday’s loss at Maryland, and this game appeared to have gotten away when the Hoosiers had the lead late. But Clark, who was 12 of 22 from the field, made the biggest play at the end.

            His family said in a statement that Pinsent died in his sleep Saturday.

            “Gordon Pinsent was one of Canada's most iconic actors,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday on Twitter. “He was passionate, captivating and endlessly talented.”











            Pinsent worked for decades in radio, television and movies. In 2008, he received the Academy of Canadian Television and Cinema's Genie Award for best actor in a leading role for “Away From Her."" He played a husband losing his wife not only to Alzheimer’s but also to another man.

            Canadian filmmaker Sarah Polley directed “Away From Her,” starring Pinsent and Julie Christie, which premiered at film festivals in 2006 before its theatrical release in 2007. 

            “Gordon had an enormous capacity for joy in absolutely everything he did,” Polley said Sunday on Twitter. ""It was infectious and educational. There wasn’t a moment without a twinkle of mischief and a determination to enjoy the moment.”

            Pinsent was born in Grand Falls, Newfoundland, in 1930, and began acting in his late teens. With his deep baritone voice, Pinsent played in radio drama on the CBC before working in movies and television.

            Pinsent spent about four years in the Canadian Army in the early 1950s. After returning to acting, he appeared on children’s shows in the early 1960s, including CBC’s “The Forest Rangers.” He later appeared in dozens of Canada’s top television shows, including “The Red Green Show,"" and was the voice of the animated elephant King Babar on TV and in a movie.

            He played a role in the 1968 Steve McQueen movie, “The Thomas Crown Affair,” and portrayed the U.S. president in director Joseph Sargent’s 1970 film, “Colossus: The Forbin Project.” In the 2001 movie “The Shipping News,” Pinsent played newspaperman Billy Pretty, and during filming, he helped other cast members perfect the Newfoundland accent.

            Pinsent starred in “Away From Her” when he was 76. Polley said as she read the Alice Munro short story, “The Bear Came Over The Mountain,” she envisioned a film starring Pinsent.

            Pinsent's own wife of 45 years, actress Charmion King, died of emphysema some months before the mainstream release of “Away From Her,” forcing Pinsent to re-examine the film's themes of quiet despair.

            “It was something I wasn’t necessarily drawing on except in the general sense of how anyone must feel at a certain time of life after spending so many years with a partner,” Pinsent said during a 2007 interview, a few weeks after King’s death.

            “It’s almost impossible to grasp ... how do you prepare?"" he said. ""Where does love go? Where do you go, the leftover?”

            King and Pinsent had one child together, actress Leah Pinsent. He also had two children, Barry and Beverly, from an earlier marriage.

            In 2013, Pinsent starred in Don McKellar’s acclaimed Newfoundland-set comedy “The Grand Seduction,” earning a Canadian Screen Award for best supporting actor. In 2018, he released a short film he wrote, “Martin’s Hagge,” about a middle-aged writer with anxiety and depression.

            “I really love writing ... writing is good, it’s even better than good when you hit those peaks, and it’s the same feeling oddly enough in acting,"" Pinsent said. ""It’s that lovely thing where you get that zone, that peak of joy, and it reminds you of why you started it all.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822542,Marlins’ Sandy Alcantara gets typo-free Cy Young plaque,"JUPITER, Fla. (AP) — Miami Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara received his NL Cy Young Award trophy on Sunday for the second time — and this time he has no reason to give it back.

            “I want to keep it for the rest of my life,” Alcantara said. “I think that is for my mom.”

            When the Baseball Writers’ Association of America originally presented Alcantara with the trophy at its January awards dinner, the plaque dubbed both Alcantara and AL winner Justin Verlander the “most valuble” pitchers in their leagues, leaving out the second “a” in “valuable.”











            Afterward, the group told him it would provide a new one.

            The replacement contains the more up-to-date “most outstanding” phrasing — and it’s spelled correctly.

            Marlins owner Bruce Sherman presented the award to Alcantara at home plate before Miami’s spring training home opener against St. Louis.

            As part of the brief ceremony, the Roger Dean Stadium Chevrolet public address announcer proclaimed that Alcantara was “finally” receiving his award.

            “I didn’t expect that I was going to get my award today,” Alcantara said. “I thought I’d go outside and have fun with my teammates. But when I saw the surprise, it made my day today.”

            Alcantara went 14-9 with a 2.28 ERA in 2022, pitching a league-high 228 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old right-hander expects to contend for the Cy Young again this season.

            “Yes, 100%,” Alcantara said. “If I’m healthy I can do it again.”

(AP) — Miami Marlins ace Sandy Alcantara received his NL Cy Young Award trophy on Sunday for the second time — and this time he has no reason to give it back.“I want to keep it for the rest of my life,” Alcantara said. “I think that is for my mom.”When the Baseball Writers’ Association of America originally presented Alcantara with the trophy at its January awards dinner, the plaque dubbed both Alcantara and AL winner Justin Verlander the “most valuble” pitchers in their leagues, leaving out the second “a” in “valuable.”Afterward, the group told him it would provide a new one.The replacement contains the more up-to-date “most outstanding” phrasing — and it’s spelled correctly.Marlins owner Bruce Sherman presented the award to Alcantara at home plate before Miami’s spring training home opener against St. Louis.As part of the brief ceremony, the Roger Dean Stadium Chevrolet public address announcer proclaimed that Alcantara was “finally” receiving his award.“I didn’t expect that I was going to get my award today,” Alcantara said. “I thought I’d go outside and have fun with my teammates. But when I saw the surprise, it made my day today.”Alcantara went 14-9 with a 2.28 ERA in 2022, pitching a league-high 228 2/3 innings. The 27-year-old right-hander expects to contend for the Cy Young again this season.“Yes, 100%,” Alcantara said. “If I’m healthy I can do it again.”___AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822543,Nicklaus says PGA National will have stronger field in '24,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Jack Nicklaus thinks the Honda Classic should have a chance at a stronger field because of looming changes to the PGA Tour, which he said Sunday would mean Pebble Beach getting elevated status and the tour going to Mexico before the Florida swing.

            Nicklaus, appearing at the final round Sunday at PGA National, said a reworked schedule in 2024 will give South Florida’s lone tour event — by whatever name it will be known — a chance at attracting higher-ranked players.

            None of the top 17 players in the world ranking played Honda this week.











            Nicklaus said the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and the Genesis Invitational at Riviera will be elevated tournaments next year with $20 million purses, while the WM Phoenix Open would lose that status.

            This year, the tour had two elevated events before the Honda, with two more to immediately follow at Bay Hill and The Players Championship.

            Honda is ending its title sponsorship of the tournament at PGA National, but Nicklaus said the event will remain the start of the Florida swing in 2024.

            “Next year’s schedule are Pebble and LA are their elevated tournaments,” Nicklaus said. “Phoenix is not. Then they go to Mexico, then they come here. So, we will have players next year. And then they’ve got Bay Hill and Players. The tournament’s going to be just fine.”

            The PGA Tour is in the middle of revamping its 2024 schedule, including the size of fields and eligibility, as it responds to the threat of Saudi-funded LIV Golf. A 2024 schedule is not expected to be announced until the summer.

            Nicklaus and his wife, Barbara, make their home near PGA National and have deep charitable ties to the tournament. The event has raised millions for the Nicklaus Children’s Health Care Foundation.

            “This town has supported this event without having a great field,” Nicklaus said.

            Many of the tour’s top players have skipped Honda in recent years even though some of them live just a short drive from PGA National. But Nicklaus has never lobbied players to play the event and said he won’t change that policy.

            “I don’t do that. I don’t do it for the Memorial Tournament. I don’t do it for any tournament,” Nicklaus said. “I didn’t like when people did it to me. If you’re going to play, you’re going to play. If you’re not going to play, you’re not going to play.”

            Maty Wilke added 15 points, Serah Williams 14 and Avery LaBarbera 12 with eight rebounds for the Badgers (11-19, 6-12), who secured the No. 10 seed for the league tournament and avoided a first-round game on Wednesday for the first time.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822545,Man United targets more trophies after winning League Cup,"LONDON (AP) — With a first trophy secured, thoughts now turn to what else a transformed Manchester United can achieve in a season that is shaping up nicely for manager Erik ten Hag. 

            While a quadruple remains unlikely, United’s four-pronged challenge is still alive after beating Newcastle 2-0 in the League Cup final on Sunday. 

            “We are still in three competitions and we have the chance to win more trophies,"" United goalkeeper David de Gea said. ""I feel the mentality of the team is a winning one.” 











            For a team that had become all too accustomed to failure in recent years, it is quickly getting a taste for success after the impressive turnaround overseen by Ten Hag.

            “I am satisfied but I want more. I want much more,” said United captain Bruno Fernandes, who led the celebrations on the field at Wembley.

            Ten Hag needed just 10 months to deliver his first trophy as United manager and end a six-year silverware drought for the 20-time English champion. It is United’s first trophy since winning a League Cup and Europa League double under Jose Mourinho in 2017. 

            As trophies go, the League Cup is a modest prize for a club that won it all under iconic former manager Alex Ferguson. But this was a triumph that was relished by thousands of United fans inside the stadium after Casemiro's header and Sven Botman’s own-goal settled the match.

            “First you have to win the first one and that is what we did today,"" Ten Hag said. ""You can get inspiration from this and more confidence that we can do it. 

            ""We are still at the start of restoring Manchester United to where they belong and that is to be winning trophies.”

            Ten Hag celebrated by dancing on the field with players Lisandro Martinez and Antony, who followed him from Ajax to Manchester last summer. And he lovingly cradled the cup when emerging for his post-match news conference. 

            However, as if to underline the fact that he is not getting carried away with his early success, he initially forgot the trophy as he got up to leave the room before quickly retrieving it.

            “I’m already on to the next cup! This one is in!” he joked.

            Few expected United to be in such a healthy position at this stage of the season — especially after losing the first two games of the campaign, which included the humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford in August. 

            Ten Hag, who won three Dutch titles and two cups with Ajax, is off the mark in his new job and there could be more days like this before the season is done. 

            Third-place United is in contention for the Premier League title and on Thursday beat Barcelona in the Europa League to advance to the round of 16 against Real Betis. Next up is West Ham in the FA Cup in the fifth round, with league leader Arsenal and holder Liverpool already eliminated. 

            While a sustained title challenge still feels like a step too far for a team that finished 35 points behind champions Manchester City last season, United cannot be ruled out. 

            “It’s an opportunity, it’s possible,"" Ten Hag said of the pursuit for more silverware. “As long as we don’t go over the top, togetherness, keep working, then we can win even more.”

            Ten Hag has certainly made believers of the club’s fans, who let off flares that left a red mist inside Wembley after the final whistle. 

            Co-owner Avram Glazer also enjoyed the occasion when making a rare appearance at a United match at time when the club is the subject of takeover bids.

            Ferguson was also part of the celebrations in the stands. 

            “He was there and he is a happy man tonight,” Ten Hag said.

            CASEMIRO'S DELIGHT

            Casemiro headed United in front in the 33rd minute of the final when rising to meet Luke Shaw’s curled free kick.

            For a man who has won it all with Real Madrid, including five Champions League titles, Casemiro’s delight at opening the scoring at Wembley was clear to see as he ran to the corner to celebrate with a broad smile on his face.

            Botman’s own-goal made it 2-0 in the 39th after Wout Weghorst played in Rashford on the left. The in-form forward miscued his shot, but Botman’s attempted block saw the ball fly beyond Newcastle goalkeeper Loris Karius. Rashford ran away in celebration, but it was adjudged to be an own-goal.

            The Saudi Arabian-backed Newcastle mounted a fightback in the second half, but could not find a breakthrough goal, with De Gea keeping a club record 181st clean sheet for United. 

            STILL WAITING

            For Newcastle, the wait for a first major domestic trophy since the FA Cup in 1955 goes on.

            While it can still be a season of celebration if manager Eddie Howe can deliver Champions League qualification, he acknowledged there remains a gap for his team to close.

            “It is a process, we want to be here on a regular basis,” Howe said. “There is a long way to go to be the team we want to be.”

            PREMIER LEAGUE

            Graham Potter is said to have the full support of Chelsea’s owners, but it is impossible to ignore his team’s woeful run of form, which continued with a 2-0 loss to fourth-place Tottenham in the only Premier League game on Sunday.

            It is now six games without a win for the Blues, who were Champions League winners as recently as 2021. 

            That feels like a long time ago now, and thoughts of returning to those heights also seem like a distant dream for a team that looks certain to miss out on Champions League qualification and is fighting just to stay in the top half of the table. 

            “You can feel the desire of the players to turn results around, but sometimes you go through moments where you have to suffer,” Potter said. 

            Defeat was even more painful as it came against fierce London rivals Spurs, who can dream about playing in the top tier of European soccer next season after moving four points ahead of Newcastle. 

            Second-half goals from Oliver Skipp and Harry Kane sealed the win at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

(AP) — Kobe Bufkin scored 28 points, Hunter Dickinson had 23, including a buzzer-beating 3-pointer that sent the game into overtime, and Michigan outlasted Wisconsin 87-79 on Sunday.

            The Badgers kept chipping away at a 35-27 halftime deficit and eventually took a 61-59 lead on a driving layup by Max Klesmit with 3:06 remaining in regulation. There were two ties and three lead changes in the final 2:19, the last tie coming on Dickinson's buzzer-beating 3-pointer.

            There were two ties and three lead changes early in overtime before Michigan took control with 10-0 run in which Bufkin and Dug McDaniel both scored four points.











            McDaniel finished with 20 points for the Wolverines (17-12, 11-7 Big Ten). Dickinson added 10 rebounds for his fifth double-double in the last seven games and was 9 for 13 from the field. Bufkin had eight rebounds.

            Wisconsin freshman Connor Essegian had 24 points. Max Klesmit had 19 points, including 5-of-8 3-point shooting, and Tyler Wahl had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Steven Crowl scored 14 points for the Badgers (16-12, 9-9).

            The Wolverines made eight of their last nine shots, including eight in a row, as they turned a 20-16 deficit into a 35-27 halftime lead. Dickinson scored 10 points in the run and led Michigan with 12 points in the first half.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822553,Kaprizov caps hat trick in OT as Wild beat Blue Jackets 3-2,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Kirill Kaprizov might not like the spotlight. But if he keeps playing like he has been, he'd better get used to being the center of attention.

            Kaprizov scored with 20 seconds left in overtime, completing a natural hat trick and lifting the Minnesota Wild past the Columbus Blue Jackets 3-2 on Sunday.

            “I work hard. So does the rest of the team,” Kaprizov said through an interpreter. ""At the end of the day, we all come out, we play 60 minutes and do our best. I don’t like to be singled out. I don’t like to be compared, but I just go out there and do my job. Sometimes it goes in and sometimes I get a couple goals but ultimately I just kind of play my game.”











            Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 22 shots for the Wild, who trailed 2-0 heading into the third period before Kaprizov took over.

            Minnesota's 25-year-old All-Star set a team record with 47 goals last season. He's now ahead of that pace this year after his third career hat trick gave him 37 goals with another six weeks yet to play in the regular season.

            “He might be the hardest working superstar ever,” said defenseman Calen Addison, who set up the winning goal. “I mean, this guy goes to the corners like no one else, and he’s not losing a battle ever. I mean, he does everything for us.”

            Mathieu Olivier and Liam Foudy scored for Columbus, while Elvis Merzlikins made 41 saves.

            The Wild have earned points in eight of their last nine games (6-1-2), but their offense has been sputtering, averaging just 1.7 goals over their previous 10 contests.

            Those struggles continued for two periods against Columbus, which has allowed more goals than all but three teams in the NHL this season. Merzlikins blanked them through the first 40 minutes before Kaprizov scored twice in the first six minutes of the third to tie the game.

            First, Kaprizov tipped home a shot directly in front of the net to get Minnesota on the board at 1:15 of the third. Then, with Minnesota on its first power-play of the game, Foudy was sent off for high sticking Addison in the face.

            Just as the 5-on-3 was about to expire, Kaprizov scooped up a loose puck in the slot and wired a wrist shot past Merzlikins.

            Kaprizov nearly completed his hat trick in regulation with a breakaway later in the period, but after making a nifty spin move to shake a defender, his shot beat Merzlikins but hit the post.

            On the final shift of overtime, Addison feathered a pass across the crease and Kaprizov slammed it into the open net for the game winner.

            “I literally could have kept them on the ice the whole … game, probably, but certainly the third period and overtime,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said of Kaprizov's line. As it was, Kaprizov had a team-high 25 minutes and 36 seconds of ice time.

            The Blue Jackets, despite being buried in last place in the Metropolitan Division, have made strides recently. They are 3-1-2 in their last six games, with the only loss a 2-0 defeat by the Wild in Columbus on Thursday. But coach Brad Larsen sensed his team was fighting the effects of a second straight day game, after they beat Edmonton 6-5 on Saturday.

            “I thought the first half of the game we were real sharp,” Larsen said. “We needed more guys tonight to be on their game – we had a few guys who just weren’t locked in and it cost us tonight. ... We just ran out of gas and got a little bit sloppy and it cost us.”

            Minnesota outshot Columbus 13-7 in the first period but wasn’t able to solve Merzlikins. Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets took a 1-0 lead late in the period when Olivier scored his fifth of the year off a Wild turnover in their own zone.

            Foudy doubled Columbus' lead just three minutes into the second when he redirected a centering pass from Erik Gudbranson past Fleury.

            That merely set the stage for Kaprizov's star turn. And, as great as his superstar played, Evason said he can't be surprised by it.

            “It’s hard to tell, because he rarely doesn’t have it,” Evason said. “He plays like that all the time. ... His drive and his desire and his willingness to compete is always at that level.""

            LOFTY COMPARISON

            Fleury, who spent 13 seasons and won three Stanley Cups with Pittsburgh, said Kaprizov's play reminds him of a former teammate with a great track record of his own.

            “Reminds of me of (Sidney Crosby) a bit,” Fleury said. “The way he’s built: big legs, big butt. Short, fast, plays, goes to the corner, battles, big hits. Finishes his checks. Defense, comes back in the zone. Helps out in our d-zone, too. It’s all similar to Sid. Obviously he’s got a great finish, too.""

Then, with Minnesota on its first power-play of the game, Foudy was sent off for high sticking Addison in the face.Just as the 5-on-3 was about to expire, Kaprizov scooped up a loose puck in the slot and wired a wrist shot past Merzlikins.Kaprizov nearly completed his hat trick in regulation with a breakaway later in the period, but after making a nifty spin move to shake a defender, his shot beat Merzlikins but hit the post.On the final shift of overtime, Addison feathered a pass across the crease and Kaprizov slammed it into the open net for the game winner.“I literally could have kept them on the ice the whole … game, probably, but certainly the third period and overtime,” Minnesota coach Dean Evason said of Kaprizov's line. As it was, Kaprizov had a team-high 25 minutes and 36 seconds of ice time.The Blue Jackets, despite being buried in last place in the Metropolitan Division, have made strides recently. They are 3-1-2 in their last six games, with the only loss a 2-0 defeat by the Wild in Columbus on Thursday. But coach Brad Larsen sensed his team was fighting the effects of a second straight day game, after they beat Edmonton 6-5 on Saturday.“I thought the first half of the game we were real sharp,” Larsen said. “We needed more guys tonight to be on their game – we had a few guys who just weren’t locked in and it cost us tonight. ... We just ran out of gas and got a little bit sloppy and it cost us.”Minnesota outshot Columbus 13-7 in the first period but wasn’t able to solve Merzlikins. Meanwhile, the Blue Jackets took a 1-0 lead late in the period when Olivier scored his fifth of the year off a Wild turnover in their own zone.Foudy doubled Columbus' lead just three minutes into the second when he redirected a centering pass from Erik Gudbranson past Fleury.That merely set the stage for Kaprizov's star turn. And, as great as his superstar played, Evason said he can't be surprised by it.“It’s hard to tell, because he rarely doesn’t have it,” Evason said. “He plays like that all the time. ... His drive and his desire and his willingness to compete is always at that level.""LOFTY COMPARISONFleury, who spent 13 seasons and won three Stanley Cups with Pittsburgh, said Kaprizov's play reminds him of a former teammate with a great track record of his own.“Reminds of me of (Sidney Crosby) a bit,” Fleury said. “The way he’s built: big legs, big butt. Short, fast, plays, goes to the corner, battles, big hits. Finishes his checks. Defense, comes back in the zone. Helps out in our d-zone, too. It’s all similar to Sid. Obviously he’s got a great finish, too.""UP NEXTBlue Jackets: At Buffalo on Tuesday night.Wild: Host Islanders on Tuesday night.___AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822561,Devils acquire Timo Meier in blockbuster trade with Sharks,"Timo Meier is going to the New Jersey Devils in the latest ante of the high-stakes poker game among Eastern Conference playoff contenders.

            Meier joins the Devils after the New York Islanders made a big acquisition, the NHL-leading Boston Bruins got bigger and tougher and the Rangers added one scorer and could get another significantly productive winger before the deadline Friday.

            New Jersey sent a 2023 first-round pick, a conditional 2024 first-rounder, forward Andreas Johnsson and prospects Shakir Mukhamadullin, Fabian Zetterlund and Nikita Okhotiuk to San Jose. In return, the Devils got Meier, defenseman Scott Harrington and prospects Timur Ibragimov, Santeri Hatakka and Zach Emond.











            “I was just doing what I felt was best for the New Jersey Devils, not reacting because of what the Rangers did or what they may do again or what the Islanders did,” Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald said. “When you can add a player like Timo Meier to the lineup that you feel is growing and getting stronger each day, it really puts a smile on my face.""

            Meier is under team control for at least the next year. He's a pending restricted free agent with a $10 million qualifying offer for the 2023-24 season, and Fitzgerald expects to be able to sign Meier long term.

            ""One thing I am confident in is who we are, what we can sell — our team,"" Fitzgerald said. “I do believe New Jersey will sell itself. I think he will love it here. I think he will thoroughly enjoy it and want to stay here. That’s my bet.”

            The 26-year-old Swiss winger has 31 goals and 21 assists in 57 games this season. Meier did not fit in with San Jose's long-term plans.

            “There’s realities at play here with the salary cap and the salary structure of our group,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said. “To pay him the money he’s looking for and wanted, it didn’t seem to make sense and to line up where were are kind of headed as a franchise and where we’re at. We don’t want to keep spinning our wheels here. We’re going to try and move this thing forward.”

            ""Having this new chapter coming my way, it’s definitely very exciting,"" Meier said. “I’m just very excited to get this started.”

            The Devils are just getting started on their climb in the East. With some cap space left before the deadline Friday, this was undoubtedly their biggest move but might not be their last.

            AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTimo Meier is going to the New Jersey Devils in the latest ante of the high-stakes poker game among Eastern Conference playoff contenders.Meier joins the Devils after the New York Islanders made a big acquisition, the NHL-leading Boston Bruins got bigger and tougher and the Rangers added one scorer and could get another significantly productive winger before the deadline Friday.New Jersey sent a 2023 first-round pick, a conditional 2024 first-rounder, forward Andreas Johnsson and prospects Shakir Mukhamadullin, Fabian Zetterlund and Nikita Okhotiuk to San Jose. In return, the Devils got Meier, defenseman Scott Harrington and prospects Timur Ibragimov, Santeri Hatakka and Zach Emond.“I was just doing what I felt was best for the New Jersey Devils, not reacting because of what the Rangers did or what they may do again or what the Islanders did,” Devils general manager Tom Fitzgerald said. “When you can add a player like Timo Meier to the lineup that you feel is growing and getting stronger each day, it really puts a smile on my face.""Meier is under team control for at least the next year. He's a pending restricted free agent with a $10 million qualifying offer for the 2023-24 season, and Fitzgerald expects to be able to sign Meier long term.""One thing I am confident in is who we are, what we can sell — our team,"" Fitzgerald said. “I do believe New Jersey will sell itself. I think he will love it here. I think he will thoroughly enjoy it and want to stay here. That’s my bet.”The 26-year-old Swiss winger has 31 goals and 21 assists in 57 games this season. Meier did not fit in with San Jose's long-term plans.“There’s realities at play here with the salary cap and the salary structure of our group,” Sharks GM Mike Grier said. “To pay him the money he’s looking for and wanted, it didn’t seem to make sense and to line up where were are kind of headed as a franchise and where we’re at. We don’t want to keep spinning our wheels here. We’re going to try and move this thing forward.”The opposite is going on in New Jersey, with a team perhaps a half-step ahead of schedule to make the playoffs.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822562,Young's buzzer-beating jumper lifts Hawks past Nets 129-127,"ATLANTA (AP) — Waiting for just the right moment to launch his game-winning shot was no problem for Trae Young. He says he has been envisioning similar shots since he was a kid.

            Young waited patiently for Mikal Bridges to fly past him before sinking a buzzer-beating jumper over the reach of Spencer Dinwiddie to lift Atlanta to a 129-127 win over the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday, a few hours before the Hawks announced they hired Quin Snyder as their coach.

            The Hawks took their final possession with 7.3 seconds remaining after Cam Johnson's 3-pointer tied the game at 127 with 7.8 seconds remaining. Young hit his pull-up 12-foot jumper as Dinwiddie tried in vain to block the shot from behind.











            “I’ve been counting down those seconds since I was 5 years old, 6 years old,” Young said. “That’s nothing new.” 

            Young finished with 34 points for the Hawks, who recovered after blowing an 18-point lead to overcome four Nets scorers with at least 20 points.

            Atlanta, No. 8 in the East, won its second consecutive game under interim coach Joe Prunty after Nate McMillan was fired Tuesday. General manager Landry Fields announced Sunday night Snyder had been hired to replace McMillan. The team scheduled a news conference for Monday to introduce Snyder. 

            Johnson had 27 points for Brooklyn. Mikal Bridges scored 24 for the Nets, who have lost four of five. Cam Thomas added 22 points and Dinwiddie had 20.

            The Nets began the day fifth in the Eastern Conference, only a half-game ahead of the New York Knicks. Coach Jacque Vaughn is trying to find a new winning mix after the team traded Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving.

            “You can't feel sorry for yourself,” Vaughn said. “What we have to do is continue to stay together and believe we can get it done.”

            Dorian Finney-Smith's 3 for Brooklyn with 48 seconds remaining cut Atlanta's lead to 127-124.

            Both wins under Prunty have come against teams above the Hawks in the conference.

            “It’s great,” said Dejounte Murray, who scored 28 points. “Like I continue to tell the players, we have no control over what the front office does. We’re going to continue to work and try to build as many wins as we can.”

            Bogdan Bogdanovic added 22 for Atlanta. Bogdanovic's three 3-pointers early in the second quarter helped Atlanta take a 50-32 lead. Thomas had 11 points in the period, helping the Nets trim the Hawks' lead to 64-57 at halftime.

            Brooklyn kept its momentum to open the second half, taking a 78-73 lead. Onyeka Okongwu scored the final four points of the third period as Atlanta took a 97-94 advantage into the final period.

            “We would not give up in the second half even though we were down by double digits,” Vaughn said.

            STICKING WITH THE STARTERS

            Vaughn stuck with his starters after the first five combined for only 34 points as the team set a season scoring low in an ugly 131-87 loss at Chicago on Friday night. 

            Before the game, Vaughn said he's looking for consistency and a balance of offense and defense. He said Finney-Smith, who had only two points against the Bulls, is “one of our best defenders we have on the team.”

            “It’s pretty tough to take him out of the lineup when there’s other offensive guys he’s covering sins up for,” Vaughn said of Finney-Smith.

            TALKING ABOUT PRACTICE

            When asked how many practices he has had with the team since the All-Star break, Vaughn referred to the blowout loss to the Bulls as “a scrimmage with referees.”

            TIP-INS

            Nets: C Nic Claxton, from the University of Georgia, had four steals, three blocked shots and 11 rebounds. ... G Ben Simmons (left knee soreness) missed his second consecutive game.

            Hawks: F John Collins returned with 12 points after missing one game while on concussion protocol. Collins was questionable with lower back tightness and cleared to start after pregame warmups, but his minutes were restricted. Collins logged almost 26 minutes, which Prunty acknowledged was more than planned.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822568,Contaminated waste shipments from Ohio derailment to resume,"EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Shipment of contaminated waste from the site of a fiery train derailment earlier this month in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line will resume Monday to two approved sites in Ohio, according to federal environmental authorities. 

            The announcement came a day after the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern to “pause” shipments from the site of the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine to allow additional oversight measures about where waste was shipped. Some liquid and solid waste had already been taken to sites in Michigan and Texas.

            EPA-certified facilities able to accept some of the waste had been identified, which meant shipments could restart Monday, Region 5 administrator Debra Shore, of the Environmental Protection Agency, said Sunday.











            Some of the liquid waste will be sent to a facility in Vickery, Ohio, for disposal in an underground injection well, Shore said. Norfolk Southern will also begin shipping solid waste to an incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, and additional solid waste disposal locations were being sought, she said.

            “All of this is great news for the people of East Palestine and the surrounding community, because it means cleanup can continue at a rapid pace,” she said.

            The Ohio governor's office said Saturday night that five of the 20 truckloads (approximately 280 tons) of hazardous solid waste had been returned to East Palestine after 15 truckloads were disposed of at a Michigan hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility. Shore said material shipped out to sites in other states, but later returned to East Palestine, would now be shipped to the two Ohio sites.

            All of the rail cars except for the 11 cars held by the National Transportation Safety Board have been removed from the site, which will allow excavation of additional contaminated soil and installation of monitoring wells to check for groundwater contamination, said Anne Vogel, director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

            No one was injured when 38 Norfolk Southern cars derailed in a fiery, mangled mess on the outskirts of town, but as fears grew about a potential explosion due to hazardous chemicals in five of the rail cars, officials evacuated the area. They later opted to release and burn toxic vinyl chloride from the tanker cars, sending flames and black smoke billowing into the sky again. 

            Federal and state officials have repeatedly said it’s safe for evacuated residents to return to the area and that air testing in the town and inside hundreds of homes hasn’t detected any concerning levels of contaminants. The state says the local municipal drinking water system is safe, and bottled water is available for those with private wells. Despite those assurances, many residents have expressed a sense of mistrust or have lingering questions about what they have been exposed to and how it will impact the future of their families and communities.EAST PALESTINE, Ohio (AP) — Shipment of contaminated waste from the site of a fiery train derailment earlier this month in eastern Ohio near the Pennsylvania state line will resume Monday to two approved sites in Ohio, according to federal environmental authorities.The announcement came a day after the Environmental Protection Agency ordered Norfolk Southern to “pause” shipments from the site of the Feb. 3 derailment in East Palestine to allow additional oversight measures about where waste was shipped.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822569,Mbappé and Messi combine as leader PSG wins 3-0 at Marseille,"PARIS (AP) — Kylian Mbappé scored twice and Lionel Messi got the other goal as the World Cup final stars combined to give French league leader Paris Saint-Germain a 3-0 win at title challenger Marseille.

            Mbappé tops the league's scoring charts outright with 17 goals, and he matched Edinson Cavani's PSG club-record tally of 200 in the process on Sunday.

            What better place to do it than at bitter rival Marseille, where PSG lost in the French Cup earlier this month without the injured Mbappé in the team? This time, PSG was without the injured Neymar but didn't miss the Brazil star.











            A win would have moved second-place Marseille within two points of defending champion PSG. Instead, Marseille trails by eight points with only 13 rounds remaining.

            “Everyone put in the right effort,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. 

            Galtier is from Marseille and played for the club as a gritty defender, which means some Marseille fans are simply unable to understand why he is coaching PSG.

            Galtier had to be restrained after the final whistle as he went over to confront an irate Marseille fan leaning over and heckling him near the dugout.

            Mbappé became only the second player to score a hat trick in a World Cup final when France lost on penalty kicks to Argentina last December, with an inspirational Messi netting twice in a thrilling final.

            This time they combined on each other's goals to quieten a Stade Velodrome crowd full of belief after the recent cup win against a PSG side reeling from five defeats in its 12 previous games.

            But after Nuno Tavares missed a great chance for Marseille, an exquisite pass from Messi near the halfway line sent Mbappé sprinting through for a typically clinical finish in the 25th minute.

            “He's a player from another planet,” Marseille coach Igor Tudor said about Mbappé.

            Four minutes later Mbappé found space down the left and picked out Messi — who saved PSG with an injury-time free kick in a 4-3 win against Lille last weekend — for a close-range finish.

            Having scored his 12th league goal, Messi set up Mbappé again with a looping pass in the 55th, moments after veteran striker Alexis Sanchez missed a great chance to pull a goal back for Marseille.

            The only negative for PSG on an emphatic night was losing central defender Presnel Kimpembe to injury in the 18th. He was stretchered off after falling unchallenged to the ground and lying on his face for several moments, although the nature of his injury was not immediately clear.

            Defeat means Marseille is now only two points ahead of third-place Monaco and fourth-place Lens, which both have 50 points.

            It could have been worse for Marseille had Monaco not lost 3-0 at home to Nice earlier Sunday in the Riviera derby.

            Nigeria striker Terem Moffi scored twice in the first 25 minutes and midfielder Khéphren Thuram — son of France great Lilian Thuram — added the third just before halftime as Nice climbed to seventh spot.

            OTHER MATCHES

            Fifth-place Rennes won 1-0 at Nantes with a goal from Belgium winger Jérémy Doku, and Reims easily beat Toulouse 3-0 in a midtable scrap.

            Relegation-threatened Auxerre won 1-0 at Lorient while fellow struggler Ajaccio enjoyed a 2-1 home win against 19th-place Troyes.

            Also, Clermont drew 1-1 at home to Strasbourg.

            Panama’s immigration agency said no more trips would take place until transport authorities reviewed the bus lines and ensured their safety. 

            Nobody died in the latest incident on Saturday, when a bus carrying migrants caught fire. All the passengers were evacuated safely. 











            But more than three dozen migrants died earlier this month when a bus plunged off a hillside. Most of the dead were believed to be migrants from Ecuador, Haiti and Venezuela.

            Migrants frequently reach Panama by crossing the roadless, jungle-clad Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama. Panamanian authorities estimate that over 250,000 migrants made the dangerous land crossing in 2020, and so far this year another 37,000 are believed to have made the trip.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822574,Only a bold and ambitious UN treaty can stem plastic waste crisis,"Peak Plastics report from Back to Blue

 LONDON, UK -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 -  Plastic consumption is on track to nearly double in the G20 by 2050 unless the United Nations agrees on a sweeping set of new global policies, including worldwide bans on some single-use plastic products, extended producer responsibility schemes and taxes on virgin plastic production, according to a new report.    The report, Peak Plastics: Bending the consumption curve, is the first study to forensically model the potential impact of policies being considered by United Nations plastic treaty negotiators. Plastics consumption across G20 countries will hit 451 million tonnes each year by 2050, nearly twice the 2019 level of 261 million tonnes, in a business-as-usual scenario, the study found.    The research comes from  Back to Blue, an initiative of Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation, and was supported by prominent authorities on plastic production, consumption and pollution including OECD, the World Bank, SYSTEMIQ, CSIR, and WWF. It also reveals that on our current trajectory countries will not reach peak plastic consumption this century: the tipping point after which plastic consumption begins to decline.   In March last year, 175 nations agreed to develop a legally binding global instrument to end plastic pollution: the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution. This historic treaty is being negotiated through a series of meetings across the globe and is expected to be in place by the end of 2024. Only policies at the most ambitious end of those under consideration will have a meaningful impact on a soaring plastic waste crisis, the Back to Blue research found.   Researchers for the report explored three policy approaches that have reached the advanced stages of the UN treaty’s negotiations, deemed by experts as those with the greatest potential to bring about peak plastic consumption.   These policies, which cover the entire lifecycle of plastic, from production to disposal, are a ban on problematic single-use plastic products; “polluter pays” Extended Producer Responsibility schemes for full end-of-life costs; and a tax on virgin plastic production – all fail to prevent a relentless rise in plastic consumption.   Only a combination of these policies and bolder action, including possible restrictions on virgin plastic production, will bring about peak plastics and see consumption slow in the future. If the negotiators fail to agree on any policy interventions, the research projects that plastic consumption in the countries under study will nearly double by mid-century.   According to the report, a global ban on unnecessary single-use plastic (SUP) items is the most effective policy of those studied. However, even with a SUP ban in place, plastic consumption will still be 1.48 times higher in 2050 compared with the 2019 baseline.   Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes will have a minimal effect on the consumption of single-use plastic products but it is still a vital part of the solution. If EPR schemes become mandatory in the countries under focus, plastic consumption would be 1.66 times higher in 2050 compared with 2019. This is barely lower than the baseline of 1.73 times if no policies are implemented.   Modelling shows the impact of a tax on virgin plastic resin will be limited and will still see consumption rise by 1.57 times by 2050. Taxes must be aggressive to be impactful, according to the research. In the absence of a tangible impact on plastic consumption by increasing taxes, the research suggests that negotiators should consider capping plastic production.   A combination of all three scenarios still leaves plastic consumption rising albeit at a slightly slower pace - 1.25 times higher in 2050 compared with 2019. The findings highlight the ‘considerable’ possibility that the UN treaty will be too weak to bend the consumption curve downward.   To suppress plastic consumption at the scale needed, the report presents the need for measures and conditions so stringent that they are likely to encounter opposition from producers, retailers, industry bodies, consumer groups and other actors.   QUOTE 1: “Negotiators of the UN plastics treaty must maintain the highest levels of ambition possible when entering the next round of negotiations, and industry needs to play a constructive, not obstructive, role in reaching a deal.   So far, commitments by industry, retailers and brands to reduce plastic waste are short on detail and have failed to materialise. We have to slow the soaring production of single-use plastic. Only a bold suite of legally-binding policies will result in plastic consumption peaking by mid-century.” – Charles Goddard, editorial director, Economist Impact   QUOTE 2: “Back to Blue’s research is a timely call for urgent, ambitious solutions to the plastic crisis. Plastic pollution extends beyond all borders, impacting the health of the ocean and natural environment. It will take global co-ordination to address the scope and scale of this issue.” - Yohei Sasakawa, chairman of the Nippon Foundation.   QUOTE 3: ""The urgency to reach peak plastic waste—and also peak production of disposable plastics—is crucial for preserving our planet and safeguarding our well-being.” - Perinaz Bhada Tata, World Bank   QUOTE 4: ""Proper plastic management is the biggest challenge facing us today. With mounting evidence that the world is generating more single-use plastics than ever before, the Back to Blue report plays a crucial role in identifying countries that are likely to become major sources of such waste. The report is also an essential guide to understand effective policy-making to address the plastics conundrum."" - Aafrin Kidwai, Solid Waste India   QUOTE 5: ""This report confirms that an urgent, global effort is needed to stop the flood of plastic pollution at its source. The entire lifecycle of plastics, from feedstock extraction and production of plastic precursors to disposal, must be addressed by the future, legally binding UN treaty to end plastic pollution. The policy levers examined in this report will not be sufficient: bolder action is needed, including globally coordinated tax mechanisms coupled with ambitious caps on virgin plastic production."" David Azoulay, Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL)   You can find the full report and data story here   Notes to Editors   ‘Peak plastics’ is the tipping point after which plastic consumption begins to decline. Back to Blue’s modelling uses a quantitative forecasting methodology to predict at what point each country will reach a peak in its consumption of plastic.   Back to Blue selected three real-world policy scenarios that are already being implemented at various degrees globally: a ban on single-use plastic (SUP) products; a mandatory Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for industrial consumers; and a producer tax on virgin resin. These three policies are cited in the advance documentation for negotiators related to the UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.   The seven categories of polymers used in the model account for 80% of all plastic production. The objective is to test if plastic consumption will reach a peak, assuming that consumers, producers and policy makers understand the true cost of producing and using plastic products. We are assuming that some products, not only single-use plastic products, shift towards using substitute materials.

About Back to Blue











            “ Back to Blue” is an initiative launched by Economist Impact and The Nippon Foundation in 2021 to focus efforts on evidence-based approaches and solutions that tackle escalating ocean challenges, such as those posed by major threats such as climate change, pollution and habitat destruction.   While governments and policymakers have begun efforts towards restoring biodiversity and regenerating ocean health, there remains an ostensible knowledge gap on plastic and chemical pollution.   Recognising the need to stimulate fresh dialogue and solutions to pressing ocean issues, this multi-year initiative brings together both organisations’ unique capabilities in ocean research and programme-building to build a powerful platform which will accelerate momentum in improving ocean health. In 2021, the Plastic Management Index published under Back to Blue addressed the issue of marine plastic pollution. In 2022 the focus is on the less visible pollution from chemical contaminants that are damaging ocean life and ecosystems and in the long term, human health.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822575,Cardi B: Court-ordered service 'the best thing' to happen,"NEW YORK (AP) — Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B spoke to girls in a police mentorship program Friday as part of what she says has been an eye-opening and emotional week performing court-mandated community service for her role in a pair of brawls at New York City strip clubs in 2018. 

            The 30-year-old “Bodak Yellow” singer visited an NYPD “Girls Talk” event at the police training academy in Queens and shared what the department said was “her rags to riches story."" She danced with teens and posed for photos.

            Cardi B's plea deal requires her to perform 15 days of community service by March 1 to avoid a 15-day jail sentence.











            “I feel like there’s so many people that make y’all probably feel like, ‘This is what’s cool, this is what’s going on, this is what it takes to be lit, this is what it takes to be fire,’” Cardi B told her young audience.

            “Sometimes that’s a little bit of peer pressure like on a girl. Don’t fall into that. You know what I’m saying? Like, be great. Be you. You’re amazing. You’re dope yourself.”

            The NYPD posted a video to Twitter showing highlights of the event.

            That drew criticism from some people, including a retired police lieutenant, who questioned whether Cardi B was an appropriate role model for children given her sometimes provocative lyrics, criminal record and past admission that she drugged and robbed men while working as a stripper before she got famous. 

            Cardi B, a New York City native whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, has been chronicling her community service on Twitter all week. On Saturday, she wrote: “Community service has been the best thing that has happened to me.”

            She likened the experience to a spiritual journey that sometimes left her in tears. “Those people that we leave behind they just need somebody to talk and a lil push and YOU might be able to change their life forever,” she wrote.

            In another post, on her way to the police academy, the multiple-platinum selling artist and mother of two complained about waking up early to perform community service before going to the recording studio, but added: “I did the crime 'I only have myself to blame'.”

            Cardi B agreed in September to a conditional discharge just as her case was about to go to trial. She pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges stemming from the August 2018 fights. Ten other counts, including two felonies, were dismissed. Two co-defendants also pleaded guilty.

            In a statement at the time, Cardi B said: “Part of growing up and maturing is being accountable for your actions. As a mother, it’s a practice that I am trying to instill in my children, but the example starts with me. I’ve made some bad decisions in my past that I am not afraid to face and own up to. These moments don’t define me and they are not reflective of who I am now.""

            According to prosecutors, Cardi B and her entourage were targeting employees of Angels Strip Club in Flushing, Queens, over an apparent personal dispute. In one fight, chairs, bottles and hookah pipes were thrown as the group argued with a bartender. She and another employee had minor injuries.

            In 2019, Cardi B rejected a plea deal that would have given her a conditional discharge. Prosecutors then presented the case to a grand jury and obtained an indictment that included the two felony charges.

            NYPD Chief of Training Juanita Holmes created the ""Girls Talk"" program to build trust and foster mentorships between police officers and girls, with occasional special guests. Ballet dancer Misty Copeland spoke to the group at police headquarters in December 2021.

            Cardi B’s chart-topping hits include “I Like It” and the Maroon 5 collaboration “Girls Like You.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822576,"DeRozan, LaVine combine for 56, Bulls zoom past Wizards","CHICAGO (AP) — DeMar DeRozan scored 29 points, Zach LaVine added 27 and the Chicago Bulls overcame their shooting woes from long range Sunday to beat the Washington Wizards 102-82.

            Alex Caruso and LaVine each sank 3-pointers midway through the third quarter to turn a one-point deficit into a 57-52 lead the Bulls wouldn't relinquish. Before the consecutive 3s, the Bulls converted only one of their first 16 3-point attempts.

            “We have to find ugly ways to win games,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said.











            The Bulls (28-33) won their second game in a row after losing six straight to close the first half of the season. They finished shooting 8 of 30 from 3-point range, while the Wizards shot only 6 of 28 from long range.

            Bradley Beal scored 18 points for the Wizards (28-32), who lost their second consecutive game. They played without forward-center Kristaps Porzingis due to left knee soreness and guard Monte Morris was scratched less than an hour before tip off because of lower back soreness.

            The Wizards managed to stay close for three quarters thanks to balanced scoring by Beal, Daniel Gafford (15) and Delon Wright (14). Washington also managed 44 points in the paint.

            Beal, however, missed three free throws to start the fourth quarter, and Andre Drummond's putback extended the Bulls' lead to 81-72.

            “We have to do a better job of screening to free up guys,” coach Wes Unseld Jr. said after the Wizards committed 16 turnovers. “A lot of them (Bulls defenders) shoot the gap and be disruptive from that regard. But those turnovers are costly. Those are empty possessions for us and leads to some transition opportunities for them. 

            ""We got to do a better job of that, fighting force with force and manage their physicality.”

            Despite the Bulls' struggles from long range, they had an 11-0 spurt, punctuated by a 3-pointer by Patrick Williams, to take a 32-27 lead nearly three minutes into the second quarter.

            DeRozan and LaVine combined to shoot 22 for 33 from the field.

            LaVine made eight of 10 shots en route to a 17-point first half. Coby White came off the bench to score 17 on 6-of-8 shooting from the field, including three 3-pointers.

            “We can't afford to have those slipups,” LaVine said of the Bulls' two straight victories. “Obviously, we know teams are going to make their runs. You get a team down, got to keep them down and close the game out. We can't afford to have those back-and-forths where you give up a big lead.""

            NO TANKING

            Donovan said before the game there were no discussions with team officials about tanking the rest of the season. The Bulls' first pick was sent to Orlando in the Nikola Vucevic trade, but it becomes protected and retained if they don't make the playoffs and they land in the lottery within the first four picks. 

            “I've never had a situation from ownership, front office, that has said, ‘Listen, we've got an opportunity to potentially manipulate or get a higher draft pick, (saying) let’s sit these guys. let's give these guys an opportunity,'"" Donovan said. ""That's never taken place. I respect that and appreciate that.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822579,Armani at heart of new doc examining birth of Milan fashion,"Giorgio Armani and a slew of fashion CEOs turned out Sunday for a premiere of documentary “Milano: The Inside Story of Italian Fashion,″ by Emmy-winning filmmaker John Maggio.

            The documentary gives due credit to Armani for putting Milan ready-to-wear on the map in the 1980s with the creation of the deconstructed jacket that made menswear sexy and relaxed, as epitomized by Richard Gere in “American Gigolo.”

            “Fashion made me grow up and become someone. It was not easy initially, as I didn’t feel up to it, but slowly I gained courage to want to be someone in this adventure,″ Armani said upon arrival at the premiere.











            The 88-year-old designer, who presented his latest womenswear collection earlier in the day, received an enormous round of applause at the start of the film, when producer Alan Friedman introduced him to the very-fashion crowd as “the man without whom today Milan would not be the capital of fashion.”

            The documentary also recounts the competitive tensions between Armani and his classic elegance and Gianni Versace, who helped fuel the super model era with his more overtly sexy collections. 

            In the documentary, former Gucci creative director Tom Ford and ex-Gucci CEO Domenico De Sole discuss attempts to merge Gucci and Versace, which ultimately failed after Versace’s 1997 murder under the insistence of his sister, Donatella Versace, that she remain at the creative helm. 

            In the intervening years, Gucci, along with many other Italian family-run companies have been bought up by French conglomerates, and Versace is now part of the U.S. group Capri Holding. Italy has failed to come up with a fashion group of its own to challenge the French dominance; fashion houses like Armani and Dolce & Gabbana are among those that remain staunchly in family hands.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822581,Union Pacific will replace rail CEO amid hedge fund pressure,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific announced plans Sunday to replace its CEO later this year after a hedge fund that holds a $1.6 billion stake in the railroad went public with its concerns about his leadership.

            The managing partner of Soroban Capital Partners, Eric Mandelblatt, said in a letter that the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad has lagged behind its peers during Lance Fritz' tenure over the past eight years and that a leadership change is overdue. The hedge fund has been privately pressuring Union Pacific to oust Fritz at least since last year.

            “UNP (Union Pacific) has repeatedly and significantly failed to reach its potential under Mr. Fritz’s leadership,” Mandelblatt wrote. “UNP has ranked the worst in safety, volume growth, revenue growth, cost management, EBIT growth, and total shareholder return. These are highly underwhelming results despite UNP having the premier railroad franchise in North America.”











            Mandelblatt urged the railroad to hire former Chief Operations Officer Jim Vena, who helped overhaul Union Pacific's operations several years ago. But the railroad's board said in a statement that it has been working with a leadership consultant since last year to identify the best internal and external candidates for the job.

            Vena was brought in to Union Pacific in 2019 from Canadian National to help the railroad change to a new operating model that relies on fewer, longer trains and significantly fewer employees and locomotives to move freight, but Vena left after less than two years on the job. 

            Nearly all the major U.S. freight railroads have adopted that model since CSX first began using it in 2017 after it was pressured by a different hedge fund to make changes although rail unions have expressed concerns that this “precision scheduled railroading” model has made the industry riskier because workers are spread so thin after nearly one-third of all rail jobs have been eliminated over the past six years. The unions say these practices make incidents like Norfolk Southern's fiery derailment in Ohio earlier this month more likely, but the railroads have defended their safety record.

            UP’s lead independent board member Michael McCarthy praised Fritz in a statement Sunday for helping grow the railroad’s profits through the uncertain times of the pandemic — and through the challenges of last year’s bitter contract negotiations with its 12 unions.

            “He has capably led our company during a time of significant challenge and change, positioning Union Pacific to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders and customers,” McCarthy said. “We are immensely grateful to have Lance’s continuing leadership and support and know he will ensure a smooth transition.”

            The railroad did post a $1.6 billion profit in the fourth quarter, but over the past year it has struggled at times to handle all the shipments companies asked it to deliver. Twice regulators ordered Union Pacific to deliver emergency shipments to livestock producer Foster Farms to ensure that company wouldn’t run out of feed for the millions of chickens it raises.

            The U.S. Surface Transportation Board also held a special hearing in December to examine the way Union Pacific puts short-term limits on shipments to try and clear up congestion on its rail network because the railroad has been using that tactic much more than other major freight railroads.

            Union Pacific has been steadily improving its performance since last spring as it hired hundreds of additional employees to operate its trains.

            Fritz said in a statement that he has been honored to lead the railroad he’s worked at for the past 22 years. He praised Union Pacific’s employees and touted the railroad’s performance without directly addressing the hedge fund’s criticism.

            “Union Pacific has embarked on a transformative journey that will result in stronger, more consistent service for our customers, with enhanced earnings growth and value creation for our shareholders,” Fritz said.

            Union Pacific is one of the nation’s largest railroads with a network of 32,400 miles (52,000 kilometers) of track in 23 Western states.OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific announced plans Sunday to replace its CEO later this year after a hedge fund that holds a $1.6 billion stake in the railroad went public with its concerns about his leadership.The managing partner of Soroban Capital Partners, Eric Mandelblatt, said in a letter that the Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad has lagged behind its peers during Lance Fritz' tenure over the past eight years and that a leadership change is overdue. The hedge fund has been privately pressuring Union Pacific to oust Fritz at least since last year.“UNP (Union Pacific) has repeatedly and significantly failed to reach its potential under Mr. Fritz’s leadership,” Mandelblatt wrote. “UNP has ranked the worst in safety, volume growth, revenue growth, cost management, EBIT growth, and total shareholder return. These are highly underwhelming results despite UNP having the premier railroad franchise in North America.”Mandelblatt urged the railroad to hire former Chief Operations Officer Jim Vena, who helped overhaul Union Pacific's operations several years ago. But the railroad's board said in a statement that it has been working with a leadership consultant since last year to identify the best internal and external candidates for the job.Vena was brought in to Union Pacific in 2019 from Canadian National to help the railroad change to a new operating model that relies on fewer, longer trains and significantly fewer employees and locomotives to move freight, but Vena left after less than two years on the job.Nearly all the major U.S. freight railroads have adopted that model since CSX first began using it in 2017 after it was pressured by a different hedge fund to make changes although rail unions have expressed concerns that this “precision scheduled railroading” model has made the industry riskier because workers are spread so thin after nearly one-third of all rail jobs have been eliminated over the past six years. The unions say these practices make incidents like Norfolk Southern's fiery derailment in Ohio earlier this month more likely, but the railroads have defended their safety record.UP’s lead independent board member Michael McCarthy praised Fritz in a statement Sunday for helping grow the railroad’s profits through the uncertain times of the pandemic — and through the challenges of last year’s bitter contract negotiations with its 12 unions.“He has capably led our company during a time of significant challenge and change, positioning Union Pacific to deliver long-term sustainable value for shareholders and customers,” McCarthy said. “We are immensely grateful to have Lance’s continuing leadership and support and know he will ensure a smooth transition.”The railroad did post a $1.6 billion profit in the fourth quarter, but over the past year it has struggled at times to handle all the shipments companies asked it to deliver. Twice regulators ordered Union Pacific to deliver emergency shipments to livestock producer Foster Farms to ensure that company wouldn’t run out of feed for the millions of chickens it raises.The U.S. Surface Transportation Board also held a special hearing in December to examine the way Union Pacific puts short-term limits on shipments to try and clear up congestion on its rail network because the railroad has been using that tactic much more than other major freight railroads.Union Pacific has been steadily improving its performance since last spring as it hired hundreds of additional employees to operate its trains.Fritz said in a statement that he has been honored to lead the railroad he’s worked at for the past 22 years.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822597,"Lillard sets Blazers records with 71 points, 13 3s in win","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Damian Lillard set franchise and career highs with 71 points — tied for the most in the NBA this season — and 13 3-pointers and the Portland Trail Blazers snapped a two-game skid with a 131-114 victory over the Houston Rockets on Sunday night. 

            Lillard tied Cleveland’s Donovan Mitchell for the most points in a game this season after Mitchell also scored 71 in a win over Chicago on Jan. 2. Lillard broke his own franchise mark of 61 points, which he’d done twice, on a 3-pointer with 4:42 left that also topped his career record for 3s in a game with 11. 

            Lillard’s 13 3-pointers were one shy of the NBA record set by Golden State’s Klay Thompson in 2018. Thompson’s Warriors teammate Stephen Curry (2016) and Chicago’s Zach LaVine (2019) also made 13 3s. 











            Lillard left the game with 44 seconds left, tied with Mitchell, Elgin Baylor (1960) and David Robinson (1994) for the eighth-most points scored in a game in NBA history. Wilt Chamberlain has the league record with 100 for Philadelphia against New York on March 2, 1962, at Hershey, Pennsylvania.

            Alperen Sengun had 17 points and 10 rebounds for the Rockets, sitting in last place in the Western Conference with just 13 overall wins and nine straight losses. 

            BUCKS 104, SUNS 101

            MILWAUKEE (AP) — Jrue Holiday scored 33 points, Brook Lopez made a tiebreaking layup with 24.8 seconds left and Milwaukee edged Phoenix for its 14th consecutive victory.

            The nationally televised game didn’t include Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo or Phoenix’s Kevin Durant.

            Antetokounmpo was out with a bruised right quadriceps after leaving in the first quarter of the Bucks’ 128-99 victory over the Miami Heat on Friday. Durant has yet to appear in a game for the Suns and hasn’t played since Jan. 8 because of sprained right medial collateral ligament. 

            Lopez had 22 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks, and Khris Middleton added 11 points and 10 rebounds.

            Devin Booker scored 24 points, Deandre Ayton had 22 and Chris Paul added 18 for Phoenix. Ayton also had 11 rebounds.

            LAKERS 111, MAVERICKS 108

            DALLAS (AP) — Anthony Davis had 30 points and 15 rebounds, including a putback dunk for the late lead, and Los Angeles erased a 27-point deficit to beat Dallas.

            LeBron James scored 26 points as the Lakers won their fourth in five games by turning a showcase of stars from a laugher into a thriller that featured 13 lead changes in the fourth quarter.

            Luka Doncic scored 26 points for the Mavs, but the youngest of the four superstars was limited and frustrated after a 14-point first quarter that sent Dallas on its way to the huge lead.

            Kyrie Irving had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Dallas, but didn’t take over in the fourth quarter the way he did in his first victory with Doncic since the trade from Brooklyn — over lowly San Antonio.

            HAWKS 129, NETS 127

            ATLANTA (AP) — Trae Young sank a buzzer-beating jumper over Spencer Dinwiddie to lift Atlanta over Brooklyn a few hours before the Hawks announced they hired Quin Snyder to replace the fired Nate McMillan as coach.

            Young finished with 34 points for the Hawks, who recovered after blowing an 18-point lead to overcome four Nets scorers with at least 20 points.

            Cam Johnson had 27 points for Brooklyn, including a 3-pointer from the corner to tie it at 127 with 7.8 seconds remaining. Mikal Bridges scored 24 for the Nets, who have lost four of five. Cam Thomas added 22 points and Dinwiddie had 20.

            Dejounte Murray scored 28 points and Bogdan Bogdanovic added 22 for Atlanta, which won its second consecutive game under interim coach Joe Prunty after McMillan was fired Tuesday.

            NUGGETS 134, CLIPPERS 124, OT

            DENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic had 40 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists to lead Denver to an overtime victory against Los Angeles in a matchup of Western Conference contenders.

            Paul George nearly won it for the Clippers with an incredible shot at the end of regulation, but his long heave from just in front of the 3-point line in the backcourt came just after the buzzer.

            It was the 23rd triple-double of the season for Jokic and his 14th in the past 19 games. Denver is undefeated this season when he has a triple-double.

            Michael Porter Jr. had 29 points and 11 rebounds for the Nuggets. Jamal Murray added 21 points and 12 assists.

            Kawhi Leonard had 33 points to pace the Clippers.

            BULLS 102, WIZARDS 82

            CHICAGO (AP) — DeMar DeRozan scored 29 points, Zach LaVine added 27 and Chicago overcame its shooting woes from long range to beat Washington.

            Alex Caruso and LaVine each sank 3-pointers midway through the third quarter to turn a one-point deficit into a 57-52 lead the Bulls wouldn’t relinquish. Before the consecutive 3s, the Bulls converted only one of their first 16 3-point attempts.

            The Bulls won their second game in a row after losing six straight to close the first half of the season. They finished shooting 8 of 30 from 3-point range, while the Wizards shot only 6 of 28 from long range.

            Bradley Beal scored 18 points for the Wizards (28-32), who lost their second consecutive game. They played without forward-center Kristaps Porzingis (sore left knee) and guard Monte Morris (sore lower back).

            CAVALIERS 118, RAPTORS 93

            CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points and Jarrett Allen had 23 points and 11 rebounds, sending Cleveland past Toronto.

            Mitchell made eight 3-pointers — one shy of his career high — and had six rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes as the Cavaliers snapped their three-game losing streak and remained fourth in the Eastern Conference.

            Darius Garland added 18 points and 11 assists, and Evan Mobley had 18 points and nine rebounds for Cleveland, which improved to 26-7 at home this season.

            Pascal Siakam paced Toronto with 25 points and grabbed eight rebounds, and Jakob Poeltl had 13 points and nine boards. Starting point guard Fred VanVleet missed his third straight game for personal reasons.

            KINGS 124, THUNDER 115

            OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — De’Aaron Fox had 33 points and eight assists and Sacramento defeated short-handed Oklahoma City.

            Keegan Murray scored 20 points and Domantas Sabonis added 14 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for the Kings, who won their third straight. Sacramento defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 176-175 in two overtimes Friday night in the second highest-scoring game in NBA history. The Kings followed it by shooting 52.9% from the field against the Thunder.

            Isaiah Joe scored 24 points and Lu Dort and Josh Giddey each added 18 for Oklahoma City. The Thunder have lost all three of their games since the All-Star break.

            Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sat out with right ankle soreness and an abdominal strain. The All-Star leads the Thunder with 31 points per game.

            WARRIORS 109, TIMBERWOLVES 104

            SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Klay Thompson scored 32 points, including a key 3-pointer with 2:05 to play, and Golden State held off Minnesota.

            Donte DiVincenzo put Golden State ahead for good on a 3 with 3:02 left and finished with 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists. He also won a jump ball in the final minute.

            Kevon Looney grabbed 17 rebounds and has 13 or more in six consecutive games. He finished with 12 points, and his career-best sixth game in a row with double-digit boards was much-needed for a Warriors team still playing without three starters: Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Andrew Wiggins.

            Naz Reid scored a career-high 30 points and added nine rebounds for Minnesota, but the Timberwolves have lost three straight and four of five.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822598,"Chris Kirk, after 8-year wait, wins the Honda Classic","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Chris Kirk waited nearly eight years to win a PGA Tour event again. Waiting one more hole on Sunday was no problem.

            Kirk stuck his approach to the par-5 18th to tap-in range, and his birdie on the first hole of a playoff lifted him past Eric Cole for the victory at the Honda Classic on Sunday.

            Cole had a chance, playing his third shot from the sand to just outside of 10 feet for a birdie that would have extended the playoff. But it lipped out, and Kirk nudged his ball in for his fifth career win — his first since prevailing at Colonial in 2015.











            “I was obviously very, very nervous today having not won in so long,"" Kirk said. “Coming down the stretch, I felt good.""

            And he’ll be the last Honda winner. The car company is ending its title sponsorship of the event after 42 years, with a new sponsor set to be in place — the PGA Tour hopes, anyway — in the coming weeks.

            They finished 72 holes tied at 14-under 266, Kirk shooting 69 on Sunday, Cole shooting 67.

            Kirk earned $1,512,000 for the win, and is now eligible to play the Masters again for the first time since 2016. Cole earned $915,600 for the runner-up finish, a check that more than doubles what the 34-year-old has earned in 14 previous tour starts.

            “I loved it. It was a lot of fun,"" Cole said. “I can’t wait to get back and do it again. I didn’t have my best stuff today, and I was proud of how hard I fought.""

            Kirk went to the par-5 18th with a one-shot lead. His tee shot found the fairway. His second shot found the water, leading to bogey. Cole made par, giving Kirk new life in the playoff.

            “Bad swing at the wrong time. ... Thank God it worked out,"" Kirk said.

            Kirk hadn’t held a trophy since 2015. That’s not to say he hasn’t done any winning in that span.

            He walked away from the game in May 2019 because of alcoholism and depression. He struggled with anxiety, struggled to deal with pressure, even though he had a penchant for making it seem like no big deal on the golf course — he was a four-time winner, plus made a big putt to help the U.S. win the Presidents Cup at South Korea in 2015.

            The tour gave him a major medical extension for the time he missed, meaning he had a set number of tournaments to do well enough to regain his full status. He got it back by the slimmest of margins at the Sony Open in 2021.

            And now he’s a champion again.

            “I just have so much to be thankful for,” Kirk said. “I’m so grateful for my sobriety, I’m so grateful for my family, I’m so grateful for everyone that has supported throughout the past three or four years.”

            Tyler Duncan, ranked No. 360 in the world coming into the week, shot 66 on Sunday and was third at 12 under. Monday qualifier Ryan Gerard, playing the weekend for the first time on the PGA Tour, shot 67 and finished fourth at 10 under.

            Gerard’s career earnings on tour went from $0 to $411,600. His plans for the next few weeks might be changing based on this finish.

            “I’ve got to go book some flights and hotel rooms, swipe the credit card,"" said Gerard, who came into the week ranked 472nd in the world. “We'll see what happens.”

            Defending champion Sepp Straka (68) was in a group tied for ninth at 9 under, with all four of his rounds in the 60’s. Also in that group: Shane Lowry, who had a chance to win the Honda last year and finished with an even-par 70.

            “I played lovely, and I just couldn’t get it going,"" Lowry said.

            DIVOTS: It was the first playoff for both Kirk and Cole. ... Jhonattan Vegas had the round of the day with a 64, getting to 5 under. He started birdie-birdie-eagle, made a 50-footer for double bogey on the par-3 15th after his tee shot found the water, then made a 36-footer for another eagle to cap the round. ... Billy Horschel (72) battled through sinus issues and finished 2 under for the week, after having a share of the first-round lead. The Florida native still hasn’t won a tour event in Florida, now 0 for 40.

He got it back by the slimmest of margins at the Sony Open in 2021.And now he’s a champion again.“I just have so much to be thankful for,” Kirk said. “I’m so grateful for my sobriety, I’m so grateful for my family, I’m so grateful for everyone that has supported throughout the past three or four years.”Tyler Duncan, ranked No. 360 in the world coming into the week, shot 66 on Sunday and was third at 12 under. Monday qualifier Ryan Gerard, playing the weekend for the first time on the PGA Tour, shot 67 and finished fourth at 10 under.Gerard’s career earnings on tour went from $0 to $411,600. His plans for the next few weeks might be changing based on this finish.“I’ve got to go book some flights and hotel rooms, swipe the credit card,"" said Gerard, who came into the week ranked 472nd in the world. “We'll see what happens.”Defending champion Sepp Straka (68) was in a group tied for ninth at 9 under, with all four of his rounds in the 60’s. Also in that group: Shane Lowry, who had a chance to win the Honda last year and finished with an even-par 70.“I played lovely, and I just couldn’t get it going,"" Lowry said.DIVOTS: It was the first playoff for both Kirk and Cole. ... Jhonattan Vegas had the round of the day with a 64, getting to 5 under. He started birdie-birdie-eagle, made a 50-footer for double bogey on the par-3 15th after his tee shot found the water, then made a 36-footer for another eagle to cap the round. ... Billy Horschel (72) battled through sinus issues and finished 2 under for the week, after having a share of the first-round lead.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822599,Charles Howell III with 63 wins in Mexico for 1st LIV title,"PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) — Charles Howell III finally made winning feel easy Sunday at Mayakoba when his putter came to life for an 8-under 63 to win the LIV Golf Invitational by four shots for his first title in the Saudi-funded series.

            Howell had seven birdies through 10 holes to take control at El Camaleon, and then got some help when Peter Uihlein had to hit three tee shots on the 12th hole in a triple bogey that removed any drama from the final round.

            Howell won in his sixth start in LIV Golf and picked up $4 million, with an additional $1 million for leading his Crushers to a nine-shot victory.











            LIV Golf's opening event in a 14-tournament schedule was a happy time for Howell, the 42-year-old from Augusta, Georgia, who won only three times in 23 seasons and 607 starts on the PGA Tour.

            “It's great,” Howell said. “It's a big win and we got the team win.”

            Two of his three PGA Tour wins were in playoffs, and the other was a two-shot win.

            Howell had a bogey-free card, and most of his birdies were in the 8-foot to 15-foot range as he ran off four in a row and rarely made any mistakes.

            Howell played 13 times at Mayakoba when it hosted a PGA Tour event from 2007 until last November, his best finish a tie for fourth.

            “I've played here many times, so I had an idea what to expect,” Howell said. “Around this place, there's double bogeys everywhere, so you never know.”

            He left that to fellow Oklahoma State alum Uihlein, who began the final round sharing the lead with a third Cowboy, Talor Gooch.

            Uihlein was still in the mix when he snap-hooked his drive into the woods. He hit a provisional for a lost ball and sent that one into the trees on his right. He found the original ball and after trying to remove a pile of limbs and contemplating a penalty for an unplayable lie, chose to go back to the tee.

            It added to a triple bogey, and Uihlein made the most of the final six holes with enough birdies for a 68 to finish alone in second, worth $2,125,000.

            Asked what he would differently, Uihlein smiled and said, “Skip the 12th.”

            “I'm proud of the way I battled,” he said. “Other than that hole, it was a pretty good day. The reality was other than those three tee shots, it was a pretty solid week off the tee.”

            Branden Grace had a 67 and finished third, with $1.5 million. Gooch shot a 76 and finished out of the top 10.

            Howell finished at 16-under 268 for his first win since Sea Island at the end of 2019. He now has made just short of $8 million in his six starts with LIV Golf, nearly equal to his previous five seasons on the PGA Tour.

            Dustin Johnson, who won the individual and team titles in LIV's debut season last year, closed with a 78 and tied for 35th.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822600,Horvat scores short-handed goal as Islanders blank Jets 4-0,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) — Semyon Varlamov would not allow his lack of work in the first period detract him from the job at hand.

            The Islanders netminder faced only one shot in the first period on his way to a 23-save shutout — his second of the season — to backstop New York to 4-0 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday afternoon.

            “Sometimes, it’s easy, sometimes, it’s very, very hard,” Varlamov said. “It depends on how mentally you prepare for the game. I was very hungry to play today so, for me, it wasn’t very hard to stay sharp.”











            He was actually expecting to face a lot more pucks.

            “We expected them to jump in right away,” Varlamov said. “They’re a hard team to play against here in their home arena. They always come out really hard and they always play a very strong first period and stuff like that.""

            Bo Horvat scored a short-handed goal, and Alexander Romanov, Brock Nelson and Adam Pelech scored for New York.

            David Rittich stopped 20 shots for Winnipeg.

            “(Varlamov) just stays solid,” Nelson said. “He’s the kind of guy who just goes out there and works hard and never says anything. Even in practice, he’s always solid. He’s a good teammate and to see him go out there and get a shutout — a big one for us — and be a rock for us was huge.”

            Horvat’s goal in the first period sparked the Isles.

            “The short-handed goal was big, there’s no doubt about it,” said Islanders coach Lane Lambert. “They have a very good power play over there and, to come out of that period with the lead having been short-handed, was helpful for us.”

            The Jets fell to 20-10-0 at home this season.

            “It just wasn’t good enough,” said Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey. “We need to be better in the first periods, we need to be better off the start, and we can’t be a fragile team right now. I’m not saying that we are, but we certainly can’t fall into that mode.

            “We’re an aggressive team. We have to be able to make plays, make passes and not just panic because we’re going through a little bit of a rut.""

            The Jets have scored only nine goals in their last six games.

            “We all gotta figure it out,” said center Pierre-Luc Dubois. “We’re not playing good hockey right now. But, at the same time, we can turn this around and turn it into a positive.

            “We just gotta get going. Time’s running out. There’s not a lot of games left, relatively. But everybody in this room is going to have to talk about it and figure it out.”

            NOTES

            With his goal, Nelson set a new career high of 60 points in a season. He now has 16 points in his last 17 games. … Horvat also hit a new career mark with his 62nd point of the campaign. ... Newly acquired Jet Nino Niederreiter did not dress for Sunday’s contest against the Islanders. Niederreiter was addressing a visa issue, so the Jets recalled forward Axel Jonsson-Fjallby. … The Isles were missing injured forwards Mathew Barzal (lower body) and Jean-Gabriel Pageau (upper body). Forward Josh Bailey returned to action after missing three games with an upper-body injury. … The Jets had killed all 13 penalties in their last four games heading into Sunday’s game.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822601,Davis leads rally from 27 down as Lakers beat Mavs 111-108,"DALLAS (AP) — Anthony Davis dunked a missed shot and screamed after giving the Los Angeles Lakers the lead for good with two minutes to go.

            So much for the 27-point deficit in a showcase of stars that went from a laugher to a thriller with 13 fourth-quarter lead changes.

            Davis had 30 points and 15 rebounds, LeBron James scored 26 and the Lakers completed their biggest rally in 21 years, beating the same team again in a 111-108 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday.











            The fourth win in five games for LA came after trailing by 27 in the middle of the second quarter — the same deficit the Lakers faced at the start of the fourth at home against Dallas on Dec. 6, 2002, before finishing a 30-point rally in a 105-103 victory.

            “The guys never got discouraged,” Lakers coach Darvin Ham said. “They had that look of frustration, but it wasn't a look of defeatedness on their faces. Everybody just wanted to stay encouraged.”

            Luka Doncic scored 26 points for the Mavs, but the youngest of the four superstars was limited and frustrated, largely by the defense of Jarred Vanderbilt, after a 14-point first quarter that sent Dallas on its way to the huge lead.

            Kyrie Irving had 21 points and 11 rebounds for Dallas, but didn’t take over in the fourth quarter the way he did in his first victory with Doncic since the trade from Brooklyn — over lowly San Antonio.

            “We have to grow up if we want to win a championship,” Mavs coach Jason Kidd said. “What the Lakers just showed us is it’s not the rabbit that wins; it’s the turtle. And they worked the game. And that’s what we have to get better at.”

            Davis and James were the fourth-quarter standouts as trade acquisition D’Angelo Russell sat out after spraining his ankle in a victory over defending champion Golden State in the previous game.

            The Lakers had what looked like an ankle scare with James as the rally was gaining steam in the third quarter, with the recently crowned all-time scoring leader staying down for several minutes holding his lower right leg. He stayed in the game.

            “It’s been better,” said James, who limped through the tunnel after the game. “But I definitely wasn’t going to locker room and not finish the game. The importance of this game and then the momentum that we had, I felt like we could steal one after being down.”

            After the injury, James hit a tying 3-pointer to start the fourth, then another bucket for LA's first lead since the middle of the first quarter.

            After Davis' rebound and dunk for a 104-103 lead with 2:00 remaining, James scored for a three-point edge. 

            The Mavericks were still down three with 15 seconds left when an inbound pass from Irving to Doncic was headed toward the backcourt. Doncic ran to save it from going into the backcourt, thinking it would be a turnover if he didn't.

            Davis grabbed the loose ball, forcing Dallas to foul. Doncic could have let the ball go past midcourt without Dallas losing possession.

            Irving said he threw the ball toward the backcourt to give Doncic more room, and figured the soon-to-be 24-year-old would know he could let it cross midcourt.

            “Once I saw him try to save it from half court, I looked at him about a minute later, ‘You know you could go backcourt?’” Irving said. “He's like, ‘Ah, man, that’s my fault.' This is what it's going to be like when you're learning in-game with one another.”

            Vanderbilt, another trade pickup for LA, had 15 points, 17 rebounds and four steals, including two during a 12-0 third-quarter run that got the deficit inside 10 for the first time since late in the first.

Irving was 1 of 8 from deep after halftime. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822602,Jake Paul takes first ring defeat by split decision to Fury,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — YouTube star Jake Paul took the first defeat of his professional boxing career Sunday night, losing a split decision to Tommy Fury.

            Paul (6-1) knocked down Fury with a short left hand early in the final round of their cruiserweight bout, but the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury controlled long stretches of the eight-round meeting at Diriyah Arena.

            Two judges scored the bout 76-73 for Fury (9-0, 4 KOs), while the third favored Paul, 75-74.











            “I've already won every single way in life,” Paul said. “I made it farther than I ever thought I would, and beyond. This is a humbling experience. I’ll take it on the chin and come back.”

            Fury is the first actual professional boxer fought by Paul, who built his lucrative second career by taking on mixed martial artists and a fellow YouTuber in boxing bouts that generated huge social media attention despite featuring more enthusiasm than skill.

            Fury also is much better known as a celebrity sibling — and much more accomplished as a reality television star — than as a boxer, leading to a relatively even matchup with Paul. Fury's unbeaten record entering this bout was built against a series of wildly overmatched opponents with a combined record of 24-176-5.

            “In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”

            Both fighters had good moments in the first four rounds in front of a star-studded crowd in Saudi Arabia, but Fury landed more significant shots behind a consistent jab that allowed him to keep Paul at a distance.

            Paul appeared to stun Fury with an accurate left hook early in the fifth round, but he also lost a point when the referee penalized him, apparently for pushing down on Fury’s head in a clinch. The referee then took a point from Fury in the sixth, apparently for excessive clinching.

            Fury had a strong seventh round despite a cut near his left eye from a clash of heads, repeatedly tagging Paul with combinations. But Paul abruptly reversed the momentum with a perfectly timed left that wobbled Fury, who put his left glove on the canvas to steady himself and bounced up immediately.

            Fury finished strong and claimed the decision.

            Fury and Paul were slated to meet two times previously, but Fury was unavailable for both showdowns. He injured a rib before their scheduled bout in December 2021, and he was denied entry to the U.S. last summer ahead of a planned meeting in August.

            Paul used the postponements to taunt Fury, and the emotions built into a contentious weigh-in earlier this week in Saudi Arabia, which jumped at the chance to underwrite this boxing spectacle and social media event.

            “All the way through these 2 1/2 years, I had a dream, I had a vision that I would win this fight,” Fury said. “No one believed me. Now I can stand up, and everyone can take note.”

            The crowd in the arena outside Riyadh included Al Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo, comedian Kevin Hart and a collection of boxers including Mike Tyson, Deontay Wilder, Devin Haney and Tyson Fury, who had publicly urged his younger sibling to interrupt Paul’s career with a knockout.

I’ll take it on the chin and come back.”Fury is the first actual professional boxer fought by Paul, who built his lucrative second career by taking on mixed martial artists and a fellow YouTuber in boxing bouts that generated huge social media attention despite featuring more enthusiasm than skill.Fury also is much better known as a celebrity sibling — and much more accomplished as a reality television star — than as a boxer, leading to a relatively even matchup with Paul. Fury's unbeaten record entering this bout was built against a series of wildly overmatched opponents with a combined record of 24-176-5.“In my first main event, 23 years old, I had the world on my shoulders, and I came through,” Fury said. “This, to me, is a world title fight. I trained so hard for this. This was my destiny.”Both fighters had good moments in the first four rounds in front of a star-studded crowd in Saudi Arabia, but Fury landed more significant shots behind a consistent jab that allowed him to keep Paul at a distance.Paul appeared to stun Fury with an accurate left hook early in the fifth round, but he also lost a point when the referee penalized him, apparently for pushing down on Fury’s head in a clinch. The referee then took a point from Fury in the sixth, apparently for excessive clinching.Fury had a strong seventh round despite a cut near his left eye from a clash of heads, repeatedly tagging Paul with combinations. But Paul abruptly reversed the momentum with a perfectly timed left that wobbled Fury, who put his left glove on the canvas to steady himself and bounced up immediately.Fury finished strong and claimed the decision.Fury and Paul were slated to meet two times previously, but Fury was unavailable for both showdowns. He injured a rib before their scheduled bout in December 2021, and he was denied entry to the U.S. last summer ahead of a planned meeting in August.Paul used the postponements to taunt Fury, and the emotions built into a contentious weigh-in earlier this week in Saudi Arabia, which jumped at the chance to underwrite this boxing spectacle and social media event.“All the way through these 2 1/2 years, I had a dream, I had a vision that I would win this fight,” Fury said. “No one believed me. Now I can stand up, and everyone can take note.”The crowd in the arena outside Riyadh included Al Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo, comedian Kevin Hart and a collection of boxers including Mike Tyson, Deontay Wilder, Devin Haney and Tyson Fury, who had publicly urged his younger sibling to interrupt Paul’s career with a knockout.___AP boxing: https://apnews.com/hub/boxing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/27,,World
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822603,Mississippi GOP governor now backs longer Medicaid for moms,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves did an abrupt about-face Sunday on an issue for which Democrats have been sharply criticizing him this election year, saying for the first time that he wants the state to allow a full year of Medicaid coverage to women after they give birth.

            Reeves said on social media that if the Republican-controlled state House and Senate send him a bill to allow a year of postpartum Medicaid coverage, “I will sign it into law.” 

            Reeves said he is willing to do so “as part of our new pro-life agenda."" He said more babies will be born because the U.S. Supreme Court upended abortion rights nationwide last year with a case that originated in Mississippi.











            “I believe that to be a beautiful thing,” Reeves wrote. “I also believe that added stress will be felt by more Mississippi moms. We have to love them. We have to support them.”

            As governor since January 2020 and during two previous terms as lieutenant governor, Reeves has resisted efforts to expand the scope of Medicaid and other government programs. He has not publicly changed his opposition to a broader expansion of Medicaid coverage to working people with low-wage jobs that don't provide private insurance. Mississippi is one of 11 states that have not approved that broader expansion.

            Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have extended postpartum Medicaid coverage to a full year.

            Physicians in the Mississippi State Medical Association and businesses leaders in the Mississippi Economic Council have endorsed a full year of postpartum Medicaid coverage, saying it could improve health outcomes in a state with a high rate of maternal mortality.

            Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the U.S., and about 60% of births in Mississippi are to women covered by Medicaid. The state usually allows two months of postpartum Medicaid coverage.

            Since the COVID-19 public health emergency started in 2020, Mississippi has allowed a full year of postpartum coverage, although many patients have said the state did little to let them know the coverage remained after the usual two months.

            The national public health emergency is set to expire in May. The deadline, combined with the Mississippi election season, has intensified debate over postpartum coverage.

            Brandon Presley, a state utility regulator now running for governor as a Democrat, said Thursday on Twitter that Reeves “doesn't have the guts to push postpartum care for mothers.”

            “You would think ‘His Majesty’ would be able to persuade the Legislature to do the right thing,” Presley wrote. “Unlike @tatereeves, I don't think I know more than doctors.”

            The two Democratic leaders in the Mississippi Legislature — Sen. Derrick Simmons of Greenville and Rep. Robert Johnson of Natchez — criticized Reeves in a joint statement Sunday

            “Saying he’ll sign this bill if it comes to him is simply a last-ditch effort to save face on an issue that the vast majority of Mississippians support,” Simmons and Johnson said of the governor. “It is not courageous; it is craven political theater.”

            The Mississippi Senate on Feb. 7 passed a bill to allow a full year of postpartum Medicaid coverage, as it has in previous years. House Speaker Philip Gunn, a Republican, has not said whether the House will consider that bill. The other Senate bills in recent years have died in the House because of Gunn's opposition.

            Reeves, who often refers to himself as a “numbers guy,"" expressed skepticism Sunday as he staked out his new position on longer postpartum Medicaid coverage.

            “The debate surrounding the future of those benefits has been fierce,” Reeves wrote. “And, to be perfectly honest, I haven't been swayed by the data that is, at best, incomplete and, at worst, often misconstrued and mischaracterized by the ‘more government benefits no matter the cost’ crowd.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822604,"Kitley scores 29, No. 9 Virginia Tech women top Georgia Tech","ATLANTA (AP) — Elizabeth Kitley scored a season-high 29 points and added 11 rebounds to lead No. 9 Virginia Tech to a 65-52 victory over Georgia Tech on Sunday.

            “She proved that she's the ACC player of the year,” Virginia Tech Kenny Brooks said of Kitley's performance. ""There are some fine players in the league that have done some really good things but no one can compare to that kid and what she's done this year.

            “She's definitely the ACC player of the year.”











            Kayana Traylor added 14 points, seven rebounds and five assists, and Georgia Amoore had eight points, seven assists and two steals for Virginia Tech (24-4, 14-4 ACC). Cayla King added 10 points.

            “We just didn't have an answer for Kitley tonight,” Georgia Tech coach Nell Fortner said, “and she really, really hurt us.” 

            The Hokies, who have won eight straight games, won 14 games in the ACC for the first time and have reached the highest AP ranking in program history.

            The Hokies led 18-10 after one quarter, then an 11-0 run midway through the second quarter gave them a 37-19 lead with 1:43 left in the half. Cameron Swartz closed the quarter with two 3-pointers for Georgia Tech, narrowing the gap to 37-25 at the break.

            The Hokies' largest lead in the second half was 18 points when Traylor's layup made it 65-47 with 4:29 remaining.

            “We played well in spurts,” Brooks said. “It’s a good win; it’s a hard place to play.” 

            Swartz scored 20 points and was the only player in double-figures scoring for the Yellow Jackets (13-16, 4-14). Georgia Tech shot 38% (21 of 55) overall and made 4 of 13 from the field (0 for 4 from 3-point range) in the fourth quarter. 

            “I thought we got good looks at the basket but we just couldn't knock shots down,” Fortner said. 

            Virginia Tech finished tied for second place with Duke and will be the third seed in the conference tournament that starts Wednesday in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Hokies will have a double bye and will play their first game on Friday.

            Georgia Tech finished tied with Virginia for 13th place.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822611,Kyle Busch gets 1st RCR victory in Fontana's NASCAR farewell,"FONTANA, Calif. (AP) — Kyle Busch still smiles at the memory of getting thrown out of California Speedway during his first competitive trip here in 2001. The 16-year-old upstart dominated a NASCAR Truck Series practice, only to be told he couldn't run in a race sponsored by Marlboro because he was too young to smoke.

            “That was my ‘Welcome to NASCAR’ moment and my ‘Welcome to California Speedway’ moment,” Busch said.

            Anger, conflict and disrespect have always appeared to be Busch's favorite fuels, and the record-setting veteran burned plenty of them Sunday while rewarding his new team — and sending this beloved track off in style.











            Busch stormed up from the back after an early speeding penalty to earn his first victory for Richard Childress Racing, winning on this two-mile Southern California track for the fifth and final time.

            Busch held off Chase Elliott and Ross Chastain in the NASCAR Cup Series' final race on the gloriously weathered asphalt at Auto Club Speedway, which will soon be demolished to make room for a proposed half-mile track. Busch asked Fontana officials for a chunk of that asphalt as a souvenir after he burned it up one last time on his way to Victory Lane.

            “That’s what I enjoy the most about this racetrack,” Busch said. “It’s big. It gets spread out. But man, you can move around and you can spread out and you can make your own destiny by trying to find something that will work for your race car. It’s a sad day for me to see this racetrack in its last race being a two-mile configuration. Glad I was able to win the final run here.”

            Busch drove his Chevrolet to victory in only his second race with RCR, which scooped him up in December after his 15-year tenure with Joe Gibbs Racing ended. This win was Busch’s first since Bristol last season on a dirt track, and his first on pavement since Pocono in 2021.

            With his 61st career victory, Busch earned a win in his record 19th consecutive Cup season, breaking a tie with Richard Petty. Busch said he set his focus on Petty's longevity record “a long, long time ago.”

            “I’m just so thankful for the opportunity to set that bar, and would love to continue to keep raising it,” Busch said.

            The victory also was the combined 95th win by Kyle and Kurt Busch, breaking the NASCAR record for brothers previously held by Bobby and Donnie Allison.

            Elliott finished 2.998 seconds behind Busch in his Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet. Daniel Suárez finished fourth, and Kevin Harvick was fifth in the Bakersfield native's 750th Cup start.

            “Congratulations to Kyle,"" Elliott said. “For him to leave and then to go get the job done like that is pretty cool. He’s always been really good to me, so happy for them.”

            After that teenage trouble, the Las Vegas native has enjoyed plenty of highlights down the I-15 at Fontana. Busch got his first Cup victory at this speedway back in 2005 in a Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet, and only Jimmie Johnson (6) earned more Cup victories here.

            Even the California fans appreciate a driver who typically gets boos after his triumphs: Fontana serenaded him with cheers as he claimed another surfboard trophy.

            ""There's nothing more rewarding than being able to go to Victory Lane,"" Busch said. “I death-gripped that wheel throughout the second half of that race, but we got the victory.”

            Busch was sent to the back early in the race for speeding on pit road, and the penalty infuriated him. To absolutely nobody's surprise, he roared through the field in response, passing Michael McDowell for the lead with 20 laps to go.

            “That's why he's won as many races as he has,” said Randall Burnett, Busch's crew chief. “Because he always pushes it to the limit.”

            GOODBYE FONTANA

            The traditional five-wide salute before the race carried added poignancy because of the finality of this race: NASCAR is shutting down the track built by Roger Penske with vague plans to build a new track in its place, along with selling off much of the surrounding property.

            The decision brings an end to an entertaining era for stock car racing in Southern California's rich car culture. The big track east of Los Angeles is a favorite of nearly every racer in multiple disciplines, with its coarse grip and wide-open spaces creating impressive racing for a quarter-century.

            NASCAR currently has nowhere to race in the area in 2024, and the new track might not even be ready by 2025 — if it happens at all.

            DRY SUNDAY

            A week of unusual rainstorms and occasional snow finally abated Saturday night, and NASCAR dried the asphalt impressively before the race. Although sand and debris bothered some drivers, the track even managed to avoid any major problems from collected rainwater weeping out of cracks in the track.

            BIG CRASH

            The race featured a major wreck out of a restart shortly before the midway point involving 10 cars, the most in any collision in a Cup race at Fontana. Four drivers — including pole-sitter Christopher Bell — couldn't continue after the wreck that sent several cars skidding into across infield.

            FOR STARTERS

            Defending champion Kyle Larson was out of contention after developing engine trouble on the opening laps. Shortly after Brad Keselowski spun from contact with Corey LaJoie, Busch was sent to the back.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822612,"Kirk wins Honda in playoff, Howell gets 1st LIV title","PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) — Chris Kirk waited nearly eight years to win a PGA Tour event again. Waiting one more hole on Sunday was no problem.

            Kirk stuck his approach to the par-5 18th to tap-in range, and his birdie on the first hole of a playoff lifted him past Eric Cole on Sunday in the Honda Classic.

            Cole had a chance, playing his third shot from the sand to just outside of 10 feet for a birdie that would have extended the playoff. But it lipped out, and Kirk nudged his ball in for his fifth career win — his first since prevailing at Colonial in 2015.











            They finished 72 holes tied at 14-under 266, Kirk shooting 69, Cole with a 67.

            Kirk earned $1,512,000 for the win, and is now eligible to play the Masters again for the first time since 2016. Cole earned $915,600 for the runner-up finish, a check that more than doubles what the 34-year-old has earned in 14 previous tour starts.

            Kirk went to the par-5 18th with a one-shot lead. His tee shot found the fairway, and his second shot bounced off the rocks and into the water, leading to bogey. Cole failed to get up-and-down from right of the green and made par, giving Kirk new life in the playoff.

            LIV GOLF

            PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico (AP) — Charles Howell III finally made winning feel easy at Mayakoba when his putter came to life for an 8-under 63 to win the LIV Golf Invitational by four shots for his first title in the Saudi-funded series.

            Howell had seven birdies through 10 holes to take control at El Camaleon, and then got some help when Peter Uihlein had to hit three tee shots on the 12th hole in a triple bogey that removed any drama from the final round.

            Howell won in his sixth start in LIV Golf and picked up $4 million, with an additional $1 million for leading his Crushers to a nine-shot victory.

            LIV Golf’s opening event in a 14-tournament schedule was a happy time for Howell, the 42-year-old from Augusta, Georgia, who won only three times in 23 seasons and 607 starts on the PGA Tour. Two of his three PGA Tour wins were in playoffs, and the other was a two-shot win.

            Howell had a bogey-free card, and most of his birdies were in the 8-foot to 15-foot range as he ran off four in a row and rarely made any mistakes.

            Uihlein made the most of the final six holes with enough birdies for a 68 to finish alone in second, worth $2,125,000. Branden Grace had a 67 and finished third, with $1.5 million. 

            LPGA TOUR

            CHONBURI, Thailand (AP) — Lilia Vu rode a hot putter to claim her maiden LPGA title, closing with an 8-under 64 for a one-shot victory over home favorite Natthakritta Vongtaveelap in the LPGA Thailand.

            Vu trailed six six shots going into the final round. The 25-year-old American unleashed eight birdies, including five straight from the eighth hole.

            She finished at 22-under 266 on the Old Course at Siam Country Club.

            Vu became the third American to win the event after Lexi Thompson in 2016 and Jessica Korda in 2018. 

            Playing her first LPGA tournament, Vongtaveelap’s lack of experience took a toll with the 20-year-old enduring a mixed final round featuring seven birdies offset by a double bogey and four bogeys to sign for a 71.

            Another Thai golfer, Atthaya Thitikul, was third after a final-round 68 got her to 268. Maja Stark of Sweden and French Celine Boutier settled at joint fourth on 271, one ahead of top-ranked Lydia Ko, who finished joint-sixth on 272. 

            EUROPEAN TOUR

            NEW DELHI (AP) — Marcel Siem ended his long wait for a fifth European tour title by closing with a 4-under 68 for a one-shot victory in the Hero Indian Open.

            Siem’s last win on the tour came eight years and 116 days ago at the 2014 BMW Masters in Shanghai. The 42-year-old German had to go through qualifying school in November.

            Starting one shot behind Yannik Paul, Siem took a share of the lead after a 20-foot birdie putt at the fourth. They remained tied through 13 holes, and Siem regained the lead with a 15-foot birdie putt on the 15th hole.

            He closed his round with three more pars, rolling in a 3-foot par putt on No. 18 to win moments after Paul slid his birdie putt wide from about 12 feet.

            Paul finished alone in second on 13 under, with Dutchman Joost Luiten another shot back in third.

            OTHER TOURS

            Dylan Mostert birdied the final hole for a 5-under 67 and a one-shot victory over Jaco Prinsloo in the Nelson Mandela Bay Championship Prinsloo closed with a 62. The tournament was co-sanctioned by the Sunshine Tour and the Challenge Tour. ... Brett Coletta set the course record with a 9-under 61 and won the TPS Hunter Valley in a playoff over Lincoln Tighe on the PGA Tour of Australasia.

            Tom Blundell made 90 and was the last man out as New Zealand’s second innings ended at 483 less than an hour before stumps.

            Under New Zealand-born head coach Brendon McCullum, England already has pulled off its highest successful run chase in tests, scoring 378 to beat India at Edgbaston last year. This chase for 258 with more than 100 overs available would seem a walk in the park by comparison.











            Tim Southee removed Zac Crawley (24) with a ball that cut back to hit off peg and at stumps England was 48-1, needing 210 from 103 overs on the last day to sweep the two-match series.

            The odds still heavily favor the visitors but Williamson at least has given New Zealand hope. 

            When he reached 29 on his way to 132, he became New Zealand’s highest run-scorer in tests, overtaking his former teammate Ross Taylor, who ended his career last year with 7,682 runs.

            And in batting for all of the fourth day, in productive partnerships with Henry Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell and Tom Blundell, Williamson guided New Zealand from a 226 run deficit when England enforced the follow-on Sunday to a respectable lead.

            “I don’t sort of think too much about records,” Williamson said. “It’s all about the team and the position you’re in and trying to do more.

            “It was nice to be part of some partnerships today and get a pretty good second innings effort on the board. Having said that you always want more and we were hoping for a few more in terms of the position we got ourselves into. But all to play for tomorrow.”

            After making only 10 runs in his previous three innings in the series, Williamson showed why he is New Zealand’s best batsman when the chips are down. The match was in the balance at the start of the day: New Zealand was 202-3, still 24 runs behind England who just had taken the second new ball.

            Williamson and Nicholls (29) erased the deficit by the ninth over and saw off the new ball in a partnership of 55 for the fourth wicket.

            Daryl Mitchell came in after Nicholls, when Williamson was 34, and rushed past Williamson to a half century from 52 balls. Williamson reached his own half century soon after from 148 deliveries and in just over four hours, reflecting the extent of his patience and application.

            Mitchell was out for 54 in a 75-run partnership with Williamson, at the end of which New Zealand’s lead was 71. Them came Tom Blundell, the first test century-maker, who provided Williamson with the extended support he needed to gradually improve New Zealand’s position.

            Williamson had batted for 7-1/2 hours when England, having explored every reasonable means of removing him, gave Harry Brook his first bowl in test cricket. Brook’s bowling style officially is described as right-arm medium. In reality it might be called dribbly medium pace.

            But it was Brook who finally ended Williamson’s innings and claimed a first test wicket, which will give him bragging rights for years to come.

            The decisive ball was gentle and unthreatening, pitching short and heading down leg side. Williamson closed up his guard to glance behind square and the ball glanced across the bat en route to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes.

            England’s appeal for the catch behind was rejected. The tourists reviewed the call, and the replay showed the faintest of edges, as England erupted in celebration.

            When Williamson was out, New Zealand’s resistance was broken and the end came quickly. Michael Bracewell paid the price for casual running between wickets and Jack Leach dismissed Tim Southee and Matt Henry in the same over.

            Leach also ended Blundell’s four-hour innings but by that stage, including the first innings, England had been in the field for more than 215 overs.

Hsiao’s travels are helping bolster Taiwan’s reputation abroad, as well as opportunities for economic cooperation.UDN reported that Hsiao visited Kentucky from Feb. 23-24 and met with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear to exchange views on Taiwan-U.S. relations and bilateral trade opportunities. The electric vehicle and whiskey industries were also identified as areas of potential cooperation, with Hsiao encouraging Kentucky to set up a trade office in Taiwan.Hsiao also met with Kentucky State Senate President Robert Stivers and Kentucky House of Representatives Speaker David Osborne. She was also invited to witness both the Kentucky State Senate and Kentucky House of Representatives pass resolutions supporting Taiwan.In a speech delivered to Kentucky lawmakers, Hsiao said the Russian-Ukraine war has approached the one-year anniversary, highlighting the importance of establishing partnerships to promote peace and avert war. Hsiao said Taiwan has long struggled for freedom of speech and basic human rights, and it has gradually become a democratic country like the U.S.Hsiao added that Taiwan is committed to maintaining a democratic system and opposing force and coercion, one reason why Taiwan has so many international partners around the world. Hsiao also touched on agricultural cooperation and technology exchange as another area of bilateral benefit.The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Atlanta said the Kentucky State Senate and House of Representatives passed resolutions encouraging the establishment of a trade office in Taiwan, support for the Taiwan-US Initiative on 21st Century Trade, the signing of U.S. and Taiwan bilateral trade agreements (BTA) as soon as possible, and supporting meaningful international engagement for Taiwan.Earlier this month (Feb. 16), Hsiao visited Virginia, which is near her work and residence in Washington, D.C. On that trip she met with politicians such as Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, Virginia Lieutenant Governor and State Senate President Winsome Earle-Sears. The purpose of this trip was to discuss economic and trade cooperation.During the visit, Hsiao was also invited to speak at a Virginia House of Representatives reception for Taiwan Caucus members. In her speech she noted that Virginia is the birthplace of U.S. democracy and the home of eight former U.S. presidents. She also remarked that Taiwan and Virginia have maintained sister-state relations for 42 years.",2023/02/27,736,Politics

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822624,Trotz taking over for Poile as general manager of Predators,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Barry Trotz is rejoining the Nashville Predators in their front office, succeeding David Poile, the only general manager in the NHL franchise's history. 

            The team announced the change Sunday, effective the end of June. Poile will retire from the role he has been in for more than 25 years and step into a position as an adviser to ownership, business and hockey operations.

            “This is a decision that is best for me personally and best for the Nashville Predators,” Poile said in a statement. “For the Predators, I believe it is time for a new voice and a new direction. I am proud of the foundation we have put in place in our hockey operations, investing in and improving every area of the department. This is the right time for someone else to move our franchise forward.""











            Trotz coached the Predators from before the team's inception in 1998 through 2014 and owns the record for the most victories in team history. He coached the Washington Capitals to the Stanley Cup in 2018 and was behind the bench for the New York Islanders from 2018-22.

            “My heart has been in Nashville since that first season,” Trotz said. ""I believe I am prepared to succeed as an NHL general manager, and I have David to thank for that. I will work hard as a member of David’s team for the next four months, and when I become GM on July 1, I pledge to do everything I can in leading our franchise to its first ever Stanley Cup.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822626,Rangers' Miller ejected for spitting at Kings' Doughty,"NEW YORK (AP) — Rangers defenseman K’Andre Miller was given a match penalty and ejected after spitting at Kings defenseman Drew Doughty late in the first period of Sunday’s game.

            Miller’s absence left the Rangers with just five defensemen the remainder of the game — the second time in two days they’ve had to finish a game a player short at the position.

            After the game Rangers coach Gerard Gallant said he didn't see the play when it happened.











            “The kid feels bad about it,” he said of Miller. “He said it was an accident.” 

            Miller was not made available to reporters following the game.

            Doughty said he was caught off guard.

            “I was just shocked obviously,"" Doughty said. ""I don’t even know if I said anything to him after. You don’t want to see things like that in this game. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen that. I’m sure it has happened, not that I’ve seen. It’s unfortunate.

            “The game they played yesterday set them up for the game they played tonight,"" McLellan said.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822628,Hawks hire Snyder as coach to replace fired McMillan,"ATLANTA (AP) — Quin Snyder has been hired as coach of the Atlanta Hawks to replace the fired Nate McMillan, the team announced Sunday.

            The Hawks reached an agreement with Snyder on a five-year deal only five days after firing McMillan on Tuesday. The team has scheduled a news conference for Monday to introduce Snyder.

            The announcement from the team Sunday came shortly after the Hawks’ second straight win under interim coach Joe Prunty, a buzzer-beating 129-127 win over the Brooklyn Nets.











            When announcing McMillan’s firing, general manager Landry Fields stressed that Atlanta’s eighth-place standing in the Eastern Conference was not acceptable for a team that advanced to the conference finals in 2021. On Wednesday, Fields confirmed Snyder was a candidate. 

            Because Snyder, 56, was available, the agreement to return to Atlanta, where he was an assistant on Mike Budenholzer’s staff during the 2013-14 season, was reached quickly.

            The decision to fire McMillan at the All-Star break allowed Fields to negotiate exclusively with Snyder. Had Fields waited until after the season, other teams might have had interest in Snyder.

            “From our first conversation, it was clear that Quin had all the characteristics we were looking for in our next head coach,” Fields said in a statement released by the team. “He has both an incredible basketball and emotional IQ, and we share the same core values and basketball philosophies of having honest communication and collaboration with players, tremendous attention to detail and placing a great emphasis on player development.”

            Snyder said he’s “thrilled to go back to Atlanta.”

            “I am excited to collaborate with Landry to create a successful program that devoted Hawks fans are proud of and cheer for and am grateful to Tony, Jami and the Ressler family for this opportunity,” Snyder said in the team’s statement. “My family and I are looking forward to immersing ourselves in the community and calling Atlanta home.”

            Snyder was coach of the Utah Jazz from the 2014-15 to 2021-22 seasons, accumulating a 372-264 record and leading the team to the playoffs in six of his eight seasons.

            McMillan went 99-80 as Atlanta’s coach, including a 27-11 record as interim in the second half of the 2020-21 season. His success that season in leading Atlanta to the Eastern Conference finals earned him the full-time position.

            McMillan was unable to follow up on the 2021 postseason success.

            The Hawks finished 43-39 in the 2021-22 season and, after escaping the play-in tournament, lost to the Miami Heat 4-1 in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

            The pressure on McMillan to guide the Hawks closer to the top of the conference increased this season. The team’s win-now approach became more clear when Danilo Gallinari and three first-round picks were traded to the San Antonio Spurs for All-Star guard Dejounte Murray.

            The trade formed a backcourt pairing of All-Star guards in Murray and Trae Young and placed more heat on McMillan. Despite the addition of another top scorer in Murray, the Hawks struggled near .500 most of the season. They lost four of six games before the All-Star break and were one game under .500 when McMillan was fired.

            There was no immediate announcement about Snyder’s Atlanta staff. The new coach will have only one day before making his debut with the team in Tuesday night’s home game against Washington, so the expectation is Snyder will retain at least most of McMillan’s staff which continued to operate under Prunty.

            AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsATLANTA (AP) — Quin Snyder has been hired as coach of the Atlanta Hawks to replace the fired Nate McMillan, the team announced Sunday.The Hawks reached an agreement with Snyder on a five-year deal only five days after firing McMillan on Tuesday. The team has scheduled a news conference for Monday to introduce Snyder.The announcement from the team Sunday came shortly after the Hawks’ second straight win under interim coach Joe Prunty, a buzzer-beating 129-127 win over the Brooklyn Nets.When announcing McMillan’s firing, general manager Landry Fields stressed that Atlanta’s eighth-place standing in the Eastern Conference was not acceptable for a team that advanced to the conference finals in 2021. On Wednesday, Fields confirmed Snyder was a candidate.Because Snyder, 56, was available, the agreement to return to Atlanta, where he was an assistant on Mike Budenholzer’s staff during the 2013-14 season, was reached quickly.The decision to fire McMillan at the All-Star break allowed Fields to negotiate exclusively with Snyder. Had Fields waited until after the season, other teams might have had interest in Snyder.“From our first conversation, it was clear that Quin had all the characteristics we were looking for in our next head coach,” Fields said in a statement released by the team. “He has both an incredible basketball and emotional IQ, and we share the same core values and basketball philosophies of having honest communication and collaboration with players, tremendous attention to detail and placing a great emphasis on player development.”Snyder said he’s “thrilled to go back to Atlanta.”“I am excited to collaborate with Landry to create a successful program that devoted Hawks fans are proud of and cheer for and am grateful to Tony, Jami and the Ressler family for this opportunity,” Snyder said in the team’s statement. “My family and I are looking forward to immersing ourselves in the community and calling Atlanta home.”Snyder was coach of the Utah Jazz from the 2014-15 to 2021-22 seasons, accumulating a 372-264 record and leading the team to the playoffs in six of his eight seasons.McMillan went 99-80 as Atlanta’s coach, including a 27-11 record as interim in the second half of the 2020-21 season. His success that season in leading Atlanta to the Eastern Conference finals earned him the full-time position.McMillan was unable to follow up on the 2021 postseason success.The Hawks finished 43-39 in the 2021-22 season and, after escaping the play-in tournament, lost to the Miami Heat 4-1 in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.The pressure on McMillan to guide the Hawks closer to the top of the conference increased this season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822629,Revenge for Norrie against Alcaraz at Rio Open,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Cameron Norrie waited a week for his revenge against top-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, rallying from a set and 3-0 down to beat the Spanish teenager in the Rio Open final on Sunday for his first title of the year. 

            Second-seeded Norrie won 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 to win the fifth title of his career after defeats in the final to Richard Gasquet in Auckland in January and to Alcaraz in the Argentina Open championship match last weekend.

            Alcaraz's failure to retain his title at the clay-court tournament in Rio de Janeiro also stopped him from tying with Novak Djokovic in points at the top of the rankings. Djokovic would still have been No. 1 due to other results.











            Alcaraz and Norrie went head to head in a tightly fought first set, which was eventually decided by Alcaraz's drop shots breaking Norrie's serve. 

            Alcaraz showed more confidence with his powerful forehand shots at the start of the second set, and opened a 3-0 advantage against Norrie. But the British player recovered in the middle of the set as Alcaraz felt pains in his right leg, which hindered his movement and serve. The Spaniard later said the problem was a recurrence of the injury that sidelined him for almost four months until earlier in February.

            “I didn't see (Alcaraz was injured). I broke him to make 4-3 in the second set, then he called the trainer. But he didn't take any injury time out at all in the match,” Norrie said in a press conference when asked whether he had sought to exploit the Spaniard's physical difficulties. “It is special when you do it against a top player like Alcaraz. It took a lot of heart.”

            Norrie led most of the deciding set but had to work hard against a recovering Alcaraz. Norrie's strong returns helped him to prevail in 2 hours, 41 minutes, clinching the title with an ace. The Briton dropped to his knees and roared to celebrate in front of a crowd that was mostly supporting Alcaraz.

            “I had to fight really hard and I had to run a lot,” Norrie said after winning his first ATP 500 title. “To win a title on clay is a different kind of feeling. You really have to earn it, you need to run a lot. I lose a couple of finals this year, and to turn around here and win the biggest title of the year ... I came to South America with the intention to improve on clay. My game can be well suited.” 

            Alcaraz returned to the tour last week at the Argentina Open, where he dropped only one set en route to his first title since his Grand Slam breakthrough at the U.S. Open last year. He said he was not sure whether he would be joining Norrie at the hardcourt tournament in Acapulco next week due to his leg injury.

            “I did not seize my opportunities like I did in Buenos Aires. And I couldnt't finish the match at my best physical level,” Alcaraz said. “I've played each of the latest 15 days without stop. And in tough matches like this one you can feel some pain. To avoid something worse I wrapped my leg to protect it. But when you feel an injury you had a few months before, it is complicated.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822639,"Jones hits 4 3s, scores 21; Stanford beats Washington 81-69","STANFORD, Calif. (AP) — Spencer Jones hit four 3-pointers and scored 21 points on 7-of-13 shooting from the field, Brandon Angel added 14 points, seven rebounds and four assists and Stanford beat Washington 81-69 Sunday to snap a three-game losing streak. 

            Maxime Raynaud made 7 of 12 from the field and finished with 15 points for Stanford. Harrison Ingram added 11 points, six rebounds and six assists and Michael Jones scored 10 points, including three 3-pointers. 

            Washington, which beat the Cardinal 86-69 in Seattle on Jan. 12, has not swept the season series since the 2018-19 campaign. 











            Ingram and Spencer Jones made back-to-back 3s to spark an 8-0 opening run and the Cardinal never trailed. Langston Wilson's dunk with about three minutes left in the first half trimmed the Huskies deficit to 27-24 but Angel responded with a three-point play and followed with a layup before Jones converted another three-point play and hit a 3-pointer to cap an 11-2 and give Stanford a 12-point lead at halftime. 

            Jamal Bey hit a 3-pointer before Braxton Meah added a basket in the paint and then threw down a dunk to trim Washington’s deficit to five points with 15:37 to play but Matthew Murrell, Spencer Jones and Angel each hit a 3-pointer in an 13-2 run that culminated when Angel made a layup that gave Stanford a 51-37 advantage about three minutes later and the Huskies never again threatened. 

            Washington (16-14, 8-11 Pac-12) had its three-game win streak, tied for its longest of the season, snapped. 

            Stanford shot 49% from the field and made 12 of 24 from behind the arc. The Cardinal is shooting 56 of 115 (48.7%) from 3-point range over the last six games. 

            Bey led Washington with 21 points and 8 rebounds and Keion Brooks Jr. added 17 points, going 8 of 8 from the free-throw line. The Huskies shot 39% (22 of 57) from the field and made just 4 of 17 from 3-point range. 

            Michael O'Connell, who finished with two points, had a career-best 12 of the Cardinal's season-high 25 assists. Stanford previous high of 18 assists was set in its season-opening win over Pacific. 

            Stanford (12-17, 6-12) had lost five of its last six.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822640,"Reese ties LSU double-double mark, No. 5 Tigers top MSU","BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Alexis Morris was unfazed — if not motivated — by seeing her more than half-court basket disallowed as the third quarter expired.

            Morris scored 13 of her 23 points in the fourth quarter, Angel Reese had 23 points and 26 rebounds to tie Sylvia Fowles' LSU record of 27 double-doubles in a season, and the fifth-ranked Tigers topped Mississippi State, 74-59 on Sunday night.

            “The shot being waved off probably did give me a little more ammunition, but I’m one of the go-to players,” Morris said. “It’s something I definitely embrace.” 











            LaDazhia Williams added 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting for the Tigers (27-1, 15-1 SEC), whose regular-season record matched the program's best, set in the 2004-05 season by a squad starring Seimone Augustus.

            Morris and Williams were both seniors playing in their final regular-season home game at LSU, but both took comfort in knowing LSU is virtually guaranteed to be a host site for the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.

            “I want my senior night to be in Dallas,"" Morris, a Beaumont, Texas, native said referring to the site of this season's NCAA Women's Final Four.

            But Morris did note that she nearly gave up playing basketball before transferring to LSU in 2021 for a second stint with coach Kim Mulkey after having left Mulkey's Baylor program for Texas A&M early in her career.

            “I’m just happy I didn’t give up on myself,"" Morris said. “Thank you, coach Mulkey, for giving me an opportunity to see this day.”

            JerKaila Jordan, a New Orleans native who's been among the SEC's most productive players this month, scored 16 for Mississippi State (20-9, 9-7), which had won five of its previous six before visiting an LSU team whose only loss this season came at unbeaten and top-ranked South Carolina.

            Mississippi State coach Sam Purcell said he changed his lineup to put more size in the paint in an effort to prevent Reese from dominating in the paint. But Reese still ended up with 10 rebounds on the offensive end and 16 on the defensive end. Reese also hit foul-line and baseline jumpers to go with an array of layups and put-backs.

            “No offense to our scout team, but they’re not Angel Reese — and those are some pretty athletic male practice players,” Purcell said. “Angel Reese is special.”

            LSU missed all 14 of its shots from 3-point range, but got away with it because of Reese's and Williams' productivity in the paint. The Tigers pulled down 21 offensive rebounds and finished with a 24-2 advantage in second-chance points.

            “Offensive boards,” Mulkey began. “That’s a big stat, guys.""

            Morris and Williams each scored 10 points in the first half and were instrumental in helping the Tigers take a 12-point lead in the second quarter.

            Williams' layup ignited a 10-3 run during which the center added another layup, as well as an offensive rebound that set up Morris' jumper.

            Morris hit two more jump shots during the spurt to make it 36-24.

            The Bulldogs scored the final six points of the period, highlighted by Ramani Parker's 3, and cut it to 36-30 at halftime. But LSU never saw its lead drop below five in the second half and was not threatened down the stretch.

            BIG PICTURE

            Mississippi State: Did not lead by more than two points and trailed for all of the final three periods in falling to 5-24 all time in Baton Rouge. The Bulldogs have lost the past three meetings.

            LSU: Improved to 53-7 since coach Kim Mulkey left Baylor to take over the Tigers before the 2021-22 season. The sellout crowd of 15,721 — an official paid attendance record since the Pete Maravich Assembly Center opened in 1972 — erupted when senior Emily Ward, a Bossier City, Louisiana, native who averages just a few minutes per game, checked into the game for the final minute. They cheered again when she grabbed an offensive rebound.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822659,"Penguins score 6 in 2nd period, beat Lightning 7-3","PITTSBURGH (AP) — The Pittsburgh Penguins enjoyed a breakout night after a difficult week.

            Sidney Crosby started a second-period surge and the Penguins beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 7-3 on Sunday night.

            Crosby’s power-play goal with 4 1/2 minutes left in the period broke a 2-2 tie and started a sequence in which Pittsburgh scored five goals in 4:27, the second-fastest five goals scored in team history. Pittsburgh’s outburst highlighted a six-goal second period and helped the Penguins win their second straight following a four-game losing streak.











            “I think this is something we can build on,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “Every game is a new challenge, but certainly our team can take confidence from the last couple games we played.”

            Crosby scored his 26th goal of the season and became the first active player — and 14th in NHL history — to record 13 or more 70-point seasons. Evgeni Malkin scored his 23rd goal and added an assist, while Drew O’Connor, Teddy Blueger, Jeff Carter, Jason Zucker and Brian Dumoulin also scored for Pittsburgh. Casey DeSmith stopped 26 shots.

            Nikita Kucherov scored his 23rd goal of the season and became the fastest to 700 career points in franchise history. Brayden Point scored his 36th of the season and Anthony Cirelli his ninth for the Lightning, who have lost four of their last six overall. Brian Elliott made 29 saves.

            “You never want to give up that many goals in that short of time,” Lightning captain Steven Stamkos said. “That’s tough, but we’ll have to regroup.”

            Pittsburgh received some much-needed secondary scoring against the Lightning. The Penguins are currently entrenched in a fight for a wild-card playoff spot, as Pittsburgh is attempting to keep the longest active playoff streak in North American sports alive. Pittsburgh has reached the Stanley Cup playoffs each of the last 16 years.

            The six-goal scoring burst helped the cause on Sunday.

            Blueger scored 52 seconds after Crosby to give Pittsburgh a 4-2 lead. It was his first goal since Dec. 6. Carter scored his ninth with 2:10 left — just 90 seconds after Blueger’s goal — and Zucker made it a 6-2 game another 47 seconds later. Dumoulin scored with 5 seconds left in the second with his first goal in 99 games.

            “I think we capitalized on the momentum,” Blueger said. “Everybody contributed, so it felt good. When we grabbed the momentum, we didn’t really let it go.”

            O’Connor opened the scoring for Pittsburgh 3:20 into the game when he tipped Marcus Pettersson’s point shot behind Elliott. It was O’Connor’s first goal since Jan. 24.

            Cirelli tied it with 3:54 left in the first as he caught a piece of Zach Bogosian’s point shot, which squeezed through DeSmith’s equipment and trickled across the line.

            Kucherov gave Tampa Bay a 2-1 lead 1:59 later with his milestone goal. Kucherov, who followed his own rebound, has points in five straight games. Point, who assisted on the goal, has a four-game point streak.

            Malkin tied it 2-2 with a breakaway goal at 6:17 of the second as he caught a lead pass from the penalty box after serving a tripping call and beat Elliott between the legs.

            A little more than nine minutes later, the Penguins started their scoring outburst to put the game away.

            “I do think it’s an important element of winning consistently, just finding offensive production throughout the lineup,” Sullivan said. “If we have to rely on the same guys every night to score goals, it’s hard to win consistently. Anytime you can get production throughout the lineup, it helps you sustain success.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822660,"Mitchell scores 35 points, Cavaliers rout Raptors 118-93","CLEVELAND (AP) — Donovan Mitchell scored 35 points and Jarrett Allen had 23 points and 11 rebounds, sending the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 118-93 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday night.

            Mitchell made eight 3-pointers — one shy of his career high — and had six rebounds and four assists in 31 minutes as the Cavaliers snapped their three-game losing streak and remained fourth in the Eastern Conference.

            Darius Garland added 18 points and 11 assists, and Evan Mobley had 18 points and nine rebounds for Cleveland, which built a 110-80 lead in the fourth quarter and improved to 26-7 at home this season.











            “We hadn’t played our best basketball the last three games, so we just came out and were aggressive,” said Mitchell, who scored 13 points in both the second and third quarters. “Darius got us going scoring-wise and the rest of us took over from there.”

            Pascal Siakam paced Toronto with 25 points and grabbed eight rebounds, and Jakob Poeltl had 13 points and nine boards. Starting point guard Fred VanVleet missed his third straight game for personal reasons.

            The Cavaliers avoided a four-game season sweep by the Raptors.

            “This was a big game for us and Donovan is a guy who shines brightest when we need him the most,” Cleveland coach J.B. Bickerstaff said. “Most important, he’s a part of the team and I can’t say enough about that.”

            The Raptors had won a season-high four in a row and are 7-2 since Feb. 3, moving into ninth in the East. They failed to reach .500 for the first time since Dec. 9 with the 25-point loss, shooting 38.7% from the field.

            “What makes Donovan difficult to guard is he uses combination moves offensively,” Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. “A lot of times, he moves in three different directions in one move over and over. Not a lot of guys can do that.”

            Mitchell and Garland combined to make their first seven 3-point attempts and Allen made his first seven shots, staking Cleveland to a 64-52 halftime advantage. Mobley grabbed seven rebounds in the second quarter.

            Veteran swingman Danny Green, who signed with the Cavaliers earlier this month, converted a four-point play in the fourth. It was his first appearance in a home game for Cleveland.

            Toronto is in the midst of an eight-game stretch that only includes one at home. The span began with a 95-91 victory at Detroit on Saturday afternoon.

            DOUBLE WHAMMY

            Bickerstaff challenged an offensive foul by Mitchell in the third quarter. Not only did the officials uphold Mitchell’s push-off under the basket against Poeltl, they upgraded it to a flagrant-1 foul for being an unnatural basketball play. 

            “It’s a judgement call on their part, but I don’t know how you shoot a layup without putting your leg up,” Bickerstaff said. “I thought Donovan went to shoot a layup.” 

            Mitchell also disagreed with the decision, saying, “I felt like I didn’t foul him.”

            Raptors: G Scottie Barnes has overcome a rough start to his second season.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822661,North Korea holds rare meeting on farming amid food shortage,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture, state media reported Monday, amid outside assessments that suggest the country is facing a serious shortfall of food.

            South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around 1 million tons of grain, 20 percent of its annual demand, after the pandemic disrupted both farming and imports from China.

            Recent, unconfirmed, reports have said an unknown number of North Koreans have died of hunger. But observers have seen no indication of mass deaths or famine in North Korea. 











            During a high-level meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party that began Sunday, senior party officials reviewed last year’s work on state goals to accomplish “rural revolution in the new era,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported.

            The report said that the meeting of the party’s Central Committee will identify “immediate, important” tasks on agricultural issues and “urgent tasks arising at the present stage of the national economic development.” 

            KNCA didn’t say whether Kim spoke during the meeting or how long it would last. Senior officials such as Cabinet Premier Kim Tok Hun and Jo Yong Won, one of Kim’s closest aides who handles the Central Committee’s organizational affairs, were also attending.

            The meeting is the first time the party has convened a plenary session only to discuss agriculture. Monday’s report didn’t elaborate on its agenda, but the party’s Politburo said earlier this month that a “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote radical change in agricultural development.”

            Most analysts North Korea's food situation today is nowhere near the extremes of the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of people died in a famine. However, some experts say its food insecurity is likely at its worst since Kim took power in 2011, after COVID-19 restrictions further shocked an economy battered by decades of mismanagement and crippling U.S.-led sanctions imposed over Kim’s nuclear program.

            In early 2020, North Korea tried to shield its population from the coronavirus by imposing stringent border controls that choked off trade with China, its main ally and economic lifeline. Russia’s war on Ukraine possibly worsened the situation by driving up global prices of food, energy and fertilizer, on which North Korea’s agricultural production is heavily dependent. 

            North Korea reopened freight train traffic with China and Russia last year. More than 90% of North Korea’s official external trade goes through its border with China.

            Last year, North Korea’s grain production was estimated at 4.5 million tons, a 3.8% drop from 2020, according to South Korean government assessments. The North was estimated to have produced between 4.4 million tons to 4.8 million tons of grain annually from 2012-2021, according to previous South Korean data.

            North Korea needs about 5.5 million tons of grain to feed its 25 million people annually, so it’s short about 1 million tons this year. In past years, half of such a gap was usually met by unofficial grain purchases from China, with the rest remaining as unresolved shortfall, according to Kwon Tae-jin, a senior economist at the private GS&J Institute in South Korea.

            Kwon says trade curbs due to the pandemic have likely hindered unofficial rice purchases from China. Efforts by North Korean authorities to tighten controls and restrict market activities have also worsened the situation, he said.

            It’s unclear whether North Korea will take any action to quickly address its food problems. Some experts say North Korea will use this week’s plenary meeting to boost public support of Kim during his confrontations with the United States and its allies over his nuclear ambitions.

            Despite limited resources, Kim has been aggressively pushing to expand his nuclear weapons and missile programs to pressure Washington into accepting the idea of the North as a nuclear power and lift international sanctions on it. After a record year of weapons testing activities in 2022, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile and other weapons in displays this month.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un opened a major political conference dedicated to agriculture, state media reported Monday, amid outside assessments that suggest the country is facing a serious shortfall of food.South Korean experts estimate that North Korea is short around 1 million tons of grain, 20 percent of its annual demand, after the pandemic disrupted both farming and imports from China.Recent, unconfirmed, reports have said an unknown number of North Koreans have died of hunger.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822663,CloudMile Launches Free Migration Programme to Drive Business Digitalisation in the Post-pandemic Era,"HONG KONG SAR -  Media OutReach - 27 February 2023 - CloudMile, Asia's leading artificial intelligence and cloud service provider, announces the launch of its ""Free Cloud Migration Programme"" designed to help enterprises control costs and improve operational efficiency. With the assistance of Google Cloud's comprehensive data ecosystem and CloudMile's hand-on technical support, enterprises can migrate their data and projects to the cloud with lower cost and complexity. The recent pandemic has prompted many companies to reassess their operations and find ways to maintain their competitiveness in the market. One key strategy that has emerged as a solution is digitalisation. As a result, companies are focusing on adopting digital technologies to streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency. This shift towards digitalisation has become the new norm for business development in the post-pandemic era.   Optimising Operating Cost (OpEx) with Digital Transformation   CloudMile, a Google Cloud certified Managed Service Provider (MSP), provides customised cloud migration plans to meet the unique needs of each customer. Our team helps enterprises move their data from on-premise data warehouses to more flexible cloud data warehouses like Google Cloud BigQuery. In addition, we conduct thorough assessments of enterprise IT infrastructure, provide solutions, and execute migration plans. The programme extends support beyond the cloud migration, as it includes annual assessments and optimisation solutions to help enterprises sustain their digital transformation journey and reduce operational costs in the long run. For more information on the free cloud migration program, please visit CloudMile's website at  http://bit.ly/3Szo7FD    Boosting IT Operational Efficiency by 41% with Cloud Migration   Many enterprises in Hong Kong still rely on internal servers for data storage, which can be costly in terms of manpower and hardware expenses. By migrating to the cloud, these upfront costs can be converted from capital expenditures (CapEx) to regular operating expenses (OpEx), offering businesses more flexibility and scalability.   Globally, 61% of enterprises have already migrated their workloads to the cloud. According to a 2020 evaluation by IDC, the use of Google Cloud Platform has resulted in a 41% increase in IT operational efficiency, a 19% increase in developer productivity, and a 26% reduction in IT infrastructure costs. This highlights the growing importance of cloud migration for enterprises, as it enables a smooth digital transformation and enhances productivity and remote work efficiency.   Tecpal: IoT Latency Reduction and Ample Computing Power   CloudMile has assisted over 700 companies in the Asia-Pacific region, including well-known enterprises, to make the most of various cloud technologies including data, AI, cost optimisation, hand-on technical support and services, and cross-platform integrations. This has allowed these companies to accelerate their journey towards digital transformation.   One of CloudMile's clients, Tecpal, a provider of BaaS services for over one million smart home appliances, migrated its data to Google Cloud with the help of CloudMile in 2022. The CTO of Tecpal, Harold Lo, complimented CloudMile's cost-effective technical support on Google Cloud, noting their expertise and rich experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The migration resulted in a latency of less than a second for monitoring over one million devices and ample computing power to handle daily traffic and high demand during holidays.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822679,Simpson's late and-1 FT help Rutgers beat Penn State 59-56,"Derek Simpson tied his career high with 16 points, including the go-ahead three-point play in the closing seconds, Cam Spencer scored 11 of his 13 in the second half and Rutgers rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat Penn State 59-56 Sunday night.

            Caleb McConnell added 12 points for Rutgers (18-11, 10-8 Big Ten) and Clifford Omoruyi scored nine points and grabbed 13 rebounds. 

            Simpson, a 6-foot-3 freshman, went around a screen by Omoruyi, drove the right side of the lane and was fouled as he made a driving layup. He hit the and-1 free throw with 1:24 left to make it 57-56. Seth Lundy missed to 3-point shots on Penn State's next offensive possession and, after Simpson missed a driving left-hand layup, Omoruyi grabbed the offensive rebound and his putback with 36 seconds to play capped the scoring. 











            Camren Wynter led (17-12, 8-10) with 16 points and Jalen Pickett had 11 points, nine rebounds and five assists. Lundy — who went into the game second on the Nittany Lions in scoring at 15.2 per game — finished with seven points and eight rebounds but made just 1 of 16 from the field, 0 of 11 from behind the arc. 

            Kebba Njie made a layup that gave Penn State a 10-point lead with 9:16 left in the game but the Nittany Lions went 0 for 14 from the field and committed five turnovers from there. McConnell scored seven points in an 11-1 run that made it 54-all when his 3-pointer capped the spurt with 2:36 remaining. Lundy made two free throws to put Penn State back in front about a minute later. 

            Penn State used a 21-2 first-half run to take a 16 point lead midway through the first half and Lundy's dunk with 17:02 to play capped a 13-2 spurt to open the second half and gave the Nittany Lions a 42-23 lead. Spencer answered 15 seconds later with a 3-pointer and Oscar Palmquist made two more 3s as the Scarlet Knights scored 18 of the next 24 points to trim its deficit to seven points when McConnell made a layup with 10:37 to play.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822696,Fox scores 33 as Kings beat Thunder for 3rd straight win,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Sacramento Kings coach Mike Brown was worried his team might come out flat two days after one of the wildest games in NBA history.

            Sacramento defeated the Los Angeles Clippers 176-175 in two overtimes Friday night in the league's second highest-scoring game ever. As it turned out, Brown had nothing to worry about. 

            De'Aaron Fox had 33 points and eight assists and the Kings defeated the short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder 124-115 on Sunday night for their third straight victory.











            The Kings led 36-26 after the first quarter and never trailed.

            “At times, we start slow in situations like this, and it was great to see our starters go out there and kind of establish themselves and set the tone,” Brown said. 

            It was Sacramento's third game in four nights — another reason for the concern about energy.

            “You take a win in that situation a thousand times out of a thousand times,"" Brown said. 

            Keegan Murray scored 20 points and Domantas Sabonis added 14 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists for the Kings, who shot 52.9% from the field.

            “The effort it takes to defend them for 48 minutes is substantial because they play with great pace, they have good creators and they’ve got shooting everywhere,"" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. “So it’s not easy to do. But if you want to win the game, that’s what you have to do.”

            Brown said he knew the Kings needed to take the Thunder seriously.

            “It doesn’t matter if they’re down 15, down 20, up 20, they’re playing the same way,"" Brown said. ""They’re coming at you on both ends of the floor with physicality, that if you don’t match it, you’re going to get ran out of the gym.”

            Isaiah Joe scored 24 points and Lu Dort and Josh Giddey each added 18 for Oklahoma City. The Thunder have lost all three of their games since the All-Star break.

            Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander sat out with right ankle soreness and an abdominal strain. The All-Star leads the Thunder with 31 points per game — fifth-most in the league heading into the night.

            Fox scored 14 points in the first half to help the Kings take a 58-50 lead. He got loose for a windmill dunk on a fast break to give the Kings a 74-59 lead in the third quarter.

            The Thunder got hot later in the period. Joe scored 11 points in the final 3:50 of the third quarter to trim Sacramento's lead to 94-90 heading into the fourth.

            The Kings threatened to run away with the game before Joe made a 3-pointer, was fouled and made the free throw with 5:19 remaining to trim Sacramento's lead to 113-104, but the Thunder never made another surge.

            “They’re a great offensive team, obviously, so there’s got to be a little more resistance defensively to beat them,” Daigneault said. “I thought we got to it in the second quarter a little bit and at different times throughout the game, but not consistently enough.”

            SPECIAL HONOR

            The Kings honored radio play-by-play man Gary “G-Man” Gerould as Defensive Player of the Game in honor of his 3,000th Kings broadcast over 38 years.

            The team cheered the decision loudly in the locker room.

            “I think that was probably the best call by our coaching staff,” Brown said. “I think our players really thought that G-Man deserved it tonight because of his ability to communicate.”

            TIP-INS

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822697,"Matthews scores 2, Maple Leafs beat Kraken 5-1","SEATTLE (AP) — Auston Matthews had two goals and Mark Giordano scored in his first game back in Seattle since being traded to Toronto last season as the Maple Leafs beat the Kraken 5-1 Sunday.

            Timothy Liljegren had a goal and an assist for Toronto, and John Tavares also scored. Mitchel Marner haded three assists; William Nylander and Michael Bunting had two each. Ilya Samsonov made 26 saves.

            Vince Dunn scored for Seattle. Phillip Grubauer started and gave up four goals on 21 shots before he was replaced early in the second period by Martin Jones, who had 11 saves.











            After Dunn’s 11th goal of the year gave the Kraken a 1-0 lead 3:47 into the game, Giordano tied it just 71 seconds later. Giordano, who served as Seattle’s captain last season until he was traded to Toronto for draft picks last March 20, fired a hard shot from the left faceoff circle that hit Grubauer’s right pad and deflected into the net for his fourth of the year. 

            In the second period, Girodano got his skate on a shot by Seattle’s Carson Soucy to set a record with his 2,045th career block. The old mark of 2,044 was by former Calgary teammate Kris Russell. Blocked shots have been recorded by the NHL since 2005-06. 

            “It’s something I’m definitely proud of. It shows that you care and try to do the right thing for the team,” Giordano said. “You think about it (getting the record), and it’s something in the back of your mind. It’s not a glamorous record by any means, but I think it speaks to playing a long time and playing hard and playing the right way. I don’t take it lightly.” 

            Tavares put the Maple Leafs ahead for good permanently in front at 7:06. Justin Hoff’s hard shot from the right circle bounced off heavy traffic in the goal crease. Nylander got his stick on and poked it over to Tavares in front of the left post and Tavares put it into a wide-open net for his 27th of the season. 

            Liljegren’s hard wrister from the right circle with 6:09 left in the first extended the lead to 3-1 as Toronto finished the period with a 19-7 advantage in shots. It was his fifth. 

            Giving up three goals in nine minutes after taking the 1-0 lead didn’t sit well with Kraken coach Dave Hakstol. 

            “Our response to their first goal, again, wasn’t good enough,” Hakstol said. “Our energy at the start of the game was good, but we have to have a better response and have to be stiffer When a tough goal goes in, we have to be stiffer than that – not just the next two shifts, but for the rest of the period.” 

            Matthews scored at 4:15 of the second to push Toronto's lead to 4-1 lead and end Grubauer's night.

            Mathews got his second of the game and 28th of the season with 7:29 left in the third to cap the scoring.

            The Maple Leafs reversed last month’s result in Toronto, when the Kraken came away with a 5-1 victory. 

            “Last time we played these guys, they were leading the league in goals, so we knew what to expect,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “If you look at a lot of different areas statistically, we might have played a better game at home when we lost 5-1. The difference today is we scored early and got a good lead. Last time, we played well, but didn’t score, and we gave up some really good looks.” 

            NOTES: Marner, who has a team-leading 74 points, now has 54 assists. Sunday was the 142nd multiple-point game of his career, surpassing Ron Ellis for the ninth-most in Maple Leafs history. ... Nylander extended his point streak to seven games and now has 19 multi-point games. ... Jordan Eberle’s assist on Dunn’s goal for Seattle increased his team-leading total to 34.

Phillip Grubauer started and gave up four goals on 21 shots before he was replaced early in the second period by Martin Jones, who had 11 saves.After Dunn’s 11th goal of the year gave the Kraken a 1-0 lead 3:47 into the game, Giordano tied it just 71 seconds later. Giordano, who served as Seattle’s captain last season until he was traded to Toronto for draft picks last March 20, fired a hard shot from the left faceoff circle that hit Grubauer’s right pad and deflected into the net for his fourth of the year.In the second period, Girodano got his skate on a shot by Seattle’s Carson Soucy to set a record with his 2,045th career block. The old mark of 2,044 was by former Calgary teammate Kris Russell. Blocked shots have been recorded by the NHL since 2005-06.“It’s something I’m definitely proud of. It shows that you care and try to do the right thing for the team,” Giordano said. “You think about it (getting the record), and it’s something in the back of your mind. It’s not a glamorous record by any means, but I think it speaks to playing a long time and playing hard and playing the right way. I don’t take it lightly.”Tavares put the Maple Leafs ahead for good permanently in front at 7:06. Justin Hoff’s hard shot from the right circle bounced off heavy traffic in the goal crease. Nylander got his stick on and poked it over to Tavares in front of the left post and Tavares put it into a wide-open net for his 27th of the season.Liljegren’s hard wrister from the right circle with 6:09 left in the first extended the lead to 3-1 as Toronto finished the period with a 19-7 advantage in shots. It was his fifth.Giving up three goals in nine minutes after taking the 1-0 lead didn’t sit well with Kraken coach Dave Hakstol.“Our response to their first goal, again, wasn’t good enough,” Hakstol said. “Our energy at the start of the game was good, but we have to have a better response and have to be stiffer When a tough goal goes in, we have to be stiffer than that – not just the next two shifts, but for the rest of the period.”Matthews scored at 4:15 of the second to push Toronto's lead to 4-1 lead and end Grubauer's night.Mathews got his second of the game and 28th of the season with 7:29 left in the third to cap the scoring.The Maple Leafs reversed last month’s result in Toronto, when the Kraken came away with a 5-1 victory.“Last time we played these guys, they were leading the league in goals, so we knew what to expect,” Toronto coach Sheldon Keefe said. “If you look at a lot of different areas statistically, we might have played a better game at home when we lost 5-1. The difference today is we scored early and got a good lead. Last time, we played well, but didn’t score, and we gave up some really good looks.”NOTES: Marner, who has a team-leading 74 points, now has 54 assists. Sunday was the 142nd multiple-point game of his career, surpassing Ron Ellis for the ninth-most in Maple Leafs history. ... Nylander extended his point streak to seven games and now has 19 multi-point games. ...

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4822698,"Josi scores twice, Predators beat Coyotes 6-2","TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) — Roman Josi scored two goals Sunday night and the Nashville Predators won their third in a row, beating the Arizona Coyotes 6-2.

            Josi scored on a wrist shot early in the second period, and the Predators captain made it 5-2 with a power-play goal six minutes into the third period after Nick Ritchie was penalized for holding. Josi, who also had an assist, has 17 goals this season.

            Juuse Saros stopped 26 shots for the Predators, who are currently 10th in the Western Conference standings.











            “We played well 5-on-5, a very engaged performance from our group,” Predators coach John Hynes said.

            Yakov Trenin, Matt Duchene, Tommy Novak and Cody Glass had the other Nashville goals. Duchene's goal was his 18th, one behind injured Filip Forsberg for the team lead.

            “We're still fighting here, we still believe we can make the playoffs,” Duchene said. “Obviously teams ahead of us are winning too, but we play some of those teams. We don't know what it's going to look like at the end of this week."" Friday is the trade deadline.

            The Predators killed off a 5-on-3 Arizona advantage late in the first period, in which the Coyotes failed to get a shot on goal in 45 seconds of the two-man edge.

            “Those I think are turning points in the game, the score was tight then. I thought the penalty kill was a big factor tonight,” Hynes.

            Shayne Gostisbehere opened the scoring with a short-handed goal for Arizona at 5:55 of the first period, while teammate Patrik Nemeth was in the penalty box for tripping. Nick Schmaltz, whose pass set up the first goal, also scored for the Coyotes, his 17th of the season.

            “I thought we were better in some areas. They scored on a lot of their opportunities,” Gostisbehere said. “When we turn the puck over that much, it's the NHL, teams are going to score.”

            Connor Ingram, who broke into the NHL with Nashville, had 28 saves for Arizona.

            STILL SITTING

            Coyotes D Jakob Chychrun sat out for the seventh consecutive game as the team attempts to execute a deal before Friday’s trade deadline. Chychrun hasn’t played since Feb. 10 in an overtime loss at Chicago.

            Nashville's Tanner Jeannot also did not play in the game Sunday. The winger only has five goals this season after a strong rookie campaign a year ago.

            INJURED

            Nashville was without C Juuso Parssinen, who suffered an upper-body injury Thursday against San Jose. Forsberg missed his eighth straight game, also with an upper-body injury.

            NUMBERS

            Gostisbehere’s goal gave him 300 career points. ... Lawson Crouse played in his 400th game, all with the Coyotes. ... With the victory, Nashville is 13-12-3 on the road.
