https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796504,"Feds drop lobbying probe of retired general, lawyer says","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department has dropped its probe of retired four-star Gen. John Allen for his role in an alleged illegal foreign lobbying campaign on behalf of the wealthy Persian Gulf nation of Qatar, his lawyer told The Associated Press.

            Attorney David Schertler said in a statement Tuesday that the Justice Department had informed him that it was closing its investigation of Allen and no charges would be filed. The Justice Department declined to comment but a law enforcement official familiar with the inquiry who wasn't authorized to speak publicly confirmed the decision on condition of anonymity. 

            The AP first reported last June that the FBI had outlined a potential criminal case against Allen in a confidential search warrant application that appeared to have been filed in error on a federal courts website. Days later, the former Marine general who oversaw U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan resigned as head of the influential Brookings Institution think tank.











            Schertler said it was “deeply unfortunate” and “unfair” that the public release of the FBI’s confidential document had damaged Allen’s reputation and livelihood. A Brookings spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

            The 77-page document detailed Allen’s behind-the scenes efforts to help Qatar influence U.S. policy in June 2017 when a diplomatic crisis erupted between the gas-rich monarchy and its neighbors. That included traveling to Doha to advise top Qatari officials and then lobbying U.S. officials, the FBI said. 

            An FBI agent said in an affidavit in support of a search warrant there was “substantial evidence” that Allen had knowingly broken foreign lobbying laws, and had made false statements and withheld “incriminating” documents.

            Allen denied any wrongdoing, saying his involvement with Qatar was meant to help benefit the United States. 

            The federal investigation has previously ensnared Richard G. Olson, a former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan who pleaded guilty to federal charges last year, and Imaad Zuberi, a prolific political donor now serving a 12-year prison sentence on corruption charges. 

            The Justice Department has made enforcing foreign lobbying laws a higher priority in recent years but suffered some high-profile defeats in contested cases.

            Qatar has spent lavishly on its influence efforts in the U.S. and Europe. The country is allegedly behind a massive cash-for-favors corruption scandal currently unfolding at the European Union’s parliament.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796508,Agent insists Alex Murdaugh suggested he killed his son,"A state agent insisted Tuesday he heard a possible confession from Alex Murdaugh even after defense attorneys for the disgraced South Carolina lawyer slowed the audio down during Murdaugh's double murder trial.

            At question is whether Murdaugh said “I did him so bad” or “They did him so bad” as he sobbed and spoke to state agents during a recorded interview three days after Murdaugh’s wife and son were killed.

            State Law Enforcement Division Senior Special Agent Jeff Croft testified he was “100% confident” Murdaugh said “I.” That could be interpreted as a confession from Murdaugh that he fatally shot his son Paul with a shotgun near kennels at their Colleton County home and hunting lodge on June 7, 2021. Murdaugh's wife, Maggie, was shot several times with a rifle and her body was found nearby.











            Prosecutors haven't explained why they have emphasized the comment.

            “What were the things going through your mind when you heard, or misheard, ‘I did him so bad?’” defense attorney Jim Griffin asked Croft during cross-examination. “I wasn’t a good dad? I spoiled him? Or, I killed him?”

            “It was definitely something we needed to follow up on,” Croft said.

            The agent said he didn't ask for clarification that day because he thought it was too early in the investigation to confront Murdaugh and lose his cooperation. Griffin asked about an interview three months later and Croft said the agents didn't get to asking about that but did ask Murdaugh point-blank if he killed his wife and son.

            Griffin asked if it would be up to the jury to decide the truth.

            “They get to hear the tape and make their own mind up on what he said, yes sir,” Croft responded.

            Murdaugh, 54, is standing trial on two counts of murder in the shootings of his 52-year-old wife and 22-year-old son. Murdaugh faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

            Croft's testimony wasn't only about Murdaugh's statement. He assisted the chief agent investigating the killings and dealt with a wide range of evidence.

            Prosecutors suggested in pretrial motions that Murdaugh killed his wife and son to buy time to cover up the theft of millions of dollars from his law firm and clients, which he feared was about to be discovered. Murdaugh’s lawyers said it was absurd to suggest an attorney would think the brutal killings of most of his family would lessen the scrutiny into his life. A judge said he will hear arguments whether that evidence is admissible later in the trial.

            As with much of the first four days of testimony, there were interesting bits and pieces from prosecutors, often provided without further explanation, such as a $1,021.10 receipt from a Gucci store with an item circled.

            The defense used their cross-examination of Croft to try to poke holes in how the investigation unfolded. Croft was asked if he knew why state agents didn't search Murdaugh's home in the hours after the killings for dirty clothes, possible blood in drains or other evidence. Croft said he didn't know what other agents did.

            Griffin also asked Croft why agents didn't search Murdaugh's mother's home until September — three months after the killings — even though that was the only place Murdaugh said he went before finding the bodies.

            “I know I did not go and I’m not sure what any of the other agents in the investigative circle had done,” Croft said.

            Prosecutors then called several witnesses to talk about how they collected data from cellphones belonging to Murdaugh, his son and wife.

            The main witness who reviewed the data only got to Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone before court ended. State Law Enforcement Division Lt. Britt Dove went over a trove of information her cellphone kept, from each text and call received to being unplugged at 8:17:51 p.m. on the night of the killings.

            Dove detailed for prosecutors a flurry of activity starting at 8:49 p.m. on Maggie Murdaugh's phone. The orientation changed from portrait to landscape and back several times. The camera turned on for one second, likely her face ID checking to see if she was logging in. Her health app recorded 59 steps — all until 9:06 p.m. when that activity ended.

            Prosecutors didn't have Dove explain in detail what might have happened.

            But investigators have said they think the killings happened at roughly 8:50 p.m. Maggie Murdaugh's cellphone was found the next day, after help from her family, just off the road about a half mile (800 meters) from the family property. Alex Murdaugh left around that time to visit his ailing mother, prosecutors have said.

            Dove will be back on the stand Wednesday morning, and that may lead to another piece of key testimony prosecutors mentioned in their opening statement — a video made by Paul Murdaugh at the kennels about four minutes before he stopped using his cellphone where his father's voice can be heard.

            Alex Murdaugh told police hours after the killings and repeated in Croft's interview three days later that he wasn't at the kennels that night.

            Murdaugh also faces about 100 charges related to accusations of money laundering, stealing millions from clients and the family law firm, tax evasion and trying to get a man to fatally shoot him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy. He was being held in jail without bail on those counts before he was charged with murder.

            Since the killings, Murdaugh’s life has seen a stunningly fast downfall. His family dominated the legal system in tiny neighboring Hampton County for generations, both as prosecutors and private attorneys known for getting life-changing settlements for accidents and negligence cases.A state agent insisted Tuesday he heard a possible confession from Alex Murdaugh even after defense attorneys for the disgraced South Carolina lawyer slowed the audio down during Murdaugh's double murder trial.At question is whether Murdaugh said “I did him so bad” or “They did him so bad” as he sobbed and spoke to state agents during a recorded interview three days after Murdaugh’s wife and son were killed.State Law Enforcement Division Senior Special Agent Jeff Croft testified he was “100% confident” Murdaugh said “I.” That could be interpreted as a confession from Murdaugh that he fatally shot his son Paul with a shotgun near kennels at their Colleton County home and hunting lodge on June 7, 2021.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796509,Cheaters beware: ChatGPT maker releases AI detection tool,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.

            The new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT’s ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.

            OpenAI cautions that its new tool  – like others already available – is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text “is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,” said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer. 











            “Because of that, it shouldn’t be solely relied upon when making decisions,” Leike said.

            Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators. 

            By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices. 

            The Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.

            “We can’t afford to ignore it,” Robinson said. 

            The district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a “personal tutor” or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.

            School districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.

            “The initial reaction was ‘OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,’"" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that “this is the future” and blocking it is not the solution, he said. 

            “I think we would be naïve if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,” said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company's detection service is in place.

            OpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.

            The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text -- a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” --- and the tool will label it as either “very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely” AI-generated.

            But much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, it’s not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.

            “We don’t fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,” Leike said. “There’s really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.”

            Higher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of France’s most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.

            In response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators. 

            “Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that it’s inappropriate for use in their classrooms,” said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. “We don’t really push them one way or another.

            It’s an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner Microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.

            O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island. AP writer John Leicester contributed to this report from Paris.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The maker of ChatGPT is trying to curb its reputation as a freewheeling cheating machine with a new tool that can help teachers detect if a student or artificial intelligence wrote that homework.The new AI Text Classifier launched Tuesday by OpenAI follows a weeks-long discussion at schools and colleges over fears that ChatGPT’s ability to write just about anything on command could fuel academic dishonesty and hinder learning.OpenAI cautions that its new tool  – like others already available – is not foolproof. The method for detecting AI-written text “is imperfect and it will be wrong sometimes,” said Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team tasked to make its systems safer.“Because of that, it shouldn’t be solely relied upon when making decisions,” Leike said.Teenagers and college students were among the millions of people who began experimenting with ChatGPT after it launched Nov. 30 as a free application on OpenAI's website. And while many found ways to use it creatively and harmlessly, the ease with which it could answer take-home test questions and assist with other assignments sparked a panic among some educators.By the time schools opened for the new year, New York City, Los Angeles and other big public school districts began to block its use in classrooms and on school devices.The Seattle Public Schools district initially blocked ChatGPT on all school devices in December but then opened access to educators who want to use it as a teaching tool, said Tim Robinson, the district spokesman.“We can’t afford to ignore it,” Robinson said.The district is also discussing possibly expanding the use of ChatGPT into classrooms to let teachers use it to train students to be better critical thinkers and to let students use the application as a “personal tutor” or to help generate new ideas when working on an assignment, Robinson said.School districts around the country say they are seeing the conversation around ChatGPT evolve quickly.“The initial reaction was ‘OMG, how are we going to stem the tide of all the cheating that will happen with ChatGPT,’"" said Devin Page, a technology specialist with the Calvert County Public School District in Maryland. Now there is a growing realization that “this is the future” and blocking it is not the solution, he said.“I think we would be naïve if we were not aware of the dangers this tool poses, but we also would fail to serve our students if we ban them and us from using it for all its potential power,” said Page, who thinks districts like his own will eventually unblock ChatGPT, especially once the company's detection service is in place.OpenAI emphasized the limitations of its detection tool in a blog post Tuesday, but said that in addition to deterring plagiarism, it could help to detect automated disinformation campaigns and other misuse of AI to mimic humans.The longer a passage of text, the better the tool is at detecting if an AI or human wrote something. Type in any text -- a college admissions essay, or a literary analysis of Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man” --- and the tool will label it as either “very unlikely, unlikely, unclear if it is, possibly, or likely” AI-generated.But much like ChatGPT itself, which was trained on a huge trove of digitized books, newspapers and online writings but often confidently spits out falsehoods or nonsense, it’s not easy to interpret how it came up with a result.“We don’t fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally,” Leike said. “There’s really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works.”Higher education institutions around the world also have begun debating responsible use of AI technology. Sciences Po, one of France’s most prestigious universities, prohibited its use last week and warned that anyone found surreptitiously using ChatGPT and other AI tools to produce written or oral work could be banned from Sciences Po and other institutions.In response to the backlash, OpenAI said it has been working for several weeks to craft new guidelines to help educators.“Like many other technologies, it may be that one district decides that it’s inappropriate for use in their classrooms,” said OpenAI policy researcher Lama Ahmad. “We don’t really push them one way or another. We just want to give them the information that they need to be able to make the right decisions for them.”It’s an unusually public role for the research-oriented San Francisco startup, now backed by billions of dollars in investment from its partner Microsoft and facing growing interest from the public and governments.France’s digital economy minister Jean-Noël Barrot recently met in California with OpenAI executives, including CEO Sam Altman, and a week later told an audience at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland that he was optimistic about the technology.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796512,Belgium to shut down controversial nuclear reactor on German border,"Belgium is shutting down its second nuclear reactor in four months Tuesday to diminish the country's dependency on nuclear power.The Tihange 2 reactor was long a source of controversy in neighboring Germany. For years, German officials have cited security concerns in calling for the 40-year-old plant to be shut after cracks were found in its pressure vessels.Belgium has postponed its plans to shut down the country's supply of nuclear power despite efforts in that direction.The reactor is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the border with Germany.Germany's environment minister, Steffi Lemke, told local media, ""The shutdown of the plant guarantees significantly increased security in our two countries.""Before midnight Tuesday, the Tihange 2 reactor will be taken offline as part of Belgium's long-term efforts to go without nuclear energy.Since 2003, Belgian law has called for nuclear power to be phased out. However, the government pushed back the nuclear exit by a decade due to Russia's war against Ukraine, which has ravaged European energy markets and resulted in dramatic price increases.Belgium's Green Party, which forms part of the ruling coalition government, has resisted any delays to removing nuclear power from the country's energy supply.Last September, a first reactor near Antwerp was shuttered.Belgium has also announced a deal with Engie, a French firm, to extend the life of two additional reactors by 10 years.Brussels has relied on nuclear power for about half of the country's energy needs.Tihange 2 is the second of a total of seven reactors in Belgium to be taken offline by 2035.ar/nm (AFP, dpa)",2023/01/31,,
https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796513,Germany debates tougher deportation rules,"Two weeks ago, a knife attack shook Germany when a man traveling on a regional train headed for Hamburg randomly stabbed passengers, killing two of them.The alleged perpetrator, 33-year-old Ibrahim A., was known to the police, as he had multiple prior convictions for assault. He had just been released from detention, although he had nowhere to go.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) asked when she visited the scene: ""How could it be that such a perpetrator was still here in the country?""In Germany, foreign nationals can be deported if they have committed a criminal offense or are classified as members of a terrorist organization. They can be detained and then returned to their country of origin. The federal states are responsible for the actual deportations.But it would have been next to impossible to deport Ibrahim A., a stateless person originally from the Gaza Strip. ""One would have needed a state that is willing to take the person back. In the case of stateless persons, there is no such state,"" migration researcher Gerald Knaus explained to DW.Foreign nationals who have been found to have no right to remain in Germany can be deported. In most cases, their asylum application has been rejected.At the end of last year, according to official figures, 304,308 people were registered as having to leave the country.Germany's center-left coalition government which came to power one year ago, had announced a ""repatriation offensive."" Above all, they wanted to make sure that criminals and potential terrorists could be forced to leave the country more quickly.But the announcements have not been followed by action, says opposition lawmaker Andrea Lindholm of the center-right Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU). ""The announced repatriation offensive has turned out to be no more than a sad joke,"" she said.The Interior Ministry said that 12,945 people were deported last year. Most of them were from Georgia, Albania, Serbia, Moldova, and Pakistan. The year before, the number was 11,982. But before deportations were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of deportees in 2019 was almost twice as high and stood at 22,000.Deportations are a ""necessary consequence of our asylum and residence law,"" says CSU MP Lindholz.But Left Party lawmaker Clara Bünger is concerned about deportations to countries where there is war, political repression, or poverty. ""Also, we see a lot of police violence and humiliation during deportations,"" Bünger adds.There are many reasons why repatriation does not go ahead: Immigrants and their advocates can contest deportation orders, which takes time to go through a court process.Rejected asylum applicants can take their case to a ""hardship commission"" that in turn can recommend to the German interior minister to suspend deportation.Individuals may not be deported to countries where they face a threat to their life through war or persecution. Doing so would violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Also, a mental or physical illness constitutes grounds to prevent deportation.A common delay is due to the absence of travel or identity documents, as authorities have to verify they are deporting the right person. The receiving country can also delay, or outright refuse repatriation.And deportation is not always the end of a person's time in the country they were removed from — sometimes, individuals who have been deported return to Germany and apply for asylum again.On February 1 a special representative for migration is to take office in the Ministry of the Interior.The former integration minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Joachim Stamp (FDP) will take on the job and has outlined his tasks in a press release: ""Those who want to work in Germany must be given fair opportunities."" Criminals and dangerous persons, on the other hand, must be deported. To this end, he wrote, it is necessary to establish ""practical and partnership-based agreements with key countries of origin.""Migration researcher Gerald Knaus thinks that introducing a special representative is a fundamentally good idea. ""Focusing on deporting all eligible dangerous persons and criminals"" is ambitious, Knaus tells DW. But just as important, he says, is ""building European coalitions"" for this purpose.Many European countries say they have reached their limit: The number of asylum seekers has risen and another four million people have fled Ukraine to EU countries seeking protection from the war in their home country.The EU also wants to speed up the process of sending back rejected asylum seekers. Across the European Union, only one in five foreigners without the right of abode was actually repatriated last year. ""We have a very low rate of repatriation, and I see that we can make considerable progress here,"" said EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson recently.One of the main reasons for the slow repatriation rate is that many countries of origin do not want to take back their nationals, Johansson said. She wants to put more pressure on these countries of origin.Changes to the EU visa policy are among ""the most important instruments to improve cooperation with third countries on return and readmission,"" according to an EU paper.According to migration researcher Knaus, the countries in the Balkans, Moldova, and Georgia are among the countries that cooperate very well, because they do not want to risk losing visa-free travel to the EU.Increasing pressure on countries who are unwilling to take their nationals back could mean, for example, that visa applications are processed more slowly or that visa fees are raised. Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria are countries that often do not issue documents to their citizens, or don't recognize EU documents. Repatriation is then practically impossible. The EU has already raised the bar for visa applications from Bangladesh, Iraq, Gambia, and Senegal.Reducing economic or development aid to uncooperative countries has also been discussed among EU interior ministers. But Germany's Nancy Faeser spoke out against this, triggering criticism from the opposition at home: ""Faeser talks about deportations in Berlin, but blocks them in Brussels,"" CSU lawmaker Lindholz told DW.In Germany, the latest knife attack has again fuelled the debate on deportations, a pet topic for the country's far-right in their ongoing campaign against immigrants.Expectations are high for the government's new migration representative, Joachim Stamp, to ensure that people convicted of crimes and with a dangerous track record are repatriated more easily in the future.This article was originally written in German.",2023/01/31,,

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796516,Slow transfer day in Spain; Barcelona gets to register Gavi,"MADRID (AP) — Forget about signing new players. Barcelona had to work just to register the ones it already had.

            As part of a slow day for Spanish clubs at the end of the winter transfer window, Barcelona was unable to significantly boost its squad and instead had to work to rearrange its finances and make sure it could fit some of its current players under the salary cap. 

            The Catalan club improved its financial situation recently but still struggled to comply with the Spanish league’s strict fair-play rules. 











            Its only hopes for last-minute deals reportedly involved Mexican right back Julián Araujo, the U.S. born player who plays for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the Major League Soccer, and Morocco midfielder Sofyan Amrabat from Fiorentina. 

            First, though, Barcelona wanted to give young star Gavi a first-team contract, and register defenders Ronald Araújo and Marcos Alonso after they renewed their deals with the club. It was able to get the Gavi deal done, in part thanks to the retirement of Gerard Piqué and the departures of Héctor Bellerín to Sporting Lisbon and Memphis Depay to Atletico Madrid, but Araújo's and Alonso's revamped contracts likely won't take effect until the summer.

            Spanish league president Javier Tebas had said Barcelona will have to save more than 200 million euros ahead of the summer transfer window, but Gavi was allowed to be registered thanks to a court ruling in favor of the Catalan club. The league said it would appeal the ruling. Getting the 18-year-old to the first team is crucial for Barcelona to keep him from having the option of leaving for free in the summer.

            Real Madrid is in a better situation financially, but also isn’t likely to add anyone to its squad other than Brazilian teenage sensation Endrick from Palmeiras, who was signed on a deal that will see him join the club when he turns 18 in 2024. On the other hand, it was not expected to lose any of the top players who helped it win the Champions League and the Spanish league last season.

            Madrid rival Atletico signed Dutch forward Depay on loan from Barcelona and Irish right back Matt Doherty after he was released by Tottenham, but lost Matheus Cunha to Wolverhampton and João Félix on loan to Chelsea. Defender Felipe joined Nottingham Forest in England.

            OTHER TEAMS

            Rayo Vallecano was finally able to register forward Raúl de Tomás after his transfer from Espanyol hadn't come through in time at the previous transfer deadline.

            Defending Copa del Rey champion Real Betis lost defender Álex Moreno to Aston Villa, while the only loss for Copa runner-up Valencia was coach Gennaro Gattuso, whose contract was terminated by mutual agreement on Monday.

            Cádiz signed midfielder Youba Diarra from Salzburg, while Getafe brought in Gonzalo Villar on loan from Roma. Girona signed Peru defender Alexander Callens from New York City, while Mallorca added defender Ludwig Augustinsson from Aston Villa after seeing Braian Cufré move to NYC in Major League Soccer. 

            Valladolid signed Canadian forward Cyle Larin, and struggling Sevilla has added defender Loic Badé from Rennes, midfielder Pape Gueye from Olympique Marseille and forward Bryan Gil on a loan from Tottenham. The Spanish club loaned midfielder Thomas Delaney to Hoffenheim.

            Villarreal lost goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli to Ajax and forward Arnaut Danjuma to Tottenham, while Espanyol added midfielder Denis Suárez after he left Celta Vigo.

Getting the 18-year-old to the first team is crucial for Barcelona to keep him from having the option of leaving for free in the summer.Real Madrid is in a better situation financially, but also isn’t likely to add anyone to its squad other than Brazilian teenage sensation Endrick from Palmeiras, who was signed on a deal that will see him join the club when he turns 18 in 2024. On the other hand, it was not expected to lose any of the top players who helped it win the Champions League and the Spanish league last season.Madrid rival Atletico signed Dutch forward Depay on loan from Barcelona and Irish right back Matt Doherty after he was released by Tottenham, but lost Matheus Cunha to Wolverhampton and João Félix on loan to Chelsea. Defender Felipe joined Nottingham Forest in England.OTHER TEAMSRayo Vallecano was finally able to register forward Raúl de Tomás after his transfer from Espanyol hadn't come through in time at the previous transfer deadline.Defending Copa del Rey champion Real Betis lost defender Álex Moreno to Aston Villa, while the only loss for Copa runner-up Valencia was coach Gennaro Gattuso, whose contract was terminated by mutual agreement on Monday.Cádiz signed midfielder Youba Diarra from Salzburg, while Getafe brought in Gonzalo Villar on loan from Roma. Girona signed Peru defender Alexander Callens from New York City, while Mallorca added defender Ludwig Augustinsson from Aston Villa after seeing Braian Cufré move to NYC in Major League Soccer.Valladolid signed Canadian forward Cyle Larin, and struggling Sevilla has added defender Loic Badé from Rennes, midfielder Pape Gueye from Olympique Marseille and forward Bryan Gil on a loan from Tottenham.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796518,Penguin Random House US CEO Madeline McIntosh to step down,"NEW YORK (AP) — One of Penguin Random House's top executives, U.S. CEO Madeline McIntosh, is stepping down. Her decision comes just weeks after the resignation of the global CEO, Markus Dohle, and the retirement of Random House Publishing Group head Gina Centrello. 

            The departures all follow last fall's ruling by a federal judge to block the company's attempted purchase of rival publisher Simon & Schuster, and an antitrust trial in Washington, D.C. last summer that revealed tensions among Penguin Random House executives.

            McIntosh, appointed CEO in 2018, had risen steadily at the publisher through numerous organizations. On Tuesday, she cited both the need for change at the publisher — “CEOs shouldn't stay in their seats forever” — and her own desire for “professional growth.” She has worked on and off in book publishing for decades, and briefly worked for Amazon.com as part of a Kindle e-reader team based in Luxembourg.











            “My path through books has never been linear,” she wrote in a company memo. “From editorial, to new media, to sales, to audio, to Amazon (and Luxembourg!), to leadership of our digital transition, to the making of Penguin Random House, to publishing with the Penguins, and finally to this seat: It’s a road that would have been hard to plan for or predict. The points of my biggest pivots are exactly the ones that taught me the most.”

            McIntosh will not leave immediately; she plans to work “very closely” with Nihar Malaviya, PRH’s interim global CEO, “to determine the best plan for the U.S. organization going forward.” In a separate company letter, Malaviya wrote that he had been “fortunate to have learned so much from Madeline throughout the years we have worked together and have benefited from her friendship, both personally and professionally.”NEW YORK (AP) — One of Penguin Random House's top executives, U.S. CEO Madeline McIntosh, is stepping down.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796519,15 students in Mexico treated for internet drug 'challenge',"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Fifteen grade school students in Mexico have been treated after apparently taking part in an internet “challenge” in which groups of students take tranquilizers to see who can stay awake the longest. 

            The incident occurred Monday in the north-central city of Guanajuato. It came just days after health authorities issued a national alert about the craze. It was the fourth school in Mexico to suffer such incidents in the last year. 

            Guanajuato Mayor Alejandro Navarro said the students were treated at the school, and urged parents to supervise their kids’ use of social media.











            “As a rule, girls and boys shouldn't have social media accounts, it's bad to start with,” Navarro wrote in his Facebook account.

            There was no immediate information on the condition of the students, believed to be fifth and sixth graders, or where they got the tranquilizers.

            The Health Department issued an alert on Jan. 25 about the dangers of clonazepam, a tranquilizer, and called on the public to report any store selling it without a prescription. 

            That alert came one week after eight students at a Mexico City middle school were treated after taking a “controlled medication.” Some were hospitalized. Just days before, three students at another middle school near the northern city of Monterrey were treated for taking doses of clonazepam.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796520,Banchero headlines field for All-Star Rising Stars event,"Paolo Banchero's rookie season will include a trip to NBA All-Star weekend.

            The Orlando Magic forward and No. 1 pick in last year's draft was announced Tuesday as a participant in this year's Rising Stars Game, to be held in Salt Lake City on Feb. 17, two nights before the All-Star Game.

            Banchero — who leads all rookies with a 20.7 points-per-game average — may still be selected as an All-Star reserve. Those players will be revealed Thursday.











            “Anytime you can get a chance to be a part of All-Star weekend, you can’t say no,"" Banchero said. “Especially me, being a rookie, first year, never experienced it before, it’s always been the dream to just be a part of that whether it was Rising Stars or as a reserve. I’m definitely excited to get there and just see what it’s like.""

            Banchero is on pace to be the first rookie to average 20 points per game since Luka Doncic in 2018-19. He also is fourth among rookies in rebounds per game entering Tuesday and third among them in steals per game.

            Magic coach Jamahl Mosley said the All-Star experience — whether just for Rising Stars or not — will have an impact on Banchero.

            “Just being around other young players that have found themselves in that position, it does so much because it’s your peers,” Mosley said. “You’re around a group of young men who are the elite of the league in that class. I think it says something to the work that you’ve put in, the work that he’s put in. It’s going to do wonders for how he continues to believe in himself, what we’re doing as a team and his continued growth.”

            Also picked for the game from this year's rookie class: Detroit's Jalen Duren and Jaden Ivey, Atlanta's A.J. Griffin, Utah's Walker Kessler, Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin and Andrew Nembhard, Sacramento's Keegan Murray, Houston's Jabari Smith Jr., San Antonio's Jeremy Sochan and Oklahoma City's Jalen Williams.

            The second-year players selected were New Orleans' Jose Alvarado and Trey Murphy III, Toronto's Scottie Barnes, Oklahoma City's Josh Giddey, Houston's Jalen Green and Alperen Sengun, New York's Quentin Grimes, Denver's Bones Hyland, Cleveland's Evan Mobley and Orlando's Franz Wagner.

            There also will be a team of G League players in the Rising Stars event, composed of Sidy Cissoko, Mojave King, Scoot Henderson, Kenneth Lofton Jr., Mac McClung, Leonard Miller and Scotty Pippen Jr.

            The 21 NBA players will be drafted into three seven-player teams. Pau Gasol, Joakim Noah and Deron Williams will serve as coaches for those teams, while Jason Terry will coach the G League team.

            All four teams will play a semifinal game with a target score of 40, and the two winners will then play the championship game with a target score of 25.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796521,DeSantis pushes ban on diversity programs in state colleges,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday announced plans to block state colleges from having programs on diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory in his latest step onto the front lines of the nation's culture wars.

            The Republican governor debuted the proposal as part of a larger, higher education legislative package that is expected to be taken up by the GOP-controlled statehouse when its regular session begins in March.

            The second-term governor, who is widely expected to launch a 2024 White House bid in the late spring or early summer, has emerged as a fierce opponent of so-called woke policies on race, gender and public health. Such positions endear him to the GOP's conservative base but threaten to alienate independents and moderate voters in both parties who are influential in presidential politics.











            
                Critical race theory is a way of thinking about America’s history through the lens of racism. Scholars developed it during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what scholars viewed as a lack of racial progress following the civil rights legislation of the 1960s. It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions, which function to maintain the dominance of white people in society.

            “I think people want to see true academics and they want to get rid of some of the political window dressing that seems to accompany all this,"" DeSantis said at a news conference in Bradenton, adding that critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion programs, known as DEI, would get “no funding, and that will wither on the vine.”

            In a statement, the governor's office said the proposal “raises the standards of learning and civil discourse of public higher education in Florida” by “prohibiting higher education institutions from using any funding, regardless of source, to support DEI, CRT, and other discriminatory initiatives.”

            Later in the day, the newly conservative majority on the once progressive New College of Florida board of trustees — most of whom DeSantis recently appointed — voted to oust the current president, Patricia Okker. They also voted to begin debate on whether to abolish the office of diversity, equity and inclusion, and related programs. The final word on diversity, equity and inclusion programs will come at another meeting.

            The overall idea is to transform the school of fewer than 1,000 students in Sarasota into what the new trustees call a “classical” liberal arts school.

            “I think it’s time for us to set a new standard,” said one of the new trustees, conservative activist Christopher Rufo. “I think new leadership is the expectation.”

            The trustees voted to hire Richard Corcoran as the next New College president. The Republican former state House speaker and education commissioner is a close ally of DeSantis'.

            Before the meeting, dozens of students held a rally outside to oppose major changes to the school and its mission, which is known for its open approach to coursework without specific grades, and being a safe place for many LGBTQ students who feel marginalized in other schools.

            “That’s what’s at stake today and what we’re here to protect: the freedom to learn, the freedom to think and the freedom to be who we are,” said fourth-year student Madison Markham.

            As the 2024 presidential primary season begins, ambitious Republicans are increasingly eager to lean into cultural divisions as they court the conservative voters who typically decide GOP primary contests.

            Former President Donald Trump unveiled his own education plan last week that promises to cut federal funding for any school or program that includes “critical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.”

            “Our public schools have been taken over by the radical-left maniacs,” Trump, the only declared candidate in the race so far, said in a video announcing the plan.

            DeSantis' overall higher education proposal was expected after his administration requested in late December that state colleges submit spending data and other information on programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion, and critical race theory.

            The governor is also pushing for education administrators to “realign” courses to provide historically accurate information and to not include identity politics. DeSantis' proposals have not yet been introduced as formal legislation, but the GOP-controlled statehouse is often eager to carry out his initiatives.

            DeSantis and other conservatives have long argued that critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion programs are racially divisive and discriminatory — and are often cited in criticism of what they call “woke” ideology in education.

            Last year the governor signed legislation dubbed the Stop WOKE Act that restricts certain race-based conversations and analysis in schools and businesses. The law bars instruction that says members of one race are inherently racist or should feel guilt for past actions committed by others of the same race, among other things.

            This month, the DeSantis administration blocked a new Advanced Placement course on African American studies from being taught in high schools, saying it violates state law and is historically inaccurate.

            So far, at least 25 states have considered legislation or other steps to limit how race and racism can be taught, according to an analysis from Education Week. Eight states, all Republican-led, have banned or limited the teaching of critical race theory or similar concepts through laws or administrative actions. The bans largely address what can be taught inside the classroom.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796522,Arkansas House panel advances school gendered bathroom bill,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Transgender people at Arkansas public schools would not be able to use the restrooms matching their gender identity under a bill advanced by a state House committee on Tuesday.

            The House Education Committee endorsed the legislation, which would apply to multi-person restrooms and locker rooms at public schools and charter schools serving prekindergarten through 12th grade. The measure now goes to the majority-Republican House, which could take up the legislation as soon as Wednesday.

            Arkansas is one of several states where lawmakers have proposed bathroom bills for schools this year, and similar restrictions have been enacted in three states. 











            Critics called the latest push an effort to spark another court challenge to transgender students' rights and is not addressing any real problems.

            “For states to be passing these kinds of bills at this point is really them issuing a challenge to the federal government and saying, ‘We know that this is what you think the law says and we’re ready to do battle with you,’"" said Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights group.

            Republican Rep. Mary Bentley, the bill's sponsor, said the legislation would protect students and has said she filed the bill after speaking with members of a local school board that enacted a similar policy last year.

            “Every child in our schools, and each school, has the right to privacy and to feel safe in their bathrooms at school,"" Bentley said at a hearing on the bill last week. 

            Bentley's proposal requires schools to provide “reasonable"" accommodations, including single-person restrooms. Superintendents, principals and teachers who violate the prohibition could face fines of at least $1,000 from a state panel, and parents could also file private lawsuits to enforce the measure.

            A far-ranging bathroom bill that was enacted in North Carolina in 2016 prompted boycotts and protests, and a year later the measure was rolled back. Past efforts to enact similar legislation in Arkansas have stalled over concerns about similar consequences for the state.

            The bill advanced as the majority-Republican Legislature is poised to make Arkansas the first state to impose restrictions on drag performances. A House committee is expected this week to take up that legislation, which would classify drag shows as “adult-oriented"" businesses, and Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she supports that bill.

            In a statement Tuesday, Sanders' office did not specifically say whether she'd sign the bathroom bill if it reaches her desk.

(AP) — A man with an AR-15-style rifle and more than a dozen ammunition magazines opened fire inside a Target store in Omaha, sending panicked shoppers and employees scrambling for safety before he was fatally shot by police Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. No injuries were reported. 

            The white man in his 30s, who has not been identified, fired multiple rounds as he entered the store but it wasn’t clear if he fired at anyone, Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said.

            Target employee Lauren Murphy had just started her break when she heard the shots, and was in the store's front restroom. She got a text telling her to either run or stay put — so she hid in a bathroom stall, lifting her feet off the ground, and began texting her family and friends to say she loved them. A child next to her was crying.











            “I was scared that this is how I might die at work,” said Murphy, 21.

            “I was just clutching onto the side of the toilet getting my feet off the ground, making sure I wasn’t visible,” she added.

            Another 21-year-old employee, Samuel Jacobsen, was filling a personal shopping order when he heard the first gunshot. But he wasn’t sure what the sound was, and kept working.

            “Then my coworker ran by and she said, ‘He’s got a gun, get out!’” Jacobsen said. “I was like, ‘Oh this is real. I have to get out, I have to get out, I have to get out.’”

            He hid behind the store, texting coworkers to make sure they were OK.

            Cathy Mahannah, a customer, said the scene inside was “sheer panic.”

            The 62-year-old grandmother was near the store’s entrance picking out Valentine’s Day gifts for her family when she heard a banging sound. She thought something had fallen, but then saw a mass of people running for the exit.

            A shopper told her there was an active shooter, and she ran. She heard at least one more gunshot in the store and a few more when she was outside.

            Mahannah was so rattled she initially couldn’t find her car and jumped into a vehicle with a stranger.

            “The moments in that parking lot were terrifying when I heard the shots and thought, ‘Where do I hide? I don’t know what to do,'” she said.

            At least 29 calls to 911 came in around noon, and the city's police chief said officers were at the store within minutes. The first officers on the scene included Omaha police officers and a Nebraska State Trooper.

            “The first arriving officers went into the building, confronted the suspect and shot him dead,” Schmaderer said. “He had an AR-15 rifle with him and plenty of ammunition.”

            Police said the officers gave several loud commands for the man to drop the rifle before an Omaha officer shot the suspect, who died at the scene.

            Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives happened to be nearby and helped get victims to safety, bureau spokesperson John Ham said.

            The ATF is tracing the weapon to determine where it came from, whether it was acquired legally and whether it has been used in other crimes, Ham said.

            Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo said in a statement that all shoppers and employees were safely evacuated from the store, which will remain closed indefinitely.

            Lt. Neal Bonacci, a police spokesperson, said officers are trained to enter such scenes quickly to prevent mass casualties.

            “We’ve learned a lot from other jurisdictions, other areas, other cities that have unfortunately experienced this,” he said. “We enter right away. We’re trained to do so. Whether it’s one officer or 10, we go inside and neutralize the threat.”

            Several other shootings have taken place at stores across the country in recent months, at a time when mass shootings have commanded public attention on a disturbingly frequent basis. 

            In January, one woman was injured in a shooting at a Walmart store in Evansville, Indiana. Police said it could have been much worse if not for heroic actions by an employee and police. Officers arrived within minutes and fatally shot the gunman. A Walmart manager in Chesapeake, Virginia, killed six people in November when he began shooting wildly inside a break room. Six others were wounded. The gunman shot and killed himself before officers arrived.

            In Buffalo, New York, an 18-year-old fatally shot 10 people and injured three others last May, after seeking out a grocery store in a predominately Black neighborhood. Authorities immediately called it a hate crime.

            The Omaha shooting came just over 15 years after the deadly December 2007 shooting at a Von Maur department store, when a 19-year-old gunman killed eight people and himself.

            Nebraska allows gun owners to carry firearms — including assault-style rifles — in public view, as long as they don’t have a criminal record that bars them from possessing one and aren’t in a place where guns are prohibited. To legally conceal a gun, Nebraskans must submit to a state patrol background check, get fingerprinted and take a gun safety course.

            Republican state Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon is sponsoring a bill that would allow people to carry concealed handguns without a permit. The measure also would prohibit cities and counties from issuing local laws with more stringent controls than the state law. The proposal has 25 cosponsors. 

            Jacobsen, the store employee, said he wants stricter, not looser, gun laws.

            “As someone who grew up here, I always hear about this part of Omaha and west Omaha being so safe,” he said. But Tuesday's shooting “really drives it home that it could happen anywhere.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796534,Titans switch to new synthetic turf at Nissan Stadium,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans are tearing up the grass field at Nissan Stadium and replacing it with a synthetic surface before the 2023 season. 

            The Titans announced the change Tuesday. The team, which already has started work, is making the change after reviewing injury rates and knowing how difficult it is to grow grass at Nissan Stadium since it opened in 1999. 

            “Ultimately there’s just a limit to how much can be done for a natural grass surface in this part of the country,"" said Burke Nihill, the team president and CEO. ""This turf is cutting-edge technology and will be a huge improvement in terms of consistency and performance.”











            The Titans have led the NFL in each of the past two seasons for most players used, including setting a league record with 91 players in 2021 — most in a non-strike season — because of injuries.

            The franchise also learned from the NFL that games at Nissan Stadium have had players suffer more lower-body injuries than games at the league’s other stadiums with monofilament, synthetic turf fields over the past few seasons and also was among the league leaders for games with players with lower-body injuries.

            Nissan Stadium will be the NFL's first to use the technology featuring a monofilament, Matrix Helix turf with an organic infill that retains moisture better than synthetic fields using rubber. The Titans installed the surface at their indoor practice field last year. 

            Coach Mike Vrabel said he noticed the grass becoming slick even when replaced with new sod, causing players to slip. Vrabel said players responded favorably to the new indoor surface.

            “Just witnessing our practices inside and how they feel and how they respond on that product,"" Vrabel said. ""We’re excited to be able to add this product to our stadium.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796535,Ugandan activist's family awarded $10.5M for Utah park death,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The United States will pay family members of a Ugandan human rights activist killed in an accident at Arches National Park more than $10 million in damages, a federal judge ruled Monday.

            Though the amount was substantially less than pursued, attorneys representing the family of Esther Nakajjigo celebrated the judgement, saying it was the largest federal wrongful death verdict in Utah history.

            “By his verdict, Judge Bruce Jenkins has shown the world how the American justice system works to hold its own government accountable and greatly values all lives, including that of Esther Nakajjigo, a remarkable young woman from Uganda,"" Randi McGinn, the family's attorney said in a statement.











            Nakajjigo and her husband Ludovic Michaud were vacationing in eastern Utah, visiting the region's national parks months after their wedding. Recreation areas had recently opened after pandemic-era closures and, on the edge of Arches, a metal gate normally secured with a lock was left untethered.

            As the couple was leaving the park, gusts of wind swung the gate around rapidly, enough to slice through the passenger side door of the couple's car, decapitating Nakajjigo as her husband sat feet away in the driver's seat.

            The gruesome nature of Nakajjigo's death and the fact that she was a renowned Ugandan women’s rights activist drew widespread attention to the case.

            Nakajjigo, who was 25, lived with her husband in Denver, where she moved to attend a leadership course on a full scholarship. She rose from poverty to become the host of a solutions-oriented reality television series in Uganda focused on empowering women on issues such as education and healthcare, and had successfully raised funds to build health care facilities in her hometown.

            Because neither the U.S. nor Nakajjigo's family disputed the facts of the case, the civil suit focused largely on the amount of damages merited. Attorneys representing Michaud and Nakajjigo's parents asked for $140 million in damages, while the government said an appropriate award would be roughly $3.5 million.

            Jenkins awarded Michaud $9.5 million; Nakajjigo's mother, Christine Namagembe, $700,000; and her father, John Bosco Kateregga, $350,000.

            Throughout the trial, attorneys debated estimates of Nakajjigo's earnings potential. McGinn, representing Nakajjigo’s family, likened her to a nonprofit CEO for an American charity and said she would have likely made millions throughout her life. Attorneys representing the U.S. commended her work, yet noted her most recent job was working at a restaurant making $15 per hour.

            In his judgement, Jenkins said the government had provided “a more reasonable projection” of Nakajjigo's earnings potential.SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The United States will pay family members of a Ugandan human rights activist killed in an accident at Arches National Park more than $10 million in damages, a federal judge ruled Monday.Though the amount was substantially less than pursued, attorneys representing the family of Esther Nakajjigo celebrated the judgement, saying it was the largest federal wrongful death verdict in Utah history.“By his verdict, Judge Bruce Jenkins has shown the world how the American justice system works to hold its own government accountable and greatly values all lives, including that of Esther Nakajjigo, a remarkable young woman from Uganda,"" Randi McGinn, the family's attorney said in a statement.Nakajjigo and her husband Ludovic Michaud were vacationing in eastern Utah, visiting the region's national parks months after their wedding.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796536,AP source: FBI searched Biden's former office in November,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The FBI searched President Joe Biden's former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington in November, according to a person familiar with the matter, at least a week after his personal lawyers first found classified records there from his time as vice president. 

            The discovery of the documents at the office blocks away from the U.S. Capitol led to a search of Biden's homes, including his residence in Wilmington, Delaware, where lawyers and federal agents found additional classified documents in December and January. It was not immediately clear whether the FBI search of Biden's office — which was conducted voluntarily, without a search warrant — uncovered additional classified documents beyond those found on Nov. 2 by Biden's attorneys. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a law enforcement action.

            News of the FBI search is the latest uncomfortable development for Biden, who pledged to turn the page on the norm- and rule-breaking tenure of his predecessor, Donald Trump. 











            Attorney General Merrick Garland has appointed a special counsel to lead an investigation into how the documents ended up at Biden's home and former office and whether any laws were broken. Trump is facing a far more perilous investigation by a separate special counsel after repeatedly refusing federal efforts to recover classified and official records at his Florida estate. 

            In the wake of the Biden disclosures, former Vice President Mike Pence said he found classified documents at his Indiana residence and the National Archives has requested that former presidents and vice presidents dating back to the Reagan administration search for any potentially classified or government records improperly in their possession. 

            Word of the November search of the Penn Biden Center was first reported Tuesday by CBS News, whose initial inquiries about the discovery of classified information at the Biden office sparked the first White House acknowledgement of their discovery.

            The White House and the president's personal lawyers, who have faced criticism from Republicans and even some Democrats for their delayed and incomplete disclosure of information about the classified document discoveries, did not directly reveal the search or comment on the matter Tuesday. An FBI spokesman declined comment, as did the Justice Department. 

            
                The special counsel for the Biden documents, Robert Hur, officially begins this week after finishing up other legal work outside the Justice Department, and will take over the investigation and the work done so far from Justice officials. 

            In a Jan. 21 statement acknowledging that FBI agents had searched and taken custody of classified records at the president's Wilmington home the day before, Bob Bauer, the president's personal attorney said the search “was consistent with the process described in the Statement we released on January 14 and followed after the personal attorney’s discovery of the documents found at the Penn Biden Center.”

            The White House and Biden’s personal attorneys have not revealed whether the FBI has already or will search Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. His lawyers previously searched that residence and said they did not identify any classified documents or government records there.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796537,"Iran, Russia move to link banks to evade Western sanctions","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran and Russia have taken a key step toward linking their banking systems in a move that further boosts their cooperation in the face of Western sanctions, an Iranian official said.

            At a signing ceremony on Sunday, Mohsen Karami, the deputy central bank governor, said banks in the two countries had connected their messaging networks following agreements reached over the past year, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

            It was not clear whether those links would allow for the transfer of funds, and services were not yet available to bank customers. Karami said 100 banks in 13 other countries were connected to the network, without naming them.











            There was no immediate comment from Russia or the United States, which has worked with its allies to isolate both countries.

            In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, Western countries banned key Russian banks from the Belgium-based SWIFT financial messaging system, which daily moves billions of dollars around the world among more than 11,000 banks and financial institutions.

            The Trump administration took similar action against Iranian banks as it reimposed crippling sanctions after withdrawing the U.S. from a nuclear agreement with world powers in 2018.

            Cutting banks off from the SWIFT system severely limits a country's ability to acquire foreign capital and trade internationally, and is among the toughest financial sanctions available. 

            Iran and Russia have strengthened ties following Russia's invasion, with Iran supplying attack drones that have dive-bombed infrastructure and other civilian targets across Ukraine. After initially denying that it had armed Russia, in November Iran acknowledged the drones transfer, saying it took place before the war began.

            Russia's vast oil reserves and trade ties with China and India have thus far largely cushioned it from Western sanctions. 

            Iran has struggled for years in the face of similar sanctions linked to its disputed nuclear program. Its currency fell to an all-time low late last year, further hobbling the economy, draining people's life savings and adding fuel to nationwide anti-government protests.

            Efforts to revive the 2015 agreement, which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for strict limits and stepped-up surveillance of its nuclear activities, hit an impasse several months ago.DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran and Russia have taken a key step toward linking their banking systems in a move that further boosts their cooperation in the face of Western sanctions, an Iranian official said.At a signing ceremony on Sunday, Mohsen Karami, the deputy central bank governor, said banks in the two countries had connected their messaging networks following agreements reached over the past year, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.It was not clear whether those links would allow for the transfer of funds, and services were not yet available to bank customers.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796540,Low-activity transfer window in Italy limps to an end,"MILAN (AP) — A quiet deadline day in Italy brought to an end a winter transfer period that saw the lowest spending by Serie A clubs in almost two decades.

            Serie A clubs spent a total of 28.42 million euros ($30.89 million) on transfers in January, their lowest expenditure since 2006, when they spent 13.56 million euros ($14.7 million).

            The biggest outlay was by Fiorentina — for a player already at the club.











            Fiorentina made Antonín Barák’s move from Hellas Verona permanent on deadline day on Tuesday, paying 8.5 million euros ($9.24 million) for the Czech Republic international, who had been on loan at the Tuscan club since August.

            January transfer windows are usually less exciting than those in the summer and Italian soccer is still recovering financially from the coronavirus pandemic. But even last year, Serie A clubs splashed out 185 million euros ($201 million).

            None of the top four teams — Napoli, Inter Milan, Lazio, Atalanta — spent anything this month. Defending champion AC Milan and sixth-place Roma, who are also both pushing hard for the Champions League qualifying places, spent just 500,000 euros ($543,000) on loan deals.

            Roma signed Spain defender Diego Llorente from Leeds until the end of the season on Tuesday, while Milan brought in goalkeeper Devis Vásquez from Paraguayan outfit Guaraní earlier this month.

            There was also no outlay by Juventus this month, although defender Luca Pellegrini joined Lazio on loan. The 23-year-old Pellegrini, who has spent most of his Juventus career out on loan, progressed through the ranks at Lazio's fierce rival Roma.

            Juventus is only 10 points above the relegation zone after being penalized 15 points for false accounting earlier this month.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796541,Jorginho joins Premier League leader Arsenal from Chelsea,"LONDON (AP) — Italy international Jorginho joined Arsenal from Chelsea for a reported 12 million pounds ($14.75 million) on Tuesday, a deadline-day move that gives the Premier League leaders an extra option in midfield in their bid to win a first top-flight title since 2004.

            Arsenal made a late move in the transfer window to strengthen its central-midfield department, with Mohamed Elneny — a backup to first-choice holding midfielder Thomas Partey — ruled out for a lengthy period Tuesday because of injury.

            Jorginho, who helped Italy win the European Championship in 2021, spent 4 1/2 years at Chelsea after joining from Napoli. He was no longer a regular player at Chelsea under manager Graham Potter.











            Chelsea recouped some money having spent around $225 million on new players in the January transfer window.

            Arsenal leads the league by five points ahead of second-place Manchester City and has a game in hand.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796550,DC arrests city employee over shooting death of 13-year-old,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Police arrested a D.C. city employee Tuesday over the fatal shooting of a 13-year old that has roiled community passions. 

            Jason Lewis, a longtime Parks and Recreation Department employee, turned himself in Tuesday morning to face charges of second-degree murder while armed. Lewis shot Karon Blake on Jan. 7, around 4 a.m., across the street from the middle school Blake attended.

            The shooting prompted a fierce community response, with Metropolitan Police Department chief Robert Contee facing intense public pressure to either arrest the shooter or reveal their identity. Lewis. 41, was ordered held without bond until a Feb. 13 court appearance.











            “The investigation took the amount of time that it needed to take,” Contee said Tuesday. “There was somewhat of a self-defense claim that needed to be overcome.” 

            The charges don't hinge directly on the shots that killed Blake, but rather to an earlier gunshot that Lewis didn’t mention in his initial statement to police. The arrest warrant acknowledges that Blake was part of a group of youths apparently robbing parked cars, and that Blake apparently ran straight at Lewis before he opened fire from his property. 

            But it charges Lewis with setting off the violent chain of events with an earlier shot that he fired — one which Contee said ”was not part of the initial discussion that we had,” when Lewis made his original statement to police. 

            Contee said multiple residents on the block came forward with video evidence from their own security cameras. The arrest warrant delves into a chilling level of detail from that footage, including Blake pleading after he was shot.

            “The decedent (Blake) can then be heard yelling, ‘I am sorry’ numerous times, followed by ‘Please don’t’ and ‘No’ numerous times. The decedent yells, ‘I am a kid’ and ‘I am only 12’ numerous times,” it states.

            That footage, which hasn't been publicly released, showed Blake and his companions emerging from what turned out to be a stolen car and breaking into parked cars in Lewis’ Brookland neighborhood, the warrant claims. ""They had flashlights, they were peering into cars and they were going into the cars,” Contee said. 

            Lewis is charged with firing first at the young man who remained seated in the stolen car. In the confusion after that first shot, Blake apparently ran directly at Lewis and was fatally wounded. 

            “The first shot was fired ... at someone sitting in a vehicle who wasn’t an immediate threat,"" Contee said Tuesday. This original shot, when Lewis had no claim of being personally under threat, was “where things really unraveled” and “put the chain of events into place” that resulted in Blake’s death, Contee said. 

            “I don’t know if (Blake) knew that Mr. Lewis was standing where he was standing,"" he said. 

            The police chief encouraged the youths who were with Blake that night to come forward to police with their own testimony. But he stopped short Tuesday of promising any sort of amnesty from criminal charges.

            “My assessment is that these young men obviously need some sort of intervention,” he said. “Ï want to make sure they get what they need.”

            A statement from Lewis’ attorney, Lee Smith, maintained his innocence and said, “While this is certainly a tragedy, once all the facts are heard, I believe that a jury will find that there was no crime here.”WASHINGTON (AP) — Police arrested a D.C. city employee Tuesday over the fatal shooting of a 13-year old that has roiled community passions.Jason Lewis, a longtime Parks and Recreation Department employee, turned himself in Tuesday morning to face charges of second-degree murder while armed. Lewis shot Karon Blake on Jan. 7, around 4 a.m., across the street from the middle school Blake attended.The shooting prompted a fierce community response, with Metropolitan Police Department chief Robert Contee facing intense public pressure to either arrest the shooter or reveal their identity. Lewis. 41, was ordered held without bond until a Feb. 13 court appearance.“The investigation took the amount of time that it needed to take,” Contee said Tuesday. “There was somewhat of a self-defense claim that needed to be overcome.”The charges don't hinge directly on the shots that killed Blake, but rather to an earlier gunshot that Lewis didn’t mention in his initial statement to police. The arrest warrant acknowledges that Blake was part of a group of youths apparently robbing parked cars, and that Blake apparently ran straight at Lewis before he opened fire from his property.But it charges Lewis with setting off the violent chain of events with an earlier shot that he fired — one which Contee said ”was not part of the initial discussion that we had,” when Lewis made his original statement to police.Contee said multiple residents on the block came forward with video evidence from their own security cameras. The arrest warrant delves into a chilling level of detail from that footage, including Blake pleading after he was shot.“The decedent (Blake) can then be heard yelling, ‘I am sorry’ numerous times, followed by ‘Please don’t’ and ‘No’ numerous times. The decedent yells, ‘I am a kid’ and ‘I am only 12’ numerous times,” it states.That footage, which hasn't been publicly released, showed Blake and his companions emerging from what turned out to be a stolen car and breaking into parked cars in Lewis’ Brookland neighborhood, the warrant claims. ""They had flashlights, they were peering into cars and they were going into the cars,” Contee said.Lewis is charged with firing first at the young man who remained seated in the stolen car. In the confusion after that first shot, Blake apparently ran directly at Lewis and was fatally wounded.“The first shot was fired ... at someone sitting in a vehicle who wasn’t an immediate threat,"" Contee said Tuesday. This original shot, when Lewis had no claim of being personally under threat, was “where things really unraveled” and “put the chain of events into place” that resulted in Blake’s death, Contee said.“I don’t know if (Blake) knew that Mr. Lewis was standing where he was standing,"" he said.The police chief encouraged the youths who were with Blake that night to come forward to police with their own testimony. But he stopped short Tuesday of promising any sort of amnesty from criminal charges.“My assessment is that these young men obviously need some sort of intervention,” he said. “Ï want to make sure they get what they need.”A statement from Lewis’ attorney, Lee Smith, maintained his innocence and said, “While this is certainly a tragedy, once all the facts are heard, I believe that a jury will find that there was no crime here.”",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796553,"Ex-Ohio speaker's lawyer questions 'vibes,' judge's fitness","CINCINNATI (AP) — One of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder's lawyers questioned the fitness on Tuesday of U.S. District Judge Timothy Black to preside over the Republican's corruption trial.

            Attorney Mark Marein raised the issue as the trial of Householder and lobbyist Matt Borges, a former chair of the Ohio Republican Party, resumed after a week's pause due to COVID-19. Marein said he was getting bad “vibes” from the court and wondered whether Black might hold “personal animosity” toward Householder for the ex-speaker's political work against the judge decades ago.

            Black said he was fit to preside. He had scolded Householder's team last week for unprofessional and “bush league” behavior, after attorneys made faces and clicked pens during the government's open statement.











            Householder and Borges are accused of taking part in a $60 million bribery scheme, secretly funded by Akron-based FirstEnergy Corp., that involved securing Householder's power, electing his allies, passing a $1 billion nuclear bailout bill and keeping a referendum against it off the ballot. Each faces a single charge of racketeering that carries a punishment of up to 20 years in prison, if convicted.

            Black dismissed a juror on Tuesday who refused to wear a mask, following a juror's positive coronavirus diagnosis last week and a week's break to allow the person to isolate and recover. A pool of 12 jurors and four alternates were originally chosen.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796554,Tyre Nichols beating raises scrutiny on 'elite' police units,"A car with dark tinted windows circles the block a few times before swerving onto the sidewalk. A handful of armed plainclothes police officers jump out and order everyone out of a double-parked car so they can search it, striking terror in the seconds before red and blue lights flash or an officer yells “police.”

            A similar scene plays out in dozens of cities across the country every day. 

            The beating and death of Tyre Nichols by five former Memphis police officers who were members of an anti-crime task force has renewed scrutiny on such squads, which frequently wear street clothes and often are involved in a disproportionate number of violent incidents and civilian complaints. Memphis police officials — after initially defending the SCORPION unit — permanently disbanded the team Saturday just hours after the release of video that showed immediate and prolonged aggression from its officers.











            Police department leaders across the country bill the specialty squads as “elite” units of officers sent into neighborhoods as a direct response to an increase in specific crimes, often arguing they are a tool to dedicate additional resources.

            But policing reform advocates and people who live in the Black and brown neighborhoods that these units usually patrol often say the officers employ aggressive tactics sometimes bordering on brutality, have little oversight and use pretextual stops of cars and pedestrians alike to search for larger crimes.

            “Obviously it's a complicated issue, and they are responding to a tangible problem being whatever crime of the day they are formed to address — guns, gang violence, narcotics. But Memphis is not an outlier here,” said Hans Menos, vice president of the Triage Response Team at the Center for Policing Equity. “I don't see any other option we have as a country but to say this is not working. This is leading to pain, injury and death.”

            Menos, who led Philadelphia's Police Advisory Commission, the former civilian oversight arm of the police department, said the units often are judged only on results without questions about how those were gained.

            Less than a year before Nichols was killed, four officers from a similar plainclothes unit in Philadelphia tasked with getting illegal guns off the street initiated a stop in an unmarked car of two juveniles on bikes.

            Department leaders have said the officers turned on their flashing lights before 12-year-old Thomas T.J. Siderio, allegedly fired a shot at the car. One of the officers chased down Siderio, fatally shooting him in the back as he fled. Prosecutors who charged that officer with murder said the boy was unarmed when he was shot.

            But there were warning signs in Philadelphia that task force officers were acting aggressively or recklessly for months before the shooting — including car wrecks and citizen complaints.

            Police leaders in several departments have argued that the high number of complaints and violent incidents in these squads are due to the exact work they are asked to do — interrupt patterns of dangerous crime often involving guns or drugs.

            In Memphis, police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis started the Street Crimes Operations to Restore Peace In Our Neighborhoods unit when she took over the department in 2021. The team of about 40 officers was designed to focus on repeat violent offenders after three years of rising violence in the city, including a record number of homicides in 2021.

            Before she agreed to disband the SCORPION unit in an effort to speed the city's healing process, Davis had defended its work, saying it had taken 800 illegal guns off the street and made more than 2,000 felony arrests last year. She added that she would not shut down a unit if a few officers committed “some egregious act.”

            Menos scoffed at what he called a frequent defense used by police leaders who say a few “bad apples” commit those acts.

            “The narrative that if this team was a problem, it was unique. Well, it’s not. ... It’s not bad apples,” he said. “The reliance of departments on these young specialized units is one of the biggest structural problems in policing that could exist. They are operating with impunity in largely Black communities that are historically overpoliced. And we are compounding that problem by putting these overly aggressive, results-only oriented officers in those neighborhoods.”

            Hunter Demster, an organizer for the group Decarceration Memphis who has raised red flags about SCORPION and other plainclothes units in Memphis, said people in neighborhoods with higher crime want more police officers to solve murders, but when the department puts these patrols in their communities what they get is targeted harassment.

            Demster said a friend recently got pulled over by an officer in an “unmarked car, unmarked clothing. And the officer said that his license plate was bent in the corner and everything was still visible. They use that as a pretext to do an investigation into hoping they can smell weed.”

            In Baltimore, seven Gun Trace Task Force members indicted in 2017 were convicted or pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges for systematically robbing the city and its residents of money, drugs and jewelry using illegal searches and planted evidence. 

            Afterward, the Baltimore Police Department commissioned an independent review of agency operations and the resulting report included recommendations specifically aimed at increasing oversight of plainclothes units. The report, released in January 2022, called for more careful screening of applicants and routine financial audits for plainclothes and undercover officers.

            Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison has also continued to shift the department away from a reliance on plainclothes policework in recent years, issuing uniforms and marked cars for so-called District Action Teams officers, whose focus is proactive patrols.

            Terence Jones, a former Philadelphia police officer who served on multiple plainclothes units, investigated Siderio's shooting in March of 2022 as part of his work for the police accountability nonprofit Total Justice that he founded. Jones called the shooting a murder after talking with neighbors and uncovering cellphone and security videos that showed the aftermath. 

            Even so, Jones was unwilling to say the units should be disbanded. He advocated for reforming them to include better supervision, ban traffic stops for unmarked cars and screen out any officer with a history of excessive force from the application process.

            “These jump-out boys are a slap in the face to real police officers that did the job the right way without having to abuse authority, plant evidence or use excessive force,” he said. “But that lack of accountability starts at the top.”

            In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams agreed he'd rather reform than disband the squads, angering progressives during his 2021 mayoral campaign when he promised to bring back a modified form of a plainclothes anti-crime police unit of about 600 officers that was disbanded during protests over the killing of George Floyd.

            The anti-crime officers were tasked with seizing illegal guns but had been blamed for abuses like the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Then-police Commissioner Dermot Shea said when he ended the program in June 2020 that the anti-crime unit had been responsible for a disproportionate share of complaints against the department.

            Adams, a Democrat and retired police captain, changed the squad’s name to the anti-gun unit when he reintroduced it in March 2022 and said officers would wear modified uniforms such as police windbreakers rather than street clothes.

            Menos said Adams' plan is a way of saying he's run out of new policing options.

            “What he did was try to thread that needle, to suggest that he recognized the problems with oppression could be directly tied to the tactics and operations of specialized units, but like many before him, he said, ‘Don’t worry, this time there will be oversight,’” Menos said. “How many specialized units are going to kill people, maim people, become criminals themselves before we say let's try something else?""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796557,US accuses Russia of endangering nuclear arms control treaty,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's refusal to allow on-the-ground inspections to resume is endangering the New START nuclear treaty and U.S.-Russian arms control overall, the Biden administration charged on Tuesday.

            The finding was delivered to Congress and summarized in a statement by the State Department. It follows months of more hopeful U.S. assessments that the two countries would be able to salvage cooperation on limiting strategic nuclear weapons despite high tensions over Russia's war on Ukraine.

            Inspections of U.S. and Russian military sites under the New START treaty were paused by both sides because of the spread of the coronavirus in March 2020. The U.S.-Russia committee overseeing implementation of the treaty last met in October 2021, but Russia then unilaterally suspended its cooperation with the treaty’s inspection provisions in August 2022 to protest U.S. support for Ukraine.











            “Russia’s refusal to facilitate inspection activities prevents the United States from exercising important rights under the treaty and threatens the viability of U.S.-Russian nuclear arms control,” the State Department said Tuesday.

            The administration also blamed Russia for the two country's failure to resume talks required under the New START treaty.

            Russia's Foreign Ministry said last August that it had told the U.S. it was temporarily suspending on-site inspections required under the treaty. It said U.S. sanctions imposed over Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine had changed conditions between the two countries and claimed that the U.S. was blocking Russians from carrying out their own inspections at U.S. sites.

            The State Department on Tuesday denied that the U.S. was blocking inspections by the Russians.

            It insisted the U.S.-Russia nuclear arms control efforts were essential to the security of the U.S., its allies and the world at large.

            “It is all the more important during times of tension when guardrails and clarity matter most,” the State Department said.WASHINGTON (AP) — Russia's refusal to allow on-the-ground inspections to resume is endangering the New START nuclear treaty and U.S.-Russian arms control overall, the Biden administration charged on Tuesday.The finding was delivered to Congress and summarized in a statement by the State Department.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796558,Chief: Fatal shooting at LA home was 'targeted assault',"LOS ANGELES (AP) — A weekend shooting in which three women were killed at a short-term rental home in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood was a targeted attack, the city's police chief said Tuesday as investigators continued to search for suspects. 

            Four other people were wounded, two critically, when gunfire erupted around 2:30 a.m. Saturday at the property in the Beverly Crest area, the Los Angeles Police Department said. 

            Chief Michel Moore said detectives believe the shooting was ""not in pursuit of a robbery, or some random act, but instead a targeted assault and … a vicious expression of violence and a terrible loss of life.”











            The Los Angeles County coroner’s office on Sunday identified those killed as Iyana Hutton, 33, of Chicago; Nenah Davis, 29, of Bolingbrook, Illinois; and Destiny Sims, 26, of Buckeye, Arizona.

            Police officials said the three victims were inside a vehicle when they were fatally shot. 

            Moore said Davis was a single mother with three young children — an 8-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl. He said Sims also had three young children under the age of six. And Hutton was an aspiring actress, rap artist and music promoter, the chief said. 

            Investigators were trying to determine if there was a party at the rental home or what type of gathering was occurring, officials said. 

            The ages and genders of the wounded victims were not released and their conditions were not known Tuesday. 

            The chief said the shooting “shattered a sense of calm and peace in that neighborhood,” where large and expensive houses are nestled in the Santa Monica Mountains. The home, estimated at $3 million, is on a cul-de-sac and described in online real estate platforms as modern and private with a pool and outdoor shower.

            The shooting followed a Jan. 21 massacre at a dance hall in a Los Angeles suburb that left 11 dead and nine wounded, and shootings at two Half Moon Bay farms on Jan. 23 that left seven dead and one wounded.LOS ANGELES (AP) — A weekend shooting in which three women were killed at a short-term rental home in an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood was a targeted attack, the city's police chief said Tuesday as investigators continued to search for suspects.Four other people were wounded, two critically, when gunfire erupted around 2:30 a.m. Saturday at the property in the Beverly Crest area, the Los Angeles Police Department said.Chief Michel Moore said detectives believe the shooting was ""not in pursuit of a robbery, or some random act, but instead a targeted assault and … a vicious expression of violence and a terrible loss of life.”The Los Angeles County coroner’s office on Sunday identified those killed as Iyana Hutton, 33, of Chicago; Nenah Davis, 29, of Bolingbrook, Illinois; and Destiny Sims, 26, of Buckeye, Arizona.Police officials said the three victims were inside a vehicle when they were fatally shot.Moore said Davis was a single mother with three young children — an 8-year-old girl, a 7-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796559,IndyCar preseason begins without Lights winner Lundqvist,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The start of a new IndyCar season is looming with a field that will include four rookies.

            Linus Lundqvist, the reigning Indy Lights champion, is without a ride for the upcoming season.

            Winning the title in the final series of the IndyCar ladder system was worth a $500,000 bonus for Lundqvist to spend on an IndyCar ride. Only the 23-year-old Swede was unable to stretch the cash into any seat time.











            Instead, he is watching as Sting Ray Robb and Benjamin Pederson, two drivers who finished below him in the standings last year, landed late IndyCar rides. Robb will drive for Dale Coyne Racing and Pederson got a seat with A.J. Foyt Racing.

            Agustin Canapino, an Argentinian touring driver, was hired for a second car at Juncos Hollinger Racing. Chip Ganassi Racing hired Marcus Armstrong, a former Ferrari driver who spent last season in Formula 2, to race on road and street courses.

            “I believe that I deserve a seat, and he beat me, so...” Robb said Tuesday about the strange situation. 

            Robb actually landed his ride with Coyne after a chance offseason encounter with Lundqvist at the gym: Robb assumed Lundqvist had the Coyne seat, learned in that conversation it wasn't a done deal, and got his agent immediately on the case. 

            “Linus does deserve a seat. His on track performance was incredible,” Robb said. ""But it takes more than just a good driver to get into IndyCar. You've got to have a village around you that supports you. And so I think that that’s where my group made a difference — it wasn’t just my performance. I do feel bad for Linus.”

            IndyCar begins its preseason testing this week without Lundqvist, who spent the last two weekends roaming Daytona International Speedway looking for an open seat.

            Any open seat.

            “Teams obviously need money to run and I am not a driver that brings money,” Lundqvist told The Associated Press. “I understand the business. But it doesn’t mean that it hurts any less. I still believe that we deserve a shot.”

            Lundqvist won five of 14 races last year in pursuit of the scholarship money that many drivers rely upon to help fund their promotion into elite IndyCar. Instead, the open rides went to his Lights teammate Pederson and Robb, who drove for Andretti Autosport. Pederson and Robb only won once each last season.

            Lundqvist said there have been discussions with IndyCar to defer his bonus money a year if he's unable to use it in 2023. Penske Entertainment has overhauled Indy Lights for 2023 and will call the series Indy NXT. The champion will now receive a little over $800,000.

            “They tell me I just won the title the wrong year,” Lundqvist said.

            Kyle Kirkwood won the title in 2021 and will drive for Andretti Autosport this year. Previous Lights champions include Josef Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion for Team Penske, and Pato O'Ward, a rising star with Arrow McLaren.

            “I’m trying to find something. Anything really, but I think the full-time racing option this year is fone,” Lundqvist said. “The best case is that I can put together maybe a couple of races, and if I do well, then maybe it can lead to something more. It's not easy to come by these seats and it's a very tough way to start the year.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796560,Unexpected Pennsylvania House speaker hopes to retain job,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The rank-and-file Democrat who was unexpectedly elected speaker of the Pennsylvania House as a compromise candidate earlier this month is saying he hopes to keep the job even after three vacant Democratic-leaning seats are filled in special elections next week.

            In a lengthy interview late Monday in his state Capitol suite, Speaker Mark Rozzi said he won't necessarily step aside and support the Democratic floor leader, Rep. Joanna McClinton of Philadelphia, as speaker.

            “I know how to count votes, first of all,” said Rozzi, who represents a mostly suburban area around Reading. “So, you know, at the end of the day she still has to get the votes to become speaker of the House.”











            Democrats won 102 seats in November to Republicans' 101, which was enough for a bare Democratic majority after 12 years under Republican control, but one reelected Democrat died in October and two others resigned in December because they also won higher offices. Elections are next Tuesday to fill those three vacancies, all in the Pittsburgh area.

            Republicans were not able to muster enough votes to elect their own speaker when the new session began Jan. 3, leading to Rozzi's emergence as an alternative. McClinton and all Democrats voted for him, along with all seven members of House GOP leadership and nine other Republicans.

            The Capitol is now rife with speculation that McClinton or some other candidate may soon try to evict Rozzi from the speaker's rostrum. 

            McClinton responded to Rozzi's talk of keeping the job by saying she “would be honored” to be speaker, and that once the House vacancies are filled, she will “trust my colleagues will make the best decision to move Pennsylvania forward.”

            The House has been frozen since Rozzi took the speakership and has not passed internal operating rules or assigned members to committees. 

            Instead, Rozzi has convened a group of three representatives from each party to work on rules, hold listening sessions and come up with a way to pass what has been his primary objective for many years — a two-year window for victims of child sexual abuse to file otherwise outdated civil lawsuits.

            Rozzi, 51, who has described being molested by a now deceased parish priest for over a year at about age 13, said he wants to use his time in the top job to do some good. He acknowledged that some members from both parties are not happy with him, seeing that as sign he's on the right path.

            “I think that if I can show people I can lead this House, maybe I could stay in this position,” Rozzi said.

            It may prove a tall order for a speaker who did not work his way up the ladder, building relationships along the way and leaning on a core of caucus support.

            “Mark is not certain about how long his tenure lasts,” said a friend from the Reading area, Republican state Rep. Mark Gillen. “There's no textbook that he's going to be able to pull out and read the next play from.”

            In two public hearings by Rozzi's group, the Speaker’s Workgroup to Move Pennsylvania Forward, he has heard a range of suggestions, many from people active with groups that have sought to ban gifts to lawmakers, improve transparency and weaken the tight grip that majority leaders have held on bills and amendments. 

            After it conducts two more listening sessions this week — in State College on Wednesday and Wilkes-Barre on Thursday — Rozzi hopes the working group will then formulate viable proposals on internal operating rules and the lawsuit window legislation. He insists he's not stalling and suggested he may soon convene the 2023-24 session's first voting floor session.

            Rep. Paul Schemel, a Franklin County Republican who Rozzi picked for the working group, said the new speaker has been feeling some heat, particularly when he chose to shut down the chamber for the time being.

            “I'm sure it's hard on him, but I think he genuinely wants reform of the system,” Schemel said.

            Rozzi said he became active in politics through grassroots participation in efforts to spotlight and combat sexual abuse by Catholic clergy, including his participation in protests in the state Capitol before he was elected. When his local state representative in Berks County was retiring, he called Rozzi to suggest he run. 

            The divorced father of one daughter won that race in 2012 and sold his family's window-and-door installation company six years later. 

            He considers himself a Catholic but not a ""practicing Catholic within the institution."" He declined to disclose the amount of a settlement he reached over claims of abuse a couple years ago with the Allentown Catholic diocese. 

            “Believe me, it wasn't enough to ever make things right, I can tell you that,” Rozzi said. “It's not enough to put my life back together.”

            The statute of limitations window has far and away been his primary issue, but Rozzi considers himself as a centrist, fiscally conservative and socially liberal. He supports abortion rights, gun rights and business tax cuts, and voted with Republicans last year on a bill to prohibit transgender athletes from playing school sports that align with their gender identity. That measure was vetoed by then-Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. He is not against expanding voter ID requirements, a proposal opposed by most legislative Democrats.

            Rozzi said he had engaged in pie-in-the-sky talks about becoming speaker several months ago with his main ally in the sex-abuse lawsuit window fight, Blair County Republican Rep. Jim Gregory. But when swearing-in day began Jan. 3, he did not know what was about to occur and was surprised when Republicans wanted to pursue the idea.

            Despite their temporary, 101-99 majority, Republicans had fallen short of majority support for their caucus' choice for speaker, Rep. Carl Walker Metzgar of Somerset County. Rozzi then found himself in a conference room with the Republican floor leader, Rep. Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County, and several aides. 

            By all accounts including his own, Rozzi agreed to position himself as an independent speaker and wanted a commitment about the lawsuit window. But both Cutler and Gregory insist Rozzi also promised to change his party registration, something Rozzi said he does not currently plan to do. 

            The lack of House floor action has effectively killed Republican hopes of getting a bundle of constitutional amendments on the low-turnout primary ballot. Cutler and other Republicans feel burned by the deal.

            “I think the mistake was trusting somebody who wasn't entirely truthful,” Cutler told reporters last week. “That was a mistake. And there's still time to correct that.”

            Rozzi insists he only agreed to consider changing his voter registration and felt even that was part of a deal in which the two-year lawsuit window would be considered on its own. Instead, the Republican-majority state Senate bundled it with constitutional amendments to expand voter ID requirements and to weaken a governor's authority to enact regulations.

            Rozzi said he has tried to negotiate with Cutler in recent weeks, to no avail.

            “You talk to the Democrats up here over the last 12 years and they'll tell you, like every opportunity that Bryan Cutler got a chance to lie to them, he lied to them,” Rozzi said.HARRISBURG, Pa.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796561,Rodgers believes decision could come in 'couple of weeks',"GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said he doesn’t expect to make a decision on whether to play next season until after the Super Bowl.

            Rodgers, 39, has said he is still making up his mind on whether he wants to return to the Packers for a 19th season, retire or request a trade. The four-time MVP also has noted the possibility the Packers may want to move him.

            “It’s going to be a little more time for my decision,” Rodgers said Tuesday during his weekly appearance on “The Pat McAfee Show” on SiriusXM and YouTube. “I feel confident that in a couple of weeks I’ll feel definitely more strongly about one of the two decisions.”











            The first decision is whether he wants to play at all.

            “You’ve got to be cognizant of what was going through your mind during the season,” Rodgers said. “Did you enjoy the grind as much? Did you enjoy practice? Did you enjoy the meeting time? Did you enjoy the routine? And not forget about those feelings and make an emotional response either way. I think that’s important.”

            Rodgers was the league MVP in 2020 and 2021, but didn’t perform as well this season while playing with a broken right thumb and dealing with the absence of star wideout Davante Adams, who was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders in March.

            Rodgers had his lowest passer rating as a starter and threw 12 interceptions, his highest single-season total since 2008. The Packers went 8-9 and missed the playoffs to end a string of three straight NFC North titles.

            Rodgers was asked if he would decide on his plans and would then call the Packers, who would then let him know what they’re thinking.

            “I think so,” Rodgers said. “It sounds like there’s already conversations going on that aren’t involving me, which are interesting.""

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796563,Minnesota governor signs broad abortion rights bill into law,"ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Gov. Tim Walz enshrined the right to abortion and other reproductive health care into Minnesota statutes Tuesday, signing a bill meant to ensure that the state's existing protections remain in place no matter who sits on future courts.

            Democratic leaders took advantage of their new control of both houses of the Legislature to rush the bill through in the first month of the 2023 legislative session. They credit the backlash against the U.S. Supreme Court decision last summer to reverse Roe v. Wade for their takeover of the state Senate and for keeping their House majority in a year when Republicans expected to make gains.

            “After last year's landmark election across this country, we're the first state to take legislative action to put these protections in place,” Walz said at a signing ceremony flanked by over 100 lawmakers, providers and other advocates who worked to pass the bill.











            Abortion rights were already protected under a 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court decision known as Doe v. Gomez, which held that the state Constitution protects abortion rights. And a district court judge last summer declared unconstitutional several restrictions that previous Legislatures had put in place, including a 24-hour waiting period and a parental notification requirement for minors.

            Opponents decried the bill as “extreme,” saying that it and other fast-tracked legislation will leave Minnesota with essentially no restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy. 

            The leaders of the Senate and House GOP minorities, Sen. Mark Johnson, of East Grand Forks, and Rep. Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, urged Walz in a letter Monday to veto the bill, saying the Democratic majorities rejected dozens of amendments that Republican lawmakers proposed as guardrails, including prohibitions on third-trimester abortions except to save the patient's life.

            But the White House welcomed Walz's signature on the bill, noting that Minnesota is the first state Legislature to codify protections into law this year. Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre noted that voters also turned out for ballot initiatives to defend access to abortion in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and Vermont.

            “While Congressional Republicans continue their support for extreme policies including a national abortion ban, the President and Vice President are calling on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law,"" Jean-Pierre said in a statement. ""Until then, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue its work to protect access to abortion and support state leaders in defending women’s reproductive rights.”

            While the new law will have little immediate further impact on access to abortion in Minnesota, the governor, legislative leaders and sponsors of the bill said it provides a critical new layer of protection in case the composition of the state courts someday changes, as it did on the U.S. Supreme Court before it struck down Roe v. Wade.

            “To Minnesotans, know that your access to reproductive health, and your right to make your own health care decisions, are preserved and protected,” Walz said. “And because of this law, that won't change with the political winds and the makeup of the Supreme Court.”

            The House passed the bill 69-65 less than two weeks ago, and party discipline held firm during a 15-hour debate in the Senate that ended in a 34-33 vote early Saturday.

            “Fundamentally this legislation is about who decides,” said House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park. “Who should be legally entitled to make reproductive health care decisions for an individual. ... It can't be decided by politicians. It can't be decided by judges.”

            Abortion is currently considered illegal at all stages of pregnancy, with various exceptions, in 13 states, including neighboring Wisconsin and South Dakota. Bans in several states, including neighboring North Dakota, remain on hold for the moment pending court challenges. Because of restrictions elsewhere, Minnesota has seen a surge of pregnant patients coming to the state for abortions. 

            Minnesota's new law is named the “PRO Act,” short for “Protect Reproductive Actions.” It establishes that “every individual has a fundamental right to make autonomous decisions about the individual’s own reproductive health” including abortion and contraception.

            There are other bills to protect abortion rights in the Legislature's pipeline as well, including one to delete the statutory restrictions that the district court declared unconstitutional last summer. It's meant to safeguard against those limits being reinstated if that ruling is overturned on appeal. Hortman said she expected House floor votes to approve them as early as next week.ST. PAUL, Minn.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796565,How will life change once the COVID-19 emergency ends?,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The declaration of a COVID-19 public health emergency three years ago changed the lives of millions of Americans by offering increased health care coverage, beefed-up food assistance and universal access to coronavirus vaccines and tests.

            Much of that is now coming to an end, with President Joe Biden's administration saying it plans to end the emergency declarations on May 11. 

            Here's a look at what will stay and what will go once the emergency order is lifted: 











            COVID-19 TESTS, TREATMENTS AND VACCINES

            The at-home nasal swabs, COVID-19 vaccines as well as their accompanying boosters, treatments and other products that scientists have developed over the last three years will still be authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration once the public health emergency is over. 

            But how much people pay for certain COVID-related products may change. 

            Insurers will no longer be required to cover the cost of free at-home COVID-19 tests. 

            Free vaccines, however, won't come to an end with the public health emergency. 

            ""There’s no one right now who cannot get a free vaccine or booster,"" said Cynthia Cox, vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Right now all the vaccines that are being administered are still the ones purchased by the federal government."" 

            But the Biden administration has said it is running out of money to buy up vaccines and Congress has not budged on the president's requests for more funding. 

            Many states expect they can make it through the spring and summer, but there are questions around what their vaccine supply will look like going into the fall — when respiratory illness typically start to spike, said Anne Zink, the president of the The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. 

            “We’re all anxious to find out more about that,” Zink said. 

            MEDICAID

            Medicaid enrollment ballooned during the pandemic, in part because the federal government prohibited states from removing people from the program during the public health emergency once they had enrolled. 

            The program offers health care coverage to roughly 90 million children and adults — or 1 out of every 4 Americans. 

            Late last year, Congress told states they could start removing ineligible people in April. Millions of people are expected to lose their coverage, either because they now make too much money to qualify for Medicare or they've moved. Many are expected to be eligible for low-cost insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act's private marketplace or their employer. 

            STUDENT LOANS

            Payments on federal student loans were halted in March 2020 under the Trump administration and have been on hold since. The Biden administration announced a plan to forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loan debts for individuals with incomes of less than $125,000 or households with incomes under $250,000. 

            But that forgiveness plan — which more than 26 million people have applied for — is on pause, thrown into legal limbo while awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court. 

            The Justice Department initially argued that the Secretary of Education has “sweeping authority” to waive rules relating to student financial aid during a national emergency, per the 2003 HEROES Act that was adopted during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

            A Biden administration official told The Associated Press Tuesday that ending the health emergencies will not change the legal argument for student loan debt cancellation, saying the COVID-19 pandemic affected millions of student borrowers who might have fallen behind on their loans during the emergency. 

            
                The pause on student loan payments is expected to end 60 days after the Supreme Court ruling.
              

            IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDER

            Border officials will still be able to deny people the right to seek asylum, a rule that was introduced in March 2020 as COVID-19 began its spread. 

            Those restrictions remain in place at the U.S.-Mexico border, pending a Supreme Court review, regardless of the COVID-19 emergency's expiration. Republican lawmakers sued after the Biden administration moved to end the restrictions, known as Title 42, last year. The Supreme Court kept the restrictions in place in December until it can weigh the arguments. 

            The end of the emergency may bolster the legal argument that the Title 42 restrictions should no longer be in place. The emergency restrictions fell under health regulations and have been criticized as a way to keep migrants from coming to the border, rather than to stop the spread of the virus. 

            TELEHEALTH

            COVID-19's arrival rapidly accelerated the use of telehealth, with many providers and hospital systems shifting their delivery of care to a smartphone or computer format. 

            The public health emergency declaration helped hasten that approach because it suspended some of the strict rules that had previously governed telehealth and allowed doctors to bill Medicare for care delivered virtually, encouraging hospital systems to invest more heavily in telehealth systems. 

            Congress has already agreed to extend many of those telehealth flexibilities for Medicare through the end of next year. 

            FOOD ASSISTANCE

            Relaxed rules during the COVID-19 public health emergency made it easier for individuals and families to receive a boost in benefits under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Some state and congressional action has started to wind down some of that. Emergency allotments — typically about $82 a month, according to the Food Research and Action Center — will come to an end as soon as March in more than two dozen states.

            Food help for unemployed adults, under the age of 50 and without children, will also change after the public health emergency is lifted in May. During the emergency declaration, a rule that required those individuals to work or participate in job training for 20 hours per week to remain eligible for SNAP benefits was suspended. That rule will be in place again starting in June. SNAP aid for more low-income college students will also draw down in June. 

            STATE COVID EMERGENCIES

            At least a half-dozen states — including California, Delaware, Illinois, New Mexico, Rhode Island and Texas — have some form of COVID emergency declaration or disaster order still in place. But those orders have limited practical effect.

            New Mexico’s public health emergency, which has been extended through Friday, advised health care facilities to abide by federal coronavirus requirements. Delaware has continued to operate under a “public health emergency,” which has suspended staffing ratios in long-term care facilities.

            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has said his emergency order will end Feb. 28. Newsom has issued 596 specific orders, from stay-at-home mandates to tax-filing extensions, during the pandemic. Most have expired, but he plans to ask lawmakers make two into permanent laws — one letting nurses order and dispense COVID-19 medication and another allowing lab workers to solely process coronavirus tests.

            MONEY FOR HOSPITALS

            Hospitals will take a big financial hit in May, when the emergency comes to an end. They'll no longer get an extra 20% for treating COVID-19 patients who are on Medicare. 

            The end to those payments comes at a time when many hospitals are under financial pressure, struggling with workforce shortages and dealing with the pain of inflation, said Stacey Hughes, the executive vice president at the American Hospitals Association. 

            —

            Associated Press writers JoNel Aleccia in Los Angeles, Colleen Long and Seung Min Kim in Washington and David Lieb, in Jefferson City, Missouri, contributed to this report.WASHINGTON (AP) — The declaration of a COVID-19 public health emergency three years ago changed the lives of millions of Americans by offering increased health care coverage, beefed-up food assistance and universal access to coronavirus vaccines and tests.Much of that is now coming to an end, with President Joe Biden's administration saying it plans to end the emergency declarations on May 11.Here's a look at what will stay and what will go once the emergency order is lifted:COVID-19 TESTS, TREATMENTS AND VACCINESThe at-home nasal swabs, COVID-19 vaccines as well as their accompanying boosters, treatments and other products that scientists have developed over the last three years will still be authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration once the public health emergency is over.But how much people pay for certain COVID-related products may change.Insurers will no longer be required to cover the cost of free at-home COVID-19 tests.Free vaccines, however, won't come to an end with the public health emergency.""There’s no one right now who cannot get a free vaccine or booster,"" said Cynthia Cox, vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Right now all the vaccines that are being administered are still the ones purchased by the federal government.""But the Biden administration has said it is running out of money to buy up vaccines and Congress has not budged on the president's requests for more funding.Many states expect they can make it through the spring and summer, but there are questions around what their vaccine supply will look like going into the fall — when respiratory illness typically start to spike, said Anne Zink, the president of the The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.“We’re all anxious to find out more about that,” Zink said.MEDICAIDMedicaid enrollment ballooned during the pandemic, in part because the federal government prohibited states from removing people from the program during the public health emergency once they had enrolled.The program offers health care coverage to roughly 90 million children and adults — or 1 out of every 4 Americans.Late last year, Congress told states they could start removing ineligible people in April. Millions of people are expected to lose their coverage, either because they now make too much money to qualify for Medicare or they've moved. Many are expected to be eligible for low-cost insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act's private marketplace or their employer.STUDENT LOANSPayments on federal student loans were halted in March 2020 under the Trump administration and have been on hold since. The Biden administration announced a plan to forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loan debts for individuals with incomes of less than $125,000 or households with incomes under $250,000.But that forgiveness plan — which more than 26 million people have applied for — is on pause, thrown into legal limbo while awaiting a ruling from the Supreme Court.The Justice Department initially argued that the Secretary of Education has “sweeping authority” to waive rules relating to student financial aid during a national emergency, per the 2003 HEROES Act that was adopted during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.A Biden administration official told The Associated Press Tuesday that ending the health emergencies will not change the legal argument for student loan debt cancellation, saying the COVID-19 pandemic affected millions of student borrowers who might have fallen behind on their loans during the emergency.The pause on student loan payments is expected to end 60 days after the Supreme Court ruling.IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDERBorder officials will still be able to deny people the right to seek asylum, a rule that was introduced in March 2020 as COVID-19 began its spread.Those restrictions remain in place at the U.S.-Mexico border, pending a Supreme Court review, regardless of the COVID-19 emergency's expiration. Republican lawmakers sued after the Biden administration moved to end the restrictions, known as Title 42, last year. The Supreme Court kept the restrictions in place in December until it can weigh the arguments.The end of the emergency may bolster the legal argument that the Title 42 restrictions should no longer be in place. The emergency restrictions fell under health regulations and have been criticized as a way to keep migrants from coming to the border, rather than to stop the spread of the virus.TELEHEALTHCOVID-19's arrival rapidly accelerated the use of telehealth, with many providers and hospital systems shifting their delivery of care to a smartphone or computer format.The public health emergency declaration helped hasten that approach because it suspended some of the strict rules that had previously governed telehealth and allowed doctors to bill Medicare for care delivered virtually, encouraging hospital systems to invest more heavily in telehealth systems.Congress has already agreed to extend many of those telehealth flexibilities for Medicare through the end of next year.FOOD ASSISTANCERelaxed rules during the COVID-19 public health emergency made it easier for individuals and families to receive a boost in benefits under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Some state and congressional action has started to wind down some of that. Emergency allotments — typically about $82 a month, according to the Food Research and Action Center — will come to an end as soon as March in more than two dozen states.Food help for unemployed adults, under the age of 50 and without children, will also change after the public health emergency is lifted in May. During the emergency declaration, a rule that required those individuals to work or participate in job training for 20 hours per week to remain eligible for SNAP benefits was suspended.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796568,MATCHDAY: United aims to reach cup final; PSG without Neymar,"A look at what’s happening in European soccer on Wednesday:

            ENGLAND

            Manchester United's place in the League Cup final looks to be assured ahead of the second leg against Nottingham Forest in the semifinals. United won 3-0 away in the first leg last week. In its first season under manager Erik ten Hag, the team is looking to end a trophy drought stretching back to 2017. United won the League Cup that year, as well as the Europa League. United will be without midfielder Christian Eriksen, who could miss most of the remainder of the season because of an ankle injury sustained against Reading in the FA Cup on Saturday.











            FRANCE

            Neymar won’t travel to Montpellier with his Paris Saint-Germain teammates in the French league because of “muscular fatigue."" Neymar opened the scoring in PSG’s 1-1 draw with Reims at the Parc des Princes over the weekend but missed training on Tuesday to receive treatment, PSG said. The French champions have won only one of their last four league games, losing two, seeing their lead over second-place Lens cut to three points. Lens hosts Nice and third-place Marseille travels to Nantes. 

            ITALY

            Cremonese will be hoping to continue its run of upsets in the Italian Cup when it plays at Roma looking to reach the semifinals for only the second time in its history. Cremonese, rock bottom of Serie A, beat league leader Napoli in the previous round to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since 1997. The winner will face either Fiorentina or Torino, which face each other less than two weeks after Torino won in Tuscany in the league.

            SPAIN

            Spanish league leader Barcelona visits sixth-place Real Betis in a match postponed because of the teams' participation in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia in January. Barcelona defeated Betis in a penalty shootout in the semifinals before eventually winning the final against Real Madrid. Barcelona has won five in a row in all competitions, as well as all of its last five away matches against Betis in the Spanish league. Betis, 16 points behind Barcelona in the league, has won one of its last four games across all tournaments. It is three points behind fourth-place Atletico Madrid in the final Champions League place.

            GERMANY

            João Cancelo could make his debut for Bayern Munich against Mainz in the German Cup after signing from Manchester City and midfielder Leon Goretzka is set to return from injury. Bayern hasn't reached the German Cup quarterfinals since the 2019-20 season, an unfamiliar blip in its dominance of domestic soccer. After three consecutive 1-1 draws to start 2022, Bayern needs to step things up in this round of 16 game against Mainz, which is fresh off a 5-2 win over Bochum in the Bundesliga. Last season's cup winner Leipzig is on a run of 16 games unbeaten in all competitions as the title defense continues against Hoffenheim, which hasn't had a win since October.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796569,Tech industry job cuts come rapidly and in big numbers,"In just the past month there have been nearly 50,000 job cuts across the technology sector. Large and small tech companies went on a hiring spree in over the past several years due to a demand for their products, software and services surged with millions of people working remotely. However, even with all of the layoffs announced in recent weeks, most tech companies are still vastly larger than they were three years ago. Here’s a look at some of the companies that have announced layoffs so far.

            August 2022

            
                Snap: The parent company of social media platform Snapchat said that it was letting go of 20% of its staff. Snap’s staff has grown to more than 5,600 employees in recent years and the company said at the time that even after laying off more than 1,000 people, its staff would be larger than it was a year earlier.











            
                Robinhood: The company, whose app helped bring a new generation of investors to the market, announced that it would reduce headcount by about 23%, or approximately 780 people. An earlier round of layoffs last year cut 9% of its workforce.

            November 2022

            
                Twitter: About half of the social media platform’s staff of 7,500 was let go after it was acquired by the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk.

            
                Lyft: The ride-hailing service said it was cutting 13% of its workforce, almost 700 employees.

            
                Meta: The parent company of Facebook laid off 11,000 people, about 13% of its workforce.

            January 2023

            
                Amazon: The e-commerce company said it must cut about 18,000 positions. That’s just a fraction of its 1.5 million-strong global workforce.

            
                Salesforce: The company lays off 10% of its workforce, about 8,000 employees.

            
                Coinbase: The cryptocurrency trading platform cuts approximately 20% of its workforce, or about 950 jobs, in a second round of layoffs in less than a year.

            
                Microsoft: The software company said it will cut about 10,000 jobs, almost 5% of its workforce.

            
                Google: The search engine giant becomes the most recent in the industry to say it must adjust, saying 12,000 workers, or about 6% of its workforce, would be let go.

            
                Spotify: The music streaming service is cutting 6% of its global workforce. It did not give a specific number of job losses. Spotify reported in its latest annual report that it had about 6,600 employees, which implies that 400 jobs are being axed.

            
                SAP: Germany-based SAP, Europe's biggest software company, said it it cutting up to 3,000 jobs worldwide, or about 2.5% of its workforce, after a shop drop in profits. 

            
                PayPal: The digital payments company says it will trim about 7% of its total workforce, or about 2,000 full-time workers, as it contends with a challenging environment.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796570,"Homa good at golf, good talking about it during CBS telecast","PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — “Max, can you hear me?”

            Lead analyst Trevor Immelman was in the broadcast booth talking to Max Homa, who had just hit his drive on the par-5 13th at Torrey Pines. Homa was listening through an earbud.

            And with that, the PGA Tour and CBS embarked on a new wrinkle in their telecast Friday.











            Just don’t get the idea this happened on the fly.

            Homa said he had been talking about the plan with CBS and with Andy Pazder, the tour’s chief of operations. And while it may not be for everybody, Homa proved to be the perfect fit.

            “I’m very excited about the idea,” Homa said after his two-shot victory. “I thought it was great for the fans to look into, push that envelope for the fans. Not just myself, but the tour — CBS, NBC, all these broadcasting streams — seem to be wanting to add something to the viewing experience.”

            For years, some players have balked at the idea of wearing microphones, and the networks have boom mics on the course, anyway. On other tours, the conversation has come across as stilted.

            Not every tour has the benefit of Homa, who delivers refreshing insight without really trying.

            The question was how he chose to shape the shot off the tee. Homa typically plays a cut, and the par 5 moves from right to left.

            “My coach and caddie let me draw one maybe once a day, maybe once a week,” Homa said. “This was not the one.”

            From there, he went on to explain his approach to going for the green on a par 5, mainly about the ideal position for the third shot.

            Homa has heard chatter, like everyone else, that networks could never get someone as intense as Tiger Woods or Jon Rahm to go along. So it might not work for everyone. But it did for him, regardless of the outcome.

            “It was 20 minutes. It was not invasive,” he said. “I’m hoping other players would want to do it. ... I’m sure there’s some interest in this whether I won or didn’t. Hopefully we can kind of keep pushing that or tweak it, just anything to help golf kind of gain some attraction to all the viewers hopefully a little bit younger than our typical audience.”

            PEBBLE PAYBACK

            Jason Dufner is in the field at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making him the first — and so far, the only — player to make good on his pledge for getting a conflicting event release to play the Saudi International last year.

            PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan granted some two dozen releases for the Saudi International (held the same week as Pebble), provided they agree to play Pebble Beach at least once over the next two years.

            Nineteen players who sought releases now are part of LIV Golf.

            According to the PGA Tour, Tony Finau, Tommy Fleetwood, Shane Lowry, Xander Schauffele and Jhonattan Vegas each received releases provided they played Pebble once over the next two years. That means they are required to play in 2024.

            Tyrrell Hatton and Lucas Herbert would be required to play in 2024 and 2025. Herbert is in the Saudi International field again this year.

            Monahan said in January the same arrangement was in place for this year’s releases, which include Cameron Young and Cameron Champ. The tour has not said what penalty would apply if players did not live up to the arrangement.

            NEXT UP FOR LIV

            The Daily Telegraph is reporting that Sebastian Munoz of Colombia is the latest player to join Saudi-backed LIV Golf, after previously reporting Mito Pereira of Chile was joining.

            Both are in the Saudi International field this week, even though neither PGA Tour member requested a conflicting event release to play (as was the case for the likes of Cameron Young and Cameron Champ).

            More evidence on Pereira — he is listed in the field next week for the Asian Tour's International Series stop in Oman, electing to pass on the $20 million purse at the WM Phoenix Open.

            LIV Golf has not officially announced new additions to its league, which starts next month at Mayakoba in Mexico.

            HOGE'S DECISION

            Tom Hoge was not on the Saudis' radar screen until he won at Pebble Beach last year for his first career title. While the offer to join LIV Golf was not what Hoge described as generational wealth, it was enough for him to consider it.

            Ultimately, he chose to stay, with no regrets. Hoge now is No. 29 in the world, eligible for all the majors for the second straight year. The deciding factor was places he hadn't been and had access to through his win at Pebble.

            “There were so many tournaments I’ve wanted to play in the first time,” he said, citing the Tour Championship and the Sentry Tournament of Champions at Kapalua as examples. “When I went to bed at night, I wasn't ready to give those up.”

            But money is money, especially when it's guaranteed. Hoge has spent a career trying to make sure he made it to the next year, and securing a financial future was tempting.

            “It was a hard decision to make, but I’m very happy with where I’m at,” Hoge said.

            PAC MEMBERS

            It took Adam Scott some 20 years on the PGA Tour before he agreed to join the Player Advisory Council, which advises the PGA Tour board on competition matters. And he wasn’t alone.

            The full 16-member PAC includes Rickie Fowler (in his 14th year on the PGA Tour), along with four players who are among the top 15 in the world ranking — Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, Will Zalatoris, Max Homa and Sam Burns.

            “I think you’ve seen kind of more players become more involved in stuff with the tour in the past year,” Scheffler said. “I think with LIV, that’s kind of an obvious deal that we had to make a few changes in order to improve our tour in a different way.

            ""For me, having an opportunity to be on the PAC and talk with guys across all different levels of our tour — whether it’s a guy finishing 100th on the money list or first — it’s kind of nice to be in the room and have those conversations and figure out what is collectively going to work best for all of us so that this tour can succeed.”

            Scott, meanwhile, joins Maverick McNealy and Kevin Streelman on the ballot to determine who will be PAC chairman and eventually moves to the full PGA Tour board. The election ends Feb. 13.

            Scott Brown made the cut on the Korn Ferry Tour in the Bahamas on a Monday (he was tied for 34th), withdrew and made the cut on the PGA Tour at Torrey Pines on Friday. He finished 72nd at Torrey Pines and made $17,487. That's roughly the equivalent of finishing 14th on the Korn Ferry Tour.

            FINAL WORD

            “Sometimes you’re just one good swing thought away from being good again.” — Max Homa.

            ___

            AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) — “Max, can you hear me?”Lead analyst Trevor Immelman was in the broadcast booth talking to Max Homa, who had just hit his drive on the par-5 13th at Torrey Pines. Homa was listening through an earbud.And with that, the PGA Tour and CBS embarked on a new wrinkle in their telecast Friday.Just don’t get the idea this happened on the fly.Homa said he had been talking about the plan with CBS and with Andy Pazder, the tour’s chief of operations. And while it may not be for everybody, Homa proved to be the perfect fit.“I’m very excited about the idea,” Homa said after his two-shot victory. “I thought it was great for the fans to look into, push that envelope for the fans. Not just myself, but the tour — CBS, NBC, all these broadcasting streams — seem to be wanting to add something to the viewing experience.”For years, some players have balked at the idea of wearing microphones, and the networks have boom mics on the course, anyway. On other tours, the conversation has come across as stilted.Not every tour has the benefit of Homa, who delivers refreshing insight without really trying.The question was how he chose to shape the shot off the tee. Homa typically plays a cut, and the par 5 moves from right to left.“My coach and caddie let me draw one maybe once a day, maybe once a week,” Homa said. “This was not the one.”From there, he went on to explain his approach to going for the green on a par 5, mainly about the ideal position for the third shot.Homa has heard chatter, like everyone else, that networks could never get someone as intense as Tiger Woods or Jon Rahm to go along. So it might not work for everyone. But it did for him, regardless of the outcome.“It was 20 minutes. It was not invasive,” he said. “I’m hoping other players would want to do it. ... I’m sure there’s some interest in this whether I won or didn’t. Hopefully we can kind of keep pushing that or tweak it, just anything to help golf kind of gain some attraction to all the viewers hopefully a little bit younger than our typical audience.”PEBBLE PAYBACKJason Dufner is in the field at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, making him the first — and so far, the only — player to make good on his pledge for getting a conflicting event release to play the Saudi International last year.PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan granted some two dozen releases for the Saudi International (held the same week as Pebble), provided they agree to play Pebble Beach at least once over the next two years.Nineteen players who sought releases now are part of LIV Golf.According to the PGA Tour, Tony Finau, Tommy Fleetwood, Shane Lowry, Xander Schauffele and Jhonattan Vegas each received releases provided they played Pebble once over the next two years. That means they are required to play in 2024.Tyrrell Hatton and Lucas Herbert would be required to play in 2024 and 2025.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796571,Reich's offensive background helped him land Carolina job,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper said Frank Reich’s strong and qualified background as an offensive-minded coach is one of the primary reasons he hired him as the team’s new head coach.

            And, ultimately, one of the reasons the Panthers passed on bringing back interim head coach Steve Wilks, who comes from a defensive background.

            “Every year we get in these NFL (owners) meetings and every year they put some new rule in to benefit the offense — every single year,” Tepper said. “Every single year, and it’s never going to end. Every year. And the reason is that scoring brings eyeballs.”











            The Panthers hope Reich can help them capitalize on the offense-focused rules.

            Reich, who was introduced at a news conference on Tuesday five days after the team announced his hire, becomes the first Panthers head coach with an offensive background.

            He spent 14 seasons as an NFL quarterback, then worked his way up through the ranks as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator, winning a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles five years ago, before becoming head coach of the Indianapolis Colts in 2018. 

            Tepper said he didn't want to make the same “mistake” as he did in 2020 when he hired Matt Rhule, whom he classified as a “CEO type” coach.

            Rhule's tenure in Carolina didn't last long. He was fired just five games into his third season after going 11-27.

            “It’s preferable to have a coach that is really extraordinary on one side of the ball or the other side of the ball,” Tepper said. ""And we think Frank is really good on offense.”

            Wilks became an extremely popular figure in the Carolina locker room this past season, going 6-6 down the stretch after taking over a team that was 1-5 under Rhule and had just traded its best offensive player in Christian McCaffrey.

            But it wasn't enough to give him the full-time job.

            Tepper personally interviewed four different NFL offensive coordinators before settling on Reich.

            Reich wouldn’t confirm he plans to call plays in Carolina, but it sounds as if that's his preference. 

            “Obviously I've always enjoyed doing that, and felt like I’ve had a good bit of success doing that,” Reich said.

            “When you have a head coach who has played the position, he knows what looking through that lens of a quarterback looks like,” Panthers general manager Scott Fitterer said. “He knows what processing looks like, how to call games through that eye. So there are a lot of advantages to having an offensive head coach.""

            Tepper and Fitterer said what set Reich apart from other candidates was that he'd locked in on quality assistant coaches to join his staff — although the Panthers have yet to announce any of those hires.

            Tepper, a multibillionaire hedge fund owner, is a strong believer that you're only as good as your supporting cast.

            “He was the one who stood out clearest to vet the very best coaches we can have to help this team be as successful as we can be,"" Tepper said. ""... Everybody presented who they had and what they were thinking to help us win in the future, and we made the decision based on that.”

            Reich has his work cut out for him moving forward.

            The Panthers are 29-53 since Tepper purchased the team and haven't won a playoff game since 2015.

            Carolina's defense is solid, but it has no clear-cut answer at quarterback. Sam Darnold, who has been so-so over the past two seasons, is set to become an unrestricted free agent and P.J. Walker and Matt Corral, who missed his rookie season with an injury, are the other quarterbacks on the roster.

            Still, Reich remains optimistic.

            He likes the team's offensive line and running game behind D'Onta Foreman, but said the Panthers need to find a better way of creating chunk plays in the passing game. The Panthers finished 29th in the league in passing.

            For Reich, the return to Carolina is a bit of a homecoming.

            He started the first game for the Panthers in 1995. A handful of Reich's teammates from that expansion team attended the news conference, including Pete Metzelaars, John Kasay and Carlton Bailey.

            Reich talked to the crowd about building a winner.

            He harkened back to a saying he learned early in his football career and still keeps on his desk at home: “That no man becomes suddenly different from his habits and cherished thoughts.”

            “We are going to be a team that is about creating championships habits, championship thoughts,"" Reich said. ""We are going to cultivate those, we are going to nurture those and as they grow and they are going to be infectious.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796572,NASCAR bans Chastain's wall-hugging move at Martinsville,"NASCAR has essentially banned the “Hail Melon” video-game move driver Ross Chastain used at Martinsville Speedway to race his way into the championship finale.

            Chastain last year mashed the gas and deliberately smashed into the wall so that the energy would speed his car past his rivals. The move advanced him into NASCAR's title-deciding final race on the final of the four spots, and was lauded by motorsports figures globally. 

            But his fellow NASCAR competitors thought Chastain's trick was both dangerous and not in the spirit of fair competition. NASCAR on Tuesday said the wall-hugging, jaw-dropping pass Chastain made on the final lap will be a penalty in 2023.











            “Not a new rule,” said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR’s vice president of competition. “I think we all remember the last-lap move at Martinsville in the fall. Brought a great deal of excitement, a great deal of exposure to our sport. But it also came with some scrutiny.”

            NASCAR cited rule 10.5.2.6.A, which states “any violations deemed to compromise the safety of an event or otherwise pose a dangerous risk to the safety of competitors, officials, spectators or others are treated with the highest degree of seriousness.”

            Sawyer said there was internal discussion about needing to “do something,” but NASCAR waited until after the season to collaborate, study data and dig into the rulebook.

            “This is not new language,” he said. “Basically if there’s an act that we feel that’s compromising the safety of our competitors, officials, spectators, we’re going to take that seriously. We will penalize for that act going forward. Basically it would be a lap or time penalty at the end of the race. That move at Martinsville would be a penalty in 2023.”

            Chastain was on the verge of playoff elimination when he harkened to a racing move he used on GameCube with his brother, Chad, as a kid. He plastered his car against the outside wall, let go of the steering wheel and pushed the pedal to the floor.

            It worked just like it did in the video game. Suddenly, on the final half-lap at the Martinsville short track, Chastain’s car looked as if it was turned up to hyper-speed while everyone else was poking along.

            Going at least 50 mph faster than everyone else, he passed five cars in a matter of seconds to claim the final spot in the title race. 

            He finished second to Joey Logano in the championship finale in Phoenix.

            Other notable changes for NASCAR’s Cup Series in 2023:

            — Losing a wheel will no longer be a four-race suspension to the crew chief and two crew members. It will be a two-race suspension for two crew members if it happens beyond pit road. 

            — There will no longer be stage breaks at road courses. NASCAR will still award points at the end of stages, only without the artificial caution. 

            — NASCAR will give teams seven minutes on pit road to work on their cars if they are damaged in an accident. It was six minutes last year before being increased to 10 minutes for the Cup playoffs.

             — Restart zones will be increased by 50% — 25% more room before the start/finish line and 25% more at the end. The rule change goes into effect for the first five events of the season and will be reevaluated from there.

            — NASCAR removed the top-30-in-points requirement for drivers trying to make the playoffs. Drivers will still be required to participate in every event unless granted a waiver (typically for an injury).

            — Mufflers will be used in the season-opening Clash, an exhibition race that will take place at the Los Angeles Coliseum for the season straight year. Mufflers will reduce engine noise and create an atmosphere better suited for fan conversations.

            — NASCAR tweaked language in its rulebook to mandate fire-retardant underclothing from the neck to the wrists to the ankles. It had previously been recommended.

            — NASCAR will use new recording systems in cars that will provide more powerful crash data. It’s a significant upgrade from the black box technology first used in 2002 following Dale Earnhardt’s death at Daytona International Speedway.

            — NASCAR will have a “large increase” in the number of drivers who will wear mouth-piece sensors at races. They were not available at every event in 2022 but will be beginning in 2023. Data recorders measure what cars experience; this would provide data directly from drivers and what they go through during races, specifically in crashes.

            — NASCAR officially designated eight locations at which wet-weather packages (rain tires) will be available in 2023: the LA Coliseum (the Clash), Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis, Martinsville, Milwaukee, New Hampshire, North Wilkesboro (All-Star race), Phoenix and Richmond. NASCAR will have “rain” tires and teams will be required to have windshield wiper hookups and rear lights in case NASCAR wants to race in damp conditions for the Clash, Martinsville, New Hampshire, North Wilkesboro, Phoenix and Richmond .

Data recorders measure what cars experience; this would provide data directly from drivers and what they go through during races, specifically in crashes.— NASCAR officially designated eight locations at which wet-weather packages (rain tires) will be available in 2023: the LA Coliseum (the Clash), Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis, Martinsville, Milwaukee, New Hampshire, North Wilkesboro (All-Star race), Phoenix and Richmond. NASCAR will have “rain” tires and teams will be required to have windshield wiper hookups and rear lights in case NASCAR wants to race in damp conditions for the Clash, Martinsville, New Hampshire, North Wilkesboro, Phoenix and Richmond .___More AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",2023/02/01,,World

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796575,Lawmakers aim to raise penalties for US airline disruptions,"Senators who want to impose tougher penalties when U.S. airlines strand or delay passengers say they finally might be able to turn their ideas into law because of outrage over debacles like the one at Southwest Airlines in December.

            Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Tuesday they will again offer a “passenger bill of rights” that would, among other things, allow customers to file class-action lawsuits against airlines, and legislation to limit airline fees.

            A trade group for the largest U.S. airlines issued a blistering attack on the legislation.











            Both the passenger-rights and airline-fee proposals from longtime critics of the airline industry have floundered in the past, and they lack Republican support so far in the new Congress. But the lawmakers argue that they can succeed this time by attaching their ideas to must-pass legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.

            Southwest canceled 16,700 flights in late December, likely affecting travel plans for about 2 million people, when it took more than a week to recover from a winter storm. Crew-scheduling technology — which got less attention from Southwest leaders than other technology spending — was overwhelmed, leaving planes, pilots and flight attendants out of position for days.

            The U.S. Transportation Department is investigating the meltdown, which has made Southwest the butt of jokes on TV shows including “Saturday Night Live.”

            The disaster will cost Southwest about $1.1 billion by the airline's own reckoning, but the disruptions accounted for a small part of the 210,000 U.S. flights that airlines canceled in 2022. The rate of cancellations surged 52% from 2021.

            “The airlines need to be given some incentives to do the right thing, and consumers need protection,” Blumenthal told reporters. 

            Southwest did not respond to a request for comment, but a spokeswoman for trade group Airlines for America said the industry is a highly competitive one that benefits consumers.

            “This bill undermines and eliminates decades of successful policies that have transformed air travel, allowing the vast majority of Americans to take flight,” said the spokeswoman, Marli Collier. “The proposed policies in this bill — instituting government-controlled pricing, establishing a private right of action and dictating private sector contracts — would drastically decrease competition, leading to a subsequent increase in airfare prices and potential cut in services to small and rural communities.”

            Blumenthal's proposal would set $1,350 as the minimum compensation for passengers bumped off oversold flights. It would require airlines to provide alternate transportation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs to customers whose flights are delayed as briefly as one hour — Southwest says it is reimbursing stranded passengers for “reasonable” hotel and meal expenses. 

            The bill would also allow consumers to file class-action lawsuits and eliminate caps on fines the government can levy for airlines that violate consumer-protection laws.

            “If Southwest faced these kinds of potential penalties and consumer class-action, it might have updated its IT systems,” he said.

            Markey proposes separately to limit fees to what it costs the airline to provide the service.

            Both proposals have failed to gain traction in previous years. Blumenthal said things are different now because of the increase in disruptions by airlines that received tens of billions of dollars in pandemic relief from taxpayers.

            There is precedent for attaching passenger provisions to FAA reauthorization bills. The last one, in 2018, included a directive for the government to set minimum standards for airline seats, although there has been little progress on that front.

            And airlines have prevailed in other fights. Also in 2018, they successfully lobbied Congress to drop a provision that would have let the government decide whether airline fees for things like checking bags and assigning seats are reasonable.Senators who want to impose tougher penalties when U.S. airlines strand or delay passengers say they finally might be able to turn their ideas into law because of outrage over debacles like the one at Southwest Airlines in December.Democrats Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Edward Markey of Massachusetts said Tuesday they will again offer a “passenger bill of rights” that would, among other things, allow customers to file class-action lawsuits against airlines, and legislation to limit airline fees.A trade group for the largest U.S. airlines issued a blistering attack on the legislation.Both the passenger-rights and airline-fee proposals from longtime critics of the airline industry have floundered in the past, and they lack Republican support so far in the new Congress.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796577,"Biden, McCarthy, once breakfast mates, wrangle over US debt","WASHINGTON (AP) — Not so long ago, Joe Biden and Republican leader Kevin McCarthy used to talk things over at breakfast in Biden's vice presidential home at the Naval Observatory. 

            Biden was intent in those days on “keeping up relations with the opposition party,” as he writes in his memoir, and the new House majority leader often arrived with fellow GOP lawmakers in tow.

            But now, with a potential national debt crisis l ooming, those morning meetings in 2015 seem a political lifetime ago as Democratic President Biden and McCarthy, the new House speaker, prepare for their first official meeting Wednesday at the White House.











            “You know, when I met with him as the vice president, he was always eager to sit down and talk,” McCarthy recalled to The Associated Press ahead of the meeting. “He was always a person who would like to try to find solutions, work together.” 

            Biden has signaled no such open-ended hospitality this time as newly emboldened House Republicans court a risky debt ceiling showdown.

            At a fundraiser Tuesday in New York, Biden called McCarthy a “decent man” who was being pulled by demands from restive Republicans.

            “He made commitments that are just absolutely off the wall"" in order to win the speaker's gavel, Biden said.

            Two affable leaders known for their willingness to strike deals, Biden and McCarthy find themselves charging headlong into uncomfortable political terrain in hardball negotiations over the nation's debt limit.

            A generation apart — McCarthy, 58, has been in Congress just a third of the time that Biden, 80, has held elected office — the two men are deeply familiar with the ways of Washington and positions of power. 

            Both have built political brands on their ability to meet with all comers, forging deals where none seemed likely. They've shown mutual respect during their limited interactions in Biden's presidency, according to one senior White House official. And both have been here before, veterans of the last fiscal showdown, in 2011, when Biden, as vice president to Barack Obama, tried to negotiate an endgame to a standoff with McCarthy's predecessors in Congress.

            The political as well as economic stakes are apparent this time as Biden considers another run for the White House and McCarthy strains to keep his new job as speaker of the House, including its right-flank Republicans.

            “Just like in 2011, it's not going to be real kumbaya,” said Neil Bradley, vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a former top aide to former House GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor. Bradley, who was part of earlier Biden talks, said, “These are both seasoned leaders who understand what it takes to get things done in Washington.”

            
                Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has notified Congress that it will need to raise the debt ceiling, now set at $31 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay the nation’s already accrued bills. While the Treasury Department has been able to launch “extraordinary measures” to temporarily avoid a debt default, that's only expected to last until June.

            The debt ceiling showdown carries echoes, but also differences, from 2011, when the House Republican “tea party” majority rose to power, demanding budget cuts and threatening a potentially catastrophic federal debt default. 

            Recalling those difficult negotiations, Biden has been reluctant to negotiate with the new House Republicans under McCarthy. Ahead of Wednesday's meeting, the White House released a memo outlining the “two questions” Biden will pose to the Republican leader.

            “Will the speaker commit to the bedrock principle that the United States will never default on its financial obligations?” reads one of the questions, in part. And: “When will Speaker McCarthy and House Republicans release their Budget?”

            The memo, from White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and Shalanda Young, the Office of Management and Budget director, noted that Biden will be releasing the administration's budget on March 9 — notably blowing past a February deadline — and called on McCarthy to detail precisely how Republicans would cut the government spending that they insist is too high.

            McCarthy all but invited himself to the White House as he pushed for the meeting with Biden. And he has made it clear he is willing to bargain, announcing over the weekend he will not be proposing cuts to Medicare or Social Security as Republicans try to slash federal spending as part of any debt ceiling deal.

            While McCarthy comes to the negotiating table with the power of the new House majority behind him, he is also viewed as coming somewhat empty-handed. 

            It's not at all clear the new speaker will be able to deliver the votes needed from divided Republicans in Congress on any debt deal. He has promised his GOP hardliners a return to fiscal 2022 spending levels, but even that might not be enough budget cutting for some of them.

            It's a potential repeat of the 2011-12 fiscal showdown, when the Obama administration negotiated with Republicans before finally settling on a deal that Biden negotiated with the Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to ease the crisis.

            “We’re all behind Kevin, wishing him well in the negotiations,” McConnell said Tuesday, his own Senate Republicans in the minority.

            “The deal has to be cut, obviously, between the House majority and the Democratic president, in order for it to have a chance to survive over here.”

            Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., said that Biden and McCarthy “don’t have the historic relationship that Senator McConnell and Biden have had through the years, but I do think circumstances necessitate and dictate at times that people have to come together -- whether they like it or not.”

            Like the Republicans, Democrats are skeptical of dealing with the opposing party. They're pushing Biden to drive a hardline bargain against any trade-offs.

            Congressional Progressive Caucus Chairwoman Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Biden “has seen over the last two years who he’s negotiating with — these are not people who are actually about negotiating something that makes sense for the working people.”

            The president, she added, has been “such a champion of working people and reversing inequality” that any budget-slashing deal with Republicans ""would reverse all of that work.”

            Refusal to negotiate with Republicans has been off-brand for Biden, who has championed his decades of experience in building relationships with lawmakers, governors and administrations of both parties. 

            In many ways, Biden and McCarthy are picking up where they left off from those breakfast meetings.

            “I think he’ll start by listening more than he talks, by getting to know Speaker McCarthy a little bit more as a person and by exploring what their common priorities might be,"" said Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close ally of the president. 

            Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a former history professor, said of the two: “They're career public servants. They're both intensely political. I think they’re both hail-well-met fellows. It seems to me that they'll have a reasonably good discussion.”

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796578,"Big 12 releases 14-team sked with 4 new teams, Texas and OU","IRVING, Texas (AP) — The Big 12 released its long-anticipated 14-team football schedule Tuesday, which includes its four new members for 2023 along with Oklahoma and Texas before their eventual departures to the Southeastern Conference.

            Houston will be the first of the new teams to play a conference game, in Week 3 when the Cougars host former Southwest Conference rival and national champion runner-up TCU in the only league game Sept. 16. The other newcomers play their Big 12 openers the following week, when BYU is at Kansas, Central Florida goes to defending champion Kansas State, and Cincinnati hosts Oklahoma.

            After playing a round-robin schedule as a 10-team league since 2011, the Big 12 will still have a nine-game conference schedule without divisions. But there will now be four league teams that each school will not play during the regular season. The two finishers in the conference standings will play in the Big 12 title game.











            First-year Big 12 commissioner Brett Yormark had said before the Big 12 championship game on Dec. 3 that he expected the schedule to be released in mid-December. It finally came out on the final day of January.

            “I would like to thank our fans for their patience awaiting this historic schedule,” Yormark said. “Given its importance, the complexities of weaving in four new schools, adding a third time zone and aligning with key stakeholders we were very deliberate with its development.”

            Oklahoma and Texas will move to the SEC no later than the 2025 season, though it is still uncertain if that could happen by 2024. The Sooners and Longhorns play their annual Red River rivalry game Oct. 7 at the State Fair of Texas. Each has four conference home games and four road games outside of that.

            BYU is the only of the four new teams that will play both Texas and Oklahoma this season, going to Austin on Oct. 28 and hosting the Sooners on Nov. 18. The Cougars also play only one of their fellow newcomers, hosting Cincinnati for a Friday night game on Sept. 29.

            Cincinnati is the only of the new quartet that will play each of the other three teams. The Bearcats host UCF and then go to Houston on the first two Saturdays in November.

            Texas, which goes to Alabama on Sept. 9, plays at Houston on Oct. 21 in the first meeting between the former SWC rivals since 2002. The Longhorns host BYU the week after that. They don't play UCF, Cincinnati, Oklahoma State or West Virginia in conference play.

            In addition to its trip to Cincinnati in Week 4, Oklahoma plays at BYU on Nov. 18. The Big 12 teams the Sooners don't play are Baylor, Houston, Kansas State, and Texas Tech.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796579,Vermont lawmakers mull bills to protect abortion providers,"Vermont lawmakers are taking testimony on a pair of bills that aim to protect health care workers who provide abortions and gender-affirming health care in Vermont from legal and disciplinary action from states that limit or ban those practices.

            The bills were introduced seven months after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and as states have restricted or taken steps to protect access to such care. 

            In Vermont, the two bills would define reproductive and gender-affirming health care as legally protected health care activities. Seven states have enacted similar so-called abortion shield laws, with three of them covering gender affirming care, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. 











            “Across the country, we’ve seen a dramatic rise in the threats and violent acts against health care providers and clinics, particularly those that provide reproductive health care including abortion and gender affirming care,” Dr. Lauren MacAfee, an obstetrician, gynecologist and family planning specialist in Burlington, told the the Vermont House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. 

            She supports the proposed House bill that would, among other things, protect such health care providers from civil arrest and make it a misdemeanor crime to use or threaten to use force, or to use physical obstruction to interfere with someone receiving or providing such health care. The bill would also ban a public agency from cooperating in an interstate investigation that seeks to impose civil or criminal liability upon a person for obtaining such care or an entity for providing it.

            Vermont has formally changed the state's constitution to include the Reproductive Liberty Amendment to protect reproductive rights including abortion. Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed the constitutional amendment in December. The Legislature also passed a law in 2019 guaranteeing abortion rights.

            The other bill currently in committee in the Vermont Senate would protect health care providers from professional disciplinary action and changes to its insurance premium charges related to such care. 

            MacAfee said it's critical to do everything possible to protect and support health care providers who are not only burning out, fatiguing and leaving medicine for other professions, but are also ""burdened with the additional concerns of their safety and ability to provide care for the increasing number of patients traveling from out of state for safe, legal health care,” she said.

            Last fall, Planned Parenthood of New England started tracking the amount of out-of-state patients seeking care in Vermont, said Lucy Leriche, the organization's vice president of public policy. While she said she hasn't seen the recent data, she told lawmakers there was about a 10% increase in out-of-state patients seeking abortion care in Vermont in the early fall.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796582,Minnesota football players' discrimination lawsuit dismissed,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by nine former University of Minnesota football players who were accused of sexual assault in 2016 in a case that roiled the school's football program. 

            
                The lawsuit against the school claimed that the players faced emotional distress and financial damage after being falsely accused of being sex offenders. The players, who were identified in the lawsuit as John Does, sought unspecified damages for willful and malicious discrimination.

            A woman alleged up to a dozen football players raped her or watched and cheered at an off-campus party in 2016. None of the players were ever charged. 











            The university found that 10 football players committed sexual misconduct. Five of them were expelled or suspended for violating student conduct codes, and the others were cleared on appeal.

            In their lawsuit, the players alleged that the woman initiated the sexual encounters with players and an underage recruit.

            U.S. District Court Judge Donovan Frank dismissed the lawsuit last week, saying the former players did not prove any of their claims, including allegations of bias by university investigators or pressure from Athletic Director Mark Coyle and former President Eric Kaler, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported. 

            David Madgett, an attorney for the players, said Tuesday that they are considering an appeal but have to determine if it makes sense financially and in terms of letting the former players get on with their lives. He said it was disappointing that the outcome was determined by the judge's version of events and not decided by a jury. 

            “It's disappointing to see disputes decided in this way,"" Madgett said. “That's the way things are decided more and more these days. … It's disappointing you don't get your day in court.”

            When the allegations became public in 2016, players threatened to boycott the team's trip to the Holiday Bowl. But after a graphic report of the investigation was released, the players agreed to play in the game.

            University of Minnesota spokesman Jake Ricker said the school appreciated the judge's decision affirming the actions taken in the case. He said the university would continue its work focusing on sexual misconduct awareness, prevention and response.

            Frank dismissed the lawsuit in 2019, but an appeals court reinstated part of it in 2021 and returned it to Frank. 

            The players, all of whom are Black, also initially claimed racial discrimination, but that claim was previously dismissed. 

            The only remaining claim alleged Title IX gender discrimination. The former players noted that they never faced criminal charges, but Frank’s ruling said that “is certainly not evidence of a judicial adjudication or that plaintiffs 'were proven innocent.‘”

            The men also claimed that an investigator for the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action used “manipulative tactics” with them in interviews and that their accuser helped draft the report. The players also alleged that “prior failed investigations motivated” the the school to punish them.

            Frank said all the claims were unsupported by the evidence and “no reasonable jury could find that the University disciplined plaintiffs on the basis of sex.”MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by nine former University of Minnesota football players who were accused of sexual assault in 2016 in a case that roiled the school's football program.The lawsuit against the school claimed that the players faced emotional distress and financial damage after being falsely accused of being sex offenders.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796596,Texans hire DeMeco Ryans as head coach,"HOUSTON (AP) — DeMeco Ryans has been hired as coach of the Houston Texans, giving him his first head coaching job and bringing him back to the place where he started his playing career.

            Ryans joins the Texans from the San Francisco 49ers, where he spent the past two seasons as their defensive coordinator. 

            He replaces Lovie Smith, who was fired after just one season where the team went 3-13-1. 











            Ryans issued a statement thanking the 49ers, coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch for his time in San Francisco before looking ahead to his future with the Texans.

            “Being the head coach of the Houston Texans is my dream job and my family is thrilled to be back in H-Town,” Ryans said. “I have been around the game of football my entire life and I’ve always had a natural ability to lead others. I know what it takes to win and be successful in this league as both a player and coach.” 

            “We’re going to build a program filled with players who have a special work ethic and relentless mindset,” he continued.

            ""I understand the responsibility I have to this organization and to the fans of Houston to build a winner and I can’t wait to get to work.”

            A fan favorite during his playing days in Houston, Ryans could help the team win back some fans that have become disenchanted with the direction of the Texans as they muddled through three straight dreadful seasons after winning the AFC South in 2018 and 2019. 

            Houston’s most famous former player, J.J. Watt, appears to support the move, with the recently retired defensive end tweeting a picture this week of himself with Ryans when the two played for the Texans. 

            Team owner Cal McNair vowed to be more involved in this hiring after the Texans fired their past two coaches after just one season. David Culley was fired after coaching the team in the 2021 season before Smith was hired. 

            “For so many reasons, DeMeco is everything we are looking for in a leader and coach for our organization,” McNair said. “He has a proven track record for developing high-quality players and constantly innovated his defensive scheme over the last six seasons in San Francisco.”

            Ryans is the third consecutive Black head coach the team his hired in as many years. The Texans faced criticism for firing two Black coaches after just one season with rosters devoid of any stars and lacking much talent. 

            Ryans led a 49ers defense that led the NFL this season by allowing just 300.6 yards a game. 

            San Francisco was particularly good against the run, ranking second in the league by holding teams to 77.7 yards. That’s a stark contrast to Houston’s run defense, which ranked last in the NFL by allowing 170.2 yards this season.

            Ryans helped the 49ers to a 13-4 regular-season record and the NFC West title this season. San Francisco reached the NFC championship game before falling to Philadelphia on Sunday.

            The Texans decided on Ryans after interviewing Denver defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Rams assistant head coach Thomas Brown, former Saints coach Sean Payton, Philadelphia defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, Philadelphia offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and Detroit offensive coordinator Ben Johnson. 

            The 38-year-old Ryans was a linebacker who was a second-round pick of the Texans in 2006. He led the NFL with 126 solo tackles that season to win AP Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. 

            He spent his first six NFL seasons with the Texans where he was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2007 and 2009. Ryans started all 16 games in five of his six seasons in Houston and piled up 636 tackles, including 43 for losses and 8½ sacks. 

            Ryans finished his playing career with the Eagles, where he spent the 2012-15 seasons. 

            Ryans has spent his entire coaching career with the 49ers. He was San Francisco’s inside linebackers coach from 2018-20 after spending the 2017 season as the defensive quality control coach. 

            “DeMeco is a proven coach with a track record of success who has an innate ability to lead people,” general manager Nick Caserio said. “He is progressive in his vision, a great communicator, a connector and somebody that values collaboration.” 

            “We are working to build a sustainable program that has long-term success and DeMeco is the coach we feel is the best fit to help us achieve our goals,” Caserio continued. ""We know how important it is to get results now and we have a lot of work to do, but I’m excited to partner with DeMeco to build our football team together.”

            Ryans joins a team that has plenty of holes to fill but has 11 picks in this year’s draft, including the No. 2 and 12th overall selections. 

            Houston is expected to address its glaring need at quarterback with its first pick and could add a piece to its defense with its other first-round pick that the team received from Cleveland as part of the Deshaun Watson trade. 

            Ryans becomes the sixth coach in franchise history and the first who played for the team.

            Defending champion Inter will face either Juventus or Lazio in a two-legged semifinal in April.

            Inter, which is second in the league, faces city rival AC Milan in Serie A on Sunday.











            The Nerazzurri had needed a late equaliser and extra time to see off second-division Parma in the last round but had the better of the play against Atalanta, which is fourth in Serie A.

            Matteo Darmian scored the only goal of the game in the 57th minute with a precise shot across into the bottom right corner.

            Hakan Çalhanoğlu also hit the post for Inter four minutes before the break. 

            Atalanta’s best chance came at the stroke of halftime but Duván Zapata headed over from a great position in front of goal.

https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4796598,Union beats Wolfsburg 2-1 to reach German Cup quarterfinals,"BERLIN (AP) — Kevin Behrens and Robin Knoche put Union Berlin into the quarterfinals of the German Cup with a 2-1 win over Wolfsburg on Tuesday – but the team celebrated another player who didn’t score.

            Jerome Roussillon failed to put away the game’s best chance with the final kick of the game. The former Wolfsburg defender, who joined Union in the winter transfer period, waited too long as he surveyed the empty net on a counterattack, allowed a defender to get back and block the shot.

            Roussillon slumped to the ground after his miss, but was soon swarmed by Union teammates who rushed to console him.











            Luca Waldschmidt gave the visitors an early lead but Knoche equalized in the 12th minute when he was left free at the back post to meet Josip Juranović’s corner. Juranović was making his first start for Union following his transfer from Celtic.

            Jordan Pefok struck the corner of the goalframe as Union came closest to taking the lead in the first half. The American forward made way for Behrens in the 63rd – when Tunisia midfielder Aïssa Laïdouni also came on for his Union debut.

            Behrens got the winner in the 79th when Rani Khedira crossed for Sheraldo Becker at the back post. Becker headed the ball back into the center for Behrens’ easy finish.

            It was Union’s fourth win from four games in 2023.

            Earlier, Serhou Guirassy scored in the fifth minute of injury time for Stuttgart to progress with a 2-1 win at Paderborn.

            In other third-round games on Wednesday, Bayern Munich visits Mainz and Leipzig hosts Hoffenheim.
